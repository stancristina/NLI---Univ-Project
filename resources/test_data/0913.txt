The draft resolution which we have approved contains provisions to this effect , and our Group has therefore given it its full backing .
Where there used to be a discrepancy between the haves and the have-nots , there are now those who can keep up as opposed to those who cannot or those who drop out of society .
It is therefore understandable that long-term , high unemployment within the European Union is high on the agenda of the European Summit in Lisbon .
But it is questionable whether it is justified to elevate employment policy to European policy in this way .
No one is expecting labour-intensive industries to flourish within an overstrained labour market .
I can imagine that Great Britain , Sweden and Denmark will think twice before embarking on the euro adventure .
I think that it is easy to identify the lessons which can be drawn from the Luxembourg process and to declare them applicable to social protection .
But on the other hand , the sound rule of macro-economics should not be misused by pinning it down too much .
It is then far more sensible to find out why some countries or regions are doing so very badly , rather than saying that we are underperforming compared to the United States .
But I would like to add that , if Lisbon wants to become a real social summit , we must also be able to spell out our plans to modernise and reinforce social security .
The first point concerns corporate governance .
Another point which I would like to touch upon briefly is tax coordination , as I do not think I have sufficient time for three points .
Normal shipping operations account for double this amount .
I believe there were eighteen in total , a large proportion of which have been adopted , with a number of less important ones having been rejected .
In the southern Member States , to all intents and purposes , a direct costing principle applies , which means that the polluters who deliver their waste to port do pay whereas the polluters who do not deliver their waste to port , still pollute but do not pay .
It could also be 75 % , but there should at least be a minimum level , which should be quite inflexible .
Investments are already being made , in anticipation of the directive .
The opinions are divided .
I hope that we will not jeopardise the entire directive on account of a too principled stance on one point .
Historic museum ships and ships which , proportionately , call at many ports over a short distance have to pay more often as a result .
The first chapter of the work programme is entitled : " Europe , its neighbours and the world " and rightly so .
To this end , we need swifter coordination within the European Union .
It is extremely depressing to note that freedom of press is still not guaranteed in Russia .
Upon serious analysis of the common position , it has to be said that democracy works .
Well now , the Commission will need to do so and we can then amend it again if necessary .
We did not want comitology for essential amendments .
I would like to finish off with the following thought .
This agony will come to an end today .
There are , of course , other interests which need to be taken into consideration .
Most members of the Liberal Group can tolerate this precarious balance .
The margin of error is 2 % .
Is it really asking too much to want to check what the effects of this directive will be on , for example , export and the sustainable development of cocoa-producing countries ?
Rules are also important to protect consumers against genetic modification and against the addition of unexpected substances .
Mr President , I am Belgian and I am not opposed to the common position .
So let us now deal with this matter once and for all and ensure that everyone can eat the chocolate they fancy and that a real internal market can be established for chocolate .
These are , however , no less essential to the charter as basic elements .
Accordingly , fundamental rights which cannot be guaranteed at EU level but can be violated by the Union , belong in the charter .
Firstly , what benefit do women in Europe , in particular , stand to gain from this charter and secondly , how does gender mainstreaming , referred to in Article 3 , paragraph 2 , of the EC Treaty , fit in with this charter ?
An explicit recognition in the forthcoming European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights of a wholesale ban on gender-based discrimination and with it , inclusion in the treaties themselves , would then also create the necessary scope for a new EU policy to promote the position of women in all relevant social fields .
What does exist is mainstreaming a gender perspective in the discussion of fundamental rights .
The ECHR should apply as a minimum standard with specific European Union rights added to it .
We do not share the presumption that a comprehensive charter can be drafted which comprises all current fundamental rights .
Vague instruction standards or rights in policy areas , where the Union has no authority , must be omitted .
Later on , at the Cologne Summit , Parliament ' s wider request was also honoured .
New threats , in particular , will need to be anticipated , such as in the field of information and biotechnology , and in the protection of the environment , of which man forms part .
