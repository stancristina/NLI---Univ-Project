However , as you are aware , the work does not end with the adoption of this directive .
It also increases confidence in democratic institutions and shows that the Members of this House want to move forward and make progress at the same pace as science and with the same level of willingness and strength of solidarity as European society .
That was our task and that is what we have done .
They can do so if they submit to the principles of the European Convention and to a court that is external to the Union and to the Member States and guarantees the fulfilment of those principles at all times and in all places .
What I do want to do is point out that here and now , a process is beginning , since , along with this report that has been drafted jointly with the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs , the Commission now has a position , a negotiating framework that will enable it to come back to Parliament to adopt this agreement and will enable the Member States to ratify accession to the European Convention .
I would like to reiterate many of the things that Mr Jáuregui said , and point out that signing the convention constitutes an element of European integration , which therefore strengthens the European Union .
This is therefore an extremely significant event , which today is being examined in the Political and Security Committee and tomorrow is going to be discussed in the Permanent Representatives Committee ( Coreper ) .
This is also why this review conference is very important .
This means that it is not enough for the Member States to have signed the convention .
As Mr Méndez de Vigo said , the Commission has acted quickly and the Council needs to do the same .
I therefore believe that this is a very important conference , with great political , symbolic and legal significance ; decisions will be taken that affect legal texts .
Let us suppose that a competition for European Union staff discriminates against Hungarian lawyers , for example , for some technical reason or any reason at all .
Members have expressed their desire for the negotiations not to be limited to accession to the European Convention on Human Rights , but for the protocols that the convention has been building up over the years to be incorporated , especially those that refer to the rights acknowledged by the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as that will provide equivalence between the two documents .
For example , the Council decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 established the capacity for the Member States to cooperate at national , intergovernmental level to prosecute these crimes , which fortunately - and we all remember the case of General Pinochet - are even part of the legislation in some Member States .
The programme establishes - and if you will allow me I will refer once again to the previous debate - the obligation for the Member States to cooperate with the International Criminal Court in the prosecution of crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity , so that they do not go unpunished .
The Council acknowledges the importance that Parliament has as the colegislator , as an institutional partner , in relation to the majority of the measures that we are going to adopt in the next five years .
I refer to the extensive debate that we had earlier .
With regard to the directive to combat sexual abuse , we are working on reaching a common position in June .
With regard to civil cooperation , we hope to agree the Rome III Regulation , a law that applies to marriages .
It would be very interesting , not only , as the Treaty of Lisbon says , to protect the economic interests of the Union , which is , of course , a very topical subject .
This has been the case for a few months , and the origin does not go back a few months , but a few years , when the subprime crisis occurred in the United States .
This is what has been coming to the surface in recent months , encouraged by the actions of very volatile markets which , at times , have even been clearly speculative .
As we have already said , the short-term measures involve an injection of public money and coordination by the European Union : what is known as the European Economic Recovery Plan , backed by the Commission ; a plan that coordinates this immediate action , this shock treatment that the Member States are adopting in order to limit the damage done by this huge crisis , but not make it disappear .
It needs to be a measured , controlled strategy and , of course , it needs to be aimed at avoiding the very serious difficulties in public accounts , but it also needs to maintain the objective of growth .
As part of this package , or in relation to it , the Economic and Financial Affairs ( Ecofin ) Council adopted a measure yesterday : the regulation of hedge funds , alternative funds or high-risk funds .
The Europe 2020 strategy is therefore a way of responding to the underlying problem in the productive economic system , preventing these fundamental weaknesses in the system in the future and making the Union 's economic system competitive and productive .
This is something that Mrs Harms and Mr Cohn-Bendit emphasise in their question .
In short , Mr President , the steps are being taken and the conditions are in place to move towards what has been described as economic governance of the Union .
I hope that the European Council in June will consolidate this move towards European economic
