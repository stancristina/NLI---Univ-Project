a tiny speculative minority of vested interests .
Up to this point I am for .
Does the 30 year blockade of Cuba and do the deaths of thousands of children constitute a war crime , a crime against humanity ?
In many countries , side by side with the flourishing market in child labour , there operates an equally flourishing trade in children 's bodies .
To address this situation the law of silence must be broken , but , most of all , there must be strict provisions for the criminal prosecution of travel agencies , of airline companies , of sex traders as well as of the users of such services .
Madam President , a few brief comments on this very important report : Firstly , what is being asked of the European social fund is the correct use of the money that is made available within its action framework , and I personally am not at all sure about that , and I do not think that that has always been the case .
Secondly , there must be horizontal action of the European social fund , but , at the same time , it must be present in the peripheral regions , so that its presence can be seen by the citizens in those regions .
I have some objections , in addition to those expressed by Mr Schiedermeier , with which I agree , and these objections are : Firstly , to what Mrs JÃ¶ns said , that is , for there to be allocations to the Funds and after that allocations to the Member States .
We have the Commission proposal on Agenda 200 which says that we should retain 10 % of funds to reward the best .
Nor must we forget that often there are objective reasons why the funds have not been absorbed , which we must not ignore .
This is a great political choice for the European Union concerning its evolution , a choice which I want to believe constitutes a decision that has already been taken at all levels of the European Union .
I am delighted to see that the European Parliament as a whole is coming to the view that the process of accession negotiations must begin simultaneously and from the same starting point for all applicant countries in eastern , central , northern and south-east Europe .
The ten applicant countries have thrown themselves with determination into the long and difficult fight for rapprochement .
I remind you and refer to the positive decision taken by the European Union in 1995 on the accession of Cyprus .
I totally agree with Commissioner van den Broek on the following : there must be no sidelining or overshadowing of the important issue of enlargement by the matter of TurkeyEuropean Union relations .
But we , the European Parliament , must maintain firm principles .
What would be of great significance is the message that must be given to all who are in need of it following the 1989 earthquake which demolished integration on our continent .
The shortfall is huge .
It would be a tragic mistake for the European Union to appear unreliable concerning the accession of Cyprus , to which it has committed itself , by laying aside this issue out of friendship towards a country which , moreover , recently declared that it was not interested , that it indeed disregarded the Conference for which its friends are going to so much trouble , and for Cyprus , to which the European Union has an obligation , to remain at the mercy of Turkey , as Commissioner van den Broek has quite rightly pointed out .
In 1995 our Kurdish colleague in the Turkish parliament , Leyla Zana , was honoured with the Sakharov prize for her unrelenting struggles , on account of which she was mercilessly persecuted and incarcerated by the Turkish government .
Unfortunately the report of Mr Andersson , apart from certain important ideas contained in it , is tending in the same general direction .
Only if the organization of labour moves in such a direction , will it be in tune with workers ' demands and aspirations .
The five hundred thousand women trafficked in the European Union and the millions in Asia bear tragic witness to the fact that the pursuit of easy gains has been tolerated as of the highest merit , while the ideology of the market place and the law of supply and demand have transformed human beings into merchandise .
We need to take direct , proactive , deterrent and suppressive action .
We need political will and the economic aid provided by the funds that have already been made available for the financing of actions aimed at international cooperation , at supporting the services of Europol .
We still need to remind Member States to implement the joint action which was approved on 24 February 1997 and to carry out the commitments that they made at the Hague Conference on 24 April 1997 , with specific actions to involve both the competent authorities and women 's organizations in effectively tackling the phenomenon .
However , there is another aspect , Mr President , which is somewhat strange and I will explain why : it is embodied in a logic according to which it calls for the support of efforts of the Member States to achieve certain objectives not by means of an increase but by means of a reduction in expenditure or , to be more exact , by means of a reduction in the contributions made by the Member States to the budget .
It is my impression , Mr President , that we are in for some surprises , since I fear that , if we carry on with this policy over a long period , enlargement will take place much later than is politically desirable , and we , as the European Parliament , must bear this in mind
