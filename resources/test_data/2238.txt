Court of Human Rights " .
These positions are irritating and most provocative when compared with the rudimentary demand for protection for privacy and for trade union and political activity .
I voted against the motion on Echelon because , in my view : First , it plays down the importance and the role of a global monitoring system which is directed by the USA and to which a Member State belongs ( United Kingdom ) .
Fifthly , instead of calling for support for transparency and democratic scrutiny of secret service activities , it flirts with the idea of setting up a "proper " European Echelon system .
And at the same time , unbridled police violence is being used , such as that seen in Gothenburg and , even more so , in Genoa .
Mr President , may I say that both the committee and the rapporteur have taken a very balanced and level-headed approach to this issue .
This is something which we should never forget and which needs to be kept in a state of equilibrium .
We cannot talk in general terms and what appear to be the most important issues today , i .e . pornography , hackers and racism , will not necessarily be the most important issues tomorrow .
My question , which I would like the President-in-Office to answer , is this : were the plans to set up teams of policemen or intelligence service officers to operate as links between the Fifteen and were the plans to exchange information in files on people classified as troublemakers implemented before Genoa or not ?
Does that mean she will be giving me a written reply once she has this information ?
The statement made by the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the European Parliament Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs gives us cause for concern , Madam President-in-Office .
The attack on the offices in Liège , which you already know about , gives us cause for concern and we fear that the reaction in Laeken will be even more savage .
We will be going to Laeken en masse to protest against the European Union ' s policy .
I wanted to say that the statistics in my question were compiled a long time before her answer and that things are changing for the better .
The UN Commission on Human Rights recently took an initiative to encourage people to file charges if they are tortured or their human rights are violated because of their sexual identity .
You have written off all our supplementary questions as statements and you have not allowed the President-in-Office to reply .
It is the first time I have seen the President intervene as you did earlier and comment on our questions and positions as you have done .
I admire and respect you , especially when you are in the chair .
I should like you to clarify this point given that you are far more experienced in procedural matters than I.
I should like to highlight two points where I have tried to improve the Commission text - and hence safety - for both the donors and the recipients of blood or blood components .
The aim of Amendment No 75 is to ensure that the ban on blood donation incentives is not an absolute ban because it is wrong , for medical and scientific reasons , to be dogmatic on such an important health issue .
Luckily , these duties are being carried out by the experienced Mr Söderman , with his usual degree of enthusiasm for the job .
I drafted the report on the application of Community law and saw the huge problems caused by the poor application of Community law at first hand .
I need only remind you that most infringements of Community law are only discovered as the result of the complaints system .
European citizens generally take recourse to the Committee on Petitions precisely in order to complain about infringements or omissions by ministers and their services , when they are wronged or when their protest or complaint is ignored .
As a result , cases drag on interminably , to the disappointment of the European citizens seeking our support .
A proposal which , if adopted , would I think be hugely important : we need , subject to certain requirements , to introduce an injunctions procedure so that an immediate stop can be put to any incipient infringements of Community law which threaten to wreak irreparable damage on the natural environment or our cultural heritage .
And there is still serious public concern as the result of criminal irresponsibility on the part of the relevant authorities in various countries of the European Union .
This shift will have a massively adverse impact on countries such as Greece , which have a high proportion of mountain regions and a small budget , with the result that it will be impossible to support these regions from national funds .
It is for these reasons that we shall be voting against the report , because we believe that the specific measures proposed , operating within the more general framework of Agenda 2000 and the so-called competitiveness argument will not only reverse , they will speed up the economic stagnation and desertification of mountain regions , with huge economic , social and environmental consequences .
The second point I wish to make is that perhaps it would be a good idea at some point - and this is certainly the intention of the Committee on Regional Policy - to discuss the state of progress of projects and programmes under the Community Support Framework in individual countries , because I personally am not at all convinced that everything is going swimmingly in every country , not through any fault of the Commission 's , but through the fault of certain Member States .
