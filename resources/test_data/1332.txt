labour market as a result of cultural and linguistic barriers , the lack of recognition of their professional qualifications , stereotypes and prejudice , racism and the disregard for their rights keep female immigrants confined to the lower ranks of the labour market or to the black economy , or dependent on men for their survival .
As far as Roma women are concerned , there are approximately 8 to 10 million Roma in Europe , although the still traditionally nomadic nature of this people means current figures are unreliable .
The women usually marry very young and bear their first child earlier than in other ethnic groups .
Madam President , this is a report which constitutes the final stage in an important procedure , a procedure which started with the report by my dear honourable friend Jo Leinen , a procedure which culminated during the Greek Presidency , when the Presidency and the Council , following an exchange of views with Parliament , finally adopted Regulation No 2003/2004 , which substantially improves the statute and foundation of European political parties in the world of Europe .
That is because , over and above all , this system directly links European political parties with the European Parliament , which is generally admitted to be the most political institution of the European Union .
One body is the Conference of Presidents of the political groups , which is the most political body within the European Parliament , and the other is the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , in other words the European parliamentary committee which is responsible for all matters to do with regulatory , constitutional and legal issues .
Of course , there are certain honourable Members present now in this House who disagree .
Thanking , therefore , everyone and you , Madam President , I call on the House to approve this report .     Mr President , we know that our honourable friend , Mr Medina Ortega , has tremendous experience in this matter and , with his proposals to date , has helped a great deal with the job of simplifying and modernising the legislative work of the Community .
With reference to the question , I ask you : are we in fact satisfied with the improvement so far in the quality of the regulatory environment ?
On these two issues , unfortunately , the Commission has not so far taken a clear stand .
We therefore also have an endogenous problem which we need to address , and here I am of the opinion that , to date , we have been lacking clear-cut services to take care of the technical aspects of legislation and help developments .
We voted against the Dimitrakopoulos report because it completes the procedures for the promotion of the central idea of the Rules of Procedure for the European parties and their financing , in other words the creation of agencies and mechanisms which will ‘create a European conscience ’ and cultivate the perception of the one-way , capitalist , anti-grass roots policy .
On the basis of Community orders and the choices of big business , the European Parliament is being turned into the judge of the ‘political correctness ’ of these parties .
We shall vote against this report because it turns the European Parliament from a forum for the juxtaposition of ideas into the judge of the right of ideas to exist .     Mr President , the 1998 review created serious problems in both Spain and Greece , especially with the 419 000 tonne quota , when it was a known fact , on the basis of the data from the directorates of agriculture , that production in Greece totalled 600 000 tonnes and more .
That is why , Commissioner , these quotas need to be changed .     Mr President , the order being given by the European Commission with the proposal for a regulation on Mediterranean products , despite efforts to embellish and enhance the situation , is categorical and depressing : the disappearance of tobacco crops , a reduction in cotton crops and the abolition of olive crops .
It is crystal clear that small - and medium-sized farmers will receive far less money in compensation for the abolition of basic crops such as tobacco , cotton and oil .
For us , these proposals do not admit of any amendment or embellishment .
The proposals in the Lavarra report make no reference whatsoever to the negative changes being promoted with the mid-term review or to olive oil because , as it says , it considers it a , in which case all that remains is to regulate certain aspects of the olive oil market .
We voted against the report , despite its individual positive points , because it accepts the mid-term review for olive oil as a foregoing conclusion .
The proposals to promote women as Commissioners , to create a special portfolio for women’s rights in the Commission , to give women equal representation on European Parliament ballot forms , to set up a European institute for gender issues etc . illustrate how far the temporary residents of Brussels are from the real problems and concerns of working class women .
How can a partially employed , partially paid , partially retired woman , which is the model being promoted or at least accepted by those who inspire such texts , become fully involved in social and political life ?
So much for the civilisation of those who present themselves as the champions of civilisation and want to give the rest of the world lessons in democracy .
When we arrived in the summer of 1999 at the start of our term of office , we arrived together with the Helsinki decision marking the unification of the procedure for integrating the new countries , the single wave
