in the telecommunications sector , when the telecom markets were to be opened up .
One condition of a common energy policy is to have shared objectives , which our leaders commit to and which they do not simply take advantage of , as is now the case .
By doing this we can steer a path away from a situation in which we are continually crisis-prone .
The Russian energy dialogue , which has made rather poor progress and is fairly secret because the Council hardly ever participates in it , could be linked to the summit at the same time .
That way we could kill two birds with one stone and increase solidarity .     Mr President , I would like to address two issues very briefly .
Tunne Kelam has already raised the matter of the human rights situation in Russia and , in particular , the treatment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky .
Another matter relating to democracy is the notion that we in the European Union should know exactly what the European taxpayers ’ euros are being spent on .
This approach strengthens the report before us and supports its objectives to make Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) a workable means of implementing the EU’s targets for development cooperation .
Since the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP ) regions include countries from both groups , the original preferences granted to the ACP countries are incompatible with current WTO rules , and our transition period giving entitlement to waivers expires in 2008 .
In order to make the EU-ACP trade relationship WTO-compliant in the long term , a solution has been sought in the EPAs .
Under Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT) , countries at different levels of development can enter into a reciprocal free trade agreement provided that the liberalisation of essentially all trade occurs within a reasonable length of time .
Reciprocity represents a major shift in the EU’s approach to development and trade policies with ACP partners .
Sometimes bold steps have to be taken , which means we must at the same time make sure that the eventual outcome of negotiations on agreements leaves sufficient time for ACP domestic and regional markets to adapt .
The opening up of markets in some cases has also led to the spread of poverty in developing countries , and for that reason the progress of talks should be monitored carefully .
The negotiations must be impartial , and no pressure should be put on any party while they are taking place .     Mr President , I hope that Economic Partnership Agreements will be a workable means of eliminating poverty , and that they will allow us to go from making declarations to something concrete .
In terms of quality , I cannot add anything , but nevertheless I would like to say a few words about Luisa Morgantini’s report .
In a way , this is a measure of how civilised we are .
It is also to be hoped that the other European countries , Finland included , will make progress in this matter .
Economic , social and environmental factors must always be taken into account in EU development cooperation .
It is not merely money that is important , but , above all , partnership , aiding development and helping countries to get off to a good start .
It is important to take these into account in development cooperation .     .
It is important that we in the European Parliament support countries where European values , such as democracy , human rights and the principles of the rule of law are in effect .
Before we can even talk about negotiations , Hamas must unambiguously 1 ) acknowledge Israel’s right to be a Jewish state , 2 ) cease all acts of terror , 3 ) give up its weapons , 4 ) refuse to support other violent groups , and 5 ) respect existing international agreements between Israel and the PA ( Oslo Accords , the Roadmap , etc. ) .
If emissions in the EU are cut by approximately 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the first phase of emissions trading , the market price in terms of emissions permits will be 2.5 billion a year at current prices .
A cautious estimate is that the price of electricity in the European wholesale electricity market could rise on average by EUR 10 per megawatt-hour as a result of emissions trading .
One option which goes against the principle of the market would be to tax electricity .
Nuclear power is an example of a form of emission-free energy which the electricity market does not support , and which in fact is not really needed either , unlike many other forms of energy .
I think it is important to call things by their right name in order to prevent a situation where , unnoticed by us , the Directorate-General for Agriculture starts managing EU energy policy .
Consequently , an increase in the use of biofuels would raise both EU energy costs and the price of food .
That would inevitably impact on the EU’s competitiveness .
Mr President , Commissioner , the objective regarding trans-European energy networks is a good and necessary one .
If the price of electricity in some other country falls , consumers in my country will pay for it .
We have recent experience of the Nordic single electricity market concerning how producers speculate on the price of electricity so that they do not utilise all their production capacity .
TEN-Energy Networks have an important role to play in the Union’s internal energy market and security of supply , and it is security of supply that is the biggest problem we face .
The new Member States of the Union must be involved in this as soon as possible
