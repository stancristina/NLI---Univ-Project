of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , ratified the aggressive policy of the ΕU , to the detriment of the peoples .
The WTO is an imperialist international body which serves to ensure that the dominion of big business and its profitability are perpetuated .
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion for a resolution on the WTO , thereby contributing to the development of the fight of the workers and strengthening the anti-imperialist and anti-monopoly fight for the peoples themselves to decide on their own future by drawing up agreements on the basis of mutual benefit .     . – The joint motion for a resolution endeavours , in an insulting and unacceptable manner , to slander the Socialist Republic of Vietnam , by accusing it of human rights violations .
It is brazen-faced impudence to cite the 30th anniversary of the tremendous victory of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism and to accuse the government of a lack of democracy .
The European and American imperialists will never forgive the country that managed to crush three major imperialist powers , the USA , Great Britain and France .
He ran off the aeroplane and was followed by a policeman , who shouted at him to stop .
We therefore need to ask ourselves if this is the society that we wish to create , where the authorities shoot first and ask questions later .
It is , at the same time , ironic that these discoveries coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
The European Parliament , the institution that represents European citizens , has at the very least an obligation to raise itself up to its full height and safeguard the feeling of freedom and security of the citizens of Europe .     . – Mr President , as a member of the second European Parliament delegation which visited the Spanish authorities in Madrid and the regional and local authorities in the autonomous region of Valencia in June 2005 and met with groups of petitioners , I am obliged to state publicly that all the key players demonstrated an excellent willingness to cooperate with the MEPs and confirmed their understanding and concern for the legitimate , but not for the illegal claims of the citizens .
These amendments restore the dignity of the non-legislative text which , of course , has no repercussions .
As to whether the honourable Members will vote in favour of the report , that is up to them .     – Mr President , I am delighted , first of all because from now on the Council will negotiate CFSP issues with us at ambassador level , thereby upgrading Parliament 's role in the shaping of the CFSP.
We have a slight improvement compared with this year , we achieved more than the British Presidency is discounting for the next seven years , but we have no reason to celebrate .
To divide the Member States into net contributors and net recipients of appropriations , when we are not going to spend more than 1 % on Europe , when we are not focusing our overall synergies from common European action , does not do us credit and certainly does not testify to our regard for European ideals .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is a difference between you and the honourable gentlemen sitting on the front benches : they are selected by their governments to serve authority .
That is what they are asking of us .
Just imagine if the Stalinist regime had had it in their hands .
They tell us , 'for the sake of combating terrorism ' .
In other words , Bin Laden and his ilk will use public telephones , they will buy prepaid cards and , if they want to use the Internet , they will go to an Internet café to do so .
Will you hand the peoples of Europe over to the CIA ?
It leaves the Member States a great deal of room for manoeuvre , firstly to define periods of data retention of between 6 and 24 months ; secondly , to define the offences for which they will use this information and , thirdly , for the law enforcement authorities to have access to this information , for which prior permission must be obtained from the courts .
In addition , we need uniform and unanimous action by the global community , better coordination of measures , proper evaluation of data and , more importantly , improved cooperation between the national law enforcement authorities .
It is safeguarding and introducing legislation imposing across-the-board monitoring .
We reject the draft directive , which will not brook improvement .     – Madam President , today 's compromise abolishes all the protections imposed by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and is a monument to non-harmonisation .
As a result , the Council is giving the Member States the go-ahead to retain any information they want , for any purpose they choose and for any period of time they consider expedient , without the slightest material European presence , restriction or control .
What we have in the end is a proposal with a roar for police access and with a whimper for the protection of fundamental rights .
Thirdly , it needs to help to shape an open and democratic global system of governance of the information society and to combat the digital divide which is creating new relations of dependence and hegemony between the developed and developing countries .
The review of the directive and the enlargement of its scope to non-linear media must not result in the watering down of its regulatory arrangements
