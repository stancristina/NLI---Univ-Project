.
We cannot see an enforced balance of power and peace agreement achieving this .
I would be glad to hear the Commissioner 's views on this .
Everyone understands that structurally important problems remain given the lack of a true desire for peace on the part of all the parties concerned .
In concrete terms that means that the European Parliament wishes to be and to remain fully involved in the specific reconstruction effort .
Mr President , at the beginning of this debate we heard once again about the ineptitude and failure of the outside world and the European Union to deal with the problems of former Yugoslavia .
We cannot plonk London bobbies down in Banja Luka and environs , or in Sarajevo and environs .
Mr President , I particularly welcome the acceptance today in another report of the need for an international public inquiry into the political events surrounding the fall of Srebrenica .
Is there anything for people to vote on ?
In this context I would also emphasize the need for better coordination between the international organizations on the ground .
When I was there recently I had the impression that the aid providers are sometimes tripping over each other ; the whole of Sarajevo is full of well equipped Land Rovers - and that many of these organizations are often working alongside each other rather than with each other .
Before I start I should like to ask the Council to reply to the questions and remarks arising from the debate .
When it comes to the crunch , to continuing TACIS projects , for example , the Council backs out .
Was it worth seeking agreement between the Council and the EP ?
This is the main bone of contention between Council and Parliament .
In a way , Madam President , the blackmail perpetrated by the United Kingdom is a blessing in disguise .
Even before this took place it was rumoured that the Council would in any case not accept or even discuss a single one of the amendments approved by Parliament or any of those approved by the Commission .
In those circumstances , Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , the conciliation procedure is pointless !
And my Group is very much opposed to the linking of internal security and the movement of individuals .
But Schengen is clearly proving successful , perhaps more so than we would like .
Because that is what we all want .
In the Internal Affairs Committee it seemed as if we were holding a German domestic political debate and I have to say in all honesty that I do not care over much for the high tone taken by our honourable friends , the German Members .
As a result the Committee on Civil Liberties approved the report by only the slightest of margins , which ought not in principle to be the case in matters dealing with this issue .
We must do everything we can to steer Albania as quickly as possible back on to the road to full democracy .
Madam President , in response to what other speakers before me have said .
For the Albanians ' understanding of democracy it is better , if errors are discovered , that the elections should be held all over again .
Bosnia needs a stable and legitimate government , based on democratic elections .
We have a few other amendments which I think they will be happy with .
Mrs Abiola was merely defending the cause of her husband who was arrested because he was victorious in the 1993 presidential elections and the military junta was not prepared to acknowledge his victory .
I would urge the Commissioner to take a firm stand , along the lines set out by Mr Mandela , for example , and that means that really there is no option but to go for a diplomatic boycott , an oil embargo or an arms embargo .
I think the Nigerian authorities will only respond to tough measures after everything they have done .
We are thus very concerned at present for the hunger strikers , amongst them Leyla Zana , the winner of Parliament 's Sakharov prize .
The scandalous treatment of Mr Wei Jingsheng and the hundreds of thousands of citizens held in labour camps are just two of them .
Mr President , I should like to go back to another of the world 's benighted countries , Nigeria .
But it seemed a good time to make this point .
Their aim is to supply medicines to the children in Belarus affected by radiation , and these NGOs are simply not allowed by the Minsk authorities to supply them direct .
Compromises on verification mechanisms and the conditions for the Treaty 's entry into force are currently being worked out .
Secondly , it must be pointed out that all the international organizations are currently in the process of pulling out , including the representatives of the European Commission .
It does not seem as if an international military force for Burundi is going to get off the ground .
And the civil war is increasingly becoming regional in character .
International intervention in Burundi is thus a matter of urgency .
Unfortunately the chairman of the Committee on Petitions is not able to read the Dutch text , but it is perfectly clear .
In this respect the programme is a step in the right direction .
I would be glad of an answer from the Commission , preferably a straight yes or no , to each of the following two questions .
Three weeks ago I had occasion to ask a question of Commissioner Cresson who had given instructions in a letter to her DGs that all correspondence with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should be written in French , even replies to letters in English or German .
