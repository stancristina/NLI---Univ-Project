The tourist industry , which mainly attracts women and young people , substantially strengthens the employment sector and is in keeping with the philosophy behind the Lisbon Strategy .
The basic precondition when designing any tourism policy is an in-depth knowledge of peculiarities and problems at local level .
In order to achieve this , we need to use scientific tools and methods , invest in research and development and create a European network of regional tourism monitoring centres to coordinate and transfer technical know-how .
It is being held towards the end of the summer tourist season , of which we all have our personal experiences , and it is being held for the first time after the recent accession of ten new Member States to the European Union , which they enhance with their exceptional tourist destinations .
I should therefore like to emphasise in particular the added value which the European Union can bring to the policies of the Member States .
I ask you please for a clear answer at long last .     .
We know society 's problems as far as young girls ' weight is concerned and this is now being exploited in order to promote smoking .
Then there is , of course , the question of alcohol , consumption of which is indeed rising at the moment thanks to alcopops , which target and are mainly consumed by women , with the social problems that this can cause .
I also wish to refer briefly to two or three matters : in both the 2006 programme and the new health programme we shall take account and promote the gender dimension , exactly as the report proposes ; on the question of smoking for 2006 , we shall focus our attention on young women .
We shall soon be announcing the new guidelines for breast cancer screening and we have already extended work on cervical cancer also .
For example , in 2006 we shall define indicators for gynaecological health and the menopause , such as an endometriosis indicator which is , of course , extremely important .
Indeed , a prosperous society with standards and cohesion is based above all on the physical and mental health of its members .
The rapporteur also gives us information about the lack of information and proper approach to these situations by society and by scientific and nursing staff .
I should also like the Commissioner , as the question of paragraph 21 was raised , to explain to us what the Commission means by its strategy on sexual and reproductive health .     – Mr President , the word 'health ' is feminine in most languages and the pagan Europeans of ancient times envisaged health as a beautiful woman , statues of whom we admire to this day .
Initiatives also on the health of girls and young women in the European Union , because its continuing life and prosperity depend on them .
I have also followed closely the proposals and views expressed .
Of course , I cannot comment on all of them in such a short time , but I have taken note of them and I shall of course take very serious account of them .
Of course , I shall not refer to all the specific illnesses mentioned .
It is indeed everything we could wish for but , without the necessary financial resources , it cannot be achieved .
I should also like to say that we need to understand that many issues fall within the competence of the Member States : the provision of medical services , the health systems , all this is the responsibility of the Member States .
To close , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament once again on this initiative .     – Mr President , Commissioner , first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Honeyball , on her excellent work .
European schools , therefore , are an institution which promote the ideas on which the European Union was built .
It is therefore important for more European schools to be founded , probably in the new Member States also ; this will bring us a step closer to European integration .
Nonetheless , an effective EU policy of tourism to other countries depends on an integrated policy for sustainable European tourism within the European Union .
With the European Constitution , tourism is reintegrated into the sectors of supporting , coordinating or complementary action by the Union .
Our debate today is particularly topical in the run-up to the major UN General Assembly debate on the millennium development goals .
This situation is an insult to mankind and imposes on the international community , on the UN and on the European Union , the need for global action which will go beyond bombastic pronouncements and will immediately create and implement an integrated strategy .
Despite the undertaking by G8 to write off the debts of the poorest developing countries , no progress has been made to date .
Finally , I should like to comment on a particularly important problem , the problem of the increase in mental and neurological illnesses in conflict and war zones .
We bear a huge responsibility .
A responsibility towards world peace , security and stability .
The leaders of the members of the UN due to meet in New York must realise at long last where their responsibilities lie and must move from pronouncements to specific actions .
A typical example is the continuing delay in actually writing off the debts of the poor countries .
From this point of view , although humanitarian aid needs to be increased , it cannot answer Africa 's serious problems .
Far-reaching changes and reforms in the state , society , the economy and agricultural production are needed .
