removed from the directive , so that it is left to judges to liberalise public services and make them subject to the market .
The European Court of Justice is directly invited to legislate by means of Amendment 5 , which confirms the Court’s principles of non-discrimination , necessity and proportionality .
The June Movement welcomes Polish plumbers and all other foreign workers , but they should be paid non-discriminatory wages , not dumping wages .
We wish to see free competition , but it must also be fair , and we therefore propose services regulated by the open coordination method so that our democracies are not turned into unlawful trade barriers by the judges in Luxembourg .     Mr President , the compromise that we have before us and on which we are to vote on Thursday is a services directive quite different from the Bolkestein Directive .
I can therefore say to Mr Bonde that the thousands of honourable trade unionists demonstrating outside Parliament today support the compromise arrived at in this Chamber .
I have to say , too , that I am in no doubt as to why they support it .
Agreements and labour legislation will be decided on by individual countries and individual trade union movements .
The public sector will be safeguarded , and we shall have avoided a split between the new and the old Member States .
I have said for a long time that the European Union must not develop into a form of competition between states .
We shall now obtain competition on fair and transparent conditions , and we shall obtain protection of those interests that serve the public and the individual citizen in the public sector as variously manifested in our societies .
In my capacity , too , as President of the Party of European Socialists , I can therefore recommend the compromise now before us .
It will definitely move us in the right direction .     Mr President , this is a fateful time for Europe .
On Thursday we have two choices .
The Commission , has , unfortunately , already made its choice , Mr McCreevy , and contributed unhelpfully to the compromise between the two big groups .
The big groups ’ compromise will under no circumstances bring the EU closer to its citizens , which is of course what we normally strive to do .
Anything else is marketing gone wrong .
Their action is scandalous .     – Mr President ; Mr President-in-Office of the Council ; Mr Barroso , President of the Commission ; Mr Schulz , our group chairman , has asked me to talk today on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , and that is something that I am pleased to do where this matter is concerned .
It has been doubly depressing , given that our countries ’ history has also been about tolerance of other peoples and about understanding and respect for them .
We have always fought for justice and for peoples ’ right to their own independent states characterised by peaceful co-existence , especially in Palestine .
It is absolutely crucial that the violence we see should not get completely out of hand .
That violence must stop now , and I should like , personally and on behalf of my country , to thank Mr Barroso for the clear signal he has sent out today in Parliament and for the solidarity he has shown with my country and with all those countries that have been attacked .
It is also important to emphasise , however , that the European Union stands for the opposite of xenophobia and intolerance .
The whole of our bloody history has taught us the wisdom of mutual understanding , dignity and co-existence .
No government or ordinary citizen can put a question mark over that freedom .
It must and will be exercised with responsibility .
This is also fundamental to the human rights on which Europe and the UN are based .
That is the way things have to be .
I should like to use my freedom of expression today to criticise and clearly repudiate the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad that appeared in a Danish newspaper a few months ago .
Publishing them was arrogant and disrespectful and reflected a total lack of knowledge of Islam .
We are well aware , both in Denmark and elsewhere in Europe , that the love of our own country , dignity and religion does not require us to criticise others or talk down to them when what is in question is something they regard as holy .
That is something that I too fail to understand .
Most important of all is the fact that the Danish Government subsequently used its freedom of expression clearly to express respect for other peoples and their religions , not least Islam .
We want to send a clear signal today : we are determined to ignore new provocations , which cannot be used by extremists in Europe and in the Muslim world to inflame violence and intolerance and create new myths about each other .
We say ‘no’ to those who claim it is ‘them against us’ .
Worst of all , they have inflamed hatred and fear and they have gained an audience for their views .
It is time for moderate and responsible voices to set a new agenda , as Mr Barroso said , a new agenda which clearly and unambiguously shows that there is another way .
We in Europe do not want to add fuel to the extremists ’ fire .
We know that we live in a globalised world .
In this globalised world it is not ‘them against us’ : we are one .
What we have witnessed are ignorant acts creating humiliation and insult .
However , trying to understand the broader reactions , those cartoons , together with manipulation from extremists , were the last straw .
