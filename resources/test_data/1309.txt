be clear about which conditions must be fulfilled if the agreements are to be beneficial , in environmental terms too .
In addition , it is important that the objectives and deadlines be carefully specified in connection with the agreements and that they also be sure to cover a representative sample of the relevant businesses and production in the area in question , so that one group of businesses is not given the opportunity to freewheel .
I think that complete openness in relation to the public , to this Parliament , to the environmental organisations and to civil society is also important .
There must be openness in connection with plans to enter into the environmental agreements , but also considerable scope for objecting to the use of environmental agreements in a specific area .
In my own country , Denmark , too , we have experimented with environmental agreements in some areas , for example the PVC area , in which there was not enough in terms of provisions governing monitoring and penalties .
It is therefore very important that these matters be clarified in connection with entering into environmental agreements .
Mr President , I too should like , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , to express our great disappointment at the search made of the human rights office and take strong exception to this event .
As the Commissioner mentioned , we are in fact seeing an express desire for reform in Turkey and a desire to comply with the political criteria , as required if the country is to embark upon negotiations concerning EU membership .
Further reforms are on the way , moreover .
What I witnessed was an objective and open debate , in which , for example , legal experts and representatives of the judiciary provided clear and incisive descriptions of the reforms that would guarantee the independence of the courts and the observance of fundamental human rights .
If the National Assembly follows the good advice and adopts reforms that guarantee the independence of a legal system that is also in accordance with human rights , Turkey will be another step on the way towards negotiating for accession to the EU , and - just as importantly - the Turkish population will be guaranteed the fundamental and democratic rights I believe they really desire .
The fact of the matter is , of course , that it is not enough to amend legislation if changes do not also take place in practice .
It is therefore very sad that we continue to receive reports of torture in Turkish prisons and of other infringements of human rights , including violations of freedom of expression .
This is unacceptable .
It is also a very dynamic country with major resources and a lot of talent , and continued cooperation between the EU and Turkey is in the interests of both Turkey and the EU.
We often hear Turkish politicians say that tougher demands are being made upon Turkey than upon other countries where accession to the EU is concerned .
The ten countries that are to accede in May 2004 have had to implement difficult reforms for which there was often little grass-roots support and which were also opposed internally .
Mr President , the lesson of the Iraq war is not that we should copy the United States and devise our own foreign policy , involving our own superstate army and military-industrial complex .
If we had had qualified majority voting on the Iraq issue , neither the British nor the French policy would have obtained majority support .
If the UN decides that a dictator is to be disarmed , it must also have the power to implement the decision .
The right of veto in the UN Security Council must be limited so that the UN can also take action , even if a small minority is opposed to its doing so .
War criminals should be tracked down and brought before the International Criminal Court .
The lesson is that we must uphold the international rule of law if we do not wish to end up as victims of the laws of the jungle and of the strongest and ourselves become targets for new generations of terrorists .
In this quite surrealistic debate , I should like , moreover , to draw attention to a most outstanding contribution by my fellow countryman and fellow MEP , Mr Andreasen from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , who is closely associated with the Danish Prime Minister .
Normally , he speaks in Danish , which is a good idea .
As a symbolic act , he gave his speech in English , however , and that of course brilliantly reflects his close relationship with the Danish Prime Minister , who belongs to the same political party as himself and is a close colleague of his .
I should like , moreover , to emphasise - for my fellow MEPs may well not be aware of this - that Mr Andreasen , who gave the Prime Minister his unconditional endorsement , is certainly no slouch when it comes to irony .
I would just draw attention to the fact that , under Articles 38 and 24 of the Treaty , Parliament has no right whatsoever to be heard .
In April of last year , the Council wrote to the British human rights organisation , State Watch , which had requested information about these agreements , and said that the negotiations that were under way had to be kept secret , since the Council 's interest in secrecy counted for more than its interest in democratic scrutiny
