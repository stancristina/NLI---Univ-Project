to distinguish clearly between the victims and the persecutors .
Although Cambodia ' s problems and its bloody history are still close to us in terms of time , the country has been able to build the foundations of democracy .
While we joyfully welcome the legislation on a trial , we must give our dedicated support to the positive developments that have started in the country .
I would like , on behalf of my group , to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda , for their reports on the railway package as well as the Conciliation Committee , for their excellent work , which can be considered to be a breakthrough in this important issue .
The development of rail transport will remain on the agenda in the future , as the Commission is promising a second railway package to include further liberalisation and the aspect of safety .
I consider the safety aspects of railways , as with other forms of transport , to be particularly important .
The development of rail transport is vital to solve the problems of traffic congestion .
As has been stated here , environmental considerations also powerfully advocate the development of the railways .
I disagree with Mrs Ahern , who seems to have left the Chamber already , that the report is not sufficiently political .
There are actually very political elements contained , for example , in the explanatory statement , which I , at least , enjoyed reading .
I warmly support the targeted programme of measures to make the general commercial policy of the EU and its Member States more effective .
The rapporteur ' s opinion on the processes of globalisation is also to be supported , and especially her opinion regarding a closer common competition policy , which concerns my own committee in particular - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
Of all the actions covered by the proposal I would in particular like to emphasise the importance of cooperation projects with the United States of America .
Transatlantic trade is still the thread of life as far as the global economy is concerned , and the importance of cooperation in this area must not be underrated .
We have to remember that there is also a strongly political element connected with this cooperation , the basis for which was created in 1995 with the signing of the New Transatlantic Agenda .
She said she was taking part because recently such weapons of mass destruction have on many occasions been deemed to be against international law .
Our group supports the main ideas in the report .
The proposed regulation and directive will make it easier to take account of international amendments to Community acts on maritime safety .
The intention of the proposal is to remove the problems mentioned earlier .
Sea safety standards are an attempt to meet certain minimum conditions , and one advantage of the pre-inspection procedure contained in the regulation is that it will clarify the question of applicable law and increase legal certainty .
In future too it must be a matter of principle that the IMO should be in charge of international maritime safety by concluding international agreements , passing resolutions and agreeing conventions .
Although the wreck of the Erika was a catastrophe for European shipping , the accident also had some very positive consequences .
The publicity surrounding the disaster and increased political pressure has resulted in more effective monitoring on the part of the Commission of legislation on shipping .
Like the fellow Members before me , I would also like to thank the Commissioner for this active involvement .
The truth is that the Erika accident would probably never have happened if all the regulations in force at the time had been properly complied with and if , furthermore , that compliance had been monitored correctly .
The new committee must monitor and , if necessary , improve the way legislation is implemented and take an active role , on the Union ' s behalf , in the IMO and other international organisations .
It is very important , however , as the rapporteur quite rightly points out in his report , that Parliament ' s rights to take part in the regulatory procedure should be satisfactorily safeguarded .
This report , together with those reports aimed at liberalising the railways that were adopted last week , is a breakthrough in the development of the European railways .
The development of rail transport is also a step towards more environmentally sustainable transport systems .
There is still much to be done but now the work is off to a good start .
At the same time we must remember that the interoperability of the rail networks is a long-term project .
For that reason , it is important that a timetable is put in place to carry out the work and that we determine just which networks should be given priority .
The compromise achieved regarding the use of Russian railway carriages and wagons between Finland and Russia will not put the aims of the report in jeopardy , but will ensure that transport on the Union ' s eastern border will continue undisturbed .
Mr President , Commissioner de Palacio , ladies and gentlemen , although my sympathies lie very much with the rubber tyre , I am delighted that we have achieved a good result , not least as a consequence of Mr Savary ' s hard work .
Rail transport must be subjected to an honest appraisal that weighs benefits alongside costs .
Improved competitiveness on the railways must first and foremost come about by reducing the costs rail transport incurs and raising standards of service .
At present , rail transport still , unfortunately , costs the taxpayer too much money , whether he or she takes trains or not
