Personally , I believe that the inclusion in the sectoral directive of a provision going beyond the scope of the GATT Agreement could constitute grounds for complaints to the WTO panel .
We shall see tomorrow if there is a majority in favour of one of these solutions .
The large number of petitions nevertheless shows that there is still much scope for action and improvement .
I should like to raise one other point which , in the information age , I feel is inseparable from the debate on mobility : the use of modern communication technologies .
I hope that we can make some headway here and bring about improvements .
Madam President , this is a very important Commission proposal .
There is now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which has developed ways of breaching walls so that threats are no longer necessary .
We should welcome any politically realistic positions adopted by Parliament which ensure that the common foreign and security policy does not remain a hollow phrase .
And I would repeat here , on behalf of my group , that while we welcome the progress on this issue , we are hoping for more impetus in this direction in the future .
And despite the many concerns which have been expressed , I am confident that it will seize that opportunity .
Mr Titley said it clearly : this is about creating acceptance for the arms industry , so that it can determine foreign policy .
From Austria 's point of view , it could be asked whether the harmonization of arms export regulations called for in the report does not represent a further strategy - deliberately veiled from the Austrian people - for the progressive dismantling of its neutrality , and whether it would not be more honest to come clean with the citizens of the EU 's neutral states and allow them to decide whether or not formally to give up their neutrality in a referendum .
This is an industrial sector which is frequently beset by crises .
I appreciate that he has tried to present a sober and objective report , since this is unfortunately a subject which sometimes gives rise to heated debate .
Neither the Commission nor the Council were ready to adopt the European Parliament 's view .
But regional cooperation will only work when there is a functioning Bosnian state in Bosnia .
Our task as elected representatives is not to act as ambassadors for Slovenia , Croatia , Serbia or Bosnia .
It is obvious that some form of regional economic cooperation will then emerge .
We should also learn the lesson of Albania : that money alone is ineffective , the only effective way is to put people on the ground in the country .
We managed it in Mostar , so why not in other cities ?
Cooperation is simply a political necessity , so that people learn to live together .
However , this breach should be covered by the derogation allowing the EU to grant special treatment to ACP countries until the year 2000 .
In the ACP countries and the EU , bananas are cultivated mainly by small and medium-sized growers , not on vast plantations like those in Honduras and Guatemala .
Fishing is a long-established and traditional occupation which also has a future .
Amongst other things , these must contain the most reliable information possible on the state of fish stocks , an element of coordination with other Community activities , and an informed cost-benefit assessment .
Moreover , we are already faced with another similar case - I refer to the agreement with Senegal which was initialled on 26 March .
Under Article 130v of the EC Treaty , the Community is already legally required to adopt a coherent approach to its various policies and to take account of their impact on developing countries .
Even to say the costs of dismantling a nuclear power station are 10 % to 15 % of the construction costs is a nonsense .
Mr President , we need a fundamental discussion of the use of nuclear technology for supplying energy .
I consider it quite intolerable for the explanatory statement to contain the phrase : ' Nuclear power ... has demonstrated its economic effectiveness . '
These calculations can be refuted by the real figures .
Nuclear disarmament is another subject we should consider - with a view to destroying stocks rather than building up new ones .
Then of course there is the unresolved problem of decommissioning .
So every nuclear power station in Europe concerns us all .
Commissioner , let me once again congratulate you as the responsible Commissioner on taking a real step forwards with this Green Paper .
We should apply our combined European common sense now .
Words and more words , but no deeds !
Let me say at this point , to rescue the reputation of the European Union which has often been criticized during this debate , that in recent years we were able to finance a whole range of projects because we increased the appropriations for renewable energy sources , thanks mainly to the European Parliament 's efforts during the budgetary procedure .
Here too there is room for improvement .
Commissioner , let me say quite clearly that I expect the White Paper at last to give a clearly formulated reply in economic terms to the question whether startup financing with EC resources really can encourage the market introduction of renewable energies - yes or no .
That would save time .
Unfortunately we voted first on the PSE motion , although the other went further .
In the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights Sir Leon Brittan likened the WTO talks to a poker game .
This is a matter of principle and I would cordially ask the Commission not to treat Parliament this way too often
