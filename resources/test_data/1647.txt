We cannot abandon Oslo in the search for another reality .
I would also like to thank the President-in-Office for the full and very positive answer that he gave to my question .
Do you think that this action is in keeping with the spirit of the customs union and with the spirit of respect for the basic principles that govern it ?
Since , of course , if this federal structure existed , if internal borders had really been abolished , there would be no reason to regulate the extradition of illegal immigrants between Member States .
It is necessary to stress the need not to underestimate the role of the European Parliament , which is a guarantor of liberties , of the European Court of Justice and finally of the Member States , which must not abuse the reservations contained in the convention nor refer its implementation to the Greek Calends , that is , postpone it indefinitely .
Our position , and we will recommend this to our colleagues , will depend on the reply the Commissioner refuses to give us .
If he does not , the whole system will collapse and we will request a referral back .
One more resolution full of nice words of support for Cyprus and full of advice to Turkey and to Mr Denktash .
And if that was not enough we also have paragraph 5 , which refers to the S300s .
Are you not aware that there are tanks and aeroplanes ?
It seems that when a missile bears a stamp saying 'made in the United States ' or 'made in Europe ' it is a good missile , since this is the impression that you give me , and I regret that in this resolution , which will have no significance whatsoever , there is this paragraph .
Many hopes had indeed been invested in the talks that took place in the United States and in Switzerland between President Clerides and the leader of the Turkish Cypriots , Mr Denktash , but it must be said that those hopes have been vindicated in only a very small part .
But there has been real progress on humanitarian issues and now there is the prospect of the beginning of talks on security on the island , and it is the wish of all of us , I imagine , in this room to see the complete demilitarisation of Cyprus .
The picture that emerged is that the Greek Cypriots agreed with the ideas of the United Nations , there was 90 % agreement , they accepted them fully and I think that nobody can claim that the United Nations is an organ of the Greek Cypriots .
For this to happen , pressure must be exerted on Turkey to find a solution and to encourage all those forces in Turkey who want this to happen and who believe in a solution to the Cypriot question and in the accession of Cyprus to the European Union .
The move for the accession of Cyprus into the European Union , while seen by many as the catalyst for the solution of the Cyprus question , is already being transformed into an instrument of pressure and blackmail against the legally elected government of the Republic of Cyprus , and allows Turkey , with the indulgence not only of the European Union but also of the governments of certain Member States , to undermine any prospect whatsoever for a just and honourable solution to the Cypriot problem .
Mr President , as we are aware , the European Union was represented by a committee of observers with unfortunately only five members , expertly presided over by Mrs Pack .
The ambassador , Mr Frowick , rushed to celebrate before the ballot boxes had been well and truly closed .
Of course every attempt to rebuild local multiethnic societies must be supported .
Of course the mega question of war crimes still has n't been resolved .
And when we talk of aid , we are not talking of philanthropy .
The increase in the imposition of the death penalty and the frequent public executions , as mentioned by Amnesty International and the Human Rights Agency , must concern us greatly and must make our Parliament , and other institutional bodies of the European Union , sensitive to the situation , so that it will engage in campaigns on a global scale for the abolition of the death penalty .
Today , unfortunately , the increased trend towards the restoration of the death penalty is all too obvious , and the reasons for this return to a mediaeval form of punishment are : firstly , the inability of governments to control crime , which is on the increase because there is no investment in a long term anti-crime social policy with prevention as its aim.-secondly , the increase in the fear of becoming a victim .
And so capital punishment is most often used for the extermination of opponents of the state .
Yesterday Mr Fischler systematically and insistently refused to answer questions or to give any clarification on the disclosure at the parliamentary Committee of Inquiry that there are loopholes in the law and that it is possible to violate , legally , the legislation which we have gradually been building up over the year for identifying animals , labelling meat , and reestablishing consumer confidence .
He gave no explanation and gave no pledge to improve the situation .
The rapporteur was quite right to emphasise that at the present stage it is not advisable to make vast changes , as the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union from January 1999 will make these changes .
What is more , it limits the free exercise of a policy of public economy by Member States in the run up to EMU, since this
