Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today 's joint debate , opened by the chairman of the European Monetary Institute , Mr Lamfalussy , for which I recognize the hard work and good relations that Dr Lamfalussy has maintained with the European Parliament in particular ( last year it was my honour to draft the report on the first report by his institution ) , comes really at a key moment .

Commissioner , how is it that abusive action by a Director General of the Commission can paralyse the LEADER II programme , just because of problems raised by LEADER I ?

I understand that the Commissioner does not want to enter into Spanish domestic affairs , but the situation is such that you should know that the day after a representative of the affected company appeared before the court , it decided that he should not be able to leave Spain .
Commissioner , I too understand that you do not want to enter into political differences in my country , but I must insist on this .
Mr President , a Spanish momentum is a European momentum .

Finally , I should like to congratulate Mr Baldarelli on his report which gains my Group 's full support .
I do not think that we can deal with the reform of the compensatory amounts for cereals by saying 'coffee all round ' , because that over-compensation to which you referred , has not occurred throughout the Community at an equal rate .
