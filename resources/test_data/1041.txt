Allow me to support what has been said with regard to universal service , access for schools , etc .
It is often said that in politics what is not possible is false .
I am also very grateful for your reply myself .
My question to Commissioner Nielson is whether the report or the Commission ' s proposals to the European Council at Feira consider the possibility of implementing some kind of programme which integrates the action of the outermost regions in relation to this region of Cape Verde , by means of Interreg III for example .
Since we are very clear about this , both in Parliament as well as in the Commission - as the Commissioner has demonstrated on many occasions in her work in favour of sport - I would like her to continue working and convincing people so that sport may be included in one way or another in the Treaties and , thereby , we will be able to work for sport , in this Parliament and in the Commission , and we will have specific budgets for it .
Commissioner , I would like to offer a brief reminder .
Am I right in thinking that right now there is not a single official or agent of the Commission dealing with the operation of this programme ?
Firstly , Parliament considers that a programme of this scope and duration cannot be left to the whim of each year ' s budget .
Sixthly , a committee of external independent experts will advise the Joint Research Centre and assess the technical quality and safety guarantees of the programme during its development .
Therefore , as a counterbalance to such broad powers of investigation , the authorities are obliged to keep the information secret .
That duty of secrecy , taken to the extreme , could hinder certain objectives pursued by the control authorities , which , ultimately , consist of ensuring that the markets behave properly .
The problem is that this exchange generally involves a degree of non-compliance with the obligation to secrecy .
If we want to simplify the legislation , it will also be necessary to reduce the number of regulations and rationalise the initiatives .
We are happy to accept Parliament ' s proposal and we believe that the idea of reducing the number of products exchanged to ten , only indicating the country of origin or destination of the products and their value , may be a good way of resolving the difficulties which I referred to earlier .
Nevertheless , we must recognise that we have two problems which we must address in a different way .
I cannot give you a specific date for the new proposals , but I can assure you that we are working on them and that Parliament and the Council will receive the new proposals from the Commission as soon as we have the basic information from the Member States .
We want to resolve this problem which is not just a question of a legal vacuum but a constitutional problem for the European Union .
We have made certain useful suggestions so that we may find our way out of a situation which is not only unsatisfactory but also negative for the development of democracy in Europe .
I understand that the proposal relating to the tripartite dialogue and stemming from Article 308 is a provisional proposed legislative provision and the best laws , at least in my country , are provisional laws , which are the ones which have lasted the longest .
We should be thinking about a parliamentary dimension for the common security and defence policy which includes the establishment of mechanisms necessary for Parliament to participate , with its corresponding institutional role , in the definition and the objectives of that policy .
We in the European Union do not simply define ourselves as consumers in a big market place , but as citizens of the Union .
One of the objectives is the eradication of domestic violence , which will be considered as a public issue and therefore subject to national legislation .
Why does the Commission and the European Union , given such a positive assessment , not implement these programmes so that the European Union may also offer its women with no resources the possibility of these policies ?
Your information is not accurate .
I must say that the Tunisian Government has made gestures which indicate goodwill .
This is the area in which the European Union can and must cooperate .
As we say in my country , By talking we come to understand people ' .
I believe that this is a useful question to ask , because only by understanding as accurately as possible what is happening in Tunisia and the challenges faced by that country , will we be able to find the tone of moderation and effectiveness which we must develop within the framework of cooperation .
We will only be fulfilling our obligations if we in the European Union find the tone and the effectiveness to help the sectors in Tunisia who are in favour of the development needed to accompany and safeguard the future of economic growth and social modernisation .
Secondly , this agreement is positive because it brings with it economic , social , environmental and also geopolitical advantages for China and the world in general , especially the European Union .
The other question is as follows : we have worked very well with the Commission and the Council throughout this process and we intend to continue to do so .
