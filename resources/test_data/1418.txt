to say where the Member States have already accepted a Community competence , in other words where we have already passed a measure , then QMV should apply to adjust that measure .
That makes absolute sense .
What I was not clear about was when he talked about other measures where it was necessary to make the single market work .
How will that be defined ?
It sounds fine but how do you define a measure that is essential to make the single market work ?
That is a matter of intense debate .
Similarly , the issue of harmonisation against coordination : one man 's coordination can be another 's harmonisation and we need clear definitions of what is coordination and what is harmonisation if this is to work .
I wish him well in this area because it is an area in which we need a breakthrough .
But it is not going to be easy to get an agreement and I would like to see the document in detail before passing judgement on what the Commissioner said this afternoon .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your comments .
I do not understand your assertion that there will be no transfer of powers .
If you are increasing qualified majority voting and therefore taking away the national veto , you are effectively transferring powers from the nation state to the European institutions .
I am also very uncomfortable with your statement that you would only seek harmonisation of tax in areas "linked to the single market " because we know that , if that phrase is interpreted liberally - as the European institutions are inclined to do - practically everything can be said to be linked to the single market .
Are you aware , Sir , that the leader of the British Conservative Party has said that we have reached the limits of European integration ?
Are you aware of recent public opinion surveys showing that the British people are opposed to the transfer of further powers from the nation state to Brussels , and how will you take those facts into account ?
Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
I am sure that none of us here will object to fraud and tax evasion being tackled but I must say that it is necessary to maintain the confidence of citizens in the Union , and I think that many Member State governments will be wishing to look very carefully at any extension of QMV before agreeing to it .
It does strike very much at the heart of what is perceived as the national ability to conduct one 's affairs .
I am thinking in particular of things such as the withholding tax , which it would have been quite unacceptable to have subjected to a QMV regime .
I hope those points will be borne in mind when you look at the practicality of getting the package through .
We are very happy to combat fraud and tax evasion and to improve social security legislation , but there are some points where there will be difficulty in convincing all the Member States to follow .
Commissioner , I have some very simple questions for you , which require just a 'yes ' or 'no ' answer in each case .
Can you guarantee that the Commission will not seek , under any circumstances , to use qualified majority voting to impose the withholding tax ?
Can you give the same guarantee in relation to the proposed tax on aircraft fuel , which was discussed in ECOFIN this week , and can you give the same guarantee in relation to corporation tax in the European Union ?
Are there any circumstances where the Commission would seek to use qualified majority voting on any of those issues ?
Can you guarantee that the Commission will not use qualified majority voting on any of those issues ?
I am pleased to hear the Commissioner 's comments on the Charter .
I would like to push him to give details about the nature of the campaign .
Last Wednesday we had a very successful launch of the European information campaign involving Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament .
I would like the Commissioner to reassure me that , when the campaign is decentralised , information offices in the Member States will involve Members of the European Parliament in the information campaign as a matter of course .
After all , it is the MEPs who are supposed to represent the citizens .
We are at least as well-placed as the Commission to engage in that dialogue with the citizens .
Question No 44 by (H-0206/00 ) : Subject : Trade preference for least developed countries Precisely what damage in specific European sectors is Commissioner Lamy seeking to avoid in his commitment to waive all EU quotas and export tariffs on 'essentially ' all products and services from the world ' s least developed countries ( LLDCs ) rather than waiving them in their entirety ?
As LLDCs account for less than 0.5 % of world trade , will he reconsider his reservations in this respect ?
What timetable does he propose for the implementation of this measure ?
I am grateful to Commissioner Lamy for his answer , as far as it went .
I certainly agree with what he said in the last part of his answer about the need for capacity-building in the least developed countries as well as , perhaps the need for asymmetrical measures , resulting in a certain level of protection for their markets that we do not seek to enjoy in return .
But my main concern in asking the question - and I do not feel this has been fully dealt with - is over this matter of exactly what "essential products " means .
