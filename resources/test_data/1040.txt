The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece is voting against the directive on the Community Air Traffic Controller Licence .
The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece , in the face of these developments , is helping to escalate the workers ' fight to overturn the anti-grass roots policy of the EU and its institutions , so that the contemporary needs of working , grass-roots families can be satisfied .     . – Mr President , the three absolutely identical resolutions from three totally different ideological groups are evidence of the common concern on the problem of nuclear weapons and , at the same time , conceal a curious , hypocritical undercurrent .
Are there , in other words , good and bad nuclear weapons ?
Is it right that 25 countries with a joint resolution , joint central bank and joint agricultural policy should not have the same right to nuclear weapons and that only two of the 25 should have the right to nuclear weapons ?
Consequently , we tear up our own credentials as an agency of independence and justice .
The truth is that Lebanon , following the war and the occupation of Iraq by the Americans , is becoming the field of application of the Greater Middle East plan announced by the United States and adopted by ΝΑΤΟ and the European Union .
Why has it been raised now , I wonder , and what are you hoping for ?
We consider that the peoples and the political forces in the area must resolve their problems and do not need protectors .
Why two sets of standards ?
I shall insist – as other Members have done – on the issue of the mission of observers from the European Parliament .
As for the third , the withdrawal of Syrian troops , I say yes , provided that Syria officially announces a timetable , especially following the recent statements by President Assad .
At the same time , an international initiative needs to be taken to restart the peace process between Israel and Syria .
The withdrawal of the Syrian forces , as agreed , is a first positive step .
Our objective is respect for the international legality and the application of resolution 1559 .
If we are to be effective , we need first to be a credible European Union .     – Mr President , the proposal for a directive on services is a proposal of ill repute .
Mr McCreevy , take the Bolkenstein proposal away and bring us a proposal of your own , a McCreevy proposal ; do not confine yourself to the role of making minor corrections to the Bolkenstein proposal .
And why does it not activate the safety clause for which provision is made in China 's WTO accession protocol ?     – Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his reply .
It is a most generous tool ; however , its long period of application through renewals is leading to the unforced conclusion that it needs to focus on the countries that really need it and on fundamentally competitive products .
The second risk is inherent in the fact that the liberalisation of imports in application of the 'everything but arms ' initiative , in conjunction with the strict proposal to review the COM in sugar , is expected to benefit not the less developed countries , which need a longer transitional period , nor the ACP countries , but the export interests of the oligarchies .
Citizens often complain about delays .
We keep them away from knowledge .
I , for my part , appreciate that the Committee on Petitions and its cooperation with the ombudsman and his services needs to be galvanised into greater action , given that , according to the initial data , there has been an increase in petitions in the order of 40 % compared with the previous year .
How do you believe that the application of the justification of citizens is safeguarded by the Member States following the Commission 's decision ?     – Mr President , Commissioner , I had a great many things to say , but I shall confine myself to very few , because I do not want to go over the background , which you already know .
If this is the case , then we also need to allow the trade in other organs , for a fee , such as when obtaining kidneys .
The side effects , which are significant , have been reported by other Members .
In March 2000 , we decided at Lisbon to maximise the competitiveness of Europe , subject to the limitations imposed by the maintenance of cohesion and environmental protection .
It is a strategy of hierarchical priorities .
Thus , the mid-term review summarises the Lisbon strategy in a simple equation : Emphasis on research and technology programmes + support for small and medium-sized enterprises + construction of crucial infrastructures + improved human resources + promotion of structural changes = maintainable long-term growth and sustainable development .
In the name of the competitiveness of the economy of united Europe ( in other words of its monopolies ) , an unprecedented attack has been unleashed on the employment and social rights of the grass-roots classes .
There can be no self-delusion as to the importance of the Lisbon strategy .
With the changes proposed to the Stability Pact and to the Lisbon strategy itself , the strategy cannot be made into a pro-grass roots strategy .
Consequently , new storms against grass-roots incomes and other grass-roots achievements are brewing at the spring Council .
These are measures which reduce social and employment rights in order to increase the profitability of European capital .
I also wish to ask how the Council believes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
