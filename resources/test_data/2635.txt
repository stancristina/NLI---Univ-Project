It would be unwise not simply to limit the minimum maximum penalty of five years to certain crimes but to arrange for it to be applied to all drugs-related crimes .
This problem is referred to in specialist literature as the grey zone .
The question arises as to what measures the Commission is taking to prevent the problem of the grey zone from occurring during the reconstruction of Afghanistan .
In addition , in my capacity as rapporteur , I would refer to the enormous importance of coordination and cooperation , not only between the Commission services but also with the Member States , international donors , local partners and NGOs .
From my talks with the Commission , it transpired that there is a clear need for a flexible instrument for construction and rehabilitation , so that this grey zone can be dealt with .
It is no longer acceptable for people who are directly faced with the effects of war or natural disasters on a daily basis to be left out in the cold due to our inability to react to the local situation in a rapid , flexible and coordinated manner .
These structural shortcomings therefore stand in the way of solving the problem of the grey zone .
Internal coordination can only be effective if a multidisciplinary team is deployed at an early stage .
Crisis situations are always complex , and we must reach consensus on the way in which the reaction of the Union as a whole can be improved on .
I think we can all be agreed that improvements need to be made in the grey zone between relief and development .
Europ I is actively working on an agenda to improve its working methods and so increase its capacity for rapid interventions .
For that reason , the debate which we held with the Council last year , together with your report of today , are welcomed by the Commission as contributions towards a more effective response to crises and the achievement of greater coherence between relief and development .
Although monitoring is a national competence , a two-yearly report on the results of the monitoring procedure , which is to be submitted to the Commission , must still be drawn up .
In addition to monitoring , there is also the problem of penalties , which differ from one Member State to another .
Normally , I am not one for using big words , certainly not as long as a negotiation process is still running , but now that we have reached the end of it , I shall venture to use superlatives after all and refer to the achievement of both these agreements as historic .
A third step is required for , if we take this employee participation seriously , it should also apply to restructuring and changes in companies .
I have carried out research into this industry for years , and I do not think that we are dealing with a cowboy society , but rather a cowboy industry .
This was a case comparable to Kralowetz , but on a smaller scale .
I should like to comment on a few of these areas of concern .
This was evidently raised during a lunch meeting with the Chairman of the FSA , the British financial authority , and I remember that we , too , raised the point during a lunchtime meeting with Mr Duisenberg and his colleagues in the past .
I would now like to turn to another topic which , with a view to the future , will become an important point of discussion , namely that of increasing the Bank ' s capital .
The situation in the United States and Sweden , where excise is very high and consumption relatively low , illustrate this trend , as well as a study conducted by the World Bank .
Firstly , there is the VAT issue in respect of which the rapporteur has submitted proposals which we support .
The rapporteur ' s approach serves the interests of the cigarette industry and not the interests of the citizen .
Finally , I should like to note once again that , sadly , one billion euros ' worth of tobacco subsidies still go up in carcinogenic smoke .
This would lead to the criminalisation of the users , who would then need to make their purchases from criminals who trade in hard drugs .
For these people , there was no European unity for years .
Unlike people with the nationality of a Member State , they were required to continue to comply with visa obligations in each separate Member State which they crossed in order to spend a holiday in their country of origin .
Not by cutting down on sex , but by cutting down on smoking , Mr Fatuzzo .
Meanwhile , a consistent rejection of , and fight against , terrorism do remain the conditions par excellence for creating any political compromise between the State of Israel and its neighbours .
Along with the psalmist , I would say indeed : pray for the peace of Jerusalem .
The peace process will be a lengthy and tiresome process , but I remain convinced that with the necessary trust , the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance , we can attain our common goal , namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East .
They are , in fact , choosing the road of peace , away from occupation , away from terror and state terror , and towards the negotiating table and , hopefully , peace eventually .
What can the European Union do ?
Is he driving a new wedge between the European Union and the United States ?
You state that you yourself are not responsible for taxation , but it is always the Commission that does the talking
