I am not really used to that but I consider it a good thing in this context .
There were two considerations which gave rise to my question .
Secondly , there is the analysis of the effectiveness of the Structural Funds which was recently presented in the Committee on Regional Policy , which concluded that their effectiveness was exceptionally poor ; with the exception of Objective 1 , the resources involved did not to any great extent go to regions of high unemployment or regions with a low per-capita income .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply .
I have been unable to provide any correct answers as to what support exists .
If we allow others to affect or guide our actions , we offend against the spirit of the task we have undertaken .
The lobbyists who try to influence us must also act openly .
This is not good .
It proposes in practice that the payment of parliamentarians ' staff and payments for their equipment by lobbyists should be legalised .
It is of course precisely in order to affect votes that such gifts are given .
Lobbying must be regulated , partly to prevent improper influence through gifts and financial advantages but not least in order that all individuals and interest groups should have the same opportunities to influence the work of parliament , irrespective of their size and financial strength .
Verifiable passcards which facilitate registration and checks based on the principle of public accountability constitute the only system which meets the requirements of openness , democracy and equal conditions for all .
There is no need for lists in which donations of money or in kind to Members can be published .
The Nordmann report is much the same .
My conclusion is thus that we have two proposals which are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough .
Having the right information or knowing how to obtain information is an important skill for most people who will work in the labour market of the future .
The present report is primarily concerned with the latter .
Allow me to mention some other aspects which are important in this connection .
Steps must be taken to ensure that these groups have the same access to and opportunities to use the financial and technical networks and systems .
In the somewhat longer term I can also see that undreamt of possibilities will emerge for the use of trans-European telecommunications networks for general and commercial services and the simplification of routine procedures in such sectors as transport , procurement , purchasing , invoicing and the postal , banking and insurance industries , which will be to the benefit of us all .
We can see that certain countries in Eastern Europe , such as Albania and Belarus , are sliding back into authoritarian forms of government .
Against this background the present report is to some extent a disappointment , because it argues very traditionally along military lines .
Common defence is discussed .
I do not believe this line of thinking provides any solution to the problem facing us , rather it is what one might call a 'non-solution ' .
I believe that the military course represents the vestiges of an old Cold War mentality which is actually obsolete and which cannot survive .
The human rights situation in the country is still far from satisfactory , however .
You only have to think of Sarajevo , Srebrenica , Krajina and many other places .
Of course consideration needs to be given to the shape we , with the help of the WEU , will give to the European pillar .
How we resolve our conflicts reflects how far we have come in our development , as people where we choose negotiation , as wild beasts where we choose force .
The Cold War resulted in insane nuclear armament , which could annihilate all of humanity .
The proposal in paragraph 21 of the Fern√°ndez-Albor report must be rejected and replaced by Amendment No 10 .
Mr President , the battle against crime and drugs is an issue close to the hearts of the general public .
I should like to take the opportunity as a Swedish Member to offer you my good wishes .
Why not consider developing police cooperation to the same standards as represented by the Mattaeus programme ?
In this document the Council of Ministers argues rigorously against openness and quite rightly states that the Code of Conduct does not imply any legal right to obtain a document , simply what is called a 'policy orientation ' .
Further to this I have two other questions .
My second question concerns the fact that some months after the case involving the ' Journalisten' newspaper another Swedish journalist asked for the same document which the Council had previously refused to hand over to the ' Journalisten' newspaper and on that occasion the document was provided .
Like many others here I should like to wish the Irish presidency a warm welcome and every success .
It is extremely important that we receive an answer from the Council of Ministers , since it is a matter of whether arrangements made and agreements reached during the negotiations have any force or not .
On behalf of France he calls upon the UN Security Council to give IFOR , the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia , a clear mandate to arrest people accused of war crimes .
I believe that it is very , very regrettable that IFOR at present lacks the clear mandate that I hope , after today 's debate , Parliament will demand , just as the French Minister of Defence has .
Many of us had very great hopes that Algeria would lead the way in respect of democracy , freedom and human rights in the Arab
