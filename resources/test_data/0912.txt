Moreover , uranium , even the depleted variety which is 20 % less radioactive than natural uranium , is still a form of nuclear waste and dangerous to use .
Did the discovery of the dangerous nature of depleted uranium weapons really come as a surprise ?
Nevertheless , we can but condemn the willingness , indicated in the resolution , to entrust the task of managing relations with Communist Korea to the European Union rather than to Member States .
Undeniably , the composition of the Commission and the dubious solidarity between member states who have little respect for human rights often prevent us adopting clear-cut , distinct conclusions , or even any conclusion at all .
If you will allow me , I would like to ask you a brief question on an urgent matter .
The elections will be held in June , then we will have a well-earned rest in July and August .
This means , however , that we should reinforce convergence and incentive instruments .
It certainly saddens me .
First of all , I feel it is imperative to point out that the main thing is to promote the sustainability of transport , which is a fundamental , long-term measure needed to protect our environment and avoid congestion .
I think that this contribution by the European Parliament will enable the Commission to make good progress in its subsequent work .
Mr President , on Monday afternoon , Parliament proposed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs should look into the situation of the workers of the European corporation , Danone , threatened with the loss of 3000 jobs in the biscuit sector , 1700 of which are in France .
I have just one argument in defence of equality , not just political equality but equality in general .
My Group has tabled amendments to get rid of the counter-productive demands I have just described and I hope that these amendments will be adopted .
We must therefore welcome this broadened approach to industrial policy and the Community forestry strategy .
In the same way , we must consider intensifying the existing link between the environment and road safety ( leading us , for example , to reassess road signs and marking to make them safer ) .
You have to read between the lines , though , to see exactly what it is talking about and if you do so , you come across two of the pet themes of this institution : the creation of an environment tax and the war waged on road transport and the car .
The one main purpose hinted at in the report is to impose yet more taxes on the road users , who are already treated like Europe ' s cash cows , and perhaps even to install toll gates and charge for the use of the main roads or minor roads .
Nowhere does the report make any reference to a state response to social needs , yet , on the other hand , the only response to the " all market " solution is to appeal to private companies , for both the construction and the management of infrastructure .
This morning , the President saw fit to propose postponing Mr Ferri' s report .
We have now seen the outcome of that situation and just how close they are in fact .
The region is stagnating , ossified in political , economic and energy transition processes which continue to exist only in theory .
Several Member States are actually guilty of conniving with the perpetrators of massacres .
It is in Europe ' s interest to extend the area of peace and stability which it has succeeded in establishing within Europe to the southern Mediterranean , by continuing the Barcelona Process .
For too long Europe has elected not to intervene in events in Algeria , siding with the established administration .
The election of President Bouteflika had given the people hope , but we are forced to acknowledge that the path taken by the 'civil concord law ' is a very long way from leading to peace .
However , in the meantime , I was informed that most of the people who had taken part in this debate in my committee , and who I hoped would be able to speak before the House , had unfortunately sent their apologies as they were unable to take part in the debate .
Accordingly , and this concerns thousands of people every year throughout the Union , a holder of a long-stay visa and who has not yet received a residence permit , is in the least favourable position by comparison with other third-country nationals as far as freedom of movement in the Schengen area is concerned .
However , I hope , and I believe that we should all hope , that this initiative should be part of a clear , consistent , overall proposal from the Council and not part of an initiative which is sketchy in scope and shaky in its arrangements , like this one .
As Mr Deprez also highlighted , the legal basis of the proposal could have been envisaged in a different way so that it covered all aspects mentioned in these arrangements .
That is why I shall vote in its favour .
I presented this report pursuant to Article 159 of the Treaty , with which you are familiar , just as Monica Wulf-Mathies did in 1996 .
That is why in this report we identified a third group of countries , which will include the eight poorest candidate countries , which will comprise 16 % of the population of the enlarged Union , where the per capita income is approximately only 40 % of the Community average .
We are part of a European Union which wishes to formalise its structures of solidarity .
The first is that we
