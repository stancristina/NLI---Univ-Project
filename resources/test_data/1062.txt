It is thus impossible to claim that Biarritz genuinely listened to the demand , as expressed in the referendum in Denmark , that national democracies be respected within the Union .
We bring the question of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into our nation-oriented arguments , but fail to consider the fact that the future of Europe hinges on a Commission that is able to represent all its citizens and not the Member States as in the past , and one that has not been transformed - along the lines sketched out today - into a second Council , where all sorts of haggling become possible and no authentic expression of common European is able to emerge .
The determination to heal the rift between the smaller and larger countries is an integral part of this spirit .
Furthermore , the French Parliament held an hour-long question session that was broadcast at peak viewing time and was specifically dedicated to topical European issues , and thus to the results of the Biarritz European Council , during which the Prime Minister spoke at length .
I would just like to express my disappointment at the fact that the European Parliament has dispensed with drawing up the report that it had announced and which was to have been the subject of an oral question today .
We will strive for this change , as our Presidential role dictates , but I would not want to lead Parliament to believe that developments that cannot come about will come about .
Indeed , the magic of the European Union is precisely its ability to foster alliances between small and large countries in the common interest .
We can say yes to Parliamentary control of closer cooperation , but how can this be put into effect without recreating conditions that are so restrictive that they do not allow this cooperation to be developed ?
Concerning the Charter , you have just replied in a very well reasoned manner , but my Group is nonetheless anxious to say to you that the work must go on .
We would like to see similar zeal for action in the field when there are disasters in Europe , such as the storms of December 1999 or the sinking of the Erika .
Then bring all our weight to bear , which means that the Union must speak with a single voice , which unfortunately was not the case last week at the tenth extraordinary session of the United Nations General Assembly .
In the latter case , the question we must answer is when will this principle of a rotation which treats both larger and smaller states on a strictly equal basis come into effect .
It is one of the points that have been broached in the discussions and I honestly feel that , beyond what we are able to achieve in the negotiations themselves , anything that the European Parliament itself can quite clearly say on the way it is to be structured after enlargement will be very useful to us because it will enlighten our work and the work of the Member States .
This was what struck me personally , and gives me some confidence that there will be genuine results at Nice .
The lessons we have learnt from the twentieth century , however , is if we see people everywhere only as French , Germans , Danish , Irish , Arabs , Hutus , Tutsis , Serbs , Bosnians and Persians , we end up forgetting our common humanity .
Democracy in Europe is in better health .
It remains undiscovered , invisible , illegible and unintelligible .
Finally , one last point of a quite different sort , which Mr Segni , backed by Chairman Napolitano , wished to bring up , and which I noted , the question of islands .
I shall now return to each of these points , but only briefly in order to leave time for the debate .
However , in spite of the clear guarantees which must surround reinforced cooperation , such cooperation is nonetheless exceptional in nature , and shows that it was not possible , at a given time , for the fifteen Member States to come to an agreement on stepping up cooperation in a specific sector .
It is a response to the real requirements which I have just listed .
It is extremely difficult to rewrite treaties which have been negotiated , sometimes down to the last comma , and the next item in our debate provides an eloquent example of this .
A number of honourable Members have raised these questions , as have the Commission and Parliament .
To tell the truth , I do not know the answer at the present time .
And that , I understand , is what you are lamenting .
It must remain open to all and , as I said earlier , it must be an instrument of association , integration , and definitely not an instrument of exclusion : that is the second point .
I completely share Parliament ' s wish for the fundamental principles to remain unchanged , but I have noticed , Mr Gil-Robles , a willingness on your part to make some of these conditions more flexible , as in point 11 of your resolution , and I would like to exercise a certain amount of caution in this respect .
I think that Nice could be the beginning of the next stages of discussions on several related topics .
The important work carried out at our request by the European Institute in Florence , to which I have referred , shows that it is legally possible to assemble all these essential elements in a single text comprising a small number of articles .
It is ready to do so by means of a report to be drawn up following Nice on these matters of clarifying competences and simplifying the Treaties ,
