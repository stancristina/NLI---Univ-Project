Do you consider there to be opportunities for coordination and useful services in the context of the problem being discussed here ?     .
It also deals with issues related to migration , social integration , justice and security .
The status must also offer , and this is very important , effective constitutional guarantees to ensure that minorities are protected , including mechanisms to ensure their participation in central government and local administrative structures .
Against this background , Mr Solana and Commissioner Rehn presented their second report on how the EU can prepare for the coming challenges to the Council in December .
I would like to know whether the EU has provided sufficient resources to ensure that it can play an equivalent role in Kosovo during and after the status process .     .
With regard to Ukraine , we are very supportive of its connection to the European Union within the framework of the ENP.
Our dialogue with China – in which I have taken part myself  – is very open and direct .
Madam President , I cannot say at the moment whether such a conference will be held in the first half of 2006 : it will depend on the troika of the G24 group  – led by Mexico – reaching agreement with the Colombian government .
The example of energy policy has already been mentioned , which involves , for example , providing aid to Ukraine .
We must not forget , though , that there is another approach : the Barcelona Process with its regional approach .
The neighbourhood and enlargement policies , like economic policy , need the concept of regulatory policy .
I simply cannot understand how it is possible to say that large enterprises should have their place in this growth and jobs strategy but the smaller ones should not .
It also specifies the daily challenges faced by SMEs and proposes measures for enhancing their ability to grow and create jobs .
Chancellor Schüssel of the Austrian Presidency , who was here this morning , was himself once the secretary-general of an organisation for small - and medium-sized enterprises , which is why he is so familiar with the problems and knows the importance of doing more in this field .
That means that , in these fields , Europe has the authority and the competence to provide direction that it so badly needs in global competition .
The Netherlands is exemplary with regard to the simplification of regulations , particularly on account of its standardised impact assessments .
I do not wish to discuss now whether the status of a number of Members is perhaps being enhanced by penalising their questionable conduct in the Rules of Procedure .
Only a genuine improvement in the Palestinians ’ living conditions will make them turn away from political radicalism and terror .
There must therefore be other reasons why women are not coming through , and I have to say there is a lack of political will here .
We must have the courage to put all that under the microscope at last .
The greatest potential of Europe’s citizens is and remains their knowledge and that must continue to be promoted on a basis of equality .
The Council stated in its decision that only 10 % of these restructuring funds should go to producers – including those in the developing world – and that the remainder should go to the sugar industry without conditions imposed , thus enabling it to fund its decommissionings without having to take job losses and the needs of the region into consideration in any way whatever .
Reform is needed , but the Commission ’s ideas about it again far overshoot the goal , and so we are today calling for even smaller cuts in the price of sugar and beet , more support for the cultivation of sustainable raw materials as a substitute for the cultivation of beet and higher compensation payments .
The EU Constitution is intended to significantly accelerate the militarisation of the EU and ( in III-311 ) lays down a whole range of militaristic projects . 3 .
In terms of military policy , too , the neighbouring countries are being locked in to the EU , the idea being that they should be able to take part in military interventions and participate in the military structures of the EU.     .
It can be said that what was accomplished then is , today , in ruins , for we see that another unjust regime is establishing itself in Cambodia , and , as that is something that we cannot accept under any circumstances , I would refer the House to paragraph 5 of our resolution , which states quite clearly that the agreement that we concluded with Cambodia is founded upon democracy and human rights .
We have all read in the newspapers about the plans that are being considered for military intervention there , but at no stage of the proceedings has anyone thought to give this House or the relevant committee within it prior notice of this .
As Mr Solana said , this multilateral approach is one reason why the world wants European foreign policy .
If the European Union becomes active in Kosovo , that will probably require substantial funds that the current CFSP Budget for 2006 will be incapable of providing .
How , actually , is it possible that what we celebrated with such enthusiasm a year ago should now – within the space of a year – be rolled back in such a way ?
As for Iran , we all know that more involvement on the part of the USA in security policy would play an important part in persuading Iran to refrain from developing its own nuclear weapons .
I can only agree with that wholeheartedly and assure you that the Austrian Presidency , like the presidencies that preceded it and those that will follow it ,
