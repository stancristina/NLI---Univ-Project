We have come a long way since that initial proclamation of the goal of ever closer union , and today the goal set by the Amsterdam Treaty is the progressive establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice .
In this regard , we must not forget that the concept of organized crime covers many different types of crime .
And I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that we have taken an important step forward with this action plan , although we still have a long way to go in the fight against organized crime .
Nevertheless , what happened in Melilla on Monday - when a 20 , 000 cubic metre reservoir burst its banks - was the chronicle of a tragedy foretold .
Madam President , I wish to express my sorrow at all the human and material losses caused by the disasters referred to in the motion .
It is also a question of fulfilling our duty of solidarity as citizens of Europe .
However , the first thing that I should like to say to Mrs Zimmermann is that immigrants are not criminals .
There is therefore also a need to avoid adopting a populist stance towards this urgent problem .
Furthermore , they provide the Community fleet - whose capacity is greater than the stocks available in Community waters - with fishing opportunities .
Firstly , the fishing possibilities correspond to the real rates of use of those negotiated under the previous protocol .
The financial compensation provided for has also been markedly increased : from ECU 6.35 million per year to ECU 8.5 million per year , in line with the increase in fishing possibilities .
Parliament must defend and make good use of all its powers and responsibilities , including those relating to the budget .
So I should simply like to ask Parliament 's services to correct this material error , since , moreover , the corresponding Commission document also uses the name Costa de Marfil , not Côte d'Ivoire , in its title .
While there has been a small increase in the number of vessels , there has actually been no increase in the total capacity allowed , so I do not believe that this agreement will have a great impact on the number of fish caught .
In the end , I do not believe that it makes any difference to a country if we say " OK , we will pay you this much for fishing rights and give you the rest in development aid ' .
Neither the developing countries nor the Community wishes to see the destruction of those stocks .
Since all of us in the Committee on Budgets voted for this report , I think I am justified in saying that my fellow committee members share the responsibility for both the good points and any errors in the proposal we are presenting to Parliament .
We must remember that the structural fund regulations expire in 1999 , whether enlargement is to take place or not , and therefore we will need to revise our cohesion policy , and everything included in the existing category II of the financial perspectives .
On previous occasions , such as the Delors I and II Packages , the Commission evaluated the objectives and the requirements , and then made the most moderate and cautious financial proposal possible .
It is plausible , and we hope it happens .
We are being asked to exercise austerity and responsibility and , for our edification , the Council rejects a reduction in cereal aid , a sector in which it has been shown that overcompensation was paid , to the tune of ECU 3 thousand million , by the member governments of the Council .
We accept the financial content of the Commission 's communication as the starting point .
Ladies and gentlemen , members of the Council and the Commission , the challenges of the next few years are important for Europe and , I would add , for the rest of the world .
In the case of the Colom i Naval report on financial perspectives , our group feels able to give its support .
We are very critical of the proposal to freeze the Community budget , with 1.27 % of GNP as the own resources ceiling .
The Europe of the twenty-first century cannot be simply a market , it must be an integrated area of democracy and solidarity .
It would not be fair to make distinctions between the candidates , since none of them fulfils the economic criteria , and if anyone is excluded the result will be political instability and irreparable economic damage , for which we will be partly to blame .
However , this consensus should not hide the fact that Agenda 2000 contains underlying problems .
Firstly , ever since 27 October I have been trying to get the last sentence of Paragraph 6 of the resolution to read " ...if appropriate reforms of the agricultural and structural policies are not realized or if the estimated rate of growth is not attained ' .
The published text reads " ...and the estimated rate of growth is not attained ' .
This is a very sensitive issue , so if you will allow me , I would like to read it out , as best I can .
Mr President , I would like you to make a public statement on behalf of this House , to express our support for the aspirations of the Basque people , and our sympathy for the family of José Luis Caso , who was murdered for having been democratically elected to represent Basques like himself .
Mr President , I want to support what my colleagues have said .
I think Parliament 's attitude should also be stressed .
The first thing I should like for Christmas is to be able to
