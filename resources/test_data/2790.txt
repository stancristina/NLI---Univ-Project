There are only a few points .
The Mafia infiltrates the circuit of decent politicians , business people , and other honest citizens .
My thought is therefore the following : when government does not have the courage or the wish to tackle such small local problems , how will it have the courage to tackle international crime ?
The problem here is that it is completely unclear to what extent the measures taken have been implemented nationally .
And priority schedules or not , it is time decisions were taken .
It is obvious that with this choice we would be deeply encroaching on sovereignty , the heart of the Member States .
I am in actual fact sorry that this Parliament did itself not take the opportunity to take the initiative to move towards a policy .
In time this will also be possible from Iraq , so it concerns us directly .

I depend on the Union and Member States working towards a strong , financial and political independent permanent tribunal , and if necessary contributing towards it , but as Mrs van Bladel says , not only from within the Union , but also from the rest of the world .
Madam President , I would like to agree with Mrs Thors , because , according to the information which I was given very recently by the Chair of the Slovakian delegation , it does not amount to much more than what Mrs Thors explained just now .
The internal security law is a law which the Malaysian government clearly uses against every form of political opposition .
Better implementation of this substandard asylum policy is not by definition in the interest of refugees .
It is fine that the candidate Member States are also able to participate in the Odysseus programme .
