applause .
At least let this be a good omen that internal security will be one of the success stories from the IGC.
Welcome Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Lalumi√®re for her excellent report which I hope receives the support of the House .
In 1994 , I voted against establishing a custom 's union between the EU and Turkey .
This has not proved to be the case .
These must be actively used and must be supplemented with conclusive action if violation of human rights continues .
We must also develop political , economic and legal mechanisms to be used as guarantees , controls and sanctions , as without these the clause on human rights and democracy will have no effect whatsoever .
But other issues are also addressed which are not within the competence of the Union , issues which are the concern of the Member States not Parliament .
We would like to practise what we preach and I ask you : What will the people of Europe think of our proposal if we involve ourselves in culturally related issues such as ; at what age do people have the right to adopt and what are our views on the adoption rights of homosexuals and single people ?
I am pleased that the Council of Ministers has taken the first steps so that together we can stop this trade .
Mr President , today UNICEF celebrates its 50th birthday and today Mrs Zimmerman has presented her report on the protection of minors .
Children have the right to good female and male role models in their every day life .
Both men and women must influence the physical , psychological , mental , moral and social development of our children .
There is a proposal for an age limit , 14 years old , at which refugee children may be fingerprinted .
There is no openness , no transparency in the proposals which do exist and there is no opportunity for national Parliaments to discuss these issues before they are finalised .
I can understand this as not everything is yet decided .
I thank the representative from the Council for their answer .
I would still like to ask the Council whether they consider that Article 36 in the report applies .
The fifteen Member States of the EU are among the richest countries in the world .
Thank you for the answer from the Council of Ministers .
This is only a small proportion of the total amount but they could be an important stimulus to the projects .
They cover all areas from transport to energy .
This is particularly important from the point of view of enlargement as we know that the applicant countries have great need to renew their infrastructure .
I did write a letter to Commissioner Bangemann immediately after the speech that I refer to .
This , therefore , should be conveyed , with some vigour , to Commissioner Bangemann .
It was this that motivated the firm decision by Parliament that these countries should be given the opportunity to submit tenders under the aid programme for Yugoslavia .
Mr President , may I conclude by saying that I would like to pass on my thanks and appreciation to Minister Mitchell for the manner in which he and his colleagues have led the work in the Council during the last six months while Ireland has held the presidency .
Mr Kerr has great ambitions in this respect .
As has already been mentioned , it is especially important that the position of that group so often affected by closures and change , meaning women on low wages and women working part time , must not be made worse .
This is a great problem in the Baltic Sea .
The regulations need to be changed as part of a good initiative for the environment .
This would be a decisive move to improve the environment in the Baltic Sea .
Mr Kerr 's report has not been translated into Swedish ; only about 30 % of the text is available in Swedish .
As this is the text of a law , all of it should be available in Swedish .
Madam President , I must apologise to Mrs Lindholm .
Our people are demanding that the Union be an area with free movement , an area characterised by freedom , security , justice and constitutional regulations .
Matters of justice are placed high on the European agenda , particularly thanks to Minister Owen .
Our people expect to see proposals but the right of veto in the Council makes our tools less effective and prevents action and development .
The Council must reorganise itself with less bureaucracy , more openness and transparency .
The Intergovernmental Conference must clarify goals and give the Council the legal tools .
It is vital that the Commission continue to urge IGC development by illustrating the impossible nature of Article K.9 .
Exchange of information between the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizen 's Rights and the Commission has been strengthened .
This unparliamentary behaviour must be stopped if we want Parliament to have greater democratic powers .
Madam President , I would just like to take a minute to highlight an especially important part of a law abiding society which has not , I think been mentioned by many here today and that is openness and public accessibility .
Looking back over the past year , I do not really know whether it is possible to say that openness and public accessibility has increased in the Union or in its Member States but , at least , I have great hopes for the Intergovernmental Conference in this respect .
But , this is the area which covers customs , police , civil criminal law , border controls , drugs , asylum and immigration issues .
