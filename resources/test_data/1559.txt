Mr President , I am happy to be speaking on this major document tabled by Mr Bushill-Matthews , whom I have the honour to call my friend .
I am glad to see that this report , which is so important for the development of small and medium-sized businesses in Europe , has been so well written , and I hope that Mr Bushill-Matthews will continue to be a beacon of light for all those drawing up European Union legislative measures on small and medium-sized businesses .
I am sure that this proposal will be music to Mr Bushill-Matthews ' ears , for he is well-known for being opposed to taxation , and I therefore hope that both he and Commissioner Schreyer will accept it .

I would therefore like to take the opportunity presented by this explanation of vote to express my satisfaction at the European monetary policy and to call for an increase in the European Bank 's activities , including the establishment of offices throughout Europe .
Mr President , I am sure you will listen carefully to my explanation of vote in support of this report .
