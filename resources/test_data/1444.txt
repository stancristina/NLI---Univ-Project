The more these basic elements of a democratic state are missing from numerous countries of the Mediterranean , the more the hopes for economic and social development and an improvement in the position of women will remain dim and the resolutions passed by the conferences held within the framework of the Barcelona process will remain dead letter .
Elections are a symbol of democracy only when they are conducted properly , to quote President Khatami .
However , I fear that efforts by the hard core to bend the will of the Iranian people may result not only in a parliament which has no democratic legitimacy , but also in the weakening of Iran 's international position .
And I should like to take this opportunity to add something else .
Of course , tonnes of oil were spilt into the sea but , from that point on , the way the Pakistani authorities acted was incomprehensible .
Apart from that , we had something else : the head of the salvage team , a Greek seaman , also went to help and he too is being held by the Pakistani authorities as we speak .
We know that the European Union Troika with Commissioner Patten is going to Islamabad next week , on the 18th of the month , and that they have managed to get this issue placed at the top of the agenda on relations between the European Union and Pakistan .
We hope that there will be results from this discussion , which for a long time now has been plaguing our feelings and our thoughts , mainly of innocent people struggling to make a living at sea .
In addition to what Mr Hatzidakis said about the Greek seaman who tried to commit suicide , there is the following tragicomic or sad fact : attempted suicide is a criminal offence there .
Who , ultimately , will protect the lives of seafarers and the marine environment in the future ?
It is inconceivable that the entire crew should be held on the grounds of the ecological disaster caused when the ship ran aground at the entrance to the port of Karachi and for even the ship 's cook to be held to account .
We call on the European Commission and the Presidency and the Greek Government to intervene decisively and demand the immediate release of the seamen being held in Karachi .
In the run up to the Olympic Games in Greece in 2004 , the International Olympic Truce Centre was set up and undertook to conduct a major campaign .
They are values which we continue to hold at the centre of our efforts for as long and with as much effort as are needed to achieve them .
The report is very good ; it proposes a policy framework and contains specific , very interesting proposals for this important and sensitive area .
There is an acute presence and mobility in the area on the part of Powell , on the part of Ivanof , on the part of the USA and on the part of Russia .
The South Caucasus is our neighbour , with historic , cultural and political ties with Europe which go back hundreds , if not thousands of years .
The Union 's priorities are often defined by the historic and economic relations between its Member States and Africa , Latin America and South-East Asia and we overlook the new state of affairs .
Nonetheless , I have already received a very serious complaint from the women’s organisations in Malta , which inform us that the leaders of the political parties are already compiling their lists without including a single woman .
Without doubt , important progress has been made over the last twenty years in all sectors , thanks to the political initiatives taken at parliamentary and national level and the initiatives taken by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities of the European Parliament , and I should like to take this opportunity to thank President Cox for his support .
Without doubt over the last 20 years , the greatest progress has been made in the participation and performances of women at all levels of education , given that today they account for 55 % of graduates in the European Union .
Nonetheless , despite the undisputed achievements , significant differences and discrepancies continue to exist between the two sexes in all sectors , as stated in the Commission ’s first annual report , which will be discussed at the spring European Council in a few days ’ time .
It is disappointing that numerous Member States hardly even follow the Council’s recommendations .
As we approach the tenth anniversary of the UN World Conference in Beijing in 1995 , where 180 governments agreed on a joint action platform in order to promote women’s rights , we find that those commitments have not been honoured .
Commissioner , I should like to ask you to reply to the topical questions which I shall put to you .
This proposal has already been submitted by the Convention .     Mr President , Commissioner , it is an honour for me to present the very important report on the situation of women from minority groups in the European Union on behalf of the rapporteur , Mrs Elena Valenciano , who is unable to be present at today’s sitting .
The rapporteur thanks these organisations of the three minorities for their support to women and for the good cooperation which she had while drafting this report .
Compared to the 55 % of able-bodied women in employment , only 25 % of disabled women work .
It is estimated that violence is the main cause of death and disability worldwide , ahead of cancer , road accidents or even war , for women aged between 16 and 45 .
Difficulty in gaining access to the
