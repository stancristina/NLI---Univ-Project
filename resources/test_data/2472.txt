on the part of Member States in transposing Community legislation into national law , ignoring Commission views , and even disregarding decisions of the Court of Justice , so that 220 legislative texts , or 15 % of the total , remain to be transposed .
Only yesterday we were talking about fiscal harmonisation , but now there is talk about some vague coordination of fiscal policies .
Mr President , Mr Santer , in the last part-session in December the European Parliament considered that the conditions for granting discharge to the Commission for the 1996 budget had not been met .
I will not spend long on these procedural questions as I consider the substantive questions to be of greater interest .
Besides , it must be pointed out in this respect that this initiative by the Socialist Group has had the effect of raising public awareness in all our countries about something that was previously restricted to the institutions and to a few people in a few countries .
Besides , in our opinion there are no good or bad moments for rigorously and extensively tackling questions as serious as these on fraud .
To these can also now be added the unfortunate proceedings against a Commission official , as mentioned previously .
We want to see this take place basically through extensive analysis and substantial alteration in terms of the causes of such a wide range of offences , which are usually associated with a policy of service privatisation , but which are fundamentally linked to the imbalance between the extensive powers granted to the Commission and the limited democratic control of these powers .
We believe this firstly because , as already mentioned , this set of eight measures presented to us by Mr Santer is not part of his programme and therefore , as we know , it will not be this Commission and possibly not even this President who will present the next programme to this House .
There is also another aspect that I must stress and that is cause for some disillusion on our part .
The pegging of the African currencies to the euro will increase the prominence of the euro , thereby justifying an additional promotional effort .
However , I must say that I applaud and welcome the rule giving greater political responsibility to the Commission President .
Europe needs this rule .
I also feel that the Brok report is heading in the right direction towards these objectives .
The deficit which has occurred since then was caused by the Asian crisis : Korea 's imports fell from ECU 11.7 bn in November 1997 to ECU 7.7 bn in April 1998 .
The changes observed in the last two years have been very marked .
Even in the area of trade unions , the main target of our concerns , we must undoubtedly welcome the agreement of the Tripartite Commission , which was reached on 6 February 1998 , and the specific liberalisation measures that were implemented , such as the recognition of the KCTU ( the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions ) , the authorisation of multiple trade unions at company level or even the right of sacked workers to belong to a trade union .
We will all benefit from the commitment of a strong Korea to the support announced at the Millennium Round of the World Trade Organisation .
Using partnerships between the public and private sectors or national and regional partnerships may be one solution .
Our hope that these partnerships will provide a miracle solution must not be too high as there are many projects , particularly in less-populated or more outlying areas of the EU , which will not raise any interest because they are simply not profitable .
I must also congratulate Mr Rehder for having made a left-wing speech in this sitting , which is something I do not normally expect from the social democrats , while the Commission generally talks only of the market , using highly capitalist rhetoric .
With regard to cereals , we are clearly in agreement , but not on the amount by which the price of cereals must be lowered .
Just one thing needs to be decided : who is going to assess the modulation and who is going to judge the question of the work units on each holding ?
The support for large farmers and holdings must be drastically limited and the aid to family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized holdings must be significantly increased through positive and genuine modulation .
However , I would like to ask the Bureau what procedure we can use to remove this reference .
This is the main thrust of the idea proposed by Jacques Delors , and backed by Mário Soares and Felipe González among others .
It is therefore not right for the German Government to claim that it will start the process of nominating the next Commission at the Cologne European Council set for 3 June , before the European elections !
This is essential in order to guarantee that the Commission is the independent body acting as the political driving force of the European Union and defining the Community interest , as is provided for in the Treaties .
This is to be regretted as it does not lend prestige to the role and image of this House .
Without this , there can be no European model of agriculture and no fair response from the CAP to the various European agricultural systems , which are patently very different .
It is not a prohibited or taboo subject , but the debate must take place on a different level from this one , namely on the level of financing and own resources .
You are talking about a privileged minority who , thanks to the CAP system , will apply for public funds that we should be managing very carefully
