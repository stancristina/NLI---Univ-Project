If , though , we are not to lose sight of the fact that economic growth for all trading partners is the most important goal of WTO negotiations , it naturally follows that , in offering access to this market , we must , in the negotiations , develop an adequate strategy with regard to the developing countries so that they might have a practical awareness of the advantages of negotiating on the traditional issues of market access and competition , as well as on other issues .
Mr President , Commissioner Lamy , ladies and gentlemen , in discussing the WTO negotiations in Cancun , we have a clear objective in mind .
I just wanted to ask if the Presidency of the Council might also take some action along these lines .

They can already set up airspace blocks on a bilateral basis .
The reduction of NOx emissions is , of course , what the ecopoint systems ' rules - which I have never claimed to be exactly brilliant - are intended to do .
Of course , the people of the Tyrol will defend their interests , and your opposition to them , Mr Ferber - your opposition to your Tyrolean neighbours - is something that you and they will just have to sort out together .
Mr President , attitudes close to Mr Berlusconi 's lurk all over the place , including - as these developments show - in HGV transport , which is such an important sector .

Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are all aware that overbookings , cancellations and delays are particularly frequent occurrences in the summer months that lie before us , and so the news we convey will be understood by all .
This might also mean that , in addition to the areas already referred to , indicators could also show the reliability of baggage handling and the subjective perceptions of the quality of the service that the airlines provide .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is time for support under the Marco Polo instrument to be made available to European actors in the field of freight transport ; the sense of urgency with which this is awaited is demonstrated by the large number of applications submitted in response to what was a small-scale announcement .

Mr President , Mr Duisenberg , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to add my own thanks to those already expressed to Mr Duisenberg , because , with the support of your colleagues and your committees , he has , over the last few years , managed the introduction of the euro in a way that has won growing support from the public .
