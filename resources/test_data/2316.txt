Mr President , I have listened with great attention to the speeches we have already heard .
I should like to say that , as has been pointed out , the Council wishes to help find a solution that guarantees the individual Member dignity and public respect .
Regarding the way in which such a statute is to be implemented , I must of course point out that the rules governing its implementation are set down in Article 190 , paragraph 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , in which it is stated that it falls to the European Parliament , after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council , to determine its Members ' status and the general conditions governing the performance of duties .
When the Treaty of Nice has come into force , the Council will be able to take decisions by a qualified majority and no longer only by acting unanimously , as has been the case up until now .
Even if it is the case that Parliament adopted a draft proposal for a statute on 3 December 1998 , that is to say before the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force , Parliament has since debated the new guidelines , namely in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
As is well known , the Council has not adopted a position on a number of the central features of the future Statute .
According to the positions laid down so far by the Council , there must , first of all , be concordance between the Statute and primary law , for example concerning immunities and privileges .
In my view , the statement from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market from April of this year does not fulfil all these conditions , and I can understand why Parliament 's President has been given the same message in his informal contacts with the governments of the Member States .
In conclusion , I would therefore welcome all efforts aimed at a solution acceptable to both the Council and Parliament .
It is Parliament that is to do the proposing and the Council that is to do the approving .
The ball lies in Parliament 's court .
I would call upon us now to agree to a proposal that can attract broad support in Parliament and that can attract broad enough support in the Council for its to be able to be approved in accordance with the new rules in the Treaty of Nice that will be in force by February .
Mr President , I have to describe Mr Karas 's speech as meaningless .
The answer is yes .
Moreover , I repeated what the Council has said all the time , namely that the ball is now in Parliament 's court .
I shall not go into details concerning the statement by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to Parliament 's Conference of Presidents .
The Council will not submit a detailed proposal .
The ball is in Parliament 's court .
I should like to remind you of the events of 1999 , when the then German Presidency made a great effort to arrive at a compromise .
That is something I believe the present rapporteur can remember , so we do not need to repeat it .
There must be clarity regarding the reimbursement of expenses ; there must be an appropriate salary level ; and travel expenses must be calculated on the basis of documentation .
We must have this Statute in place in good time for the next elections to the European Parliament .
It is bad if the electorate treat this Parliament with indifference .
This can be seen from the fact that they do not turn up and vote .
In that way , we are in danger of seeing a great many voters treating Parliament not merely with indifference but also with contempt , and that would be the worst thing of all that could happen .
The Council has of course given clear signals .
It must be possible for these things to be done , Mr President .
It lies in your hands and in those of your MEPs .
The reforms of our fisheries policy that we are debating this evening are very important .
On behalf of my group , I would at the same time express understanding for Mr Varela 's statement concerning oil pollution along the Galician coast .
We might well have been able to endorse maintaining public aid for the modernisation of fishing vessels if this would exclusively have improved safety and working conditions on board .
Under no circumstances , however , can we accept a continuation of the present situation , in which the European fishing fleet is becoming larger and larger at the taxpayer 's expense .
There are simply too many vessels for too few fish , and there are unreasonably large discrepancies between the ways in which the Member States have so far administered fisheries policy .
With regard to the proposed ban on cod fishing , we in the ELDR Group would like to support the conservation arrangements .
We also emphasised , however , that , when such drastic measures for reducing the quotas are being proposed , we really need to be sure of the facts , for the measures would have very far-reaching consequences for the fisheries sector not only at sea but also on land .
Research must therefore be accorded high priority , and sufficient resources must be made available .
That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to support the Commission 's proposals for reform and thus to reject the tabled amendments aimed at perpetuating current fisheries policy .
Mr President , I think that reform of the common fisheries
