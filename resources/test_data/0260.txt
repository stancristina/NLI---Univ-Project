I refer , of course , to the approval of Agenda 2000 , which was an enormously difficult exercise in terms of politics , diplomacy and the balance of interests within the Union , and to all the consequences resulting from perhaps the greatest contemporary problem , given its repercussions within the European Union itself , by which I mean the Kosovo conflict and all the circumstances surrounding it as well as its resultant consequences for the future .
Applause
I refer to the reform of institutions .
And not only I myself , on behalf of my group , but also all the other groups in this Parliament , say that this will only achieve one thing : it will obstruct the European Union .
This means that we have to respond to the problems which are worrying our fellow citizens : unemployment , Kosovo , consumer problems , the management of the euro .
Here we have to take the lead as Members of the European Union .
We must show political judgment and responsibility in order to understand what we can ask of the new Commission and in order to await and support the reform process proposed by President Prodi .
I think this should be discussed with a little more calm .
Furthermore , we should remember that if we go along the route of concessions we will never know where we will end up and we must act responsibly .
Since it is impossible in three minutes to list all these challenges - the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has said that it is impossible to list its programme - I will limit myself to a few brief observations on some particular points .
The Finnish Presidency knows that this is a disputed question and we hope it will make use of all its powers of conciliation in order that this taxation package might move forward , since it is of great importance to Europe .
We must begin a dialogue with Mexico and Mercosur .
The death sentence against Mr Öçalan must be lifted .
I was also satisfied to hear , passing on to other matters , although no less important , of its concern about the creation of jobs and improvements in the well-being of our citizens .
We must start with the freedom of people and the fact that we are all in public service voluntarily , and the ex-Commissioner cannot claim ignorance of this .
But it still holds a dominant position in the Spanish market-place and an international profile , which means that this is not a purely Spanish matter .
Since highly critical things have been said here in this Chamber , who is going to restore the honour of those Commissioners ?
Both crises were caused by the addition to animal feedingstuffs of raw materials derived from recycling and both caused serious problems for consumer health .
Nevertheless , the most serious problem arises from the fact that any ingredient which has not been expressly prohibited in the manufacture of feedingstuffs is implicitly authorised .
Furthermore , they have caused distrust amongst consumers , damaged the reputation of the European agricultural and food industries amongst third countries and caused headaches for the governments of the Member countries .
Finally , I would like to draw attention to the Commission 's chaotic information policy .
Madam President , would you please bear in mind that our group is called 'Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance ' , that it has two components and that this is a new group and should be referred to as such .
Madam President , in the event that the PPE Group and the Liberal Group present a joint motion for a resolution , as I understand it , the other proposals are automatically rejected .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , last Friday the Commission received the text of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts , which analyses the administrative management of the Commission and puts forward proposals regarding its reform .
I will not dwell on these , since Parliament is well acquainted with them and I believe they are already assigned to history .
Therefore , I believe that this is basically an analytical report .
But forty years of heritage can also undoubtedly be a burden .
This is not the time to analyse them in detail , but I would like to highlight the fact that the problems relating to the distribution of budgetary resources , the protection of the Union ' s financial interests , the fight against fraud , the management of contracts and decentralisation are matters which require solutions and responses which will demand the active cooperation of the European Parliament and also , and above all , of the Member States that make up the Council of Ministers .
Finally there are others , with a greater content and on a higher level , which will even require the reform of the Treaties and , in some cases , probably the reform of the Constitutions of some Member States .
Other issues are old and recurrent and are not innovations but a product of the realities , contradictions and also the residue of successive political commitments which are , at the end of the day , the ones which form the overall picture of the European Commission .
I believe that this is the constructive way to evaluate the results of the crisis , with a view to the future and , above all , in the eyes of the citizens .
However , apart from this shared sentiment , I am also pleased for other reasons .
It is to be hoped that now , endorsed by independent and well paid experts , they will be better treated .
Time is at a premium and I would like to highlight a couple of observations which are important , if not fundamental .
Mr
