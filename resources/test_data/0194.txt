Mr President , the Laaken Summit asked the Convention to bring the EU closer to the people .
A French sun king is leading the Convention in contravention of all the democratic ground rules .
We are unable to have proposals translated and debated .
The EU rules on transparency do not apply to Chairman Giscard d'Estaing .
He does not permit any votes that might upset his so-called consensus method , the same consensus method that he now wants to introduce , in place of unanimity , as the European Council 's form of decision-making .
Chairman Giscard d'Estaing 's draft constitution may be likened to a large removal firm .
Power would also be transferred from smaller countries to larger ones and from medium-sized countries to the largest ones .
They would be given power because of their countries ' size , not because we had elected them .
The prime ministers would , then , meet after each election to the European Parliament and divide the posts among themselves .
Mr Aznar could be made President of the Commission , or Vice-President with responsibility for justice and home affairs .
Someone else could become the EU minister of finance and economic affairs , and a third person could become supreme commander of the armed forces .
The constitution would create good jobs for outgoing prime ministers when they could no longer be elected .
In our case , 13 prime ministers could vote down 12 in the European Council , and the prime ministers of the three largest countries could vote down the 22 others in one go on the basis of what is termed their double majority , in which countries with 40 % of the inhabitants are given the right of veto .
Our democracy would be reduced to something very local .
Our national governments and parliaments would be like large , powerless local authorities in an EU writ large .
The European Parliament would obtain the right of codecision in quite a few areas , but it would not gain all the power lost by the national parliaments .
That power would be taken away from voters and elected representatives in all the countries .
The power that , in all democratic countries , resides with the electorate would , in the case of the EU , be apportioned through an inscrutable power game involving prime ministers , meetings of the Council and of the Commission and a European Parliament potentially dominated by powerful supranational party bureaucrats .
As for the electorate , it has an extremely remote role to play in the draft constitution to be debated at the Thessaloniki Summit .
Greece was the cradle of democracy , Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
I shall not , like Mr Rothley , talk in very elevated terms , but explain to him that the reason why the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to omit paragraph 5 of the resolution is simply that the Praesidium has already made a decision .
There is one particular point , however , that ought to be clarified , and I should therefore like to table an oral amendment to paragraph 5 .
At the same time , an important addition should be made : namely , where the words 'enter into force together with the Statute ' appear , I wish to propose adding the words 'and with the same validity as the latter '.
That is what I should like to propose .
.
( DA ) I consider Parliament 's adoption of the proposals in the Rothley report to be unlawful , since they would alter primary law .
Their adoption is particularly unwise , since it rejects the national taxation of European Parliament salaries and fails to put the travel scheme in order .

The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely .
