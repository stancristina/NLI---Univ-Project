Mr President , we have been unanimous in this debate .
I would like to thank those who have spoken for having given their approval of the Council 's decision to take swift action in this affair , and for their support in bringing the case to court .
In my view , it is an issue that concerns us all as it is sometimes hard for the public , as was mentioned here , to distinguish between the institutions of the Union , which means that events such as this should not be allowed to occur in any of the institutions .
Council .
I have no doubt that co-operation between us during this time will be fruitful and will serve the interests of European producers , manufacturers and consumers well .
Obviously , I might have wished that our first meeting under the Finnish Presidency had taken place in other circumstances which would have permitted me to present the actual priorities of our programme .
Unfortunately , owing to circumstances , we were obliged to give consideration to a chain of events we would never have wished for .
I fully understand why consumers expect us to take speedy , comprehensive and effective action , appropriate in terms of the gravity of the matter , to give them the necessary guarantees that the crisis will be resolved in both the short and the long-term .
It is in our own interest to take all necessary action to prevent incidents such as this from recurring .
You are well aware of the criticisms made by certain third countries that measures meant for the protection of consumers within the Union are too restrictive .
I can mention , by way of example , the recent decision by the World Trade Organisation to allow the USA and Canada to impose penalty tariffs on our exports , owing to the importation ban on hormone-treated meat .
First , the most important objective is the protection of people 's health , and second , all action must be based on the best possible scientific evidence .
In speaking of dioxin contamination , we have to say that the investigations carried out by the Belgian authorities and the inspections made by the Commission show contamination was due to the introduction during the manufacturing process of a raw material that should never have been used for this purpose .
We must act now to see that the 'prevention rather than cure ' principle is fully applied in the future .
In addition , the Commission imposed conditions on certified produce coming onto the market and on the continuance of trade in produce in national markets as well as the entire Community market .
The Commission has already sent out all the details regarding the work it has begun , so I will not repeat them here .
Turning to the action the Council has taken , I would like to remind everyone that the Ministers of Agriculture and Health have followed the dioxin crisis closely , and that they discussed the situation at the first available opportunity in meetings held in June .
The Council particularly stressed that a swift , thorough and independently drafted report should be produced and , if required , that there should be changes to current legislation .
Furthermore , the Council asked the Commission to monitor the effective and uniform implementation of these EU early warning systems and , if it was appropriate , to make recommendations regarding how they might be improved , and give consideration to how much the existing monitoring systems should be extended to cover all situations .
The Council urged the Commission to speed up the work already begun by its Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs , which re-examines the legislation on animal feed and proposes , if deemed necessary , additions and amendments for tighter harmonisation .
The Council also urged the Commission to take a critical look at EU legislation regarding the disposal of meat meal , animal waste and feed .
Anxious about the situation , the Agriculture Council in their meeting on Monday this week returned to the issue to monitor developments .
The Council made all the relevant decisions relating to procedure to ensure the speedy examination of the Commission 's proposals , bearing in mind the aim the Council has to finish the job , if at all possible , before the end of the year .
Before I end , I would like to say that the dioxin crisis has clearly shown that the effects of this type of occurrence are not restricted to the regions , or even countries , in which it began .
We therefore have to rebuild consumer confidence both within the Community and the world over and , at the same time , develop appropriate action to restore viable commercial relations .
When it is a matter of people 's health , simply the best way to reassure the European people and the consumers who live outside Europe is to act with transparency , clarity and a sense of accountability .
It was an attempt to show that certified EU exports are safe .
In fact , consumer safety is an absolutely essential aspect of an idea which has become familiar in connection with Agenda 2000 , that of the European agricultural model .
I agree , in this regard , with the comments of Mrs Grossetête and Mr Souchet on the European agricultural model .
I would like to return to two particular comments .
This theme was taken up by Mr Böge , among others .
As far as the Agriculture Ministers are concerned , the conclusions were adopted at political level in the Council in June , and now , again in terms of practical action , in the Council last Monday .
Regarding this , I would like to state very clearly that food monitoring is the
