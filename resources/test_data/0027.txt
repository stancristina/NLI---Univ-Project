of the world .
At the same time , a very large sector of the population continues to live below the poverty line .
My group is very critical of the fact that the Council has adopted a softer line on the Castro regime and that not enough support is being given to the democratic opposition , the representatives of which have twice been awarded Parliament’s Sakharov prize .
Such a partnership must be a broad one .
Individual summits are important , but they are not enough .
It was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and contains many positive and intelligent suggestions that we support .
Madam President , I believe that you will see the proof of this unity if you scan down the list of speakers a little , for it is not merely Spanish speakers who are taking part in this debate and engaging with this issue .     Mr President , the European Union’s political legitimacy is limited and dwindling .
This lack of confidence in the EU is , unfortunately , well deserved .
The instinct is to cover things up .
A majority of this Chamber appears to want to conceal unpleasant truths about the European Union from people so that the EU does not become still more unpopular .
I have found no reason for bringing the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor into question .
In the course of 2004 , the European Economic and Social Committee had problems involving irregularities in relation to the reimbursement of members ’ travelling expenses .
I want to take this opportunity to emphasise the advantages of renting buildings instead of engaging in such huge building projects ourselves .
Moreover , the internal auditor has not completed any of his investigations since he was appointed in 2003 .
The fact that the Court does not at present require judges to declare their financial interests is unacceptable .
It is therefore extremely important for there to be an open , fair and comprehensible tendering procedure .
I turn now to our black sheep , namely the Committee of the Regions which , of the ‘Other Institutions ’ examined , has attracted the most criticism from the Court of Auditors .
We have still not received any explanation of the fact that the internal auditor employed up until May 2004 was in no position to produce any auditor’s reports .
In spite of this , the Committee’s managers state that there is no question of there having been any cases of fraud .
In connection with this matter , no clear information has been given , either , of measures having been taken to claim back incorrect payments .
It now looks as if OLAF will produce its final report in the middle of May .
The Montoyer project , too , should be examined .
What is more , the Committee of the Regions ’ internal auditor was refused access to the documents he had requested in this connection .
I therefore obtained the Committee on Budgetary Control’s agreement to our questioning OLAF’s investigators and the Committee of the Regions ’ internal auditors for 2004 behind closed doors .
I did not find out why .
If Parliament still grants discharge , it will not then be possible subsequently to plead ignorance .
The only difference is that the Strasbourg issue has found its way into the media .
Because we have not had all the uncertainties clarified , I would call on you to vote against granting discharge for the Committee of the Regions ’ implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 .
As has been said , the work has , moreover , been something of an uphill struggle .
What is more , Parliament must not of course sign any contract of sale until this issue has been clarified .
It is a system with no legal basis and no provisions regarding what should be done about deficits in the fund .
It is unfair that European taxpayers should be made liable for covering deficits in the pension fund .
The system should be abolished .     Mr President , I too wish to say a few words about the report on discharge for our own Parliament , the European Parliament .
Rather , we must also resolve all the uncertainties before the issue can finally be settled .
It is not only that our pensions system has no legal basis and is not paid for out of our salaries .
Road safety is important , and this is a road safety issue .
One possible measure for saving lives on our roads is eCall .
We have also seen this in the case of disasters other than road accidents , for example in the case of natural disasters both in Europe and in other parts of the world .
This is something to which the eCall system can contribute .
These systems must , however , have their counterparts in countries ’ infrastructures so that there are people to take the calls .
Equipping cars with intelligent aids needs to be an EU strategy where work on road safety is concerned , because cars are produced for the whole of the European market .
It is enrichening to be able , as a Finn , to read the newspapers of the whole of Scandinavia , which is what we can now do thanks to the Swedish teaching we have in Finland .
It must not , for all that , be the EU’s strategy to concentrate on , for example , the five biggest languages or only the official EU languages .
In the Nordic countries and the Baltic Sea region , it is helpful to know , for example , Swedish , Russian or Finnish .
Respect for those who speak a minority or regional language is also of fundamental importance to European stability .
