As the report itself confirms , the High Representative is therefore called upon to appear before the European Parliament and to consult it frequently and regularly .
The European Union must make its presence felt with the international organisations to which it is allied , especially the United Nations , the chief custodian of global security .
Union for the Mediterranean : resolution of the Turkey-Cyprus conflict .
On the contrary , it would encourage new arrivals .
I congratulate High Representative/Vice-President Ashton , and thank her for having mentioned my report : one aspect of her approach that I particularly like is its dual nature , the way it seeks synergy between the tasks of the Council and the Commission .
For natural , historical , cultural and economic reasons , mountain regions are a model for reducing energy consumption , in line with the demands of modern life , and they lend themselves to large-scale experimentation with the use of renewable energy sources with low-carbon emissions .
Article 174 of the Treaty of Lisbon recognises the role of mountains , which is why we are anxiously waiting for an initiative from the Commission to implement this article and for a European mountain policy also in the field of energy .
We also need to invest substantial sums to establish long-term action aimed at implementing a disaster prevention strategy .
It is precisely for this reason that there are two amendments that we tabled as a group , because , in our view , they are missing in the joint resolution .
In situations like these , with widespread destruction of buildings and infrastructure , and with thousands killed , it is important to constantly improve coordination of civil protection and emergency authorities to avoid overlapping of efforts and wasted resources .
In particular , something which , in our view , is part of the heritage of mankind , namely Tibetan culture and spirituality , is disappearing .
We are also supporting - as is Mrs Andrikien- the creation of a coordinator for Tibet .
This is a battle for freedom which therefore concerns the identity of our continent .
By strengthening national synergies , it could try to establish a European coordination network for the Tibetan people who , without robust action on the part of the international community , are in danger of being wiped out .
There is , however , another important issue : the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens ' needs , to people 's needs and to changing needs .
I therefore believe that , by keeping the two PDO and PGI systems separate , they take account of the specific differences in the nature and strength of the links between the products and their geographical area of production .
I would like to thank my colleagues for the support they gave me in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I hope that the European Parliament will also give its support during the vote tomorrow .
We have already requested and shall request again tomorrow , via a specific amendment , that Parliament vote on the possibility of indicating the origin of raw materials , not only for fresh , non-processed products , but also for processed single-ingredient products ; that is , those in which the characteristic element is substantially the raw material .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen .
Why must consumers not know that they have the choice of drinking a litre of milk from Europe or a litre of milk from Brazil ?
The European Parliament will continue to fight for the protection of both farmers and consumers .
The continuing search for quality must form an essential component of the strategy pursued by the EU 's agri-food sector on the world market .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this resolution makes reference to certain principles that must not be underestimated , such as the importance of combating discrimination against the Roma people and the need to integrate this minority by means of a global strategy .
It is for these reasons that I abstained on the resolution , and dissented from my political group .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank Mr Leichtfried for his excellent work on the report on aviation security charges , which considers , among its various aspects , one important point : consumer protection and passengers ' rights .
The Committee on Transport and Tourism has approved the technical modifications examined by the legal services of Parliament and of the Council , and the Council has stated that it can conclude at first reading if we vote along these lines , which is entirely acceptable .
Recent studies estimate that , in 2018 , maritime transport will increase in the Member States from 3.08 billion tonnes in 2006 to 5.3 billion .
Why ban single-engine piston aircraft from flying at an altitude of 500 metres when the ash was above 8 000 metres ?
Perhaps the rule that was applied was the one that we aviators have known about for years , namely , that the safest flight is the one where the pilot is in the bar and the aircraft is in the hangar .
Our citizens will not forget the airport notice boards showing every single flight cancelled , the prison , day after day , that was the airport transit areas , and the interminable queues at stations , car rental companies and taxi ranks .
In this way , we would obtain that swift response to the needs of the citizens that the governments have been strangely unable to guarantee today .
For the first time , Article 174 of the treaty recognises the specific role of mountain regions , which represent 40 % of our territory and over 90 million European citizens .
In fact , this
