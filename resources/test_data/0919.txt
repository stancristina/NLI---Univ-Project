a manner because the field is so sensitive .
Should any of them fail to accept the mechanism , it would undermine the whole directive because , if at the time of implementation the conditions in the Member States and third countries were not uniform , it would be highly feasible for substantial amounts of savings to be transferred in real time .
In this regard , it would be desirable to have a European personal data centre to check all major movements of money that may have - or are just suspected of having - connections with international terrorism .
In the past the Treaty has attributed legal personality to the European Communities , but with the birth of the Union there is a legal void to fill .
We cannot , of course , pre-empt the Convention , but this resolution gives a great boost to a constitutional process to which , in our opinion , the future of a democratic Europe is bound .
The Convention must say who we are and what we want .
For this reason and also for the reasons expounded by other Members regarding the limited actual effect the measure would have on cigarette consumption , as regards the issue of smoking , it is therefore important , moreover , to preserve the research fund , particularly for agronomic research on broad-leaf tobacco , for that represents our only hope if we are to reduce the harmful effects of smoking and contribute to the right of all consumers to health too .
And this populism continues to confuse production with consumption .
As a great French writer said , although it is certainly possible to kick a habit , it is very difficult , for superhuman willpower and , above all , a great deal of time are needed .
I was therefore very pleased to vote for the motion .
.
For this directive to work effectively , it must be implemented when the third countries adopt it .
Tobacco growing plays a very important role , especially in the less favoured regions of Europe .
For the reasons given above , we say 'no ' to the under-cover gradual elimination of subsidies for tobacco growing ; we call for the current contribution levels for the research fund activities to be maintained for 2002/2003/2004 , since agronomic research is today one of the most important ways of making tobacco consumption less harmful to health ; and we support the amended report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
To pay tribute to Marco Biagi , Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , we must strive to preserve the unity between our societies and combat terrorism together ; we must strive to defeat terrorism , the unrelenting enemy of democracy .
A success too for our method and for the institutions : the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
It was the best possible start to two days of constructive work .
If we really want to bring Europe closer to the people , we must decide and act smartly .
I would also point out , however , that the opening up of the markets will be regulated to ensure that public service obligations are fulfilled .
In the run-up to the Barcelona Council , progress was also made on consolidating the interconnection of Europe 's telecommunications and electricity networks .
As I have said on a number of occasions , the time has come to capitalise on the tremendous success of the launch of the euro .
Mr President , at Barcelona , we gave strong impetus to the economic reforms that were lagging behind schedule , but we did not give those objectives precedence over the social issues .
Clearly , other actions must follow : we must never forget that our strategy spans a ten-year period .
I refer , for instance , to the extraordinary omission to talk about Iraq and the negligible attention afforded to the strategy for sustainable development .
On the other hand , there is a growing desire to address issues which are not the direct responsibility of the European Council such as how many computers schools in the European Union should have for their pupils to use in the coming years .
The abuse of a dominant position and the distortion of the market in favour of nuclear energy are currently our main problems .
The murder of Professor Marco Biagi focuses the debate on terrorism once again .
The Commission and the Council must make the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue their absolute top priority , promoting growth , employment and socio-economic structures which are more compatible with market economies .
We hope that the Spanish government , which has all the potential necessary to respond to these urgent needs , and this entire House will bring about the freedom and justice , democracy and progress compatible with human dignity as that is what we and what the citizens desire .
I do not want to undermine the decisions of the Barcelona Summit , but I feel that we are once again in danger of setting new priorities and new goals without having made tangible , incisive progress on what we had planned to do .
I am talking about the Mediterranean question .
I must say to the Vice-President , Mrs de Palacio , that this is turning into some kind of joke : after three years we still do not know what is going to happen .
Solidarity is effective if one really tries to build a different , more just society .
Many positive decisions were made by the Barcelona Council , under the Spanish Government 's lead , which we think was positive , and the results of the work carried out are also positive , although a few shadows remain over three questions
