I should also like to call for the Council meeting to express its support for the Geneva Initiative for peace in the Middle East , under which a number of courageous Palestinians and Israelis have now signed an agreement that may succeed in breaking down walls .
Returning to the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference , when the Convention chose to draw up a whole treaty , that is what it was : a choice .
Perhaps the Convention has raised the European banner so high that its feet do not touch the ground .
Above all , however , it baffles me how we can sit in this House in a parliamentary assembly – an elected assembly – discussing a constitution which will possibly not be put to the vote , on which our citizens are not permitted to take a position , and to which European citizens are not given the opportunity to give their assent or dissent .
After all , democracy is more than just democratic institutions , although that is part of it .
Democracy is also more than just free , democratic elections between multiple candidates and multiple parties , although that is part of it .
Democracy also comprises the possibility for dialogue with the citizens in the process .
They must also be consulted in the case of important events , such as the drafting of a European constitution .
That will , however , be quite some task , for example on the subject of economic policy .
We do not care for this policy , and I also hope , therefore , that the Council meeting will find a solution to this problem , so that Germany is able to solve its economic problems and we do not just have to follow rigid requirements .     Mr President , this is probably the last time we shall be meeting before the summit on 12–13 December , and I should like to warn against the Constitution that is now on its way .
Now , a large number of new decisions is to be transferred from the national parliaments to officials behind closed doors in Brussels .
Overall openness will diminish .
In essence , the electorate is having its influence curtailed .
The democratic deficit will increase , although the task was to reduce it .
The federalists in this House are clapping their hands with glee , as they themselves will obtain more influence .
The electorate and the elected representatives will be the losers .
The Heads of State or Government will be given the right to appoint those who will hold power in the EU.
Eight countries can be outvoted and their wishes disregarded .
The seven who do not hold on to power back home can then share jobs in Brussels .
The monopoly on making legislative proposals will rest with people who can no longer be elected .
The Commission can only be unseated with a two-thirds majority , and doing so will at most create a crisis .
The European Parliament itself is undergoing a crisis , with ever falling voter turnout and an inability to make the Commissioners comply with a bookkeeping law applying to every book-seller in the EU , for example .
Effective means against fraud do , however , exist , namely openness and democracy .
Thus , no Commissioner will get away with saying ‘ I am not responsible ; I did not know what was happening’ .
I should like to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party supports a strong , independent OLAF .
The time taken to deal with cases must be reduced , and the channels of communication between the Commission and the Commissioners responsible must be improved .
Mr Bösch has done sterling work in this House in relation to OLAF over a long period .
I do not think that it is Parliament’s business to determine OLAF’s internal organisation and staff policy .
It must be fully independent of all the institutions .
Nor do I think that it is necessarily a particularly good idea to give us a special legal officer for the rights of the individual .
The tasks in this field should and will be performed by the European Ombudsman .
Other things should be dealt with separately .
Finally , I should like to express my regret once again that our committee has not had a proper opportunity to debate extensive amendments to the original text of this report , and I should like to call for Parliament to support the amendments proposed by the ELDR Group , so that we , too , can support , or vote in favour of , the final report during the final vote .     Mr President , I should like to give Mr Bösch the highest praise for a splendid report , which is both penetrating and thorough , and I should like to say to Mrs Schreyer , who is my favourite Commissioner : you should ask someone else to write your speeches instead of coming out with the nonsense we have heard this evening .
There has been a great deal of criticism of OLAF of late , and rightly so , but OLAF must not be made a scapegoat for the Eurostat case , for example .
Even if a case has been forwarded to OLAF , that does not release the Commission from its obligation to act .
The secretariat of the Supervisory Committee must be fully independent of the Commission .
I telephoned OLAF about Eurostat in the spring of 2002 , after Dorte Schmidt-Brown had contacted me for the first time .
OLAF told me that it had neither the time , the inclination nor the staff to look over the Eurostat case .
In their words , Dorte Schmidt-Brown was a hysterical woman who should try to relax a little .
It is very worrying that OLAF only prioritises investigations that have the interest of Parliament or the press ,
