How many of these does the European Union have today ?
Consequently , we need to strengthen the Union 's ability to react to an influenza virus , including with a network of laboratories , mechanisms and public health resources .
I greatly fear that we are below this threshold and will suddenly find that we need to produce huge quantities .
Another question – which you can answer , Commissioner – is how efficiently the early warning and response system of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is operating and if it is connected to other Community warning systems relating to the health of animals , food , feedingstuffs and civil protection .
The Commission must basically strengthen its coordinating role and we are here , Commissioner , to give you effective support in that role .
We need a comprehensive communication strategy .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and the Members for today 's debate , both for the question and for the motion for a resolution .
The presence of avian influenza in Europe – and I shall emphasise this so that European citizens hear it too – does not affect the probability of a possible pandemic .
There is still plenty of room for improvement and further preparation , even though I acknowledge that , since we last debated this subject in the relevant committee , progress has been made on the part of the Member States and I need to emphasise that .
At the same time , we are in the process of revising our Community preparedness plan , which was adopted in March 2004 and will also take account of the national plans and the preparedness exercise which we shall carry out in a few weeks , when we shall test these plans to see how effective and efficient they are and to examine how they mesh with each other and with the relevant Community plan .
I shall be in contact shortly – now that I have a full picture of the situation in the Member States – and shall be holding new meetings with the industry , so that we can examine how they intend to resolve the production and supply problem .
As far as the pandemic vaccine is concerned , and this is my last point , we need first of all to distinguish – as Mr Trakatellis quite rightly did – between the seasonal influenza vaccine and the pandemic vaccine , which does not yet exist .
Of course , the vaccine also needs to be created in the event of a pandemic once the virus appears ; this is not possible now .
Four companies have already expressed an interest in commencing cooperation with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and I am confident that others will follow .
Thank you for your attention ; I shall , of course , listen to the debate with a great deal of interest and I am always ready to update Parliament fully because , as you know , you are the strongest allies I have in this endeavour .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a doctor I consider that prevention is the key element of the strategy .
Antivirals are also important , although I doubt if they could combat a new virus .
Perhaps there is no epidemic either .
There was the case in Thailand two months ago where the poultry farmer died , while his son fell ill but survived .
Is there a vaccine ?
Many industrialists earned a great deal of money from each drug , but the poultry farms lost .
Tomorrow we debate the budget .
The Commission , in cooperation with all the competent Commissioners , including Mrs Fischer Boel , will need to mobilise , firstly , the political safeguarding of farmers ' incomes from market crises .
The Commission and the Council must lay down measures .
The rules of sensitivity must be adhered to where cases have been identified , as must the rules of hygienic burial .
The objective of 'lifelong learning ' is to satisfy the demand of big business for flexible workers moulded for even greater exploitation .
The negative experience from the application of similar measures to higher education shows that the integrated programme is here to ram through all levels of education in every Member State .     – Mr President , Commissioner , the previous speakers have forgotten to tell us what the real situation is in Bulgaria and Romania during the accession procedure .
Even infrastructure works such as irrigation works have fallen apart .
Thus , you will buy them for nothing , for a loaf of bread .
The Romanian Government , Commissioner , has the objective today of achieving the standard of living of 1989 , which you condemned .
As wages are very cheap , this precise situation results in companies relocating to these countries , especially from the area of northern Greece , in order to increase their profits .
It is a fact that no one can contest and no one can disparage .
Issues such as the protection of the health of animals , plant health protection , the environment , nuclear safety , state aid and tax , insurance and labour dumping also cause serious economic and social problems in the Member States of the European Union .
I believe that it is in the interests of the European Union and the peoples of the two countries to remain firm in defending the strategy of enlargement and to make every possible effort to complete the procedure of the timely integration of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union .
The accession procedure will proceed without discounts , but also without new terms and with
