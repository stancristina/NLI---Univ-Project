has been declared ?
I would like the President of Parliament to explain what criteria are used to make such decisions , because , quite simply , I find them very hard to understand .
We think that there are other promises , which are only promises , that can be fulfilled , that perhaps the Commission is fulfilling , but we think that the moratorium should continue until all of this legislation is in force , Mr President .
It represents a considerable change in mentality for the business world to consider respect for the environment more as a factor of competitiveness and progress , rather than as an annoying legal obligation , in many cases at heavy financial cost and with a questionable degree of appreciation of the effort on the part of consumers .
In this last aspect there has been considerable simplification and unification of nomenclature and requirements , which will provide significant clarification of the role that EMAS should play in the European context .
I think that the European Parliament can consider the final result of the conciliation to be very satisfactory , given that the large majority of its amendments have been incorporated fully or in revised form into the joint text , and I therefore propose that it be approved tomorrow in Parliament at third reading .
Focusing on Article 2 , both the work of Mrs Emilia Franziska MÃ¼ller and that of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy as a whole provide a legal concept of a balanced food supplement .
One of the objectives of this directive is to harmonise , and the directive has been drawn up - the Commission says so - to eliminate barriers to internal trade .
Commissioner , this is not harmonisation .
We need tax incentives to facilitate the sale and use of less-polluting vehicles that are easy to use , improve traffic and are more integrated into our cities .
We therefore need to consider which are the studies aimed at offering more childcare and social assistance in the home .
Commissioner , the Lisbon objectives of bringing up the employment rates for women , a target for 2010 of 60 % can already be considered too ambitious .
Mr President , very briefly , as a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico , I should also like to express our concern that the people of El Salvador have once more been afflicted by a natural disaster , and to urge that aid should arrive as soon as possible so that what happened after Mitch does not happen again , because if aid takes a long time to arrive it is the population that suffers .
Article 4 of the proposal dealt with by Mr Swoboda should be implemented immediately .
The truth , however , is that in recent times things have not been going well in this area in Turkey , where human rights are still being violated .
Last year in Lisbon , the European Union , as Mr Bullmann has pointed out , set itself a goal which meant achieving over the next decade the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world , allowing us to achieve sustainable economic growth with the creation of more jobs and greater social cohesion .
It is true that in the way we designed them these indicators are not solely for use in the synthesis report ; they will also be used in other Commission reports , such as the report on the implementation or fulfilment of the obligations resulting from setting the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines in motion .
There is no doubt that macro-economic growth and stability are fundamental elements , but employment and social cohesion are too .
It is a fact that good progress has been made on the reforms needed so that we can maintain a model of permanent growth .
My idea is to take into consideration all these references and indications , some of which refer to specific indicators , and analyse them to see to what extent some of the elements put forward can be incorporated in our future reports .
The European Union will not give up its level of social cohesion as an economy based on well-being , which is one of the great features of European society , achieved and consolidated during the second half of the last century .
In second place is a subject that concerns me greatly and is very well expressed both in the Bullmann report and my own : employment .
Although we have a very high level of scientific training and scientific innovation , we still have not closed the gap on the United States , nor have we overcome the existing difference to achieve a kind of technological development that can be turned into competitive goods and services .
Madam President , I have voted against this proposal because of the profound contradiction that arises from the fact that this morning all the Members that have taken the floor on the proposal dealt with in Mr Swoboda 's report have directly or indirectly recognised that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria .
Even if I am told that this inequality occurs on account of the populations of these Member States , I believe we have to think about this aspect , since balanced development will not be achieved through proportionality but through solidarity .
This is a difficult subject that the Court of Auditors has come out strongly against , expressing clear reservations as to its effectiveness .
Small and medium-sized enterprises are going to be able to take advantage of this possibility of access to risk-capital , but they are also going to be the great beneficiaries in the bank ' s Innovation 2000 Initiative , especially in its support for investment in information and the knowledge-based economy .
