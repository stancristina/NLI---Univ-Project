and in a spirit of fairness .
For example , in India millions of dollars are wasted every year in the water sector on political corruption , according to Hindu.com .
Recently , studies have been published showing that merely solving the water problem could even make the situation as a whole worse if it causes population growth to accelerate , which would lead to food shortages .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mr Papadimoulis for his excellent work .
Every year since 1990 , the world has seen at least 20 weather-related events classified as major disasters , a figure which only occurred in three of the previous 20 years .
Since 1990 , according to insurance company statistics , the annual damage due to weather catastrophes has more than doubled and the compensation paid out has quadrupled .
The World Wildlife Fund recently published a study showing that climate change is adding to the number of storms that occur in Europe , mostly around the North Sea , in the British Isles , in the Netherlands and in France .
In other words , ladies and gentlemen , we have to understand that climate protection is a crucial factor in reducing the number of weather-related disasters in future .     .
The situation now is better : all the national communications are with the Commission , and in almost every Member State five directives have come into force one way or another .
This industry is developing at such a rate that new legislation is necessary to guarantee the viability and development of the market and its potential for providing employment .
For this reason , it is good that the Commission has decided to propose the i2010 strategy , which aims to create a viable common knowledge-based area .
Technology changes more rapidly than legislation , and this is why I adhered to the basic premise that the strategy proposed in my report should be as transparent as possible , and that technology should be neutral .
But who should lead this change ?
Information is transmitted , for example , between a tyre and a car , between a refrigerator and portable terminal equipment , a wallet and a key ring , home air-conditioning and a navigator .
He is a mobile source of , and a target for , information .
I just wonder when we will be starting to control him like a robot .
It has been calculated that 80 % of our national wealth is intangible , which is to say education , knowledge , administration , and just 3 % is made up of natural resources .
It is only mainly the Nordic countries and one or two others that are exceptions to this trend .
Unless we pull ourselves together , disaster awaits us .
The day before yesterday the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Europe about this change .
Is it not then time to act , ladies and gentlemen , as the Commission is also suggesting ?
My colleague , Mrs Riera Madurell , and I drafted three of them , which can be kept in the form of these summarised versions , as compromises .
Furthermore , my colleague , Mr Guidoni , has drafted a few amendments , which we on the committee voted against , mainly because of a translation error .
If members of the public do not receive information that is essential for their lives , development will not be sustainable .
This is therefore an essential matter as far as democracy is concerned .
I assume that the Commissioner has pondered this issue and I would like to hear her opinion on the subject of relevant information now , at the same time as she greets this important official .     – Mr President , I am in favour of establishing a separate , active and independent European Institute for Gender Equality .
Women are participating more and more in the labour market , and men less and less .
Within the context of the Lisbon Strategy , the equality standpoint carried a lot of weight at first , but it has been forgotten about .
As part of the legislative reforms in preparation for acceding to the Union , and with the support of the European Parliament over the years , Romania recently adopted new legislation on child protection .
The application of these provisions must be seen within the context of former abusive practices relating to international adoptions in Romania .
As to the more precise legal aspects , it should furthermore be noted that there is currently no Community legislation in the field of international adoption .
This means basically that the in the area of child protection has been implemented in Romania and Bulgaria .
We are working together with the Romanian Government in a very consistent manner .
We are in regular contact with the Romanian authorities on this issue .
In overall terms , the screening process of applications for inter-country adoptions registered before the entry into force of the new legislation is expected to be completed this month .
We expect that the Romanian authorities will inform all the applicants individually .     .
The Romanian authorities have established a working party which should finalise its work on 31 March , and the Commission is committed to a close follow-up on this issue .
I have partly responded to this question , so I will cover only those parts which have not yet been covered .
We are conducting a total of 15 expert reviews , or peer reviews , both in Bulgaria and Romania , on a number of critical issues , and this is one of the essential areas in which we are conducting this peer review , which is done by both Commission officials and the best Member State experts in this field .
