And we should accept that fact : advertising does work .
We should seek to turn the tables on them .
We should seek to ensure that the cigarette packs themselves are turned into instruments to promote health , not death .
We should follow the Canadian example and ensure that advertising is used effectively .
And the bigger the better .
Mr President , I am satisfied that there is general consensus within the fifteen Member States that legislation governing the sale , presentation and advertising of tobacco products must be fundamentally changed .
The protection of the general public health of the citizens of the Union , must be a central priority for all European Union legislators at any time .
As a result of the Amsterdam Treaty we now have an equal say with the EU governments in the area of legislation on public health matters .
Let us use it intelligently .
The issue of cigarette smoking and the damage which cigarettes do to the health of the citizens of the Union is a very serious public health matter indeed .
For the most part I support the key amendments which were passed by the Committee on the Environment last month , in their call for the warnings on cigarette packets to be larger than proposed by the Commission .
The warning about the public health risk of cigarette smoking should cover 40 % of the front of every packet and 60 % of the back of every cigarette packet sold within the Union .
Labelling requirements in general should be stricter and include fuller health warnings and the list of ingredients should also be available on request .
Descriptions such as low tar , mild and light must in future be banned .
I support the elimination of such descriptions because they give the impression that smoking such cigarettes does not damage the health of individuals as badly as other cigarettes : this is clearly misleading .
Such slick advertising by tobacco manufacturers must not be permitted .
The Committee on the Environment has also called for warnings to be printed only in black on a white background , so as to give such warnings more impact .
The committee members also consider that general warnings such as smoking kills are inadequate and I agree with this analysis .
Messages such as " Smoking kills half a million persons each year in the European Union " , or "85 % of lung cancers are caused by tobacco " should be the messages printed on cigarette boxes in the future .
Mr President , I suspect that in my group as in most others there is a wide range of views , from people who think that smoking is a matter for consenting adults , largely but not necessarily in private , to those who think that sellers of tobacco should suffer capital punishment and that those who smoke should be incarcerated in secure hospitals .
But all of us would agree that the primary purpose of this measure is to protect children and to deter them from a habit that may kill them .
The best way is not to worry about maximum levels of content but to worry about minimum levels , so that the first taste for a child is so foul that they do not seek to repeat the experience .
Certainly we should support the ban on the use of labels such as mild and light or anything that suggests that the product is safer .
The truth is that people inhale more deeply to get the taste and so can actually damage themselves more .
Such labels are deceptive and dangerous and should be banned .
Otherwise labelling is of marginal and temporary impact , whatever the picture , whatever the words , and there is some danger of a cigarette card mentality emerging , with the different messages becoming collector 's items .
The export issue is probably the most difficult .
It is one for balanced judgment : on the one hand , it is odd to say that what is not good for our citizens is okay to export to other countries ; but on the other hand , it is presumptuous of us to say what standards other countries should adopt and on balance I come down in favour of the second approach .
Lastly , we have the issue of subsidies for growing tobacco , paid by our taxpayers to people in our Europe .
It is immoral and obscene that we allow subsidies for growing something that we know will kill and will cost us billions of euros in health care for smokers .
Our governments must stop this and we must stop them supporting it .
Mr President , this was a highly controversial report within the Industry Committee which only approved its opinion by 29 votes to 26 .
The division in the Environment Committee was overcome as the major groups managed to agree a compromise .
On behalf of the Socialist Group , we support this compromise .
We reject the view that the legal basis of the report is wrong .
We support the creation within the EU of a single market in cigarette and tobacco products .
At the same time , within the limits of Community law , we would like to use the opportunity of maintaining and strengthening public health protection within the EU.
We believe that nicotine and tar levels need to be further limited and new limits should be imposed on carbon monoxide levels .
We believe that health warnings should be bolder , clearer and larger .
Nevertheless , my concern is that in some areas , our good intentions are in advance of common sense .
If we are to have a single market , surely we should have mutual recognition of the common procedures for testing .
It would be absurd to make each Member State test separately
