Thirdly , we must examine in depth what is happening in our area .
Let the misfortune of south-east Asia be a lesson .
These are measures to arm the plutocracy , which will exacerbate social and class antagonisms and bring new trials and tribulations to the people .
It is the pretext for big business to terrorise the peoples and plunder the wealth they produce .
The role of the UN is crucial here .
Fourthly , we need to strengthen the European civil protection programme more generously with resources and mechanisms .
Secondly , there is the common policy of serving and consolidating the interests of big business ; division and competition for the sharing out of markets and spheres of influence .
That is why the workers , the peoples of Europe , have no delusions about the character of the European Union and the United States of America .
However , given that , as you noted in your reply , the status of non-Muslim communities , the registration of property and the question of the training of clerics have yet to be addressed , I should like to ask you this : do you consider the progress made in this sector to be satisfactory or inadequate ?
The dismissal of 43 language teachers after 15 to 30 years ' service constitutes an unacceptable action by the Commission .
The disaster mainly hit the grass-roots classes .
This means funding for projects with a depressing economic philosophy so that the multinationals can reap the benefits of 'reconstruction' , ignoring the needs of the people .
The money raised as a result of grass-roots solidarity must not be embezzled .
They were granted for the purpose not of strengthening the economies of these countries and combating grass-roots problems , but for the purpose of control of the markets and wealth-producing resources and fierce exploitation of the peoples , with the result that these loans exacerbate the position of these countries , increase their dependence on the international imperialist centres and strengthen the position of the large monopoly groups , the multinationals , especially the American multinationals , so that they can control the markets .
They are fighting for international relations to change radically .
These developments confirm the international credibility and the huge political potential of the European Union when it acts as one to resolve important international problems through dialogue and political means .
We must continue to be constant supporters of human rights in Iran , of cooperation with civil society and of dialogue at all levels .
Communists are fighting for the brotherhood of peoples and workers the world over , irrespective of gender , race , colour or creed .
The European Parliament is again failing to take a position on the official revival of fascism in the former Baltic States , where homage is being paid and monuments are being erected to Nazi collaborators .
This is dramatic .
We want Europe to prosper , but not of course at the expense of the national borders of our country , at the expense of national sovereignty .
This is the quintessence of the common market and of the single European market .
European citizens need to have confidence in the criminal justice system , they need to be confident that their fundamental rights will be respected , they need to be confident that transparency and quality will be present in any court in the European Union .
As other countries in Europe which have faced similar corruption in their judicial system know , this is very , very difficult .
And where does the problem lie ?
However , the Commissioner 's attention should be drawn to the fact that the issues addressed in the reports by both Mr Di Pietro and Mr Costa may be a step in the right direction but they cannot be seen as a daring step .
I believe , for example , that the application of the principle of mutual recognition in the field of criminal convictions must be an immediate priority .
However , the Commissioner 's intervention today did not convince me that the Commission will proceed at such a rapid pace in this direction and that is a pity .     . – Mr President , the title , which refers to state aid for public services , is a misnomer , because this is aid for companies .
In addition , the Commission proposal comes within the framework of the capital restructurings promoted by the opening of the markets on which big business will derive even more profit , while the aspects of the proposal about exemption from approval of state aid by the European Union for small services of general interest , airlines and shipping companies , are insignificant .
We feel that it is important for the Commission to impose pluralism on the media , both at national and at Community level , by consistently safeguarding the free participation of everyone in the audiovisual media sector .
The rapporteurs , instead of replying to the foregoing , support stricter compliance with the Stability Pact , with extortionate tax and anti-grass roots austerity programmes to combat deficits .
They call for the European economy – by which they mean the profitability of the European monopolies – to be invigorated with new , harsher , more anti-grass roots austerity measures and for the workers to make greater sacrifices , for their own good , while demanding that governments reduce even the minimal social spending which remains and make immediate changes to insurance and pension systems which , as they say , are inadequate .
We have allowed the euro to become overpriced in relation to the dollar .
Thus , the expensive euro has exacerbated the recession .
While all our competitors are focusing on competitiveness and growth , we are focussing on waste and
