If Poland ' s agricultural standards quickly reach the average standards in the EU , it will just about be able to feed the whole of the EU on its own .
These are basic principles .
There is no way you can produce feed from sludge .
These sorts of crises have to be dealt with very quickly .
Mr President , cattle in England was fed with the ground carcasses of animals and foreign prions caused BSE.
In France sludge has been mixed with animal feed , which has also contained human waste , because of its urea content .
The EU and Mr Fischler , the Commissioner responsible for agriculture , are very much to blame for many problems , but the real guilty parties in these matters are the national governments .
The solution to this problem is not to establish an army of EU officials to oversee the work of farms .
Perhaps that way the illegal use of hormones will also be discovered .
Madam Speaker , I do not see much cause for drama here .
I would like to think that we could organise a small debate .
I really do not think this is much of a crisis ; debate is a good thing , but the most important thing is that we get a chance to hear this announcement in the first place .
It is thus a new process .
In order for the euro to quickly acquire the weight it deserves , not only as part of the international economy but also in discussions concerning the economic policy of the Union area , the common points of view on economic policy in the euro area in particular must be explored in more depth .
We must seize this opportunity and do everything possible to safeguard economic growth and employment development .
The best way to do this is to ensure that the benefits of a single currency and a single market are fully exploited .
The European Employment Pact , which was signed last summer at the European Council at Cologne on the initiative of Germany , is an initiative which will promote mutual understanding and a reform of the European economies .
For the first time , all the prime movers at Union level will be seated at the same table : representatives of the Council , of the Commission , of the European Central Bank and of the parties in the labour market .
The participation of the ECB is a significant feature of this .
They ensure that the independence and autonomy of the parties involved are respected .
The dialogue will be based on confidentiality , which means that there is no intention of issuing joint conclusions or passing joint resolutions .
There will be no public report on the discussions : each side will report to their own quarter on the content of the meeting .
It complements - but by no means excludes - public debate on economic policy , which takes place in any case .
Even so , we believe that the dialogue will make a positive contribution to the climate of debate surrounding the issue of economic policy .
These discussions have concerned matters of principle regarding social and economic development .
Similar practices exist in several countries .
Macroeconomic dialogue at European level cannot take the place of national dialogue , either .
In our presidential capacity , we have also wanted to make sure that this dialogue works .
The debate should not focus on the situation and problems of individual countries - the matters on the agenda concern the whole area , a joint area of responsibility .
Naturally , we have acted accordingly .
The conclusions of Cologne also emphasised the fact that the macroeconomic dialogue is perceived as a sustainable and on-going process .
Therefore , future presidents of the Council will also be taking part in the meeting , whose tasks it will be to develop and further deepen the dialogue .
Above all , it is a question of budgetary policy and determination of wages .
Still , there is no reason to paint such a sombre picture .
This is a positive way of promoting the prospects of an economic policy which favours economic growth and employment .
As part of the dialogue , we also have to improve the statistics on economic development - including wage and cost trends - and the flow of information .
Discussions must be based on facts , and it would be better still if we could agree on these facts .
Mr Speaker , first I would like to thank you for this debate .
I am obliged to confirm , however , that the European Council at Cologne very explicitly limited the number of participants in the dialogue proper , and that the country which holds the presidency of the Council cannot but comply with this restriction .
Economic growth seems to be underway , it is beginning to take shape .
It does not present itself , however , as some fundamental reduction in unemployment .
This sort of situation is very challenging .
As was mentioned earlier , the single currency has increased our opportunities , but at the same time also produced new risk factors .
Each one will have their own duties to perform , both the ECB and the social partners , but in places they are tangential to one another .
This is very much due to the fact that all participants are likely to speak about their own issues and their own area and may not necessarily be seeking joint decisions , but mutual understanding .
I am convinced that Parliament will get its voice heard , and I for one will be very happy to convey news of this debate to the dialogue next Monday .
Mr Speaker , ladies and gentlemen thank you for the
