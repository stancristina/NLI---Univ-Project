Unfortunately , the Member States are shrinking from making the decisions necessary for all this to come about .
The drafting of the directives on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision in particular has been painfully slow .
Like my colleagues , I too urge the Council to face up to the challenges of our population growth at long last and take the necessary decisions , while Spain still holds the Presidency , that would enable institutions that offer supplementary occupational pensions to operate constructively in our internal market .
Making the decisions in good time is above all in the interests of the younger generation as every wasted day increases the costs of reform and aggravates the problem .
Then it seemed that social and economic reform in Moldova was making headway despite the many difficulties and obstacles .
We have reason to fear that there is a connection between these disappearances and the country 's political problems .
We obviously hope that everything possible will be done to find the disappeared persons unharmed , and that an independent and thorough study will solve the mystery surrounding these cases .
The Moldovan Parliament must also revise its decision to abolish the parliamentary inviolability of members of the opposition and desist from any renewed suppression of that inviolability .
Poverty and sluggish social reform have led to an increase in crime and the growth of the shadow economy .
I think it is important that the European Parliament clearly states its position to the Moldovan Parliament and government , as well as the party in power there , which is what is being done in this motion for a resolution .
We in Parliament naturally wish to keep abreast of developments , and my own group supports all balanced attempts to achieve a state of peace in the Middle East .
Simply to discuss this issue from one month or one week to the next , however , seems almost grotesque .
We come here to speak to whoever happens to be listening , but do we then go away feeling pleased with ourselves , having done so ?
An optimist would say , and I am one , that from here on things can and must get better .
Solo endeavours , whether those of Colin Powell or the High Representative for the CFSP , Javier Solana , who are both held in high regard , do not produce results .
President Ahtisaari , who I know well , could hardly be accused of prejudice .
The international community must unite to achieve the only possible solution : the Palestinians must have their own unified state , whose entire area they have complete sovereignty over , and not just the whole of the land area but also the waters that surround it and the airspace above it .
Only this can be the basis of a constructive common existence built on mutual respect .
In these circumstances we are also in danger of being guilty of the same thing we accuse the governments of many countries of , which is to say a rhetorical commitment to human rights that fails , however , to lead to any purposeful and coherent action being taken .
We must find this political will in our own institutions , in Parliament , the Commission and , first and foremost , in the Council of Ministers , which has shown little but uncertainty and only now and again given a credible performance in the Human Rights Forum , which Mr Van Hecke once again reminded us of , to his credit .
Instead of merely praising and filing away Mr Van Hecke 's excellent report - and that also goes for most of Mrs Díez González 's report , which I think is very worthy of our support - we should for once take our own words seriously .
We have not done that .
For that reason I hope we shall for once take Mr Van Hecke 's report , and much of Mrs Díez González 's report also , seriously and undertake the relevant work accordingly .
The Supplementary and Amending Budget before us includes two important matters : the new basis for collecting the own resources , and carrying over last year 's surplus to cover this year 's budget .
It will particularly benefit the EU 's net contributors .
Germany 's annual contribution will fall by around EUR 847 million , that of the Netherlands by EUR 505 million , and that of Sweden and Austria by around EUR 140 million .
The decision shows how sensitive an issue EU contributions are in terms of internal policy , because they only represent around 1 % of GDP.
Last year EUR 6.5 billion of these funds remained unused .
The procedure whereby decisions are taken is confused and vague .
If the budget were so poorly implemented in any Member State the government would fall straightaway .
The Commission must therefore really make more of an effort .
Madam President , I would like to congratulate the Commission on having persuaded the Member States at the Barcelona Summit to commit to the target for common development cooperation finance for the first time in history .
It is surely the case that the countries that have reached the 0.7 % target for GNP - Sweden , Denmark , Luxembourg and the Netherlands - will not pay any more before they see the countries that are lagging behind take responsibility for their share too .
How do you intend to accomplish this ?
I would ask other groups to support this target , on which we will shortly be able to vote .
I want to say that Mrs Malmström is absolutely right when she says that transparency can and must extend from Finland to Greece ; this really is no longer just a Nordic concept
