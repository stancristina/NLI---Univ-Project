Member , he will want to put down questions or make representations on that specific basis .
If and when he does - and I am answering the question - I will give him the basis for a scientific view of what the consequences of the use of depleted uranium are in those circumstances .
He will understand , however , that without notice of that question I am hardly in a position to give him the detail that he would want on the specific environmental questions that he raises .
I am certain that he would not , as a responsible Member of the European Parliament , want to contest serious scientific opinion or indeed be alarmist in a way that would be upsetting to his constituents .
The honourable Member is correct in stating that the proposed amnesty law , which is still only a proposal before both the Serbian Parliament and the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , will not cover anyone convicted of offences considered to be acts of terrorism .
The European Union has already repeatedly called for the release of all Albanian Kosovar prisoners .
The EU ministerial troika which visited Belgrade on 8 February also expressed concern at the fact that the proposed amnesty law will not cover all those convicted of political offences by the Milosevic regime .
The Commission has been fully involved in these initiatives , and the European Parliament 's ad hoc delegation , which visited from 8 to 10 February , also raised this issue in the relevant quarters .
The Serbian and federal authorities have indicated their intention to urgently re-examine the cases of those not covered by the law , particularly to ascertain whether the convictions are sound or not .
As of today , the prisoners have still , regrettably , not been released .
The EU will keep up the pressure to ensure that they are .
I certainly understand the instincts of and the rationale offered by Mr Staes , and not for the first time .
I can give him the assurance that all influences and all means of representation are being employed in the most forceful possible way in order to try and secure the outcome that the Commission , the Union generally and Members of this House - including Mr Staes - want and that would be consistent with humane and just treatment .
The Commission , however , is not disposed , certainly at this juncture , to contemplate the possibility of sanctions of various kinds , including the ones suggested by the honourable Member , simply because the Commission is making its contribution and its commitment on behalf of the Union in full knowledge of the dire needs of people and organisations in that area .
We very much hope that by using the means that are currently being employed we will , without great delay , secure the outcomes which will serve the interests of humanity and be consistent with the views continually expressed by the Union , the Commission and this House .
Whilst I have absolutely no reason to doubt the figure given by the honourable Member , there are different estimates .
The official estimate of the number of prisoners affected in this specific area and this specific instance is 300 , rather than 700 .
The point that we continually try to make in our representations is that regardless of the precise numbers there is a principle of humanity to be followed , and we want to see it applied without any further delay .
However , whilst I understand the argumentation over the legal base , we would be further complicating an already delicate situation if we were to seek to act in a peremptory fashion or advise others - including the United Nations - that they should do that .
Clearly there is less patience now than yesterday , and there was less yesterday than last week .
That feeling is being strongly communicated in the relevant quarters .
But it would be irresponsible and misleading of me to indicate that we are going to make any major departure from the course that we have followed and have every reason to believe we can produce a successful and humane conclusion .
Could I briefly ask the Commissioner if he can be specific now on an issue many of us , including Mrs Hulth√©n , have raised with him before , that is the potential dangers of plastic inedibles which are given away with sweets and other things and which are not a foodstuff .
They are a plastic , but they are not really designated as one or the other .
Is he confident now that these substances are actually safe for children ?
Mr President , I am very grateful to the honourable Members for their questions about my correspondence with my friend and former colleague , Mrs Anita Gradin , and her former chef de cabinet , Mr Christer Asp.
The questions enable me to report publicly and fully to this House on an issue that I know has aroused interest particularly in Sweden .
On 13 November 2000 Danish TV broadcast a documentary programme in which statements were attributed to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp that appeared to relate to an employee of the Commission who had been unanimously acquitted of specific charges by the last Commission after due disciplinary process had been followed .
As a result of that broadcast , and as Commissioner responsible for Personnel and Administration , I was obliged to write to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp on 22 November to request confirmation and clarification of the reported remarks , in order to enable the Commission to establish whether or not the remarks in question would require any action by the Commission .
That was the sole purpose of the letter
