I hope that we will not have to have a third reading , but we may have to just to make it absolutely clear that these automatic stays would not affect netting contracts , repo contracts and contracts in a regulated market .
I would appeal to the House that in some ways it is more important to get a clear answer than to get one that suits everyone ; one that is absolutely perfect in every respect .
Because with a clear answer people can arrange their transactions around the framework that we have set up .
It is vital to do that .
I applaud the work that Mrs Peijs has done and I hope that we have finally sorted this issue out .
I just have certain worries about the automatic stays and suspect that we might need some fine-tuning at a later stage .
The other controversial issue involves right in rem and the difference between the common position and the tidying up operation that Mrs Peijs has done , and this is something we have discussed at length .
In essence , there is a lot of common ground between what the Council proposes in the common position and the alternative wording that Mrs Peijs has proposed .
I am inclined to think , in view of the uncertainty , that it may well be worth sticking to the common position on that particular issue , because of the potential threat that it might pose to the mortgage bond market .
This is not a strategic interest to me as a British MEP , because it does not affect the British market in any way - it is much more important for the Danish , the Austrian and the German mortgage market .
I would congratulate Mrs Peijs on her work .
It is a very good report .
There are still one or two small points of controversy in it , but she has done an excellent job .
I apologise for the confusion we have had in committee over the voting and I am glad that it has all been resolved now .
Mr President , I do not feel that I will need the full five minutes , hopefully this will allow you to speed up proceedings tonight .
I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Peijs as rapporteur on this report which , as Mrs Villiers has already outlined , has been extremely complicated .
The issue has long been problematic , mainly because of the national differences at governmental level , rather than the issues directly originating from Parliament , but compromises produced in Parliament have been both efficient and expedient in terms of their approach and are very welcome .
In an effort to provide for equal treatment across the EU , the principles of unity and universality are the central pillars , of course , of this report , and coherence and consistency are therefore attained .
Similarly the rights of creditors in Member States other than their own are safeguarded by the assurances of cooperation between the relevant authorities in the Member States , but let us be clear , in case some of you have not read the document , this is not about harmonisation , it is about mutual recognition of Member States ' reorganisation measures and winding up procedures .
Parliament 's success in introducing substantial changes in the original proposal is important .
There are many in Parliament who feel the issues here are of real concern since they all concern the safeguarding of European citizens ' interests and rights ; indeed this report helps clarify many of the elements , such as the deposit guarantee scheme .
But , of course , many of the changes in the common position which finally came back to us have to be welcomed , as they reflect many of Parliament 's concerns , although some work has still to be done .
It is therefore sensible for Parliament , whilst accepting the improved document 's intentions , to reimpose our priorities from the first readings but to organise and also clarify the suggestions emanating from this text .
Amendments Nos 1 and 2 bring the text into line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals which had already been agreed last summer : this confirms Parliament 's desire , therefore , to see a degree of coherence in this matter .
I also see great strength for creditors in Amendments Nos 3 , 5 and 6 while recognising that other national delegations , especially in my group , may have other concerns in this area .
But I personally offer my support to the idea of bringing this directive in line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals .
It seems to me that , finally , in the remaining amendments , following in the tradition of tidying up texts for the purpose of clarification , Parliament 's rapporteur has maintained the type of quality we have come to expect from experienced Members .
Whilst issues such as netting seem to have been slotted in as an extra series of amendments , what we have here is a workable document nonetheless , capable of securing support in the House and provoking serious discussion within the Council .
Mr President , it is clear that improving the quality of legislation is essential to the effective functioning of the internal market and to increasing the competitivity of the European economy .
So we all welcome the SLIM initiative , but we must all share the rapporteur 's reservations about how it has worked so far .
There are surprisingly few areas which have been subject to the SLIM process and it is not always clear why those particular areas have been selected .
We need , without a doubt , a fast-track procedure to turn SLIM opinions into legislative proposals , because it all seems to take rather
