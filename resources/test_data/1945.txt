countries to feed soldiers rather than starving children .
Of course we must do everything in our power to alleviate famine .
However , where countries are at war , all our aid must be humanitarian and channelled through NGO organisations to ensure that aid goes to the starving people and not to the war front .
We must watch the situation in Eritrea and balance humanitarian aid there , if required .
We desperately want these two countries to sign a peace agreement through the efforts of the OAU so that we can resume full development aid to both countries .
I recently spent a week in both Ethiopia and Eritrea .
I visited refugee camps in both countries and saw for myself the hardship and the poverty people are suffering .
It is not true to say that Ethiopia has not been crying for help for food aid over the past two years , but the war situation has blurred the vision of many looking on .
When I was there they were pleading for help .
I saw children with serious malnutrition and in need of health care , as well as food and proper shelter .
I saw families living in caves , the walls running with water , and listened to the hacking coughs of children racked with fever .
It looks bad on TV ; it is a hundred times worse when you stand amongst it , when people are in such dire situations .
However , I saw food aid being delivered in Eritrea by German NGOs to a camp of 16 000 people , spread over 7 kilometres in case of bombing raids .
I watched two strong men lifting 50-kg bags on to women ' s backs and saw them stagger off to their plastic shelters kilometres away .
I saw children aged eight walking eight kilometres out and eight kilometres back to get water .
They were the lucky ones : they were the ones with food .
We never seem to learn a lesson from the past .
It should not be TV cameras and pop stars who alert us to starvation and drought : there should be a proper monitoring system in the sensitive areas of the African continent .
Perhaps this could be built into Commissioner Patten' s rapid reaction unit we heard of yesterday .
We must have action and we must have action decisively and urgently .
Mr President , misery and death in Ethiopia were on our screens four years ago .
The cameramen left but misery and death did not leave Ethiopia .
Starvation and death continue today .
The population of Ethiopia pray for rain .
Sadly they see only a rain of bullets .
People crave water , food and medicine .
Sadly all they see is their land and their homes blown to pieces by the tanks and planes our governments supply to the Ethiopian and Eritrean politicians .
These politicians are hungry for power : politicians who argue over territorial boundaries whilst their people die .
These politicians fly their national flags on their parliaments and presidential palaces , but sadly the only flag their people see is the flag of death .
Famine , disease and death remain the hallmarks of these countries .
Hunger for power must not be allowed to override the hunger for life .
Mr Patten has listed a number of measures the EU has taken to help .
Such help has been received with gratitude , but let us put it into perspective .
Sixteen million people are starving today ; 15 000 tonnes have been delivered .
I accept the difficulties of the logistics but that means less than a kilo per person .
No time limit is given , in other words it is a kilo that has to last forever .
These measures are palliative .
They only relieve the symptoms ; they do not cure the disease .
The EU must take the lead in curing this serious problem and the only way to do it is firstly to stop arms reaching all the warring parties and make sure we use our influence with those who supply them ; and secondly teach these people how to grow food and harvest , store , package and process it so that they can be independent and self-reliant , not beggars for life .
Mr President , could I ask the President-in-Office of the Council - all of whose good intentions for a multi-ethnic Kosovo I accept - whether he would not admit that the international community ' s policy there in all its facets - the European Union , the United Nations , KFOR , NATO et al - is really an unmitigated and disastrous failure and getting worse by the day .
What is being done to get the KLA and the Albanian bully-boys , who clearly have no interest in a multi-ethnic Kosovo , under control ?
There just seems to be an ineffectual permissiveness of the situation despite all these wonderful , pious good intentions .
Mr President , as medical advances contribute to a steady ageing of our populations , the burden of pension provision throughout the Union becomes ever more costly .
In the UK, as in the US , Chile and Singapore and , to a lesser extent , the Netherlands , the burden on the state and succeeding generations has been significantly eased through the successful provision of supplementary second and third pillar private and occupational pension schemes , involving funds which grow to provide pension benefits following the retirement of the individuals .
Both pillars have the advantage of being resistant to demographic change , and third-pillar portable schemes , in particular , which are not restricted to single companies , enhance labour mobility and choice for the investors and are much more affordable to small and medium enterprises .
