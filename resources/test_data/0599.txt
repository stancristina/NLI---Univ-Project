invoked and established on a number of occasions as one of the fundamental rights of the European Union , with the complex issue of immigration , which is , in any case , a different subject and should be addressed quite separately .
This is certainly an extremely complex issue in legal terms , but I am glad to say that a major debate is developing on the matter with endeavours being made , first and foremost , to define the appropriate legislative instruments and identify the appropriate financial resources to secure what should be the basic right of a crime victim : to receive proper compensation for suffering and damages inflicted , especially where there is no perpetrator of the crime in that the author is unknown or is not in a position to provide the victim with compensation .
It will certainly be no easy matter to identify minimum standards , for two reasons .
In practice , a situation is created where there is real disparity between the treatment people receive , which varies according to the country in which the crime took place , and this is a blatant violation of the fundamental principle of non-discrimination .
Therefore , other internal cases are to be covered by the directive as well as cross-border cases .
However , the political and social importance of a directive of this nature would - and , indeed , does - justify Parliament 's appeal to the Council to take this step .
Here , we have the primary task of identifying the political objectives which will further the genuine development of the Europe of the citizens , the Europe of equality of justice for all .
Therefore , the process of examining this report must be brought to its normal conclusion ; in other words , the report must be put to the vote in Parliament .
In conclusion , the Community initiative on compensation to victims would indeed be a major contribution to the creation of a European area of freedom , security and justice .
Then , a little further on , still by the sea , I saw a horribly ugly , uninhabited area where there was a steelworks that had been deserted for 10 years .
Because I had met a GMO who said to me - none of us know what GMOs look like - that he , in his turn , had dreamt he was Ulysses , tied up so as not to succumb to the temptation of the sirens , and that he had seen a beautiful GMO - resembling Mrs Wallstr√∂m - which called to him : ' Follow me , follow me and you will be happy . '
Mr President , last Thursday , I was taking part in a television programme in Milan .
I therefore call for this initiative to provide compensation for the victims of crimes to proceed and for public officials who do not do their job properly , especially the most influential , high-level politicians and administrators in our States , to receive heavy fines .
What a beautiful lady Mrs Roth-Behrendt is !
The European Commission is not the only one with responsibility in this area : a great deal of responsibility lies with the Member States too .
I would like to focus , in particular , on two issues .
I would rather not return to the subject of the RALs because time is lacking and because none of us wishes to hear information which we know to be completely unviable financially but which , nevertheless , is produced year after year in the budgetary procedure .
After the December Council , which will have to establish which and how many States are to enter the European Union in time for the European elections in 2004 , the Commission should present a proposal for revision of the financial perspective , a proposal which the two arms of the budgetary authority will have ample time to adopt - in accordance with Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement - before the start of the 2004 budgetary procedure .
I have seen the document , the communication sent to us by Commissioner Schreyer and Commissioner Barnier - for which I thank them - and I am afraid that it may well be a little too optimistic .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Smet , on my own behalf and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on her excellent work and on her supreme willingness to take into account the wealth of suggestions made during the debate in committee .
In any case , these studies reveal a pyramid structure , in which about 40 % of the total number of trade union members are women , and the percentage falls to less than half that figure the nearer one gets to the decision-making structures at the top of the pyramid .
There is even less information available regarding employers ' organisations .
It is therefore necessary , as Mrs Smet 's report calls , for the European Commission to make a start on the compilation of data and the establishment of a database relating to the representation of women among the social partners so that indicators can be established with a view to increasing the influence exercised by women in decision-making bodies , to create a database relating to the results of collective bargaining in the context of equal opportunities and to use it for the dissemination of best practice , and to urge the social partners to create networks among women negotiators and women administrators with a view to their exchanging experience and expertise and , in their employment policy , to develop further the role allotted to them in the promotion of equal opportunities .
