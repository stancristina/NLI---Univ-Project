order to allow the economies to grow together harmoniously .
We must ensure that the people there do not experience enlargement eastwards primarily in the form of lost jobs and closing businesses .
The competitiveness of their own country is at stake , irrespective of whether or not they join the EU.
The energy mix will no longer be the same .
But one thing is certain : the remarkable efforts and absolute determination of the candidate countries to join the European Union must be incentive enough for us to get ready and able to enlarge .
But there is no point in running scared ; the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development takes the view that , if we estimate pre-accession aid correctly , we can do it .
Obviously that is out of the question .
On balance then , we have nothing to fear , but we must reform , otherwise accession will not work in the agricultural sector .
The TINA report covers these prospects .
As a result , we can now take up a coherent position for the European Parliament which is supported by all political groups .
As far as I am concerned , it is out of the question to have to use additional resources from category 8 from 2002 as part of the pre-accession strategy here .
Enlargement is basically a challenge for the EU itself to reform and an opportunity to steer the social , employment policy and democratic aspects of European integration as a whole .
We therefore call upon the rapporteur , the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy section with the fisheries policy section , for example by changing the title 'Agricultural Aspects of Enlargement ' to 'Agricultural and Fisheries Aspects of Enlargement ' .
Now , all hopes and expectations are pinned on France .
It would be a good idea if Poland were to request an increase from SAPARD , and perhaps a modification too , in order to tailor these funds more effectively to the conditions , in Poland in this case , but the same applies to the other candidate countries .
For years now , we have had links with these countries through the Tempus programme , and likewise , for a year and a half now , they have been entitled to participate fully in the educational , cultural and exchange programmes for young people .
The third form of communication I wanted to discuss is that within the candidate countries .
Incidentally , the French farmers and all their counterparts will still be there , before and after every election !
The small and medium-sized enterprises must be the main beneficiaries of economic diversification .
We should therefore take this opportunity to think about sending out a signal .
Annual reports from the Commission allow us to follow the implementation process .
As well as giving enlargement unequivocal support , I would stress that it should take place as soon as possible .
However , in common with our rapporteur , Mr Wuermeling , I believe that it would not be in the interests of either party to the treaty for there to be no transitional periods , and being a delegate from a border region , who , like Mrs Schierhuber , owns a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border , it is a matter of concern to me that the formation of close , common economic areas should be managed without any major problems , and lead to a positive outcome on both sides .
The fact that there has been a reunited Germany in the European Union for ten years now , bears witness to the solidarity between us .
It is therefore all the more important that equal treatment for men and women should be incorporated into the acquis communautaire as a fundamental human rights issue , and that establishing the necessary institutions in this sphere should be a crucial precondition to the implementation of the acquis communautaire .
It is true that we are motivated by moral considerations , but we are also committed to enlargement owing to deeply held political convictions .
Mr President , as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I am delivering this opinion for Mrs Auroi , who drafted it for the committee .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we want to guarantee the safety of animal feed and human foodstuffs , and to that end we need a workable European regulatory framework .
Farmers have a right to flawless animal feed .
But it is not the answer simply to permit blending .
We all want the same thing and we have to say this very clearly here in Parliament .
With today ' s analytical methods , Commissioner Byrne , any recipe is as transparent as can be .
What we are discussing so fastidiously is not going to be changed here .
Then we would hear the most specious of arguments - it was impossible to prove , it was too difficult , it would distort competition - all the things we are hearing again today .
The same applied to protein .
That entails a host of measures .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there is a proverb which says that good things come to those who wait .
The PPE-DE Group approves Amendments Nos 1 to 5 but cannot support Amendment No 6 .
We believe that complete transparency for farmers is essential .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a surfeit of scandals has shaken public and consumer confidence .
The second is to restore consumer confidence in European food products after the BSE crisis and the dioxin scandal .
This means that they had not been allowed to exercise their rights of free speech and freedom of assembly
