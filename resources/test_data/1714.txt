Health has to take priority over political or economic compromises . ?he programme to replace sectoral and fragmentary Community action on health with an integrated programme on 1 January 2003 is based mainly on preventing disease and helping to establish quality standards in the public health sector .
I should like at this point to summarise briefly the work done in the Conciliation Committee , which basically improves on the text and the Council 's common position .
In addition , a Commission declaration on article 7 - related to the funding - foresees that the financial framework will be reviewed in the context both of the accession of new Member States and preparations for the revision of the financial perspective .
I believe that reinforcing the foundations of the European structure requires convergence not just at economic policy level but in individual sectors such as health .
I think that , on this point , we have achieved a compromise which guarantees that the programme will be implemented properly , in line with the approach taken by Parliament in its amendments .
The European Parliament proposed the sum of EUR 380 million and I think the Council should have accepted this , given that much of this money has already been spent on programmes already running until the end of 2002 .
Similarly , the new programme will apply not just to the fifteen Member States , but to the ten new Member States as well .
However , I do welcome the fact that the Commissioner responsible , Mr Byrne , has promised to review the financial framework once the new Member States have acceded .
Mr President , Mrs Van Lancker 's report deals with an issue of particular concern to the Committee on Women 's Rights and my political group and to each of us individually .
We engaged in an up-to-the-minute dialogue between the political groups in committee and representatives of European society and we agreed that these issues are vital to today 's European citizens , especially women .
When I and my colleagues in the Committee on Women 's Rights visited Poland , we all stressed how important it is to engage in dialogue on women 's rights at all levels and in all spheres of life and for policies to develop and adapt to new social and historic circumstances and Europe is not going to come along and reduce national ideologies , customs and conscience or cultural differences to the lowest common denominator .
Mr President , I think that Mrs Van Lancker deserves our warmest congratulations and praise for taking the initiative on this important report , which has opened up a dialogue and highlighted a problem which goes right to the heart of the rights and fundamental freedoms of half the world 's population .
On the pretext of protecting life , they basically propose criminalising abortion and incriminating women and even prosecuting them under Portuguese standards .
But apart from women 's health and rights , should we not be ensuring that children are born into an environment in which they are welcome , so as to safeguard their proper mental , physical and spiritual development ?
The ECB policy of raising or lowering interest rates , shadowing interest rate policy in the United States , is basically dictated by the need to fund speculative projects which , objectively speaking , result not just in unproductive investment , but in "scams " such as the stock exchange scams for which thousands of redundant workers and thousands of duped investors have paid and are still paying the price .
A large majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with this approach , which is why we should adopt it unanimously .
Problems have arisen in practice , as has the question of international jurisdiction and applicable law , which is why jurisdiction clauses referring to offshore jurisdictions or simply to jurisdictions other than in the place in which the property is situated should be banned , as should clauses referring to the law of a third country .
I have nothing further to add .
I just want to ask you one more thing : do we perhaps have any information as to when this saga will come to an end , for better or for worse ?
Is there any news since Seville ?
I put it to you , Mr President , so that you can put it to the Bureau .
What I should like to know is , does the Council see this sort of threat , this sort of criminalisation , as falling inside or outside respect for rudimentary political rights ?
At the same time , many countries , such as Greece , which perhaps has the highest percentage of immigrants , apply practices which are crude , barbaric infringements of immigrants ' fundamental human rights .
Mr President , may I congratulate and thank Mrs Figueiredo and , of course , the Committee on Women 's Rights as a whole for their most welcome support , their proposals and , of course , their criticism .
So may I remind you of what has been done so far : first , the strategy on employment contains one of the four approaches to gender equality .
Nonetheless , we have seen a net improvement year on year under the strategy on employment .
A second issue raised by a number of honourable Members is the Institute .
As you know , we commissioned a study and have already received the results ; we have scientific confirmation of the need for this Institute and an initial estimate of its budgetary requirements and financial conditions and I have already been in correspondence with the President .
No Member State has yet spoken out against the Institute .
I should like to reassure you that I for one shall be taking decisive action to
