On one point , however , the proposal is deficient , and that is in relation to the decision-making centres .
How many are there , and which are they ?
Italy ’s energy needs are therefore strongly dependent on oil , which comprises 45 % , and gas , comprising 32 % .
For its part , the European Union has in recent years put in place policies such as strategic cooperation with Russia , the Euro-Mediterranean partnership , the Neighbourhood Policy and the agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council .
By how much ?
In the energy field some countries have gone beyond the monopoly philosophy but others have not .
Enough of asymmetry , enough of rogues .
In short , we must speak with one voice – will we be able to do this ?
Instead , we ought to have made financial provision for the major structural reforms required of the ACP countries within the framework of the EPA negotiations .
Mr Winkler , reducing the proposed allocation for the EDF is not a positive signal for our global partners , particularly the ACP countries , at the very moment when it is clear that the millennium goals are very far from being achieved .
The phrase is very emphatic , but it actually seems that the European Union , and this is a euphemism , is placing too much emphasis on the effectiveness of trade in the fight against poverty .
These principles are almost present in the report , partly because these are the requests of the ACP countries , and it is those countries that are putting them forward .
The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly also has the power to set development indicators in order to assess the achievement of results and trade agreements , requesting that social and environmental indicators be included such as the creation of dignified work , health , education and gender equality .
We ought always to remember that in order to be successful and have a positive impact on the social fabric of developing countries , effective integration and economic growth must necessarily be accompanied by an improvement in people’s general living conditions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as the Commissioner said just now , in September 2005 the Commission submitted a first annual report on the state of progress of European contractual law and the review of the Community .
This is a process of regulation and knowledge which will be able to go beyond the law in force in order to form a modern code : there was even an idea that we might achieve a uniform code of contractual law , formulated through principles .
For my part , the issues that I wish to highlight are the two major challenges facing us : firstly , an ageing population for whom we want to ensure the best possible , dignified old age and , secondly , a low birth rate .
We want the right balance to be restored in our continent between the expectations of women and those of our countries .
New tax policies , extensive employment opportunities for women , the opportunity to enter the job market and undoubtedly a new and different quality of services are therefore needed .     .
The report by Mr Bushill-Matthews – whom I thank for his customary diligence – rightly talks about solidarity between the generations .
We all need to be aware of and sensitive to this issue .
In order to keep a check on the immigrants , Malta employs 10 % of its police force , which would amount to employing 30 000 people if it were Italy or 40 000 people if it were Germany ; in other words , all of the law enforcement personnel put together .
We are making the people of Malta regret what they have done , even though they do not want to , since Malta is a resolutely pro-European country .
I hope that this Parliament gives all due support to this great , ancient and noble nation that is suffering because of mistakes that we have made .     .
In Malta , even refugees from war zones , in particular Darfur , are being refused asylum .
It is only at this level that we can ensure genuine competition on the European market among European champions , not national champions .
The wealthy countries ’ request that the developing countries ’ tariffs be abolished or greatly reduced will further accentuate the negative trend for those regions .
I therefore hope that Europe can defend this position within the new negotiations and work hard to conclude the agreements by the end of 2006 , since a further failure would weaken the entire system and give rise to serious consequences , especially for developing countries .
I am also pleased that the country-of-origin principle has been removed and that the new document on the posting of workers has been drawn up .
It is a slow procedure that provides for relatively inadequate sanctions : in order to arrive at a positive solution for the implementation of Community law by the Member States , the procedure often leaves much to be desired and takes a very long time .
At the same time , Article 228 has only been invoked twice : once for the Greek waste discharge case , which was suspended after a very short time , and once for the Spanish bathing water case , which was withdrawn at the last minute because of an issue that the Commission itself admits is rather dubious from a legal standpoint .
That , however , is an obvious message .
I shall give you an example , Mr Barroso and Mr Verheugen : a letter from UNICE was all it took to drastically cut back the air quality strategy , despite a EUR 2 million impact assessment that said that the costs to consider were not only
