, as you know , these installations are very dangerous - what is stopping you from setting a date for the closure of reactors 3 and 4 ?
It is unacceptable for pollution to be transferred from the air into water and the ground .
Treating dangerous and non-dangerous waste in the same way therefore exacerbates the problem .
Mr President , my first report as an MEP was on precisely the same topic as that which we are discussing here today : the environment and the Structural Funds .
At the same time , however , we should avoid over-reacting .
Rather , I am suggesting that we go ahead and implement the programmes and , at the same time , monitor the implementation of legislation and ensure that the Commission keeps Parliament informed .
I should just like to draw your attention to paragraph b and point 3 and 8 of the resolution which takes account of precisely this issue .
We need , once and for all , to come out and say what is happening in the Member States , because transparency , courage and the truth are the best policy .
We saw a huge wave of refugees and , at the same time , we watched hospitals and embassies being bombed and unarmed civilians becoming the war targets , while the Balkan peninsular will pay the price and suffer the painful consequences of the ecological disaster caused by the bombings for years to come .
There has been a dramatic increase in the number of abortions .
Women are dying due to a lack of rudimentary medical care in clinics which have no electricity , heating or water .
Mr President , what concerns us in particular is the hypocritical and selective manner in which human rights are applied during the exercise of the European Union ' s external policy , especially as a pretext for justifying intervention , including military intervention .
Furthermore , the policy being exercised by the European Union at home basically violates a series of fundamental human rights .
We call on the people to step up their fight to stop their self-proclaimed saviours trampling on the rights for which they have fought hard and made sacrifices , and to reverse the current trend , which only serves the interests of those who are exploiting them .
Our action to foster respect for human rights and create a fair society of creative coexistence therefore needs to be examined against a backdrop of policies and measures which seek to improve economic and social conditions for everyone and combat unemployment , poverty and social exclusion .
At the same time , the mass media need to help fight prejudices and to demonstrate the beauty of modern multicoloured , multicultural society .
Speculative working capital would be taxed , tax havens would be abolished , fraud and tax evasion would be combated , wealth and income would be redistributed for the benefit of labour , state aid would be controlled , restructuring , merger and relocation grants which result in mass redundancies would immediately be suspended , and better social protection based on solidarity and independent of commercial and financial interests would be introduced if employment really were the European Union 's main concern , rather than how to 'sweeten the pill ' in order to deceive workers and limit social reaction to its anti-labour and anti-grass roots economic and social policy .
The victims of long-term unemployment and social exclusion , and there are over 60 million of them , and European workers as a whole , have no intention of showing themselves to be 'mutually supportive ' , 'adaptable ' , 'docile ' and 'cooperative ' in their choices , as you will have them be .
Human rights issues spearhead and underpin the development of Europe .
And yet we have an ally , America , in which the death penalty both exists and is used .
In particular , Mr Belder ' s report on candidate countries is a very good report and I hope that , in the end , it will be even better .
Turkey - The Commission report notes no progress on the fundamental Kurdish issue .
In short , Turkey still fails to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria .
Apart from that , the fingerprinting system per se has negative associations with criminal investigations by police authorities and criminal offences .
However , I think that the best thing the European Commission and the Council can do is to institute a common asylum and immigration policy based on European humanitarian and democratic values and respect for human rights .
The point is whether or not a country has the right to decide its fate and choose its government .
Mr President , that is what is being done with the barbaric bombing , that is what is being done with the fuel embargo on Yugoslavia .
Mr President , the reply by the President-in-Office puts me in mind of the reply by Pontius Pilate .
The point at issue , to get to the crux of the matter , is a transaction between two Member States of the European Union and the Council of Europe cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that Germany is clearly using its power to refuse to honour its commitments .
Other countries have been paid .
Germany has acknowledged its obligation from time to time .
Unfortunately , the precise opposite has happened in the agreement with Mexico .
In other words , with a population of 90 million Mexicans , we have agreed to export one pair of shoes per 100 inhabitants in Mexico .
This particular derogation from the rule of origin affects some 15 000 small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and 650 000 employees .
I hope we do not have many more of these derogations because they will only compound the problems we already face .
