, I represent the pensioners of Italy and Europe .
It is strange that a summit with an agenda which is so sensitive to global governance issues should receive such severe , groundless criticism .
Fighting against poverty means improving cooperation between the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the ILO and the WTO in order to integrate macro-economic stability and development policies with social policies .
The legitimacy of these summits is not in question but , quite apart from the fact that they have no real influence , they do suffer from a terrible deficit of representation - and by that I mean not just the representation of the poorest countries - which is a very serious problem - but , for example , the way the European Union itself is represented .
Many social and political organisations , including ourselves , see the G8 as illegitimate , as an expression of a serious tendency to take important decisions away from the sovereign powers .
They see the demands of individuals , the environment and groups calling for social justice .
This certainly does not mean that the majority of Italians support the violence we have witnessed on other occasions and which we fear will be displayed this time as well .
This is shown by the almost unanimous position adopted on the Kyoto Protocol , by the battle to abolish the death penalty and to uphold respect for human rights and by the cohesion policy - as yet maybe not sufficient but still important - that we are developing .
If the voices remain the voices of individual countries , as they have been thus far , they will carry even less weight at the world summit .
This is a response of economic freedom which we must pursue to the end , apart from anything else because , in this way , we will be better able to respond to those who blame globalisation for the wretchedness and exploitation of entire peoples and areas of our planet , peoples who are exploited by their tyrant rulers , peoples who are exploited by economies which are , more often than not , closed and autarkic .
The G8 is not an institution but it is still bound to be transparent in its work and decisions and to make them public .
However , the point is this : even when they produce such major results , the great international summits do not succeed in communicating with what are known as the Seattle movements and , above all , do not connect with that much deeper , much more widespread , silent demand for security on the lips of the citizens , the submerged base of an iceberg whose tip is represented by the raft of different types of protests .
Why ?
When will these things happen ?
Mr President , we are about to undertake a series of very important roll-call votes .
Mr President , on the subject of the use of the European Parliament 's own resources , I would like to say , both on behalf of the Pensioners ' Party which I represent and on behalf of the associated French , Dutch , Spanish , Swedish , Slovenian , Bulgarian and Lithuanian Pensioners ' Parties , who have authorised me to speak on their behalf , that I openly support the proposal that the European Union should levy its own taxes and that this should not mean an increase in taxation for the citizens but , on the contrary , a reduction in the taxes that the citizens pay in their own States .
Every evening , I watch Fatuzzo 's European Show .
In Italy , in Genoa and all along the Ligurian coast , unfortunately , when it rains rather more than usual , all the street level houses , flats , shops and bars are flooded .
I could only reassure her that I was going to vote for this measure and recommend that it be laid down that pleasure craft must fly the European flag too .
The rights of the elderly are not respected when we become ill , completely incapacitated and lose our self-sufficiency : if we are lucky we are cared for by our families at home but , if not , we have to go into care homes which do what they can but , in any case , we have to pay for the care out of our own pockets with our own savings , if we have enough , and that is after we have given our work and paid taxes and contributions to the State all our lives .
Secondly , we must make it clear that it is time to move on to the next stage , which is to prepare for the General Assembly of the United Nations and the possibility of adopting a resolution on a moratorium on executions .
First of all , the People 's Republic of China .
If we accept China 's application to host the Olympic Games today , it would be like gilding the executions , the persecution of all political dissidents , the material and environmental destruction and the deportations which take place in China with the fine colours of the Olympic rings and all the flags .
I feel that , this being our first meeting after the summer recess , it is our duty to express our sympathy once again and send our condolences to the mayor of Strasbourg , the relatives of the victims and all the citizens for , apart from anything else , Strasbourg is our host city and the tragedy took place just a few metres away from the Parliament building .
' Hand in hand for peace ' : that was the theme of the Adep demonstration scheduled to take place on 1 September in Ankara
