I wish lastly , to say a couple of words about Palestine : given the tragic situation currently facing that country , we must respond to the situation next year by establishing a line and sufficient appropriations , specifically to recuperate the investments that the European Union has made there .
( PT ) The Commission considers a labour cost index to be of utmost importance for the European Central Bank , to monitor inflation in the EMU, and for social partners to use in negotiating wage agreements .
The rapporteur considers that these changes are in line with the spirit of the original proposal and I therefore wish to use this explanation of vote to express my favourable position .
This will contribute both to the upstream adoption of fair , proportionate and appropriate measures by national and Community authorities and to serving as a downstream tool for clarifying the role and interests of economic actors and ensuring that the composition of these is balanced .
In this context , I should also like to emphasise the importance that this set of regulations will have in helping to resolve the issue of air space saturation .
For all these reasons , this report has won my vote .
The directive that has been adopted today represents a significant step in this direction - the public dissemination of information will become the rule and the protection of information by the authorities will become a clearly defined exception .
.
Our group also wishes to draw attention to a new raft of preventive measures .
Mr President , the disaster caused by the Prestige oil tanker took place more than a month ago and we still do not know how long we will continue to see waves of oil slicks , which alone is an indictment of the leaders of Spain and the EU for having adopted such belated and ineffectual measures in an attempt to play down the effects of the real tragedy that has befallen the communities and the sea of Galicia , but which has also spread to the maritime territories to the North and to the South , affecting Portugal and France .
It is now clear that Galicia 's citizens are suffering the consequences of the serious political conflict which opposes the positive proposals put forward by the Commission and which has led to the selfishness and irresponsibility demonstrated by the Member States of the Council .
This must never happen again .
Europe 's citizens are demanding that legislation be made tougher , and that it enter into force and be implemented earlier than planned , without further ado .
As time passes , the true scale of this disaster is becoming ever clearer .
The second aspect is that since this has clearly had a terrible effect on fishing and shellfish farming , we must consider a more integrated and far-reaching package of measures that will provide practical responses for the communities that have been affected .
Together with the start of operation of the Eurodac system , which is scheduled for 15 January 2003 , this will constitute a positive step forward .
Little remains to be done on this key proposal which could be adopted by the Council at its first meeting in 2003 .
As you know - and as already mentioned by the President-in-Office - the directives on family reunification and long-term residence status are still under examination .
In this document we also elaborate on the possibilities , but also the limitations , of the Community budget in this area .
However , the harmonisation being attained is worth our effort .
Unanimity in the Council - especially in view of an enlarged Union - appears more and more to be an invitation to stalemate .
I am happy to see that has carried on and followed the evolution of these issues .
In my defence , the only thing I can say is that there was only one round of negotiations .
As far as the oral question is concerned , the Commission does not have exact figures concerning the overall scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by Member States .
For instance , I cannot distinguish between voluntary returns and forced returns because national Member States ' statistics do not make the distinction .
For instance , mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is a key element .
Of course , I welcome the idea of having a broad debate on return policy .
I also agree with the words of Mrs Terr√≥n i Cusi , who said that a global approach to these issues is needed .
It would probably be easier to make everything that is illegal legal , but we cannot do this .
Concerning the wisdom of Commissioner Vitorino , I wish to emphasise something that he said and which I believe to be extremely important : on this matter we must have a policy made up of small steps ; small steps , but steady ones .
Is this a desire on his part to play a leading role ; vanity ?
We are already beginning to see the consequences of these decisions , not only in the redundancies and in the greater instability of employment in some of these sectors , but also , in some cases , in the higher charges and prices and the poorer quality of the services provided .
( PT ) We have voted in favour of this report because as a result , the funding of EUR 27 million for the conversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets which operated in Moroccan waters will be ensured .
.
Sport contributes , in particular , to increasing the social skills of young people , such as team spirit , solidarity and fair play .
It should be remembered that in that year , the European Football Championships will be held in Portugal and the Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place in Athens .
As you all know ,
