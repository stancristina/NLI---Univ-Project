be carried out in the different contracting companies ; and , perhaps , thirdly , the differing methods and procedures , even for a task or post of an identical nature in different companies .
After all , this is a political chamber , not an academic body or a group of experts .
Clearly , this is nothing new .
I refer to the three rulings .
Mr Gorostiaga referred to a report by the United Nations Committee Against Torture , and subsequently sent an e-mail to all Members of the House .
I should like to make a few points regarding that conference .
On the other hand , progress on a political level was disappointing .
Regarding the position of developing countries , concern over inadequate financial support from developed countries was expressed .
We therefore request that delegations from Parliament be admitted to these meetings in future , at least as observers .
Had it done so , the Prestige would have been banned since 1 September 2002 .
These situations need to be dealt with once and for all , to ensure no further similar tragedies happen .
It appears that the last time the vessel underwent an inspection as required in the European Union under the Paris Memorandum was in 1999 .
That involves the immediate application and implementation of agreements and directives adopted by European Union Ministers .
The European Maritime Safety Agency should start operations too .
Each of the vessels involved in the latest three accidents , namely the Erika , the Baltic and the Prestige , was an old-fashioned single-hull tanker carrying heavy fuel oil .
It has been shown that there are ports where hardly any inspection takes place .
Ladies and gentlemen , going further should also mean talking to our neighbours .
We should remember that the seas are a common heritage , and that our concern has to extend to their farthest reaches .
To all intents and purposes , before she was appointed there was no such thing as a European policy on maritime safety .
The Commissioner referred to double hulls .
In Galicia the Atlantic coast of the Cape Finisterre area is known as the Coast of Death .
We are eager to move what could be termed the lanes of death further away from where they now are .
Mr President , I really feel the time has come for European solidarity to make itself felt .
In conclusion , I should like to assure the Commissioner that she can count on support from the Group of the European People 's Party .
The oil slick it caused is already an economic , social and environmental disaster for Europe , especially for my home region .
Pictures of hundreds of fishermen sewing together an enormous net four kilometres long to create an amateur device for holding back the oil speak volumes .
She went on to say , however , that despite Parliament 's express wish to the contrary , vessels without protective ballast tanks will be able to ply the seas until 2012 .
The Socialist Group calls for a policy on transport and sustainable development based on the principle of maximum safety and prevention .
Mr President , Commissioner , my mother tongue is very rich in popular proverbs and sayings .
Because there are times when stricter measures are required and there is much resistance - on the part of the lobbies present in this very House - to voting for these stricter , more serious and more rigorous measures .
Until when ?
Measures such as the extension of sea corridors should not be made to wait , so that ships transporting dangerous goods are further from the coast , especially when they are sailing through areas of high ecological sensitivity such as the Galician coasts .
I believe that enough has been said and that we must look forward , learning from the lessons of the immediate past .
In 1999 , it reached the port of Rotterdam and that is when for the last time it had an in-depth inspection in accordance with the Paris Memorandum in a European port .
In 2000 , six .
This is not a criticism of any particular port .
And precisely because only 23 months have passed and because there was a lack of ambition - as we all know - there has been another disaster .
Infringement procedures have been opened against some of them for lack of application , not of the new rules , but of those currently in force , which are much less strict and much easier to comply with .
What we clearly have are the FIPOL funds .
I hope that Portugal can be spared from this tragedy .
I hope it will be set up before the end of the year .
All of this within the context of the International Maritime Organisation , genuinely adapting maritime law to the demands and new circumstances of the 21st Century .
Mr President , I only wanted to ask the Commissioner a very brief question .
I would also like to table a point of order , before moving on to the vote , which will be a joint one concerning the whole text , because there are some linguistic corrections which I would like to point out to the services , since we have worked very quickly and some errors have slipped in which I will now mention , Mr President .
In point 3 , the Italian version does not match the other versions ; it is the only one in which , in line 7 , seven words have been included which must be removed since they do not appear in any of the other versions .
Mr President , I would like to present an oral amendment , because the amendment by the UEN Group includes Portugal .
