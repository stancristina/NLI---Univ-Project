put by Mr de Roo regarding rail transport that the matter is also being looked into but no proposal has yet been made .
This is a reference to Amendments Nos 6 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 20 and 22 .
The same holds true for Amendment No 1 and the latter part of Amendment No 9 , in which it is proposed that a year-long exemption be granted for the special class of trial motorcycles , and the first part of Amendment No 9 , which recommends application to present models to start , not from January , but from July , 2004 .
The Commission nevertheless rejects Amendment No 26 , which would delay application to present models by a whole year .
The Commission can thus accept Amendments Nos 4 , 9 , 12 and 18 , and , in principle , Amendments Nos 2 , 7 , 8 , 16 and 21 , and , in part , Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 19 , 20 and 22 .
Mr President , a job - work - is the most important means of preventing exclusion .
A big step forward will be the subsequent Luxembourg process , which invests in new technology and uses it to put Europe on the path to growth .
Mr President , first I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Swoboda , for an excellent report , and the same goes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , and Common Security and Defence Policy for their realistic presentation of the matter .
Turkey was accepted as a candidate country at the Helsinki Summit .
Every year around three billion euros are set aside there - rather more than that , in fact .
In addition , the same objective , that is to say , pre-accession aid , is being financed now from two different headings , which is blurring the transparency of the budget .
However , Heading 4 , " External Action " has become over-burdened .
For two years in succession now - at 200 million euros per year - a flexibility instrument has had to be used to finance it , something which in fact is Parliament ' s own disposable fund for unforeseen expenses .
Budgeting for pre-accession aid for Turkey , Cyprus and Malta in Heading 4 has increased the over-burdening further and jeopardised the ready availability of these funds .
Madam President , I am actually in the same situation .
Question No 13 by (H-0043/01 ) : Subject : ECOFIN and integration What plans has the Economic and Financial Affairs Council for developing a comprehensive strategy for integrating the environmental dimension into its policies , with a set of indicators , a timetable for further measures and follow-up and monitoring as required by the Helsinki conclusions ?
However , I would like to add my voice to the concern expressed here that there is not too much time left before the Gothenburg Summit , in terms of preparation to integrate environmental issues into various policies , something which came out of the conclusions of the Helsinki Summit .
In fact , I am very worried about how this process is to move forward .
I would like you , Mr President-in-Office , to explain your purpose regarding this matter .
These days information is the most important factor in production and what we are calling for is an improvement to the content of processed information .
We are moving away from a sort of information society hopefully to one of education , culture and values , and these guidelines really do speak of a European Research Area .
That , in my opinion , is only right , and they say it will be a way of revising the basic social structures .
As a result of the change already under way , we should create a cluster of projects within the framework of the European Research Area , which would help develop content and the production of content .
This is a major factor in the changes taking place today and an enormous challenge in terms of research .
For that reason , Commissioner , I would hope that the proportion of social research can be increased .
I think that this discussion should never have taken place in the European Parliament .
So I voted against the whole resolution .
Mr President , the European Parliament took a positive view at the start of the week of extending the agreement between the EU and ASEAN to include Laos .
It is appropriate that human rights there should be discussed at the same time as increased cooperation .
Laos is one of the world ' s poorest countries .
In October 1999 , a demonstration was organised in front of the presidential palace against the ruling powers .
Those who took part in it have not been seen since .
Meanwhile , Mr Thongsouk Saysangkhi , who died in prison in 1998 , belonged to a group of three ministers and a high official who had been attempting to change the administrative machine from within .
The EU has given EUR 120 million in aid to the country ; the United States has given 23 million , and Japan 132 million dollars .
Laos is rich in natural resources and , were there democracy there , would have real potential for development .
Mr President , the Supplementary and Amending Budget makes pitiful reading .
The worst thing about all this is , however , that the BSE crisis is seriously threatening the equilibrium of the EU budget .
But the most serious aspect of the issue is that the margin for the Financial Perspective is in danger of being used up entirely .
Consumption has dropped in many of the large countries , which is reflected in increased stocks .
