In next year ' s budget , money has thus been set aside for early retirement and new appointments in order to ensure that the Commission obtains the right manpower for carrying out its tasks .
In Parliament , we have demanded information as a condition of the appropriations , and the Commission has , on several occasions , reported in detail on the staffing situation .
There is a majority in the Committee on Budgets that has wanted to place a large amount of money in reserve until further information has been provided .
Otherwise , we shall end up obstructing the reforms rather than promoting them .
I think that we in Parliament should honour the obligingness and openness shown by the Commission and either release those items that are in the reserve or at least be content to keep a smaller amount in the reserve so that the Commission obtains reasonable conditions .
Thank you very much for your answer .
I therefore find it worrying that there is now a desire to increase the limit values .
Is it correct that the Committee of Independent Experts has in actual fact recommended a reduction in the limit values ?
Finally , I want to ask who has asked for these limit values to be increased .
Is it the fishing industry and , if so , in which countries does the fishing industry want permission for higher limit values for the heavy metals at issue here : lead , cadmium and mercury ?
Now , we are able to put names to the world ' s most dangerous terrorists .
The terrorists who are most deliberately and effectively ravaging our planet and threatening world peace are the governments of the United States and Israel .
Monstrosities of military technology , they practise terrorism in multiple senses of the word .
It is absolute power , economic and military , that creates terrorism .
Two months ago , the United States sent Mr Prodi a list of 40 different decisions which , according to the United States Government , should be taken by the EU and the Member States in order to satisfy the United States : surveillance , control , arrest with no counsel for the defence or court hearing provided , and the handing over of suspects for legal proceedings in the United States , involving military courts and the death penalty .
We must protest most vigorously against the handing over of suspects in any form as long as there is the possibility of the death penalty ' s being carried out and as long as no guarantee can be given by the United States of its not being carried out .
It has been shameful to see the way in which the institutions of the EU have complied with demands that are also aimed at abolishing our concepts of justice .
What is at issue here is not military technology but politics and the defence of the law .
' May we see the telephone directory ? ' ' Sorry , this has certainly not been classified information for two years , but you cannot be given it . ' ' How many laws are there ? ' ' Sorry , we are not counting . ' ' How many projects are you running ? ' ' We stopped counting when we reached 100 000 . ' ' How many committees are there ? ' ' Sorry , that is a secret . ' ' Who takes part in the preparative meetings ? ' ' That is unfortunately something we do not know . ' ' But you pay travel expenses , do you not ? ' ' Sorry , we do not know whom we pay these to . ' ' May I see which laws are being negotiated with the twelve applicant countries , together with the screening reports ? ' ' Sorry . '
Like the Ombudsman , the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control , we are unable to obtain what ought to be available to elected representatives in all parliaments .
We were right there with a renewed request to scrutinise the documentation , but the officials discovered that there was nothing to be made available on the basis of the new rules , either .
We have asked for details of the enlargement negotiations and to see the declarations and statements associated with current laws .
I should therefore like to ask our rapporteurs if they will be involved in taking proceedings against the Commission if our renewed request for access to documents also fails in the end to produce a satisfactory answer .
Mr President , the Commissioner intimates that we have been given an answer .
We have not .
We tried to renew our old request to Mr Prodi .
The same day , officials told us that nothing at all new could be made available under the new regulation .
We had raised another question with Mr Prodi in the Conference of Presidents .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , there were enough warnings before the crisis in Kosovo really got under way .
I think these are two examples of the way in which we are all too often all too wise all too late .
This is in stark contrast to the willingness to employ resources on civil crisis prevention and on peacekeeping .
Now , the EU has decided to play an active role in conflict prevention in Africa .
That is something I view in positive terms .
That role has unfortunately fallen somewhat by the wayside since 11 September .
We must make pro-active use of the tariff agreement in this crisis .
