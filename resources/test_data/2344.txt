Mr President , first I should like to thank Mr Hughes , Mr De Rossa and Mr Andersson for their interest in the question of harassment at the workplace , which clearly helps the Commission .
I should like to remind Mr  Hughes that , during the last six Presidencies , there has not , I think , been one single Presidency during which legislation on health and safety was not adopted .
The Commission presented a communication with a White Paper on health and safety for the years up to 2006 , which clearly states that the Commission will examine the suitability and advisability of a Community measure on psychological harassment and violence at work .
Mr Hughes asked for a timetable .
Thus , in the aim of achieving efficient prevention of all forms of violence at work , other non-binding measures , such as recommendations or other non-legislative initiatives , such as guidelines , information and awareness-raising campaigns and enhanced training activities for employers and employees , may be complementary rather than mutually exclusive actions , in conjunction , of course , with a legislative text .
Within these frameworks , it aims to maximise the potential for companies to guarantee an abundance of skilled manpower , so that they can choose as much as they need , as and when they need it , so as to depress the price of manpower , trample the workers ' rights and vested interests underfoot and , generally , enhance the exploitation of scientific manpower .
As far as the content of the directive is concerned , we would point out that , on the pretext of simplifying recognition procedures , the minimum preconditions set for access to scientific professions safeguarded under the law are much lower than those which already apply in numerous countries in the European Union and in Greece .
Even vocational experience or practical exercise can , according to the directive , be equated to a three-year or five-year course .
It even introduces a single specialist committee to recognise vocational qualifications and control progress in the application of the operation .
Of course , the precondition to the success of such an endeavour is recognition of university diplomas .
These diplomas are not recognised by the State and the social problem of thousands of people is escalating .
However , because the problems of the Greek education system are dragging on , I tabled an amendment which was approved in committee , so that European diplomas could be recognised as soon as possible , without needless legal obstacles and without Greece being condemned by the Court of Justice of the European Communities , and so that reputable European universities could open annexes in Greece under a regime of legal certainty , in order to raise the level of courses through competition and put a stop to student migration .
The first is that it will be much easier for the liberal professions to move around than it has been to date , especially for those who exercise regulated professions .
As regards the cross-border provision of services in particular , I think that amendments which set terms and conditions in order to prevent infringements should be accepted .
On the other hand , the innovation in the directive introducing the concept of common bases should be especially welcomed , because it gives the liberalised agencies the opportunity to take an active part in strengthening their cross-border cooperation .
We all need to agree on this if we do not want to put the product of education on the same footing as an uncontrolled industrial product .
Mrs Kratsa 's report moves along lines required by the imposition of the terms of big business on this sector and its content reveals the manner in which the neo-liberal policy of the EU deals with the problems .
It adopts the raising of the retirement age and calls for note to be taken of the 'beneficial ' consequences of privatising services of general interest .
Even for these immigrants , the conditions for acquiring a resident 's permit , in Greece at least , are prohibitive .
The resolution warns that 'managed migration cannot mean side-stepping the reforms of ΕU labour markets ... needed to increase employability and overall adaptability to economic change ' .
The imperialists of the ΕU hold nothing sacred ; they have no compassion in the face of human suffering and misfortune .
Nor does the resolution fail to advertise the 'generosity ' of the American President .
The Greek-owned ship , the sank in Karachi harbour and , unfortunately , the cook is still being held , as are people from the salvage company who went there after the accident .
What I am requesting is that the President of the European Parliament intervene again , perhaps calling on the ambassador to Pakistan or even asking Commissioner Patten to tell us what demarches have been taken by the European Union .
Right until the end , we were faced with prejudices either on the part of certain Member States or certain military authorities .
Nonetheless , it is better for the European Parliament to agree to what we have before us and to look on it as a first step .
The White Paper talks clearly about a demand-driven space policy , while both the White Paper and the previous texts and official statements clearly indicate that the aim is to use space for military objectives .
Others say that space cannot be developed without state funding , and they are right about that , but they add that the only way to obtain such funding within the framework of competition is to develop the military side .
I would ask them to tone down their worship of the free market and competition policy and I would counter-propose public funding for space research and exploration .
But it does
