of what is required have been encouraging to the extent that the estimates of what is required for aid have fallen rather than increased as matters have progressed .
On the basis of current information , we assume this to be sufficient , but we are , of course , ready to debate this issue in the light of better information because , as we all know , acceptance of the budget requires that both official bodies with budgetary control come to a consensus on the issues .
Mr President , this point of view on the inclusion of the International Monetary Fund is the kind of matter which the Council itself must study for its part .
Madam President , you have already expressed our jointly felt sadness regarding the aircrash and the Greek delegation , but I would still like to say how overcome with grief I was today when I heard of the death of my good friend and colleague and that of other Greek citizens .
At the European Council meeting in Tampere , we wish to take the next big step towards a Union that will provide for the people who live within its borders an area of freedom , security and justice .
This is a logical and inevitable step in the Union ' s development .
We are in the process of adopting a common currency , which will add to the benefit of us all .
At Tampere , we must agree future policy guidelines for co-operation , commit to certain jointly agreed concrete action , and ensure that restrictions imposed by the Pillars do not constitute a barrier to the effective action we wish to see .
It may also be feasible to use it now .
In mentioning this latter area , my comment might sound lightweight , but in practice , it is just that barrier that we have to overcome .
I myself sincerely believe that if we were to ask the citizens of the Member States what they wished to see , it would be that they expect the Union to become more effective and determined in their resolve to reinforce their rights and strengthen their security .
The methods used in legal and home affairs policy as well as foreign and security policy , in the same way as with commercial and development co-operation policy , must be made more uniform so that our citizens may be assured of a secure environment in these respects also .
Co-operation in the area of internal affairs and legal matters must be developed with the applicant countries so that together we can achieve the goals we have set for Union policy .
For purposes of co-operation , we can also rely on the Council of Europe and the OSCE , which have meritorious traditions and can offer much expertise in this matter .
Before anything else , I would like to outline some of the main aims of the Presidency before the meeting takes place .
At the same time , I hope your ideas will inspire me in further preparation for the meeting , since we still have that opportunity .
Clearer goals than those that existed earlier for justice and home affairs were created with the Treaty of Amsterdam .
The European Council at Vienna last December furnished us with an excellent plan of action which sets out our work timetable for the near future .
We shall pay special attention throughout to human rights and transparency , which are an essential part of the foundations of an area of freedom , security and justice .
Then I would like to speak in rather more detail about immigration and asylum policy which , as I am aware , the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Justice have already given an account of here .
In my opinion , all who reside or who are hoping to reside in the Union area have a right to security .
At Tampere , we should achieve consensus on the creation of a European asylum system based on common principles .
The aim is to offer a high level of protection , common to all countries as far as is possible , to those who need it .
At the same time , obviously , we must the whole time ensure that this cannot lead to situations that compromise human rights .
The Union must be ready to offer swift protection in mass evacuation situations .
The offer of temporary protection relies on the will to be protected and the will and ability on the part of the recipient state to take responsibility .
For me , it seems natural that in mass evacuation situations , Community funds could be used and other Community joint financing measures could be taken to provide economic compensation .
The rights and obligations of foreigners legally resident in the Member States of the Union must be safeguarded in a more standardised way .
There is experience of this in certain countries that we can draw on .
The Union ' s external border controls must be developed so that it becomes better balanced and more standardised , in compliance with the Schengen measures .
With the next phase of enlargement , the external borders of the Union will once again alter , and the importance of viable surveillance will grow both as far as the security of the public and freedom of movement are concerned .
The Treaty of Amsterdam provides new opportunities for planning a policy of repatriation .
In certain cases , the Union should aim to initiate negotiations leading to multilateral agreements on repatriation .
In this connection , we must investigate the means available to us .
We must turn our attention to the conditions prevailing in the most significant countries migrants and those seeking asylum are departing from , conditions that induce or even force them to leave their homeland .
