We know that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a major worry in this context .
It is , however , sensible - and we return to this in the second report - for primary produce that is suitable for human consumption also perhaps to be used as feed .
We must therefore probably observe that it will not be possible within the foreseeable future to remove the ban on feeding omnivores with meat meal and bone meal .
We also believe that the Commission must be able to impose sanctions upon Member States that have not done enough to apply this type of legislation .
Diseases of this kind are dangerous to both animals and human beings , and it is incredibly important that we in the EU devote adequate resources to maintaining the fight against them at a high level .
I am really looking forward to our being able to adopt a position in this House on the Commission ' s proposal concerning the way in which the issue is to be handled .
Rather , it came from elsewhere .
I would , however , emphasise in conclusion that the danger is not over .
That means that the only thing we know in many of these situations is that we really do not know anything , or that we do not know a sufficient amount .
I cannot help but wonder if it is always the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy that meets on Tuesday night during the part-session in Strasbourg or whether we are regarded as some kind of suspect fundamentalist sect that is always placed lowest down on the agenda .
I should like to say , today , that I am not only a proud Gothenburger but also a proud European .
I have the sense that there is not only a physical ocean separating the continents but also a mental ocean , given the way in which the United States regards the climate issue and believes it should be handled .
The United States regards a global environmental threat as a domestic problem that only concerns Americans , while the European attitude is that the issue should be dealt with jointly .
It is just unfortunate that certain members of the Council will feel the need to make a fuss about the way in which the burden is distributed .
Your efforts , including visits to the United States and contacts with parliamentarians in different countries , have been extraordinarily important .
The cooperation we have had during the negotiations , especially under Mr Moreira Da Silva ' s leadership , has contributed to our having come as far as this on our home ground .
If it is to be possible to achieve this objective , the EU should set a good example .
I want to comment briefly on what is termed the Danish problem , which is to be regarded as a technical complication .
If this decision is adopted at the Environment Council meeting in March , this would be a clear signal that the EU is determined to comply with the Kyoto Protocol , a move that would strengthen the EU' s credibility and leadership role in the matter of combating climate change .
If we are to be credible , we must put our own house in order first .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I want first of all to say a big thank you to the European Parliament , and , above all , to Mrs Martens and the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , for the support , points of view and proposals to which the debate on this report has given rise .
Despite the fact that this involves some very complicated work , the finishing touches are now being put to a detailed work programme of the kind requested by the European Council in Stockholm .
The views and proposals put forward by Mrs Martens in her report will , as far as possible , be taken into account in preparing the final document .
A knowledge-based society cannot be created without knowledge .
In the future too , we shall have the opportunity to work more with Parliament and other EU institutions , as well as with international organisations such as the OECD and the Council of Europe .
The proposal means that extradition cases would not be examined in the same way as before and that special legislation against crimes specifically classed as terrorism would be implemented on very vague and unclear grounds .
I think it is dubious , on such vague bases , to have a special legal system within a legal system .
I believe that when , as we must , we combat terrorism , we must do so by employing , rather than weakening , the Rule of Law .
Eradicating poverty is a moral imperative , but it is also an issue directly linked to our common security .
On both occasions , rich and poor countries will have an opportunity to agree upon a long-term plan to eradicate poverty step by step .
No amount of fine words and eloquent rhetoric can eradicate poverty .
We want to see practical results .
We have now voted in favour of one of them , which mean that the others cease to be options .
The reason for my having done so is that the report quotes Article 95 of the Treaty as a legal basis , involving majority decision-making in the Council and codecision making for the European Parliament , and this in spite of the fact that Article 95 states that it does not cover 'fiscal provisions ' .
The Swedish Christian Democrats fully support the Council ' s approach .
We are strongly critical of these terrorist laws , and above all of an arrest warrant , in terms
