home will be made easier and less stressful .
These are simply common-sense measures that will make life so much easier for people across Europe , particularly in Britain where buses are an essential way of getting around our towns and cities .
The bus and coach directive will secure minimum safety standards for the design of buses operating in Europe and basic requirements to ensure access for people with reduced mobility , such as the continued manufacture of existing low-floor buses and better facilities for passengers with mobility difficulties , especially wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs .
I give the green light to these measures and look forward to a more pleasant bus ride home from Bolton town centre after a Saturday afternoon 's shopping spree .

I fully support proposals to encourage an employment strategy across the European Union .
We can only fight the scourge of unemployment if we work together right across the 15 Member States .
Jobs , jobs , jobs .
That is what it is all about .
That is what the Labour Government is campaigning for and that is what Europe is working for .
It is our top priority and we must move heaven and earth to make it happen .
The goals set at the Lisbon Summit last year were a crucial step forward in establishing the right conditions to achieve full employment , whereby the Heads of State and Government set the EU the objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world , capable of sustainable economic growth accompanied by quantitative and qualitative improvement of employment and of greater social cohesion .
The forthcoming Stockholm Council in March will continue to develop the European agenda for a flexible economy , liberalisation of gas and electricity markets , postal liberalisation , reform of the financial services sector , proposals on telecommunications and e-commerce , measures to create a favourable environment for SMEs , and targets for employment rates to benefit all our citizens in the European Union .
Cooperation throughout the Union is essential for exchanges of information and best practices , providing comparative analysis as well as promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences .
In Britain , our Labour Government is leading the way towards job creation and full employment .
Not only has youth unemployment been halved under Labour , but the government is now introducing vocational training for our young people to benefit from new skills in a high-tech and evolving job market .
The aim is to create a flexible , high-skilled workforce in Britain .
Madam President , I fully endorse this report which is yet another benchmark in our progress towards full employment in a dynamic knowledge-based economy .

While I voted in favour of the Swoboda report on financial assistance for Turkey for the pre-accession strategy , I believe that the EU should be talking more toughly to the Turkish Government about its human rights abuses especially towards the Kurds .
It should also monitor fair distribution of the money .
In view of renewed military repression in the Kurdish south-east - with the probable aim of provoking the PKK - and recent arrests and disappearances of activists in HADEP ( a legal political party ) it seems Turkey is going backwards rather than forwards in respect of the Copenhagen criteria .
Mr President , I must say that I am slightly disturbed by the lack of response on one or two of the issues there , but I will come to those in one moment .
My report deals with this regulation and , as has been said , it concerns a key mechanism in the implementation of the European Union 's goal of free movement of people in that it coordinates social security systems .
It certainly does not seek to harmonise them .
There are three aspects to today 's debate .
We have heard already about third-country nationals and the legal base which should be applied to include them in the scope of the regulation ; the comparative lack of progress in including accession countries in the coordination process ; and the update of the regulation in my report to bring it into line with the changes made in the social security systems of certain Member States .
I will say more on that , but touch on the other two issues as well .
As has been stressed , a crucial factor underlining all these elements is the need to make rapid and positive progress on the Commission 's proposal for a simplification and modernisation of the whole of Regulation 1408/71 .
It is essential for the Council to understand that in Parliament we have consensus and are determined on that point , whatever the differences that might appear elsewhere about the right strategy .
We have been looking to the Council for a positive response about the speed of that overall reform .
Paragraph 4 of the resolution tabled by four political groups makes it clear that Parliament is no longer prepared to continue with the piecemeal amendments and technical updates - of which my report is the latest and , we believe the last example .
We must now have overall integrated changes necessary to resolve the bulk of the problems currently arising from this regulation as soon as possible .
That is why the amendments proposed and supported by the committee are technical ones .
We prefer generally not to accept amendments concerning the scope of the regulation , the benefits covered , the changes in the competent authority and so on .
Our aim is to deal with this report most speedily so as not to give the Council any excuse for not moving rapidly to the conclusion of its initial debate on overall simplification - again a point raised in the joint resolution
