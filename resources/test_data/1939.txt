mode of transport is treated unfairly .
Parallel to this debate , we have been holding talks with Mr Currie , the Director-General for Environmental Affairs , on the outcome of the negotiations in The Hague .
I believe we must ensure that no competitive disadvantages are incurred within Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner Liikanen , this very night we shall be discussing the proposal for a Council Decision on European digital content .
The sums that will be invested here naturally bear no relation to the total investment in software , in digital content .
The stumbling blocks of modern technology and the possible need to communicate in a foreign language can now be more easily overcome .
We all want to ensure that the people in our Member States are not exposed to excessive noise , but we also want this whole question to be regulated by law .
We have no intention whatsoever of pulling a fast one on the House .
I am still quite curious to see how the dice will fall tomorrow .
This is something we should bear in mind during our discussions .
The political world is called upon to do everything in its power to ensure that the safety of foodstuffs can be guaranteed .
We as legislators should never lose sight of this , and we should encourage the Commission to apply the principle from the outset when drafting legislative proposals .
I should like to announce a few fairly minor technical adjustments very briefly .
With regard to Amendments Nos 34 , 38 , 35 , 36 and 78 , the computer has jumbled up the figures .
Instead of what is suggested by the words " of producers and artists , especially from the non profit-making sector " , my primary intention was that we should include in this circle representatives of content providers .
We can certainly call for reduced spending in general , because each of us could list examples of savings that could be made , and these would far exceed the travel expenses of the officials who have to travel from Luxembourg to Brussels or Strasbourg .
This is indispensable , especially for rural , remote and sparsely populated areas and even for certain parts of towns and cities too .
On the contrary , the people of Europe and their Parliament have experienced a 'regression from Amsterdam ' .
We are further than ever from generalised qualified majority voting in the Council , which would have led to codecision rights for the European Parliament .
I should like to focus particularly on two aspects of the Commission proposal .
And there is more to come .
I say two because , although the proposal identifies three areas , two of them quite obviously belong together and will have to be jointly funded .
One especially good feature of this initiative is that it has enabled women in particular to familiarise themselves with new information technology and its applications .
But despite the Agreed Minutes of 22 June 2000 on the technical issues , on accounting transparency and banking operations , there has been no sign of willingness on the part of the South Korean Government or of the shipyards and the shipbuilding industry to reach a consensus with the European Union on pricing .
I also wish to remind you that many of our shipyards are in remote regions with structural weaknesses - regions that are undergoing radical adjustment processes .
Neither side wants peace , but we must help to ensure that peace is established in that region .
Turkey has every right to prevent such activities but , at the same time , it must ensure that all prisoners in Turkish jails are treated humanely , decently and as individuals , and we are utterly uncompromising in our commitment to this principle .
Please do not come to me with the popular cry : " But surely , then , we are taking away jobs from young people " .
Mr President , I am pleased to be able to speak here during the last Friday sitting of this year , which will hopefully not be the last ever in Strasbourg .
However different the national pensions systems are in Europe , they should all be earnings - and performance-related .
I do not believe that all women - or all men - should have to go out to work if they decide to have a career break or to stop working in order to devote themselves to their family .
This sector is , of course , included in the "green box" , and it would , of course , make it possible for us to present European products on the world market in an entirely new and much more intensive way .
Another important area is , of course , further education and training .
If they had stayed in the fields then we would not have had BSE.
Mr Verheugen , you are familiar with the debate surrounding the new Member States and the question of whether they will receive the compensatory payments or not .
All those who say that you can still tuck in in style in Europe are right .
Finally , I should like to extend my warmest thanks to the House , to all of my colleagues , to all of the ushers and also to the President .
The common position is well-balanced to my mind and was improved on , to some extent , by the committee ' s amendments and those tabled by the rapporteur , Mrs Peijs , whom I would like to thank .
What constitutes a good school education these days ?
Only those who have a knowledge base know how to handle knowledge properly , and how to distinguish and differentiate , in an age that has seen an explosion in knowledge
