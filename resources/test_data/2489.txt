The enlargement strategy is effective in encouraging reforms in candidate states , but it only works if those reforms are also recognised .
If we fail to implement these changes , we will leave reformers in Turkey , millions of men and women , simply out in the cold .     .
We must build on the progress that has been made in recent years , whilst acknowledging that delays have hampered that progress .
First of all , with regard to the Armenian genocide , I share the view which Mr Eurlings has adopted in this respect .
I am not talking about the many critical paragraphs in which the Turkish Government is urged to do more and to implement reforms more quickly .
Why is it so important that the report should be critical and , at the same time , fair ?
To what extent do those forces , summed up under the heading of ‘deep state’ , hamper the present accession negotiations ?
Turkey is calling the shots .
Mr President , I should like to remind Mr Claeys that Commissioner Rehn has already explained in detail that it would be impossible for him to stay .
Can Commissioner Kallas indicate in what way those countries are being involved in the programme in order to fight counterfeiting and the bringing into circulation of counterfeit euro coins ?
Central will then be the role of Parliament in this new era , with an interim review in 2009-2010 .
Mr President , I am particularly pleased that we are discussing this topic – albeit at this late hour – because it is indeed the case that we need to get our skates on .
You have mentioned a Green Paper .
Could that be the bridge that can bring about this acceleration ?
Everyone can see that a solution is needed , but opinions differ on how this should be done .
To this day , though , it is unclear in which countries these prisons were situated , and whether any of them were in the European Union .
The link between immigration and development is paramount .
For example , you condemn homophobia with words , but will you also take action , Commissioner Frattini , for example on the basis of Article 7 against homophobic actions and statements by EU governments and ministers ?
Are we not cycling around the Schengen information system fast enough ?
We will be voting by roll call for the first and second parts .     Mr President , I see that the oral amendments have been distributed .
The European Parliament is fulfilling its responsibility for safeguarding European values and the accession criteria with this report .
If , though , we were to examine the impressive catalogue of serious problems , we would know better .
I hope that those negotiations will eventually lead to a democratic , multi-ethnic and multi-religious Turkey that lives in peace with all its neighbours .
That is why that country will need to make a reasonable offer in the form of a reduction of its import tariffs .
One important point of criticism that I made with regard to the Commission ’s working method was that the proposal was tabled before the North Sea Regional Advisory Council had issued its recommendation .
I also hope that the Council will as yet move a little closer in the direction of Parliament to ensure that we in any event end up with a balanced approach .
There are , of course , general policy lines , but in order to keep a support base for fisheries , it is essential for these Regional Advisory Councils to be accorded an important role , also in future , also in the implementation of the plans .
Parliament’s position will be apparent in tomorrow’s vote .
The time at which she is here is not of her choosing but is the choice of your Bureau .
I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report , and I shall advise my group to vote in favour of the report as amended in the Agricultural Committee .     – Mr President , it is vitally important that attention be given to nanotechnology .
Can the Commission have a critical analysis done of this ?
These must , of course , be considered , particularly at the global level within UNESCO and the OECD.
In this situation , alas , it is all too often the development aspect that gets squeezed out ; for example , trade considerations loom far too large in economic policy agreements , the renowned – or sometimes , perhaps , notorious – Peas .
Global trade is important and of great benefit in enabling developing countries to escape from the vicious cycle of poverty ; much is to be gained by a good combination of aid and trade , and the process of combining the two must not be allowed to stand in the way of these countries ’ development ; it is in this way that we will be able to achieve the Millennium Goals .
The VVD delegation has voted to adopt the Guerreiro report on the grounds that our party wants to see the economic position of the fisheries sector improve .
I also rejoice to see that the Commission is now seeking to give serious consideration to the possibility of concluding bilateral trade agreements with Asian countries , certainly with Singapore , and possibly also with Thailand .
Finally , human rights must also feature in this sort of dialogue .
There are indeed disturbing things going on in the Philippines and in Myanmar , and I am glad that these are being talked about .
We go along with your way of thinking , and it would be good if the EU were to do as it did at the Hague conference , were to take part as a political and economic organisation , so
