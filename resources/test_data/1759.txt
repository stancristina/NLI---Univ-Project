I am thinking of the agricultural policy , of the fisheries policy , which we are proposing to reform as well .
There are already more than 1 200 !
The examples are as numerous as they are revealing : biodiversity , the subject of a Convention in Rio , continues to decline sharply .
It is extremely important to implement strategies which seek to promote a more balanced representation within social consultation bodies .
Governments have a duty to deal with this by supplementing existing legislation with means of protection other than conventional asylum .
The Ha'aretz newspaper answers for you , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , in pointing out that 30 Palestinian civilians were killed in August alone and Yedioth Ahronot , another newspaper , condemned the irresponsible nature of these crimes , although , apparently , the number of terrorist attacks has fallen spectacularly .
Its second argument is if the United Nations supports this action , all well and good ; if it is against this action , it does not matter , we shall take action with the support of our friends .
And we also call for the Palestinian Authority to be reformed and to accept more responsibility , failing which , Mr President , it will be impossible for the essential dialogue to be resumed .
The European Parliament is not the place where we will answer the question 'what can be done ? '
There will still be time then , and I am speaking to you , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , to implement , in its entirety , Security Council Resolution 687(91 ) which emphasises that the disarmament of Iraq is part of an initiative whose goal is to establish in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles .
Madam President , the aim of the International Criminal Court is to judge the perpetrators of the most serious crimes that have international implications , an aim that is all the more commendable since it was defined at the end of the most crime-ridden century in the history of humanity , a century which saw the genocide of the Armenians in 1916 , of the Jews in the 1940s , one hundred million deaths caused by Communism , the Christians of Sudan massacred by Islamic fundamentalists , one million starving children in Iraq because of sanctions on their country ? the list goes on .
The resolution quite rightly calls for our policies to be co-ordinated in order to provide financial aid to the Mercosur countries and to include these new guidelines in the EU-Mercosur agreement that is currently being negotiated .
If the European Union unilaterally decided to transfer to this legal system , it would introduce distorted competition between the European Union and third countries .
The development dimension is increasingly important in our commercial policy , as stated by Commissioner Lamy and duly noted .
Under these circumstances , do we need to establish new free trade agreements , or rather invest in production tools and make the conditions for granting manufacturing licences more flexible ?
This is also true with regard to the integration and unity process currently underway in Africa .
These countries have weak and vulnerable economies .
The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the objectives stated in the Lom√© Convention and the Cotonou Agreement and so on are far removed from reality .
For an industry such as agriculture that has already been weakened by health crises and is awaiting the new CAP guidelines , this is a considerable extra cost .
( FR ) We have approved the resolution on the results of the Johannesburg World Summit on sustainable development , since it demonstrates , and this is very positive , that the countries of Europe hold a largely common view of these issues , and that they display a high degree of sensitivity towards them .
In 1992 , the Earth Summit took place in Rio to address the issue of sustainable development .
It is urgent that we re-orientate direct aid in order to promote sustainable agriculture .
We also propose a return to the interpretation of the Brundtland report , which defined sustainable development in terms of a guideline for action .
In the name of what is it doing so ?
Pursuing this policy of plunder can only worsen their misery .
.
The communitarisation of a virtual CFSP would therefore be a serious historic mistake : it would further restrain the Member States , while the freedom of our nations , in the field of foreign policy as well as other policies , is what makes Europe independent ; this excludes neither cooperation between countries nor freely discussed and agreed coordination of their policies .
.
My reply is that the list of standards will be published after the meeting of the committee responsible for communications on 2 October .
They are scheduled to be examined between now and July 2004 .
I think I speak for my group as a whole in welcoming all these European nations .
This is borne out , for example , by the essential conflict between the Polish Government and parliament and the Polish Central Bank , which is considered too liberal and too independent .
How can that work ?
What will the Europe we want be like in fifteen or twenty years with the Twenty-five ?
Lastly , this should have been clearly stated .
Parliament , in its latest resolutions , clearly listed the conditions with which such an arrangement would have to comply for Cyprus to be able to fully meet its obligations as a Member of the EU.
That is why I shall vote against the report presented to us by the Commission .
I am sure that we can , as it is clear that the requirements of our societies and
