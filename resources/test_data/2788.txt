the facilities .
If we really want to clean up our oceans and preserve the natural balance for future generations , we must take more radical measures , especially concerning payment for these facilities and the need to avoid distortions in competition between ports .
In this particular case , it seems to have sunk without trace and your conscience seems to change with the wind .
In this case , under the guise of concern for the environment , the rapporteur wants to take charge of all the policies of the Member States .
Europe is going to be submerged , even though at El Elejido in 1999 and in just a few other places , the settled populations have reacted against this flood of nomads .
As Member for a town that looks on to the Mediterranean , I hope that the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is given comparable resources for the period 2000-2006 to those given to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
I shall do my best to ensure that the vote on the MEDA budget is another stage confirming the importance we attach to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership .
It is quite clear that the floodgates are open wide and that the aim is to encourage immigration on a massive scale that will change the very nature of European societies .
Indeed we have recently seen companies making redundancies even when they are making profit , because they have to restructure and merge , with no thought , of course , of fulfilling their obligations to inform their employees and to communicate with them !
.
Many problems remain in the field of the recognition of qualifications .
To mention one problem with which I am very familiar , that of students , I think it is crucial that we provide them with better information on their rights if they wish to study in another Member State .
There is no doubting that this is a challenge !
The publication of this report has led to many people across Europe expressing their views and has enabled a genuine debate to be held at European level , beyond the scientific circles concerned .
The Commission looks forward to hearing the opinion of the European Group on Ethics this November on the use of adult stem cells .
The speed at which scientific research progresses is sometimes difficult for average humans , and even for politicians , to comprehend .
There are two opposing views in play : the first refuses to turn the human being and more specifically the embryo into a tool and is concerned at the potential risks for human society of the widespread use of certain techniques such as cloning .
In this respect , it would probably be more appropriate to ask scientists to conduct further research into the possibility of obtaining differentiated stem cells for therapeutic purposes , particularly from adult organs .
Today , however , we are discussing the use of cloning techniques for therapeutic purposes and this has many implications .
Safeguards are crucial .
All of these questions are laden with consequences and concern the meaning of life itself .
First of all , it should be pointed out that many of those involved in the incidents that occurred in Brussels and Charleroi , come from one of the European Union ' s Member States , the United Kingdom , which is not a member of the Schengen area .
We are now in the process of assessing those measures .
The arrangements introduced will clear the way for a list of priority substances to be gradually drawn up every 4 years , that is , priority substances which must be reduced in quantity , and priority hazardous substances , which must purely and simply be eliminated .
In any event , this is the intention of our directive and I have no doubt that the Commission and the Member States will ensure that it is implemented .
The political dependency of the Member States depends in large part on their freedom in terms of tax .
This correlation between noise and rolling , tyre grip and fuel consumption is rightly at the centre of the concern expressed in Amendment No 1 .
The report that has been submitted to us is not entirely free from reproach in this respect , and nor , what is more , is the Commission 's communication .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is one point that I should like to emphasise , a point which is perhaps common to both reports .
As far as the system and its focal point , the sportsperson , are concerned , what the reports are calling for is the rationalisation of the specific nature of sport in our European Union .
Others , especially the sprinters , are proclaiming loud and long that they are only running to promote their particular brand of footwear .
The Bosman decision , for example , which was taken in the name of high principles , has destabilised professional clubs and has exacerbated the impact of money on European football .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , everyone acknowledges that sport is a means of personal development and a special opportunity to meet other people .
It is certainly a challenge , but we must accept it for the sake of coming generations .
Mr President , Commissioner , Madam Minister , I am speaking on the Zabell and Mennea reports today in my dual role as a Member of the European Parliament and as president of a professional basketball club which takes part in the major European competitions .
The system of agents must be brought under control by the Union , or perhaps even scrapped .
So , the underlying causes have to be tackled , and without delay ; I believe the accent must be placed on controls , on sporting sanctions and on action against the supply chains
