be made .
Today , I suspect that there are possibly one or two Member States - perhaps one of them is your own , Mr Wurtz - who might have similar interests , the same sort of interests that you most strongly condemn where the US is concerned .
Whilst Saddam Hussein may have cause for celebration , the Iraqi population , his people , are sinking further each time into crisis and poverty .
Our principles of freedom and democracy will cross frontiers all the better when conditions conducive to dialogue are restored .
I have just voted in favour of the Amending Budget 1/2001 of the European Union for the 2001 financial year , which provides for an extra EUR 971 million to cope with the consequences of the BSE crisis .
We do not .
Indeed , a small majority of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities again managed to exaggerate the issue by an incredible amount , thus distorting the main aim of this report , whose basic position I support ; in other words , to include the dimension of gender and mainstreaming in the European Union ' s Euro-Mediterranean policy , with particular focus on globalisation and its implications for female migration .
We believe that if a Parliamentary Committee decides to adopt an own-initiative report , the report should , on the one hand , be on a subject not tackled by other committees , and , on the other hand , be adopted as a result of a broad consensus within the same Committee .
We must gradually free ourselves from this policy and instead consider development as a multifaceted issue , so that eliminating poverty is a reality rather than just a mythical objective .
Madam President , I have been asking to speak for 15 minutes .
I think that we can draw an analogy between this situation and our own .
Lastly , I shall mention the requirement for Parliament to maintain its credibility .
I have always respected him for this attitude , in spite of our conflicting political beliefs .
They want us to believe that the transport of radioactive materials is not a matter for the nuclear industry and that we , the Group of the Greens , are in the wrong debate .
This is an essentially industrial solution which must really be decided on the basis of technical and economic criteria and in terms of the need to reduce highly radioactive waste .
Having said that , I have four comments to make .
We have to work in the context of universal public assets .
There have been great strides forward in public opinion regarding the regulation of international trade .
Regarding the precautionary principle which you have just stressed , I think it is clear that BSE and , more recently , foot-and-mouth disease inevitably raise questions of this kind .
On intellectual property , let me stress one point that Mrs Kinnock raised and which is highlighted in a topical court case in South Africa , where the pharmaceutical industry is in conflict with the South African Government .
We shall return to that matter when the time comes .
The Council was not wrong-footed by this approach and opted to renew this COM for a further five-year period .
Firstly , we have to put into context any reference to a world price , since it cannot be seen as representative of the transactions actually carried out .
I would like to thank all the officials in Parliament ' s secretarial service for the invaluable help they have given me in drawing up this report , as well as all the fellow Members who took a very active part in this draft .
Unfortunately , although today 's proposal is more flexible on certain points , it remains open to several serious criticisms .
I believe that while the directive gives the Member States a degree of flexibility in managing their asylum system for the duration of the temporary protection , it also guarantees the beneficiaries absolute access to the asylum procedure , and at all events does so at the moment when the protection period expires .
Moreover , the concept of voluntary action by both sides introduces a transparent system .
Not only is the Council exercising the power of initiative that belongs to the Commission ; on top of that it now wants to deprive the Commission of the implementing powers conferred on it by the Treaties .
They follow on from the pictures of the 58 Chinese immigrants who reached Dover only to be found dead among crates of tomatoes , of the fugitives from Bangladesh , Pakistan , Albania , Iraq , Africa or any other region stricken by poverty and war .
Do we want a Europe that shuts itself off from the world ; do we want a Europe that sorts people out and divides them up into good and bad refugees , acceptable immigrants and permanent exiles ?
The Commission can endorse the aim of the Portuguese proposal for a regulation concerning the period during which third-country nationals who are exempt from the visa requirement can travel freely within the territory of the Member States .
The discussions that will follow this communication and that will cover every aspect of the policy on repatriation promise to be very difficult , in view of the tensions between the Member States ' need to implement the decisions and , on the other hand , the obvious human dimension .
It is time to stand back and think , rather than rushing ahead , and to take the necessary steps to establish effective cooperation between the national prevention policies .
That derogation is unacceptable , for it is common knowledge that the majority of applications for asylum are unfounded and just made to gain time
