Liberalisation is also partly responsible for undermining port security at a time when major investments are otherwise being made in securing the ports against terrorism .
It is the Danish model for agreements that is in danger .
It is quite conceivable that other groups of workers will be up for consideration .
The amendments adopted by Parliament during its reading of the report were a serviceable compromise between those who want a total liberalisation of port services and those who think we should take account of our workers .
If we accept the compromise , port workers will lose their jobs , simply because seafarers on ships calling at EU ports have been allowed to handle cargoes .
We do not want ports of convenience , just as we do not want ships sailing under flags of convenience .
Now , an attempt is being made to get rid of this solidarity by means of a bad piece of EU legislation .
Those campaigning for liberalisation say that not so many people are in any case employed on modern ships and that the Port Directive will not therefore mean fewer port workers .
It is , however , precisely because there are not especially many people employed on modern ships that we should leave it to the competent port workers to ensure that cargoes are handled properly .
We are now therefore opening the door to poorly trained labour that may jeopardise port security .
I myself come from a seaport in Denmark , and I am very familiar indeed with the problems .
We divide up the amount of goods and , in that way , ensure optimum use of the different ports , at the same time as preserving free competition .
What training opportunities do they have ?
It is too bad that group discipline is allowed to decide these matters .
If , moreover , the port workers are to be given help , we can give it them by voting against this bad document from the conciliation committee .     – Mr President , on 12 December 2002 , the International Maritime Organisation’s ( IMO’s ) diplomatic conference adopted a new Chapter XI-2 , on special measures to promote maritime safety , as part of the IMO’s SOLAS ( Safety of Life at Sea ) Convention , together with a new code named the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code ( ISPS Code ) , which seems to be of fundamental importance to the establishment of a global maritime safety system .
On 2 May 2003 , the Commission presented the European Parliament and the Council with a Draft Regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security .
The purpose of this draft is to introduce these new instruments into Community law , together with the necessary interpretative provisions .
The European Parliament will abstain from voting on it at first reading on 19 November 2003 .
The IMO has no intention of granting more time in which to implement these measures .
In accordance with the relevant regulations of the ISPS Code , it will therefore be possible for any vessel that , after 1 July 2004 , does not comply with the safety arrangements laid down in these international instruments to be refused access to any port in a state that is a member of the IMO.     Mr President , Mr Antonione , Commissioner , the democratic deficit in the EU is , in fact , often talked about .
That is the deficit that we in Parliament must make up , and Parliament’s influence on the budget and budget control are crucial in this area .
It is Parliament that does this .
I hope that they accept the Convention’s proposal concerning the budget procedure , for it is balanced in a way with which they can be satisfied .
At present , Parliament has , of course , real influence , both upon the annual budget and the financial estimates .
Under the Convention’s proposal , we should be surrendering a little of the latter form of influence , for we can , at present , say at any time that we do not accept the multiannual budget framework but are returning to annual budgeting , for that is what is specified in the Treaty .
That is the balance in the Convention’s proposal .
I also look forward to the Danish Government’s denying press reports that it would support one of the finance ministers ’ proposals , namely the proposal to introduce unanimity in the European Council when the financial estimates are adopted , for that cannot be right .
Denmark’s point of departure is that the European Parliament must have greater , not less , influence over the budget .
What we have here is a non-binding recommendation in an area outside Parliament’s competence .
The subject is frighteningly important .
I am able to say that George Orwell’s nightmare visions of Big Brother pale in comparison with this state of affairs .
The systems are to a large extent secret , particularly for those implicated .
Evermore extended use is being made , officially and unofficially , of the information collected .
The original rationale behind the Schengen Information System , or what was known as SIS I – namely nothing more nor less than the securing of border controls – has long since been replaced by an ambition to collect police information in the broad sense of the term .
I am unfamiliar with my fellow MEP’s , Mr Coelho’s , background and motives .
What I contest is the realism and usefulness of the proposals .
The misuse of such a legal vacuum is an almost inevitable consequence of the police state factors that are already present and that have been approved .     Mr President , in purely formal terms , the three reports we are debating today concern the issue of the
