to remind you that , on behalf of my group , I tabled an oral question on the visit by the Veterinary Committee to Portugal because I should like to be told of the findings of that visit .
But it is not enough to be right ; you have to know how to be right and the Commission does not know .
This confirms that the European institutions are aware of the importance of their role in improving the quality of public health and intend to do so in response to public practice , given that an increasing number of people are turning to these complementary forms of medicine .
It is important not only that the European Union should be willing to do something but also that the Member States should respond .
The Commission 's Culture 2000 Programme had many positive aspects : it is a multiannual programme , integrating different sectors .
The question is : either we spend enough to create the critical mass for culture to bear fruit , by encouraging quality , individually or socially , or we decide to give culture peanuts .
As for cultural diversity , culture cannot be dealt with like some statistic , defined once and for all .
To put it another way : this subject and this report really deserve a debate , whereas instead it seems that everything has been done to prevent one .
The report was due to be included in the agenda of the November II or December part-sessions but seemed to have been left off both the draft and final agendas for this part-session .
Of course not .
Although Mr Skinner seems satisfied that the second version , in his opinion , has dispelled 'any ambiguity in this matter ', he draws attention , albeit only in the explanatory statement , to the fact that industrial conflicts standing in the way of trade , the reason behind this Council and Commission initiative , do not occur at random and may be closely linked to the content or absence of other legislation on occupational issues , an equally urgent matter .
Culture cannot be dealt with as a statistic , defined once and for all .
Waddington report ( A4-0373/98 ) Mr President , the issue of education/training is so essential to our societies that so many people wanted to speak in this debate that I have been forced to put what I had to say in writing .
This calls for serious thought and a wide-ranging debate on teaching children from primary school onwards throughout the European Union the same foreign language that can be used as a language of communication .
That is why I have asked for a debate to be held here .
This is not an issue on which we are giving our opinion for the first time .
The Commission should do this as quickly as possibly , by 1 December , as our colleague Mr Fabra Vall√©s has asked .
This huge market has also given rise to new forms of computer piracy and crime specialising in fraud and counterfeiting , or so-called cybercrime .
For example , on the subject of combating the falsification of euro notes and coins , the Commission statement calls for close cooperation and mutual assistance between UCLAF , the ECB and Europol .
We must in any case continue to compile , assess and update data on money counterfeiting practices , circuits and networks if we are to protect the euro .
Mr President , everyone knows that since 1990 the rules governing clinical trials in the European Union , and internationally , have been codified in directives on good clinical practice .
That is why it is important to have ethics committees and for them to be transparent and independent .
Which Member States could be picked out as the bad pupils ?
In other words , the principle of equal opportunities for men and women is to be included in all sectoral policies .
It is obvious that in the first employment plan for 1998 , not all countries have attached the same importance to the four pillars nor found solutions for all of the guidelines .
Another important point is that at all future summits of the Heads of State or Government , monitoring these national employment plans will be the subject of a compulsory analysis , enabling all concerned - governments , parliaments , both sides of industry and non-governmental organisations taking an interest in this process - to follow these matters attentively and regularly .
Unemployment is not inevitable but I would not wish on other countries in the European Union the solution applied in large areas of Portugal , where all three generations have to work in order to scrape together the minimum wage paid in Spain , half the minimum wage in Belgium , and a quarter the minimum wage in Germany , albeit with almost full employment .
It is on the question of employment and not on the problem and the statistics of unemployment .
We would highlight the ambiguity , in particular , of the first pillar , that of employability , a concept that seems to hold the unemployed responsible for the very existence of unemployment because they are poorly qualified .
The European Union 's new economic framework , resulting from the completion of the Single Market and the new monetary policy , which is about to come into effect , makes interaction between economic policy and social policy all the more important and accentuates the need to consolidate relations between EMU, the Single Market , the cohesion policy and effective social and employment policies .
Mr President , first of all I should like to say that I will always be the first to defend close links with the United States : we are talking about the world 's two main blocs and they both have special responsibilities .
