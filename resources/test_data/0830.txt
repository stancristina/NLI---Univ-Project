As a result one million birds and a hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles are killed each year .
The MARPOL Convention aims to prevent pollution from ships but legislation is clearly necessary to ensure the convention is enforced .
That is why this directive is so important and why tonight I am pleased to welcome the progress that has been made in Council to reach a common position which will force ships to dispose of their waste at port reception facilities .
I also commend the work of the rapporteur , whose commitment reflects the strength of feeling within our committee to tackling this particular problem and a strong desire amongst parliamentarians of all parties to call a halt to this environmentally disastrous practice .
I particularly welcome his strong support for the proposal that , in the interests of improving pollution prevention and avoiding distortions of competition , the environmental requirements should apply to all ships irrespective of the flag they fly and adequate waste reception facilities be made available in all ports throughout the Community .
An area where British Labour Members take issue with the rapporteur is the way in which the polluter-pays principle is to be applied .
The principle is one we strongly support but we believe it can be more effectively enforced if Member States retain the power to establish their own charging systems appropriate to their own circumstances .
For example , in the UK the system by which a ship pays the waste collector each time it uses waste facilities , without the port getting involved , works well .
It is based on a consensus which has been forged by all the players , including the ports and environmental groups like RSPB and the World Wildlife Fund .
However , we share the rapporteur 's concern that different charging systems should not lead to greater risk of maritime pollution .
That is why we back the Council proposal to strengthen the review clause to ensure the impact of the directive is monitored regularly .
Could I begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work on this very important dossier , and by congratulating the Commissioner and the Commission for bringing forward this proposal .
We are all very aware that one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency , quite rightly , is to tackle the scandalous position regarding road safety in the European Union .
I know they are familiar figures , but 43 000 citizens are killed each and every year .
That is the equivalent to a medium-sized town being wiped off the face of the earth every year .
We therefore welcome this initiative as a means of at least trying to ensure the heavy goods vehicles are as safe as is possible and comply with Community legislation .
Lorry traffic on EU roads is growing both in numbers and in size and we think there are three reasons why this proposal is so important .
Firstly , the safety argument that we have already heard about .
Secondly , the fair competition argument that my colleague Mr Jarzembowski has already referred to - the need to create a level playing field throughout the Community .
Thirdly , there are also the environmental benefits - the possibility of ensuring quieter and less polluting vehicles .
There is clearly a need for EU-wide random checks , and the UK - my own Member State - has already been applying such a system with very positive results .
This proposal will inevitably be bad news for cowboy operators , but as well as being bad news for them , it is going to be good news for all other road users , particularly the vast majority of lorry drivers , owners and operators who are conscientious about the quality , safety and environmental standards of their vehicles .
I welcome this initiative and I hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible .
Mr President , my Group would like to welcome the annual legislative programme .
However , we have some concerns about the process .
I came to this procedure as a relatively new Member of this House .
It was with some incredulity that I found myself faced with these various draft resolutions from each of the groups , all of them very much resembling shopping lists of differing lengths and ingredients .
Indeed , to carry the metaphor further and using the English usage , if we were going to make a meal from these it would be rather long and rather indigestible .
I understand that it has been the normal tradition to obediently produce these lists .
Now , I am not particularly radical or revolutionary , but it seemed to my colleagues that this process lacked something , especially at a time when we are trying to reconnect Europe with its citizens , when we want them to be clear about what we are doing here .
There has been much talk about concentrating on core tasks and of achieving better quality of European legislation rather than more quantity .
All this sits rather uneasily with endless lists .
With this in mind , we produced a one-page resolution highlighting key areas .
However , this has not reached the compromise resolution , so we wish now to put down a clear marker for the future about how this process should be conducted .
We should like to suggest that , since this is a very important process and moment in our legislative cycle , and to enable the Commission and Parliament to approach it in a constructive way , the annual state of the Union address could be combined with a resolution from Parliament on key political priorities and then go to the committees for more detailed debate .
This would get away from the shopping-list approach and give more political focus .
It would
