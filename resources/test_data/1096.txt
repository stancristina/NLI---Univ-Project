example is a telling one in terms of the figure given .
Telecommunications companies will be able to be linked up to the system .
It is good that EU Foreign Affairs Ministers and Ministers for Development Cooperation are responding quickly , agreeing on EU measures to help people in the crisis area and begin reconstruction .
Now a new deadline has been set for 2007 ; who knows what it would have been but for this disaster .
We just have to hope that all the promises made will be kept .
This incident alerted the Western world , as the presence of tourists made it seem so near .
Help is needed when the face of human suffering is a foreign one .     Mr President , relations between the United States of America and Europe are going through a critical phase .
It is important that transatlantic relations in the future are built on dialogue , not confrontation .
Regarding global issues , the EU and the United States need to act in a context of broader cooperation .
Cooperation must be increased on environmental issues , natural disasters and humanitarian catastrophes .
Finally , I wish to say that I appreciate the fact that President Bush will be visiting Brussels right at the start of his second term .     Mr President , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I had the honour of participating in the meeting of the World Economic Forum as part of the Young Global Leaders programme .
On the opening day of the Forum , an interactive Global Town Hall discussion was held .
What , for example , would we imagine that men between the ages of 40 and 60 , mainly from the EU or North America , and half of whom are business executives , think are the greatest challenges posed by globalisation ?
The greatest challenges , as proposed by this group , were the elimination of poverty , the establishment of equitable globalisation and the management of climate change .
Global responsibility has progressed a great deal when leading businessmen say that to eliminate poverty people have to go beyond their normal way of thinking , extend the benefits of globalisation to the poorest regions and create global leadership to combat climate change .
Globalisation does not appear in the end to be the sort of divisive factor that the left-hand side of this Chamber believes it to be .
I am certain that there are also initiatives connected with the World Social Forum on which we have the same views .
Yesterday I spoke here in plenary .
My colleagues could not understand a word I was saying in Finnish .
This is a constant problem for all the small language groups in Parliament .
The same thing happened at the start of this sitting with Polish , a very nice language .
As we know , growth in the EU has not been as good as we expected .
However , we cannot rely only on public investment to stimulate growth : we must give incentives to stimulate private investment , which is the real source of sustainable growth in Europe .
The idea behind this was for the Member States to pay off their debts in the good times and to ensure , by reforming the structures of the public sector , that their budgets could be kept balanced in the bad times as well .
However , it is not easy for us politicians to restrain ourselves from increasing spending in good times .
I am strongly in favour of the Pact .
However , we should be wary of watering down the Pact .
Secondly , no expenditure , such as public investments or research funding , should be automatically excluded from public expenditure : these exceptions would provide an opportunity for Member States to interpret them in a very innovative way .
I hope that good common sense will win out and that the Stability and Growth Pact will remain ; and , if any changes are made to it , at least let us direct them in a favourable direction .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful for the excellent work that has been done .
During its 20-year history , the Capital of Culture project has proved to be a success .
Lowering the threshold and broadening the cultural arena is therefore a positive thing .
The city is our closest cultural environment .
Most Central Europeans have to put up with permanent noise pollution .
We are evolving into a digital network-aided cultural society .
A Capital of Culture is hardly likely to grow up around a lorry terminal .
Models should be built showing what a city in the cultured network society should be like .
A global digital networked environment .
There is a political gulf between the priorities set for the Community and the lack of clarity regarding financing .
We need a special fund .
A key challenge for the European Union is to protect the diversity of nature in the area we all share .
Every Member State has committed itself to this by drawing up a list of its conservation areas in accordance with the Habitats Directive .
The areas must not see any significant reduction in the natural resources which qualify them for inclusion in the Natura network .
At the same time as focusing our attention on various details , we should still make very specific mention of the leading violators of human rights , China and Russia .
These two words of accusation can destroy the innocent lives of peace-loving citizens .
Using the concept of the ‘Evil Cult ’ as a pretext , the authorities in China arrest and imprison countless numbers of people .
These people are not responsible for civil disorder and do not pose a threat to others .
