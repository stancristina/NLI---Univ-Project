The European Union has for a long time demonstrated its support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity .
The European Union regards this framework as constituting a transparent space appropriate to the search for a political solution to the conflict .
I am also aware that air transport is not without risks .
There is a great temptation to cut back on training , maintenance or staff , and safety is threatened .
For the present , there is nothing tangible that would allow us to call into question either the condition of the aircraft , the professionalism of the Egyptian charter company FlashAirlines , the earnestness of the Egyptian civil aviation authority or the reliability of the technical controls that were carried out on that aircraft .
I think that is a necessity for all of us , even if for some the priority is to find someone to blame .
However that may be , the starting point is simple : every vessel has a flag that belongs to a country , since there is no European flag .
Some are technical changes , for example , specifying the ships to which the regulation does not apply , warships in particular .
That is why we have met this evening and I would like to congratulate the various authors of the texts that are the subject of this debate and say how important it is that we should define the crime of ‘illegal discharges ’ and insist on the necessary coordination so that the Member States will at last work by common agreement .
No one can say who would be authorised to mobilise and deploy such an instrument , which has a very direct bearing on the security of the Member States , assuming a way could ever be found to pay for it .
We must find a solution that will ensure that the Member States comply with the measures adopted by the European Union in the field of maritime safety and agree to receive vessels in distress in harbours of refuge .
For example , 350 000 lorries should embark each year at Montoire to travel to Spain .
When , finally , it comes to the safety of nuclear installations while they are being operated or decommissioned , I also wish to congratulate my colleague , Mr Seppänen , who has been very skilful in carrying out his work as rapporteur .
The proposed instrument provides for the continuation of the system of dock dues , with an exemption mechanism for certain local products from our four French overseas departments of Guadeloupe , French Guiana , Martinique and Réunion , for a ten-year period beginning on 1 July 2004 .
An objective assessment of the real situation is needed , because the conviction that the market does everything better is becoming an article of dogma and is dividing Europe into two camps .
Key areas such as education , health and water must not be liberalised , and there is a need to recognise the increasingly numerous hybrid situations in which social , economic and environmental factors are intertwined .
For this reason , I strongly urge you not to retreat into party or national blocs but to make up your own mind on each amendment , on each article , motivated only by the general interest of the European people .     Mr President , may I begin by thanking this House and especially Mr Herzog , your rapporteur , for the remarkable efforts you have devoted to this complex and delicate issue that the Commission raised in its Green Paper on services of general interest .
In the meantime , a White Paper could define the political framework for our future activity or else provide a road map for the pursuit of the sectoral approach .
Recital H , for example , emphasises that liberalisation in leading sectors in the internal market is a factor in technological progress and economic efficiency , while paragraph 13 welcomes the liberalisation that has taken place in the fields of telecommunications , postal services , transport and energy .
I should like to add two elements to the debate .
My group is in favour of deliberations that would culminate in the identification of the interests that are common to all European service users and of measures to guarantee the funding of the identified services .
It is fundamental , because our European model , the envy of the world , and the most elementary civil rights , chiefly enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , are at stake .
First of all , it is necessary to affirm the fundamental legitimacy of services of general interest .
If the social model were to be taken away from them , what would be left in the coming months ?
In political terms , then , the problem is relatively clear , and I do not really distinguish any great differences between the various ways in which you have described the contours you would give these services of general interest , or public services , if they had to be more precisely defined at the European level .
To avoid any misunderstandings – and I will be coming back to this when I respond to the debate , with reference in particular to the point raised by the rapporteur – this initiative does not cover the ‘executive’ agencies that help to manage Community programmes .
The advantage of having such an instrument on the regulatory agencies is that it would exist in parallel to the framework regulation on the status of the executive agencies , which was adopted by the Council in December 2002 .
As you are aware , after Cancún , the Commission embarked on a phase of in-depth reflection and consultation of Parliament , the Member States , the social partners and civil society .
Nevertheless , will this mean that negotiations will proceed at a
