Mr President , I too wish to express my group 's appreciation of the valuable work done by the UNHCR , both on the ground and in policy terms .
There is a desperate need for a body that defends the individual right to asylum and actually looks for best practice in terms of treatment for refugees , not the lowest common denominator and policies of deterrence , which some Member States and political parties seem determined to follow .
There are arguments for including the UNHCR in the formal policy process of the Union to make the best possible use of their advice and experience .
As others have said , we also need to ensure adequate funding for this organisation .
Our own contributions have fallen in recent times as have those of our Member States and yet , as others have said , the need grows .
Anyone who was at the recent exhibition in the European Parliament and who studied the pictures and the script dealing with the work of the UNHCR in the world at the moment I think would agree that it is one of the saddest exhibitions that we have ever had the misfortune to see in our Parliament .
Mr President , the present crisis is founded upon the Turkish proposal to transfer prisoners from large wards to smaller prison cells .
This treatment would be exactly like we see in Western Europe and , faced with the protests , the Minister Hikmet Sami Turk has postponed the transfer so that a social and political consensus upon prison reform be developed throughout Turkey .
This is surely the correct approach and fully consistent with the government 's expressed wish to meet the political requirements for the accession partnership with the Union .
For that reason , we oppose the GUE/NGL resolution .
Mr President , I wonder if Commissioner Patten can explain to me how the Commission is going to help repair a submarine , which is what we really just voted on .
Mr President , in the Minutes I am recorded as having voted in favour of paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Theato report .
I did not , I abstained .
I should be grateful if that could be corrected .
Mr President , I am very pleased to speak on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
This is a most important topic , especially with a growing ageing population in Europe .
The solidarity of different age groups and actors involved in this field is vital in this regard .
One should emphasise that unity , not only between nations and regions but also between people , is an area in which the European Union has a very proud record , and this report emphasises that fact .
Low employment of ageing workers is a matter that the European Parliament should have tackled far earlier .
I am very pleased with the emphasis in the report on reviewing the tax and benefit schemes to provide incentives to take up job offers : this is an initiative that is welcome .
Promoting life-long learning - a topic that has already been mentioned by another speaker - is a matter I also support .
With new technology and distance-learning possibilities open to older people , real , new opportunities offer themselves to them and they should be allowed to take advantage of this .
On social protection policies : in its work programme for 1999 , the Commission paid particular attention to ways to reverse the trend towards early retirement , to explore new forms of gradual retirement and to make pension schemes more sustainable and flexible .
On policies against discrimination and social exclusion : the social action programme sets out the Commission 's intentions to explore the possibilities for developing new Community action programmes based on Articles 13 , 129 and 139 , as modified in Amsterdam , and that is something we all welcome .
The attention given to medical and social research related to ageing is an excellent emphasis in the report .
Perhaps - and I say this as a member of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport - sport and exercise should have been given more emphasis to keep ageing people fit and healthy - but that is something I am sure the rapporteur is well aware of .
I welcome the excellent initiative on the part of the rapporteur and give it every support on behalf of my Group .
Mr President , my father , Robert Purvis , is 90 and not too well just now .
He is much of the reason why I am here - an MEP , a Scotsman , a European .
In the early 1930s he spent much time in Germany .
He had good German friends .
He witnessed and worried about the rise of Nazism .
While I was very small he was away for long periods , parachuted into southern Serbia to support the brave fight of the royalist Serbs against Nazism .
Next he parachuted into the Hautes-Alpes of France to fight with the Maquis and prepare that part of Europe for liberation .
I have photographs of him as the tricolour was raised anew in Mont-Dauphin and Brian√ßon .
Immediately after the war he went back to Germany to help restore agriculture and food supplies in North Rhine-Westphalia , Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein .
My brother and I joined him there .
We played in the rubble of Hamburg , we made good German friends in our turn .
On my first day in this Parliament , in 1979 , one of our then German colleagues approached me .
" Are you Purvis ? "
" Yes . "
" I remember rocking you
