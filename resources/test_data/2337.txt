Moreover , there is another thing which really surprises me , in addition to my fellow MEPs failure to understand the reality of the situation and to the praise forthcoming from the large political groups .
These negotiations have taken place in the strictest confidence , with all the small groups excluded .
The major groups have gone through this process without the rest of us being involved at all in these negotiations .
This , I would point out , contravenes the basic rules of the Treaty which presuppose that there are three independent institutions which play their part .
What we are concerned with here , moreover , is a matter concerning public access to documents .
Mr President , I cannot support the new rules concerning transparency because they impose a common limit upon transparency and open the way to directly retrograde steps .
Documents which are at present in the public domain may be classified tomorrow .
At present , we in practice operate with common minimum rules governing transparency .
The EU Regulation makes the rules the same in every country .
The Member States will now be obliged to conform to the common rules and consult the EU authorities before they make documents available .
Just look at recitals 9a and 12 , which exclude better national legislation , and Article 4a of the Regulation in which the Member States are obliged to consult the EU.
See the text on euobserver.com , if you do not have it in your briefcases .
At present , progress can be made by means of pressure from the ombudsman , decisions by the Court of Justice or a simple majority in the Council of Ministers , that is to say eight out of fifteen countries .
From tomorrow , any progress will require 62 out of 87 votes in the Council , and the Court of Justice and the countries in favour of transparency will not be able to help us obtain clear rules in the Regulation .
It would be in the greater interests of transparency if we were to defer the decision today and see how the Council and the Commission are to interpret the new rules .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Parliament is taking an important step today on the road towards the greater transparency which we have been talking about for so many years .
What we have here are marked improvements .
The exceptions to this rule are few but well-founded , and the rules governing the lodging of complaints have been tightened up on .
This must not , however , overshadow the fact that this is a good compromise in which the EU is setting a standard for transparency unknown in many of the EU' s Member States .
It also depends upon a culture of transparency .
Transparency ought not to be perceived as an inconvenience for the administration .
Transparency is an advantage , not only for democracy but also for the authorities to which it extends .
The Commission should forget the lack of public access that characterised its first proposal and straightforwardly adopt the new proposal and the new spirit .
In three years ' time , practical experience must constitute a sufficient argument , and this is what we shall spend the next three years acquiring .
We must make sure that countries which are sceptical come to see for themselves that transparency is beneficial to democracy .
Mr President , first of all , I want to congratulate Mr Cashman , Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Watson .
Such is life .
A decision for or against is then made .
That is because there are no other possibilities when no further progress can be made at the negotiating table .
The compromise reached in the negotiations concerning public access to EU documents is in no way what I would have wished for at the start of the negotiations , and it contains weaknesses , as has already been pointed out .
However , it is the first step in the right direction , and it means that , in a few years ' time , we can take the next step .
I can well understand why the compromise has been called a victory for the willingness to negotiate .
We in the Nordic countries have good traditions of administrative transparency and , naturally enough , we took these as our point of departure .
In other words , our points of view were worlds apart .
We often find them self-satisfied and overly correct , but as a rule we are , of course , just envious .
We therefore have fewer reservations about voting in favour of the compromise when we see that Swedish colleagues in our group , together with the Swedish Presidency , are able to recommend a vote in favour .
We shall carefully monitor the implementation of the result that has now been achieved .
At the same time , it is our assessment that we would not have achieved a better result by letting the matter go to a second reading .
If a system is to enjoy our citizens ' confidence , it is not sufficient for it merely to be open under the rules .
A great deal of work remains to be done here by citizens and the press , who must use the new rules actively and who must also test the limits of these new rules .
The GUE/NGL Group dissociates itself from the result of the closed negotiations and we have today voted against the compromise between the European Parliament ' s two biggest political groups , the Council and the Commission .
The rules concerning which documents can be excluded from public access are so unclear that it will not be difficult to keep secret almost any document
