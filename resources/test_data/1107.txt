The incentive measures must support employment policy , and that is why the incentive measures are important .
These amendments relate to five different points .
Secondly , the parties in the labour market , together with the relevant local and regional authorities , must be involved .
Fourthly , an assessment and revision of the open coordination method must be set in motion .
And fifthly , the programme must be extended to include pilot projects as well .
What , in other words , we are concerned with here is a quite extensive alteration to the incentive measures which , in a way , were good enough originally .
I hope that the Commission and the Council are ready to demonstrate the same drive that we have tried to demonstrate here in Parliament .
Mr President , I have a dream .
Turkey must make a choice , however : a choice between the future and a past characterised by ethnic oppression , torture , the death penalty and absence of legal security .
I should also like to call upon Turkey and the Commission to make special efforts to reconstruct the villages destroyed by Turkish authorities in eastern Turkey .
This might , for example , be via the project developed by , for example , Erik Siesby at the Danish Centre for Kurdish Human Rights , and I know that they have sent details of the project to the Commission .
Madam President , I would also alert you to the fact that I have a vested interest in copyright matters in connection with Danish Radio , and I am therefore abstaining from voting .
Madam President , the reason why I have asked permission to speak is because , pursuant to Article 144 of the Rules of Procedure , the EDD Group is requesting that the matter be referred back to committee .
In fact , the directive in view is overwhelmingly concerned with health policy , which is why , legally , it pertains to another part of the Treaty , namely Article 152 .
However , a series of other measures may be adopted .
The least we must demand is that the issue be investigated , and we would therefore ask for the matter to be referred back to committee .
Madam President , I should like to speak in favour of the proposal for I believe that , if the least suspicion can be created that we are exceeding the legal basis for our work , then we have a problem in a Parliament which takes a serious approach to its work .
In the vote , we have voted in favour of amendments that will make it possible for public service stations to develop what are known as their 'on demand ' services .
We have done this because we think it important that no unnecessary obstacles should be placed in the way of public service stations continuing to be a part of the overall media picture .
We have attached crucial importance to public service stations naturally having to pay for the use of materials to which others have the rights .
Our framework - Regulation No 1408/71 - whereby countries ' reciprocal agreements ensure that people also have these rights in practice has become more and more complex throughout the years and , what with this and general bureaucracy , it is often no simple matter at all to move from country to country .
The question arises as to whether , in addition to simplifying and improving the regulation for EU citizens , we can also ensure that it will be possible for third-country nationals engaged in active employment and resident in EU countries to be covered by the regulation .
At the Nice Summit , Denmark fought hard against changing Article 42 and against majority voting in connection with Article 42 .
I would urge that it not all be allowed to collapse in legal wranglings and problems concerning the legal basis , for Danish business too will have an interest in a solution ' s being found to this problem so that , for example , foreign experts legally resident in Denmark can be posted to another EU country for a period and retain their social security rights and so that we can have experts over to Denmark from other EU countries .
Mr President , I heard Mr Danielsson say that it would be difficult to be clearer than he had been in his answers .
I would also say that it is difficult to be the Swedish President-in-Office of the Council for , as my fellow MEP Mr Sj√∂stedt said so clearly , there are two possible answers to the question that has been asked , and they are either yes or no .
Instead , Mr Danielsson comes out with a long explanation to the effect that the operations are in keeping with the UN Charter .
They always maintain that it is not .
There are , as likely as not , people who draw the conclusion that no UN mandate is required .
In this way , it will be prohibited , where such documents are concerned , to exercise the right to freedom of expression and public access to documents under the Swedish constitution .
The Court will adopt a position on whether what counts is the interpretation of the Council of Europe , Sweden and Denmark and a few other countries of officials ' right to express opinions , or whether it is , instead , the advocate-general ' s restrictive interpretation that counts .
Mr President , the policy pursued by many Member States and , to an ever greater degree , by the EU too in this area gives us all a direct share of responsibility for the corpses at Dover and for the bodies washed up on
