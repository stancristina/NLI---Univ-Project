barely prepared for the change .
Mr President , I am not aware of any legal guarantees on the subject , but only of a political commitment .
Obviously , our problem is that Russia 's economic difficulties cannot be overcome with the support of the international community alone .
If we learn any more , we shall glad to forward the information to the honourable Member .
He will be here tomorrow at the Commission meeting , and I will ask him to reply separately to you on that point .
ECU 300 million has been spent on this , and there has been an immense amount of cooperation among experts .
I believe the Commission has a very good overall picture of the situation , but I am prepared to ask our experts in the field to provide the honourable Member with detailed information if she so wishes .
Mr President , I agree completely .
The second area in which I think the rules are lax concerns the invigilators ' right to intervene in disturbances , or when someone is cheating , for example .
That is why it is important that the Commission 's decision to annul the competition was taken quickly , and that a whole new competition should be organised carefully and thoroughly .
This is not a defence of the misconduct that has taken place , but it does oblige us to consider whether or not the competitions should in future be made more controllable .
Firstly , the candidates are obviously guilty who entered the competition fraudulently .
Thirdly , we have to judge separately the responsibility of the administrative staff in this case , in the light of how feasible the present rules governing supervision are .
As for costs , the total costs of the competition were high , amounting to ECU 1.2 million .
Mr President , it is difficult for me to anticipate any future legal decisions .
This has to be viewed very seriously , and action must be taken accordingly .
Unfortunately , I am afraid that most of the candidates will have to make the sacrifice once again .
There have not been any political decisions taken in the EU that might lend support to the exploitation of renewable energy sources .
What does the Commission think ?
If the Structural Funds are cut , it will be the EU regions scheduled for development that will pay .
If Germany pays less into the EU budget , the others will pay more for expansion .
If Britain is paid a smaller rebate from EU funds , it will be the British taxpayers who will be paying more for expansion .
As for my own country , Finland , I might point out that , if customs revenues were taken into account in the budget , we too would be net contributors .
We shall not achieve a politically justified enlargement without all the present Member States putting money into future member countries .
Combating these diseases cannot , however , be just a matter of health policy , but their prevention requires action in all areas of social policy .
I can give you one example of a Finnish success story regarding the reduction of lead in the atmosphere .
In one decade in Finland we brought about a dramatic fall in the lead content in the atmosphere by reducing the tax on unleaded petrol , i .e . through a policy of taxation .
I also support the suggestion that the financial framework for the programme should be increased toECU 7 million .
People seeking the recognition of qualifications should , however , be allowed to choose a method themselves by which they can show their qualifications : either through application tests or adaptation periods .
The whole area of reciprocal recognition of examinations and qualifications is a vital one in the practical development of European cooperation .
The issue concerns not only the movement of skilled and professional people , but also the participation of students and young people in educational and exchange programmes and the wish for them to acquire experience alongside their studies , as well as developing a facility for European cooperation .
But at the same time , there has to be an awareness that the education programme must also include the recognition of examinations passed and qualifications gained in another Member State One problem is still a lack of knowledge of the workings of the common system for recognition and the possibility of an appeal .
The Commission should now look very closely into the experience gained from the application of the recognition system and the possible practical problems that exist , and embark on the further action needed , on the basis of a comparative study and the progress made .
I think the rapporteur made exactly the right decision in repeating his views as expressed at first reading .
I think it is most odd that Council has not been able to approve them .
For example , the agreement procedures that are involved in highly innovative projects must be very flexible , as the rapporteur states .
This requires flexibility in the agreement procedure .
Fraud prevention should also be common to , and standard in , all Union activity and should also be clearly and tightly regulated to a sufficient extent across the board .
In addition , negative decisions and the reasons for them have to be submitted in writing .
The importance of information technology in communications between the different parties involved in projects cannot be emphasised enough .
In this way , there will be sufficiently more resources for researchers to carry out their research work .
There has to be more openness , therefore , but not at the cost of the protection of information .
Mr President , we are facing an immense challenge .
