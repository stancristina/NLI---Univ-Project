Mr President , in 1995 , the Commission submitted the communication on the development of short sea shipping on the basis of the strategy which was formulated in the White Paper on the common transport policy .
Speed might not be the main feature of short sea shipping , safety is .
In its communication , the European Commission provided a sound overview of the issue as a whole .
Parliament and your rapporteur have looked at the Commission plans with a critical eye and tried , in consultation with all parties involved , as befits a Parliament , to compile this report .
Cars are a good example of this .
At every level , excessive bureaucratic procedures and endless red tape accompany the cargo .
In my report , I also call for incentives from the Commission , which are needed to promote short shipping .
This is certainly true , relatively speaking .
The rapporteur is right to point this out .
If I can use this opportunity , I would just like to say that it would perhaps be sensible if in future , for example , we do not manage to vote on a Tuesday evening , we could squeeze in an extra round of voting , so that we do not incur further delays during the rest of the week .
However , as a result of different provisions which have been agreed in conjunction with the Council , and following judgments by the Court of Justice , this line has now more or less expired after three years .
It could be that they are looking for a general angle and at the same time specific angles , but at any rate , this is all taking up too much time , as the budget lines are expiring .
As such , we are thus not asking for a new treaty , but for some attention .
Yesterday ' s incident caused a great deal of confusion .
Hence it is preferable for various Member States to sign and ratify the Council of Europe ' s Convention .
I principally assent to the formulations proposed by Denmark , although I wonder whether the illegal trade in threatened flora and fauna could be added to the definition .
I do , however , support additional ideas , such as providing information on the effects of environmental crime and court rulings .
At any rate , cooperation in terms of criminal prosecution at European level still leaves a great deal to be desired .
The order of business is adopted thus amended .
The sluggish pace of implementation is not the fault of the committees , in any case .
May these reports and this debate help to realise these lofty ambitions .
Mr President , first of all I would like to extend sincere congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Galeote Quecedo , for his very important and also interesting report that has come at a very opportune moment .
Indeed this found expression in the number of people that could be employed locally through the European Union .
Does this really amount to nothing more than a coordination problem ?
As if the divergent national interests of the Member States had already been consigned to the European past !
On no account does this typically European custom rule out legitimate and extremely useful prior enquiries as to necessity and effectiveness .
If I then ask : 'how do you coordinate your work , and how do you harmonise your activities , the answer is : 'that is not something we do ' .
In other words , saving the lives of numerous human beings by taking swift and effective action , making funds immediately available and ensuring that they are well-spent , whilst eliminating political deliberations and bureaucratic rigmarole .
And what this means in terms of ECHO , which is the seed , is that although it does not have to handle all the reconstruction work itself , it does have to make all the necessary preparations .
We invite all those who seek peaceful change to gather around the negotiating table .
The EU owes this much to both parties and to the international community .
Public opinions on the Israeli and Palestinian sides - invisible yet very tangible - were also very much a player within Camp David .
I watch in silence and amazement and I am reminded that the real Saladin made a solemn pledge to the Arabs never to make a pact with non-believers .
In the same breath , Oz adds that he is more than happy to grant the Palestinians the "right to their free and independent Palestine " but that this should not be at the expense of the existence of the Jewish State .
I am voting against this new step in the wrong direction .
It is unfortunate that Mr Solana was unable to be here to make a contribution of this kind .
All too often , we find that the Council follows its own line of thought and this is no longer the way in which we can market modern foreign policy which covers a wide range of issues .
Enlargement is on the agenda and he also mentioned the promotion of stability , at which point I started to have my doubts .
This is about the fact that our policy was unable to prevent the suffering in Bosnia , which claimed hundreds of thousands of victims .
How different is the situation in many Third World countries , especially in Africa !
I believe it is not helpful to try to copy European policy in Africa .
And there was I thinking we were dealing with reliable partners .
The same arguments crop up time and again .
Secondly we need involvement , involvement in the support networks , and this is the social implication that needs to be developed .
