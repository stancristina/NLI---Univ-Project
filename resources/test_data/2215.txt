The Committee also believes that the Commission should support the group of experts and that this work should involve the collective bargaining partners , the European Parliament , the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the social partners .
I know from my conversations over the past years on the largest building site in the centre of Berlin that the people we are dealing with here are the working poor .
It has an effect even on people’s private lives , is a burden on social security funds and hampers general economic performance .
Necessary though they are – I am in agreement with that – awareness campaigns are not enough !
That is the only way that control and protection mechanisms can have any effect .
At the same time , with consumer interests in mind we want to help to ensure that high-quality services can be offered everywhere .
The outcome cannot be described as something that has produced a simplification of legislation in Europe , quite the opposite , it has all become more bureaucratic , more complicated , harder to understand and more inefficient , the opposite of ‘slim’ , I would call the directive ‘thick’ , to borrow the English word .
She has asked me to present this report briefly for her today because a week ago she became a mother .
We are flinging the doors open wide to such fraudsters and in so doing indirectly encouraging tax fraud .
We waited for that promise for a long time .
We call on the Directorate-General for Competition to continue to tackle the vertical concentration of the media and of production within the media and to do so with renewed vigour , just like it did at the start of this legislative period .
It only remains for me to tell you now that when the vote itself comes I shall be bringing an oral amendment which will be concerned only with the language versions .
That was inevitable with such a many-facetted subject , but its success is a tribute to you .
The only positive aspect that comes to my mind is that the Commonwealth , at least , has not changed its stance on Zimbabwe .
His mysterious , brutal and deliberate murder put a stop to that .
What we are seeing here is a failure to hold elections , the falsification of ballots , the intimidation of the electorate , of whom – as was apparent the last time – only some 5 % turn out to vote , most preferring to stay at home where they feel safer .
I have noted that one of the amendments has been incorrectly translated , and I do not think it accurately reflects the opinion of the Committee .
We will then no longer be obliged to talk to each other every day in the same fora , things will fall apart , and then , rather than there being a multiple-speed Europe within the framework of the European Union , Europe will drift apart .
Let us be serious ; let us get back to 2004 , which is , as we all know , a crucial year .
There has been talk of ‘core Europe ’ and multiple speeds , and I want to say how much I agree with what both Mr Brok and Mr Hänsch have said .
We have to make the internal market an internal market ; our problems with competences in the areas of fiscal policy , labour law and working times mean that it is not one .
Commissioner Monti , you have now become acquainted with our resolution – from the last part-session in Strasbourg – on services of general interest , in which we spoke out plainly in favour of codecision by this House on a legal framework , which means that it cannot be regarded as assent only to a block exemption regulation – which is the impression I got from the Commission ’s reaction .
As Mr Fava put it , the fact that there are 41 air traffic control centres in the Member States alone , with a short flight from Brussels to Rome having to pass through seven of them , not only makes for potential dangers , but also provides reasons for unnecessary delays .
We have in any case made progress in that the Member States have , for the first time , acknowledged that the only way to ensure the safe and efficient use of airspace is for the military and civilian users of it to cooperate , irrespective of how this is to be arranged in future .
Where was it that aircraft were left hanging in the air ?
Now we are about to open the documents and announce the result .
Only then will we be able to be convincing on the international stage .
I regard the slight increase in the threshold values from what they had been previously as a good solution , especially because this means that smaller contracting authorities , such as municipalities , do not have to put projects in their area out to tender right across Europe , whilst the internal market continues to apply to larger projects .
We have achieved something more in this context , something I felt was very important and have repeatedly mentioned .
I would like to thank everyone for the very positive cooperation .
Overall , the Committee on Budgetary Control is very concerned about the extent to which an amateurish improvisatory approach has prevailed in the administration to date .
In two weeks ’ time , the Commission will present the next progress report on the reforms .
They charge the Commission ’s accounting officer with the task of validating the systems used to produce accounting data .
That is a clear alternative .
I would like to thank him in particular , as
