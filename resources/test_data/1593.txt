Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the ELDR Group , I must compliment Mr Liese on his energetic support in this report for the European Union 's position on the framework of assistance for banana producers .
The stress on diversification , Somalia 's special position , and not least , socially sustainable production and fair and supportive trading conditions , are definitely some of the report 's strong points .
We believe that text should be maintained .
This is the only commodity that unfortunate country can export to the European market and its fate largely depends on being able to maintain and strengthen banana production .
Somalia is emerging from a couple of seasons which have been disastrous to say the least , in terms of environmental calamities piled on top of those of the past .
Well , now the organisation of Somali producers exists and is recognised at both continental and international level .
That is what is behind Amendment No 1 .
The extraordinary logic underlying the rearing of laying hens in batteries will be recalled : they are no longer regarded as living creatures but as objects , industrial machines , parts of a production line .
For the same reasons as my colleagues , to have more time to examine the Commission 's position properly , I would ask for the vote on the legislative resolution to be postponed .
This is the second reading of a very urgent and very important legislative proposal , so I think the right thing to do is to vote on it now .
I also agree with the need to ensure national financing of income support measures for farmers , thus strengthening the principle of subsidiarity in aid .
I should add that if a number of different measures are applied to separate out , at the start , those components of waste that can be reused and recycled , and if compost is produced , all we shall be left with is inert waste that can be managed much more easily , avoiding the need for incineration which in any case leaves us with ash that has to be dumped .
Those objectives will not be easy to attain , but the fiscal measures - and Mr Spencer and a number of other honourable Members pointed this out - are one of the specific ways that can be used to achieve them .
The Commission proposal limits the tax increases to the rate of inflation in an effort to meet half-way those Member States that would be compelled to introduce substantial tax increases simply in order to reach the minimum rate laid down .
And so we shall soon be able to see whether or not a political consensus is forming .
Mr President , I too take the floor to speak on behalf of the PPE Group on this extremely important Commission proposal which , as has already been said , is part of a broader package of measures designed to set in train a process of fiscal coordination among the Member States in all those areas in which excessive fiscal competition is very clearly having negative effects that must be countered .
This , we realise , will be no easy process , and we certainly do not want to see any kind of conditions attached to what we are asking the Commission to do , as we have no wish to see the entry into force of the directive postponed indefinitely ; we actually want the Council to give its consent as soon as possible .
Copyright and related rights do not create obstacles or lead to unjustified reward : the fact is that authors , interpretive and performing artists , companies and distributors involved in creative activity in Europe , in developing the arts and cultural production , will only be able to enjoy the certainty and autonomy they need if the various forms of intellectual property are strictly protected .
Europe cannot stand back .
I fail to understand what is so complicated or strange about asking that where a work is used to make copies that are transitory and essential as part of a technological process , this should be authorised or at least permitted by law if it is not , as such , of economic significance to the rightholders and is therefore not damaging to them .
Copyright , I repeat is not theft ; the remuneration that has to be paid is not an excessive charge .
However - if I may be permitted a personal assessment which I feel I have to make - Amendments Nos 30 , 32 , 48 and 56 are contradictory , impenetrable or downright dangerous .
At this point , however , the House is being asked to approve legislation which limits the right of European operators to have access to the Internet , in contrast to what has been provided in the recent World Intellectual Property Organisation treaty and the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
It is those with interests on the other side of the Atlantic that want it .
At one time , almost all Europe 's major hits came into being with the help of a producer who believed in them .
The reality is that European producers primarily need unrestricted and low-cost access to the networks in order to be able to offer the kind of music which the big multinationals regard as uneconomical in terms of their own commercial criteria .
I think more can be done , and will therefore discuss two aspects in particular that I believe to be gaps about which I am dissatisfied .
Many Members in this House have spoken about quality and the need to protect the agricultural origin of the wine and the product itself ; however , no effort has been made to work towards
