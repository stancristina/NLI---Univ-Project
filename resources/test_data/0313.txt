We are talking about deregulation and increased flexibility on the labour market .
Measures which harm the investment climate in the Member States would be devastating .
Flexible regulations for the labour market were discussed at the time .
Madam President , I would like to say the same as everyone else here is saying that this is a very good report .
Above all , in the background documents for the report I see a good description of how a common security policy could be developed ; there is an analysis of shortcomings but there is also a description of what could be done .
I support instead what Mr Paasio said on the situation of the non-aligned neutral States .
What is the reason for it ?
Soon the loopholes also become obvious .
I think that drastic action is required in this respect .
First of all it ought to be possible to give a proper answer to this question , which is what do we intend to do about the fact that several EU countries , including the President 's own , have been the subject of reprisals from China .
The larger countries will be able to vote down the smaller countries .
Thank you very much for the answer even if I am none the wiser .
This is extremely important for the Swedish economy and for the thousands of people employed at Ericsson .
I would also to say thank you for the answer .
If this is the case it will be extremely serious .
Of course there is not an automatic link , the setting up of new companies depends on the economic climate as a whole .
I received the response then that 'this was not necessary , Albania was already on the way to a democratic government ' etc .
For example , I think that the so called 'car accident ' which President Berisha is supposed to have had is the work of his own staff to draw public attention to him .
We must work towards creating closer ties between the EU and the Central and Eastern European States in the Baltic Sea Region .
This risk must be eliminated .
Currently existing co-operation instruments must be used to the optimum to strengthen democracy , political stability and economic development in this region .
All the applicant countries must have the same chance to qualify for membership .
No one shall be excluded from the discussions at the start .
Finally : the enlargement of the EU into a peaceful , united Europe must be kept separate from the enlargement of NATO 's military defence alliance .
Not only will their security be enhanced but also the security of Europe which makes it extremely important for us all that these countries become members as quickly as possible .
The European Agreement is an important part of this and an important step towards membership .
Finally , I would like to say thank you to Mr Burenstam Linder for an excellent report .
One of the most important issues of equality is equal pay for equal work .
We must improve the opportunities for women to get and keep jobs .
In Sweden and in other countries the public sector is very important in providing work , equality and equal pay for both women and men , but particularly for women .
Mr President , I would like to thank both rapporteurs for a really first-class report and at the same time also thank the Commission for an excellent communication on a code of practice .
Even in my homeland , Sweden , which often congratulates itself on having made more progress than other countries in improving the participation of women in working life and reducing wage differentials , even here there are differences between the situation for men and women .
Currently it is women who have the low paid jobs , who work within the public sector , who have part time jobs and atypical work patterns .
I do not share Mrs Glase 's opinion on this point .
It is possible to evaluate work in different sectors .
Although legislation is important , this is really a matter for the partners in the labour market .
Mr President , as far as this excellent report by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is concerned I would just like to stress seven points very quickly in my short minute .
Young people have already mastered IT and communication technology very well .
Fourth , IT must be user-friendly so that the majority of the population can use it .
Seventh and last , the European Parliament must set a good example .
Voluntary service creates the kind of understanding and knowledge which cannot be gained at a school desk .
At the same time in amendment proposal No. 25 it says that it is necessary to have good or adequate knowledge of languages to be able to participate .
Mr President , the European voluntary service for young people is an important step towards a Europe for the people .
So I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Fontaine for her excellent work .
There are many positive points in this programme .
But I would personally like to underline the mutual exchange with third countries .
This will be particularly important if we do expand Eastwards .
Our Union , in co-operation with the European Council , has a central responsibility to speak on behalf of humanity in its contacts with the world outside .
Mr President , none of the States of the former Yugoslavia seem to have understood the necessity of keeping to agreements , including the Dayton Agreement , and respecting human rights .
The European Union has a duty to demand respect for human rights and for agreements concluded .
But as explanations of voting must be submitted before the report is fully discussed in the House ,
