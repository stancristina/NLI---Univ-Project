We also emphatically take exception to the debates in the European Parliament in relation to there being a need to reform the system for own resources and to the EU needing its own source of income , for example by means of a tax being levied on mobile phones across the entire Union .
The overhaul of the EU’s system of financing must not under any circumstances cause the EU to be granted its own right to levy taxes , and it is therefore unfortunate that there are wordings that implicitly suggest that this is necessary .
Experts in the field believe that this may , however , be justified in one exceptional case , namely fish bone meal as a protein replacement for calves .
The financing of the institutions and organisations in question should nonetheless be debated and established within the framework of the regular budget negotiations .
I therefore oppose the EU granting funding to this work , which should be self-financed through charges .
As we have heard from a large number of speakers in the Chamber , this would reduce the risk of disruptions in one production unit knocking out large areas .
So far so good – but then comes the poison arrow .
Instead of having an open debate about the pros and cons of a common external policy , such a policy is sneaked in in a completely different context .
I contend that the text concerning a common external policy should be expunged .
Yet the problem with the report is this – it fails to take a view on the question of at what level these important questions ought to be dealt with .
Should this be at EU level or at national level ?
A very large part of what is proposed for the stimulation of growth in order to meet the requirements of globalisation in terms of adaptation and the like consists of matters that are best tackled by the Member States themselves , in worthy competition with each other to find solutions that work .
The EU leads the world in this area , and it would be a disaster if this system , into which Russia and Japan are due to enter in a couple of years ’ time , were to collapse over time .
This is an essential task for the European Union , and one of a global character .
In this area we need to steer development in the direction of renationalising the costs of gradually creating political opportunities to carry out a liberalisation of the whole system .
These two institutions have outlived their purpose .
I support Mrs Krehl’s report and would like to thank her for a truly excellent job and for her constructive cooperation .
The reason is that a social economy brings entrepreneurship and creates job opportunities at local and regional level .
IT and its infrastructure have exactly the same importance today as roads and railways have long had and continue to have for growth in Europe .
We believe that human rights are universal and that we should fight to ensure that they are respected in all countries .
We are , however , critical of the report’s assertion that setting up what is known as the Globalisation Fund may constitute important progress for the EU.
That is something about which we have our doubts .
We Swedish Social Democrats are opposed to new instruments and more funding for the agricultural sector .
We therefore voted against the report .     In an EU with 25 Member States , the report focuses too much on the problems in the Mediterranean area of Europe .
In insurance theory , this is called ‘moral hazard’ .
We have therefore voted against the report .     In her report , the rapporteur discusses natural disasters from an environmental perspective .
The issue of rivers bursting their banks may be something that can be resolved at EU level , but there is already a rivers directive that regulates how this type of problem might be tackled .
The rapporteur wants the EU to call on the Member States to establish national forest funds for the prevention of natural disasters .
It is also proposed that the scope of the European Solidarity Fund be extended to cover the consequences of public health crises , terrorist attacks and technological disasters .
In insurance theory , this is called ‘moral hazard’ .
The fact that the Tamil Tigers have now left the negotiating table is destructive for all the parties .
As recently as in May , at least 18 civilians were killed on Kayts Island , and there are witnesses to confirm that the Sri Lankan navy murdered innocent civilians – at least 13 of them – because they were unwilling to leave their homes .
In the sketch , a man returns to a pet shop in order to complain about a dead parrot .
Only then can the debate about the future of Europe be meaningful again .
In actual fact , the voters of France and the Netherlands sent us a loud and clear message .
This , and not the Constitution , is the key to better cooperation in Europe .     Mr President , it is the nation state that is the bearer of democracy in Europe .
A demos has a national identity which shapes the very soil from which democracy can grow and in which it can stand tall and survive trials and tribulations .
Freedom , however , is not ‘just ’ anything .
We can today already see that the transatlantic economy is defined by , and functions as a result of , direct investments and the ongoing collaboration between industry and research that supports trade .
If we can achieve this , we will also be in a position to achieve other goals for cooperation across the Atlantic .
