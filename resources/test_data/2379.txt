Who should pay ?
Mr President , Vietnam has once again flouted its international commitments and its own Constitution .
Vietnam is demanding a place on the international stage and has potentially everything in its favour to become a prosperous country .
Then , the day before yesterday , the paramilitaries assassinated Octavio Sarmiento , a Member of the National Congress .
The Northern Caucasus , as we all know , is experiencing the tragedy of Chechnya , a tragedy that is continuing and that sees opposition from the European Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , how far is the European Union going to let the situation in the countries in the Southern Caucasus deteriorate before it finally decides to fully commit itself to the region , in keeping with local and regional expectations ?
Hundreds of thousands of people are living , without any real humanitarian aid , packed into refugee camps in Thailand , China and Bangladesh .
We should now break with the past and with the feeling of guilt that goes with it , in order to define a true responsible and equal partnership between the overseas countries and territories , the attached Member States and the European Union .
Madam President , I was astonished to read in the press the outcome of the negotiations by the Conference of Presidents to decide the winner of the Sakharov Prize .
That is all you need to say and that is why I maintain that a lack of courage and historical insight are what led to the proposal by the Committee on Foreign Affairs being watered down .
So far , only two Member States have submitted to the Commission proposals on the representatives that they wish to appoint .
Some of us still recall the time when hydroelectric dams burst .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you for your attention .
Madam President , Commissioner , the question regarding the safety of Europe ' s skies is being considered in terms of immediate and urgent measures .
I believe , therefore , that it is our duty to ensure that they are used and to avoid any redundancies in the sector .
This was the background to what I said .
With regard to the amendments proposed , the Commission accepts four out of the six of them .
Given that this is for preparatory action , and in accordance with the rules on the execution of the budget , the Commission really does not require a legal basis for these preliminary expenses , but it is nevertheless aware that it cannot develop the SIS II without calling on the experience of Member States in relation to the current SIS and its operation .
Public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes Mr President , to advocate transparency and public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes is a laudable objective , which we fully agree with .
I have personally , along with some other fellow Members , tabled another amendment .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has finally expressed its preference for a clause which is restricted in time .
The Meltzer report , in the American Congress , was some one hundred pages long .
This involvement should extend to the freezing of debt service payments .
This could also be the basis for a new economic partnership between all nations , the beginning of a true globalisation .
The only purpose of this report is to justify an economic system which is irrational , anarchic and socially unjust .
If our citizens are to find this directive credible , it will have to be applied simultaneously throughout the European Union .
That is why we are proposing two amendments , which rule out the possibility of withholding information where there is a risk or prejudice to the business .
My second point relates to sanctions .
Instead of despairing over poor growth forecasts as if these were gloomy weather reports , we should try to shape this policy in accordance with our objectives on social and territorial cohesion , and decide on , for example , the necessary large-scale investments , including public investment , draw up a European job creation policy , and not simply a work placement policy .
As you know , this is an objective that Parliament quite rightly considers very important .
Hand-arm vibrations cause serious and virtually systematic problems , such as the 'white finger ' phenomenon in woodcutters and forestry workers ; carpal tunnel syndrome , poor circulation and loss of feeling .
What control can the public even have over preventing a disaster , which , unfortunately , is not only ecological , such as that of the explosion at the AZF factory , from happening again ?
Why is this so ?
I reiterate that this group suggested - or indicated in any case - to the Commission , and in particular to the Vice-President charged with reform , that the path that the Commission recommended was not the correct path and was not the path that Parliament advised .
Admittedly , the Treaty of Nice provides the possibility of a legal basis by adding a second sub-paragraph to Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , but there is no need to remind you - especially in the wake of the negative outcome of the Irish referendum - that there is still a long way to go before this Treaty can be ratified .
We must not take refuge behind the reports published last year , because the linearity is no longer what it was .
What will happen if we are ?
I must protest against what the spokesperson for the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party said when she stated that the position
