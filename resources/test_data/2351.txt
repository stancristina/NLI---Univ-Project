I am sorry to have to say this , Commissioner Fischler , but things could not have been handled more badly .
This is the most heavily populated of the so-called 'less-developed countries ' .
We also saw the disastrous effects of erosion and of successive floods , and also the dangers and consequences of the huge environmental and health disaster caused by the presence of arsenic in drinking water .
The European Union has also provided Bangladesh with a considerable amount of external aid that has been earmarked for it and on which , in fact , the country is heavily dependent .
We also hope , however , that the Commission will state to what extent it will be willing to provide political support for Bangladesh in order to overcome the problems to which I referred earlier .
The situation is that in some of these countries , including my own country , Portugal , several worrying cases have arisen .
Lastly , because it would be incomprehensible and even paradoxical for our countries to have participated in missions for peace and to promote human rights in the Balkan region and to possibly left there an unsolved public health and environmental problem that affects precisely the populations that they seeking to protect .
But how , and in what cases ?
.
The Parish report , with which I broadly agree , despite its lack of coherence , does not focus on the necessary changes to policy .
( PT ) We are voting against the joint motion for a resolution that has been tabled because we cannot accept that we are still trying to deny the obvious , i .e . the serious effects on the health of people in areas affected by the use of weapons containing depleted uranium .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my colleague , Mr Patten , who had to leave to go to Moscow for a meeting , I should like to praise Parliament for holding this debate today , because it affords us a valuable opportunity for an exchange of views on the forthcoming Commission on Human Rights .
The 56th Commission on Human Rights of last year inevitably had its high and low points .
As I have noted , decisions regarding EU resolutions for this year 's 57th Commission in Geneva have not been finalised , as is usual for this stage of the process .
With this in mind , the human rights dialogue with China is currently the object of an evaluation exercise which will lead to the adoption of conclusions by the January General Affairs Council .
Finally , as a thematic concern , children 's issues will deservedly receive much attention this year , not least at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly scheduled for September .
First of all , addressing Mr Thomas Mann , I emphasise once again that the Commission is looking forward to evaluating the dialogue on human rights with China and we hope to see concrete conclusions from that evaluation at the General Affairs Council this month , as the President-in-Office said .
We are in the lead in raising awareness and giving the police and the judiciary of the fifteen Member States the necessary harmonised legal instruments to fight against those threats to human rights and to stability in the 15 Member States .
We must change this situation .
This proves the eccentricity of the Bureau 's decision to reduce the length of explanatory statements to one page .
Women must be given the opportunity to be elected in order to prove what they are capable of .
This is an initiative that gives great cause for concern and we must be aware that , in this case , this will clearly discriminate against women who wish to participate actively in politics .
We agree with some of the elements of the report , specifically with the need to develop transport infrastructure for environmental sustainability and the preservation and improvement of the right of all citizens to movement and accessibility to public transport services , although we think that these points should addressed in greater detail in the resolution as a whole .
This situation occurring in Central America is nothing new .
Therefore , the impression we receive from the principal authorities in Central American countries - and on Tuesday we had the opportunity to receive the President of Honduras - is of a people that is suffering and that , just when it sees a little light at the end of the tunnel and starts to pick itself up in order to confront its problems and its history , is struck by tragic situations caused by these natural disasters .
A positive way to conclude this meeting with the San Jos√© Group would be to proceed to implement the reconstruction programme for Central America with the new procedure for helping the victims in El Salvador .
I would also ask the Conference of Presidents to include this matter in the topical and urgent debate in Parliament ' s next part-session .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am pleased to be able to say that I am glad to hear this .
The crucial factor in the current situation is undoubtedly 'Plan Columbia ' , which was agreed in September 1999 between Presidents Clinton and Pastrana , and it is essential that the Council and the Commission stick to their positions and distance themselves even more vigorously from this agreement .
In fact , we believe this to be the position of the vast majority of Member State governments .
This is the attitude that I hope will prevail on the approach of European governments towards the Colombian Government on 30 April in Brussels .
These groups are mainly responsible for the wholesale massacres of communities and even of Europeans working with them .
Mr President ,
