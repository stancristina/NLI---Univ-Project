system .
This amendment did not make it because the Liberals and the Group of the European People’s Party voted against it .
This happened this morning , for which I am grateful .
We have had major problems in the past .
Unfortunately , Mr Lehne stands outside of this consensus .
Germany will eventually make it easier to get the deposit money refunded in different places .
Once again , one is forced to conclude that such action is required , but where is it ?
The European Union needs more effective structures in order to act more effectively , without the Member States throwing a spanner in the works .
Nobody will have a problem agreeing with this on paper , but do we really realise what this involves in practice ?
What we hear is in any case not so positive in a few respects .
All of this is at odds with the intentions of the founders of European integration .
When we were faced with the choice of a free trade zone , personalities of that ilk always emphatically rejected that alternative .
Now , as rapporteur , he is proposing in his Amendment No 15 to exclude pedestrians and cyclists from bodily injury cover in the drivers ' legal liability insurance , irrespective of whether the driver is at fault .
The European Union should not try to be a military superpower , but , I would say , a civil superpower .
Anyone following the discussion in the media could be forgiven for thinking that the essence of the discussion between the EU and NATO was about headquarters .
I urge you not to trade NATO for such uncertain military aspirations cherished by a number of EU Member States .
Europe must therefore provide an efficient and well-developed security and defence system .
It appears to me to be of major importance for more Member States , current and future ones , to join the European defence project of Belgium , Luxembourg , Germany and France .
This is a statement by the Council and the Commission .
This is why I want to come back to our resolution of July , in which the express request was made for the European Union to play a significant role , with a peace conference held under its aegis , because an external player is required to ensure that the Russians and Chechens enter into real dialogue .
In the Gulf of Kerch , a serious border conflict between the Ukraine and Russia is at risk of escalating out of control .
The military training , the system of that military apparatus and the strategy used in Chechnya all fit into the old pattern of ruling with a rod of iron .
That is why it is of vital importance that we pull out all the stops to see whether we can persuade the military , and hence the politicians , in Russia , to change the way it behaves in Chechnya .     Thank you , Mr President .
They are the Islamists ’ urge to destroy the Jewish state of Israel , and the interference in the region , which causes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to escalate .
There is , as I have always said , an element missing from the Roadmap .
However , Prime Minister Sharon will only accept this under American pressure , which is absent .
Next month , a delegation of the Knesset will be paying us a visit , and it would be good if we were to organise a joint debate on this .
For a long time , road victims were , and still are , a source of donors , but the numbers are decreasing , which only exacerbates the problem .
We therefore hope that this proposal will contribute to this .
We cannot follow the report in one area : we think that – as is , in fact , mentioned in the Greek initiative – the offering and accepting of money for organs , tissues or cells should also be punishable .     – Mr President , Commissioner , if we are to prevent North Sea cod from disappearing completely , a ‘save the cod ’ campaign is urgently required .
The recovery plan should be less of a hindrance to the activities of fishermen whose by-catches of cod are small than to those of fishermen whose contribution to the problem is comparatively great .
Incidentally , the impact of the various types of fishing can only be gauged accurately if the discards , too , are landed .
It is almost impossible to tackle this kind of problem except by giving fishermen’s producer organisations a strong position : joint management of quotas , trying together to reduce by-catches as much as possible , and also looking together at how to counter the consequences of fishing effort limitations .
This correction only enters the correct budget lines without obviously changing the content of the amendments .
When talking about influence over neighbouring regions , he makes no distinction between possible future EU Member States in the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union on the one hand , and desired spheres of influence in West Africa and the Middle East on the other .
Instead of disputing each other’s right to exist and forcing neighbouring peoples to emigrate , they would live peacefully side by side from then on , without humiliation , obstacles or fear .
That is very important if we are to have fair competition in Europe .
We must ensure that ecology and economy want to share the same future ; changes can also be made much more effectively if that desire is there .
For that reason , we strongly advocate a Community office to monitor the enforcement of the CFP.
This is incorporated into an amendment which I have tabled , and the Committee on Fisheries has approved
