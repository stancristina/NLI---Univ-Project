Then you will actually be bringing about the extensification of the sector because , otherwise , by maintaining aid for production , you are implementing a contradictory policy : on the one hand you are encouraging production and on the other , you are paying for it .
In short , biotechnology is bringing about a real revolution in science , economics and politics .
This report seeks to make a contribution towards meeting this new challenge set in Lisbon , covering equal opportunities for men and women in the field of employment , an important pillar in the European Employment Strategy .
I wish to say a final word about the allocation of resources for employment incentive measures .
We clearly expressed this position in Parliament ' s part-session last November during the debate on the report on the progress of Turkey ' s preparations for accession .
What new doctrine on the shape of Europe allows us to frame this new concept of external borders that would result from Turkey ' s inclusion in the Union ?
And what of the military ' s influence over the regime which is still powerful ?
Is this the case ?
Obviously , we cannot ignore this fact .
Parliament wants to be involved in this evaluation process , which is all well and good .
Furthermore , Turkey is a member of NATO , which has a tradition of mutual recognition towards European countries that are members of the alliance .
It is in this context that we wish to emphasise and support the content of Article 4 of the proposal for a regulation .
In any event , despite the limitations of this directive , we acknowledge that some positive changes have been made to the final position and we hope that the Member States will pay particular attention to this aspect of artistic and literary creation and to promoting the distribution thereof , whilst respecting copyright .
This is something we welcome .
At the same time , the Commission regrets what it considers to be delays in the regulation of public contracts and the liberalisation of the markets in gas , electricity , transport and postal services .
These policies therefore need to be amended , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
It is today a Special Administrative Region that is part of the People ' s Republic of China , in accordance with the Chinese principle of 'one country , two systems ' .
I have already passed this information to the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
In 1949 , when Mao Tse Tung came to power , he said ' Portugal has spent 400 years in Macau without ever having waged war against China . '
They are all different and the European Union should therefore deal with them all as separate issues even though they are closely related .
As a matter of fact , this was his first trip abroad .
This is important and I believe that it has already been done .
Because Macau is a Special Administrative Region with its own cultural identity and a population that is mixed , although largely Chinese , the European Union can only gain by maintaining a presence there , for both of these reasons .
The report takes account , of course , of the particular culture and the specific historical , social and economic bonds that underpin Macau ' s relationship with Portugal and the European Union on the one hand , and with the People ' s Republic of China , on the other .
My justification for saying this consists of a few points , which are perhaps explained by the differences in outlooks .
This law insists on the need to stimulate cooperation between Europe and Macau in all areas , because the importance of rapidly appointing a representative of the European Union to that Special Administrative Region is clear .
This report , which bears his stamp and his signature , increases the credibility of the European Parliament .
Lastly , the Portuguese administration has made a huge effort , especially in the last twenty years , to modernise the territory and its infrastructures .
The timeliness of this Parliamentary report by Mr Soares exposes the main weakness of the Commission , which is not to have marked this fact .
I hope that it will address the challenges facing us more actively and that it will duly reread and comply with its own communication of 1999 in time .
To this extent , I wish to emphasise that , in addition to the mechanisms that have been established in the fields of political cooperation and trade , an instrument has also been created to boost and further cooperation in more than thirty different areas .
To conclude , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that we need to call for two things : firstly , we must ask the Commission , in the person of Commissioner Nielson , through the intermediary of the European Union delegation in Mexico , to undertake an assessment on the ground of the agreement ' s potential for trade and cooperation and to ensure that his results are distributed to the various parties concerned .
The proposal now before us , which is intended to strengthen the fight against illegal immigrants entering and staying , must pay particular attention to two factors : first of all , the issue of employers ' responsibility and the consequences that using an illegal workforce may entail .
We must address these challenges as one wide-ranging issue .
The importance of this issue does not mean - and I think that this criticism is unfair - that we are addressing it because we are obsessed with building a Fortress Europe .
The European Union is , therefore , able to demonstrate its contribution to a worldwide fight against the trafficking of human beings
