We will not be able to understand this phenomenon if we consider it purely from the point of view of competition policy , industrial policy or trade policy .
Such investment has tripled in ten years , worldwide , and has become a normal part of the mechanisms of the market economy .
My aim is to put forward a few practical measures which can be used to monitor and analyse this phenomenon more precisely .
However , the Union has a definite interest in promoting the welfare of its citizens in this area , so that I believe a monitoring unit is needed , as relocation cannot be observed purposefully enough using the existing means .
Secondly , it is clear that enterprises ' own voluntary measures are also very important .
I seriously believe that the operations of enterprises abiding by these guidelines could be highly successful , as this approach could become a factor in promoting competitiveness .
Taxation is the field where there is perhaps most to be done .
I should also like to draw the Commission 's attention to the fact that the Union 's regional policy may incorporate factors which endanger competitive conditions .
The committee also stresses that the links between , on the one hand , direct investment and new enterprises to be located in a region and , on the other hand , local industry and the local economy should be strengthened .
The importance of training must not be underestimated either , to ensure that workers can adapt to a situation in which enterprises can very quickly change their strategies .
The citizens of the EU Member States expect concrete evidence that the European Union is genuinely acting in the interests of their safety and their future .
From a northern European perspective I would have liked the problems of the Baltic region to be stressed more .
I hope the Community will devote more attention than at present to the environmental problems of the Baltic and will step up its action in the region .
This also means greater financial effort .
We are still far from having attained this ambitious objective .
Another major problem is that no measures have yet been taken to bring the EU 's environmental standards up to the level of the three newest Member States .
Environmental issues are not sufficiently dealt with in the Commission 's annual programmes of work or the Presidencies ' statements of priorities either .
This being the case , environmental concerns inevitably take a back seat .
Serious instances of the almost total destruction of the natural environment by pollution are to be found in the immediate vicinity of EU territory , to the north , east and south .
Here there is , above all , an issue of shared responsibility for the health and safety of our citizens and our future citizens .
He is unquestionably a very experienced and competent individual , but we believe that his basic monetary and economic views are not of a kind which we can support .
Although the future European Central Bank 's independence of political passions must be safeguarded , it is important that the Central Bank should be directed by people who have a realistic view of the operation of the real economy .
As we are not particularly convinced that he does , I have recommended that my Group should abstain in tomorrow 's vote .
Mr President , I should like first of all to say a few words about the Metten report .
However , it is not entirely unproblematic in this connection how it proves possible to solve the equation : the solution proposed is that the convergence criteria be interpreted non-arithmetically .
One example is the inclusion of the French state telephone company Telecom 's pension funds in the calculation of France 's budget deficit .
Are we not already heading towards a situation in which the stability of the future European currency will be in doubt ?
The aim is to enable the internal market to function better than at present .
The first two paragraphs of the amendment have already been taken into account in the directives which this directive will amend , and the second sentence of the third paragraph cannot be accepted because whatever falls outside the scope of this directive will in any case remain a matter for national decision-making , so that it will remain possible for the Member States to choose freely whether to grant national type approval to tractors with a maximum design speed exceeding 40 km/hr .
I have voted against the Tsatsos report because in my opinion the role of the parties lies above all in bringing people together at national level to bring influence to bear within society , the most important forum being national parliaments .
On the other hand , in the European parties whose status the Tsatsos report seeks to secure , it will be impossible for citizens from small countries to make their voices heard .
Parties should be founded at citizens ' own initiative .
I cannot endorse the report 's proposals on the funding of European parties .
To us Finns , the development of cooperation both in the Baltic region and in the Barents Sea region of the Arctic is particularly important .
Similarly , attention should be devoted to unemployment in the applicant countries , which in the case of a number of them is catastrophic .
Strict economic discipline and compliance with the EMU conditions will have a further impact on the applicant countries ' ability to improve employment and social security .
I hope that in future these social aspects will be stressed more .
The conditions for agricultural production within the Union vary widely .
The purpose of the Union cannot be to destroy the preconditions for agricultural production in each
