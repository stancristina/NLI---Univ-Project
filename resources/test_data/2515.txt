We are not trying to tell anyone what to do , but we must constantly reaffirm that the European Union - as Mrs Malmström said - is not just about creating wealth at home .
A number of approaches were made last year by the Union and by various Member States .
As regards human rights in Tibet , we also share your concern .
They are fully aware of the whole Union ' s opposition to the death penalty and all executions .
So I am convinced that other initiatives , especially aid to youth associations , should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the European Union .
Of course , we must ensure that this knowledge is not confined only to the better off in society .
But I do not think we should only devote one year to this aim .
Behind the producer countries the European Union is claiming to protect , however , there are some large families of wealthy French-Creoles and , indeed , powerful English and French groups .
It is clear today that , without actively seeking confrontation , the EU must champion its own point of view , a position which is all the more tenable as present and future European consumers represent a major proportion of the banana market .
Other countries in the region like Bulgaria and Romania have also suffered serious economic repercussions .
García-Margallo y Marfíl report ( A5-0059/2000 ) Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
On prudential supervision , I made a direct appeal to the Commission and the Council yesterday not to cling to the crazy idea of entrusting supervision of all the credit establishments in the fifteen Member States to the European Central Bank .
As regards taxation , the only acceptable solution is one based on the principle that contributions should be tax deductible , at least up to a certain ceiling , and that supplementary pensions paid out should be taxable in accordance with the income tax legislation applying in the countries of residence .
The sub-text of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s report is recognition of the deadlock between national governments , which fail to transpose Community law when it does not serve their interests , and companies , normally the principal beneficiaries of the single market , which have to be convinced of the benefits through information campaigns and 'incentives ' .
Milk distribution in schools contributes to the maintenance of consumption of milk products , and those same milk products are vital to healthy nutrition for children , so that they can grow up healthy .
I am reminded of the priest who berates his parishioners because other people do not come to Church .
Along with the honourable Member , I admit that we might be able to improve the way they operate , and I shall indeed make every effort to achieve this .
In order to do so , we must seriously examine the way we are organised , the instruments and procedures we select , what is being done at the various levels , at institutional , national and regional level , and how tasks are divided between the three institutions .
We have to act .
I am absolutely sure that , if we want to bring Europe closer to the citizens and the citizens closer to Europe , there must be a regional dimension to the information policy at all levels , including information relating to the euro .
I would like to make it quite clear , once again , that the provision of information to citizens is not the exclusive responsibility of the Commission .
Clearly , I need a large number of soldiers and aides , and I need you , each and every one of you individually , to assist me wherever you have influence or responsibilities in this new information campaign .
Faced with this situation , a number of countries and regions have taken steps to restrict access to airports at night .
In the course of this debate , which will be held in the different institutions , the Council of Ministers and Parliament will have the chance to express their views on this communication , both in general terms and with regard to specific aspects such as night flights .
But this is not the case at all .
The European Union must continue with its endeavours in the areas of research and technological development , equip itself with the means it needs to produce the standards envisaged , and give financial and technological support to all studies and programmes which make shared information available and which facilitate the modernisation of equipment with a view to limiting environmental disamenities .
A general ban on night flights would therefore seriously disrupt air transport activities .
The ICAO is currently working on drafting a new standard , and this is long overdue , for the present standards date from 1977 - ages ago .
Let us be completely clear about this and not try to pretend it is otherwise or to evade the issue .
Secondly , what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available ?
Thus , the European Union does not have the necessary means to intervene in the way stipulated by the two resolutions .
In effect , timber is not among the products listed in Annex I of the Treaty .
These dossiers are currently under negotiation between the Commission and the Member States , but I can state here and now that the Commission ' s attitude is favourable .
Moreover , regulations can be a constraint which varies according to the State in question , as is , notably , the case with regard to grain storage , in respect of the impermeability of the ground , the water sampling limits , which are set at 5 % of the low water
