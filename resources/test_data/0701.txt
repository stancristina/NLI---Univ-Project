be the case in most of the Member States .
This report speaks of risks , for the danger is indeed there .
It will therefore be evident that our vote today on a communication dealing with Community and national provisions on breast implants is a matter of twofold satisfaction to me ; firstly , because it gives recognition to the action taken by the Committee on Petitions , which was the true initiator of this communication , and then because Mrs Stihler 's excellent work takes up and gives added weight to almost all the proposals made in the June 2001 resolution , especially as regards advertising , the information required to be given to patients , the guarantee of the implants ' high quality , research , the responsibilities placed not only on manufacturers , but also on surgeons and clinics , as well as the invitation extended to the Member States to maintain national registers and to make provision for a consent form .
In conclusion , Mr President , what women expect is clear answers to issues that frequently cause them anguish or even traumatise them , when raised in the event of an illness .
It is also important that they be warned of the risks , the costs , the advantages and the disadvantages connected with the insertion and wearing of breast implants .
We are , in practice , opposed to this report .
We have supported this initiative in spite of its limitations .
- ( FR ) The Community policy of cooperation and development is designed to promote lasting development and economic expansion in the developing countries , as well as the latter 's integration into the world economy and the fight against poverty .
That is how it will be possible to provide them with the psychological and material aid that they need .
That is a good thing !
For our part , we are using this opportunity to protest against the imperialist war against Iraq .
I must admit that I was very surprised to hear the Commissioner condemning the attitude of a company that everyone considers to have behaved in a particularly scandalous manner , Metaleurop , and at the same time praising another company which has been headline news in recent months , Arcelor .
What I am saying is how much , like Mr Hansenne , we think that a Commission declaration was more necessary than ever , but we also think that it is largely inadequate .
Mr President , today Europe must , through the Commission , show the rest of the world that it is firm on commercial matters and make the industrial choice to be socially pro-active and restructure industry in a useful way .
You of course referred to existing legislation that needs to be applied .
Commissioner , you said that the restructuring of companies in the steel sector , but also in the metal sector , went back a long way .
Who should pay ?
I want the Commission to have the power to say no to restructuring that is violating employees ' rights , and failing to consider the environment and the reclassification of sites .
This debate is , therefore indeed about the social future , but also about the economic future of Europe .
Not content with abandoning its commitments to Cockerill - developing technological innovation , renewing tools , promoting employment - Arcelor is making threats .
For such a decision to be taken in secret by a board of directors , obeying the demands of a handful of financiers , shows the extent to which the system that you defend amounts to a dictatorship by money .
In the same speech , Mr Lamy described our steel industry as restructured , productive , strong and competitive , adding that he admitted we had paid an extremely high social and financial price between 1980 and 1990 , but that we could now be proud because the overall result was positive and , in particular , because we no longer needed to fear the future .
Europe is adept at pointing out the rules of an ambitious industrial policy : what can we do to remain competitive in the traditional production sectors such as steel , telecommunications , gas and electricity ?
The signals coming from Kazakhstan , however , are more reminiscent of a return to Soviet methods than of a transition towards the rule of law , democracy and a system that respects human rights .
I think , on the contrary , that we have made a serious mistake .
Secondly , I feel that , following the various reports that the Commission could present to us , it could be useful for Parliament to draw up an own-initiative report on the development of metalworking in the face of what will undoubtedly be at stake in the enlargement process .
In other words , it either votes before us or after us .
It should be pointed out that the aim of the proposal for a directive they are criticising is none other than to reduce salaries and , therefore , to authorise the recruitment of staff from outside the docks to do the work instead of them .
Mr President , could you resume your efforts to ensure that the law , the law as we understand it here in this House - human rights , the rights of the individual - is respected in Estonia in the case of Natacha and Maria Illiasova ?
It is that balance which has inspired the Commission 's proposals .
Contrary to what is sometimes claimed , multilateral negotiations provide greater transparency and better conduct on the part of States since they are based on clear rules which are familiar to and accepted by all participants in the negotiations .
They can organise the service as a public or private monopoly .
