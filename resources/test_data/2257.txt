The Communist Party of Greece will throw all its weight behind the struggles of both the Greek and the other peoples of the ΕU , in order to overturn the anti-grass roots policies which the election of the new President of the European Commission marks .
Thousands of workers in Greece are being made redundant with the go-ahead of the ΕU and the governments which support it .
Similarly , for the first time in the history of the Paralympic Games , the Greek Government decided some time ago to contribute the sum of EUR 55.8 million , thereby exempting every country , rich and poor alike , from the need to pay the fee required in order for their athletes to participate .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at the same time , the government of Arial Sharon is stepping up its murderous assaults , with the Israeli army making incursions into the Gaza Strip on land and from the air , killing and injuring dozens of Palestinians .
We consider that practical political and other measures should be taken immediately in order to force the Israeli Government to stop the slaughter of the Palestinians and create the preconditions to an independent Palestine .     – Mr President , of course everything we have heard is extremely important .
For four years , a ghost ship with forged documents has been breaking every rule , every directive , every international convention , and there is no way of applying legislation and the law .
It is therefore time to stop merely talking and to start acting .
Commissioner , it is time for action , not just the right words .     – Mr President , the shipwreck of the , carrying toxic waste without a consignee between Spain , Algeria and Turkey , and another ecological disaster , which will even have repercussions on the food chain , via fish , confirm what we too have been saying in the European Parliament for years now : that toxic waste management and pollution of the marine environment cannot be addressed solely as crimes , because everything still takes second place to safeguarding and increasing the profits of big business , which controls the sources of energy and production , and of shipowners , who control the means of transport .
I think that the baton for action needs to be passed to the grass-roots movement , so that it can overturn this policy , introduce strict measures governing the transportation of toxic and nuclear waste and , on a more general note , protect human life , the sea , public health and the environment .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the budget for 2005 expresses the authoritarian , anti-grass roots policy of the European Union , the objective of which is to safeguard and increase the profits of big business .
Money is being taken from small and medium-sized farmers , with the result that they are being exterminated and entire areas are being abandoned and deserted .
Unfortunately , however many amendments are made , they will not change the reactionary character of the budget , which is why we shall be voting against it .     – The situation with the measures referred to have got worse rather than better , because it is precisely the commercialisation of sport which is the real cause of the huge problem of doping .
I should therefore like to ask you if you intend to take measures to make sport a truly social commodity and ensure it remains outside the rationale of profit and sponsorship .
Does the Commission intend , albeit two and a half years later , to promote such a Community directive ?     – Commissioner , at the meeting of Ministers for Agriculture on 19 July about this specific maize , only one Member State in three voted in favour , following which the Commission decided that one in three wanted it .
Are you perhaps considering promoting similar measures at European level ?     – The workers and their trades union have expressed their categorical opposition to the liberalisation of port services .
Is she taking account of the workers ' proposals ?     – Madam President , despite the fact that I am wasting valuable time , I should like publicly to congratulate Commissioner Lamy on the work which he has accomplished on the portfolio which he has managed to date as Commissioner .
My supplementary question concerns what general measures , reciprocal measures and measures to abolish non-trade barriers the Commission intends to take at both multilateral and bilateral level , as well as within the framework of trans-regional cooperation .
I should like to thank Mr Papadimoulis because his question allows me to clarify certain matters relating to employment contract holders in Greece , which is one issue which has arisen and , of course , to clarify matters relating to the directive on fixed-term employment .
There may be different solutions for different industries or for different categories of workers , provided the rules adopted suffice to prevent abuse .
However , as the Community directive does not order such conversion , the method and criteria used to achieve the number and categories of employment contract holders which it covers cannot be the subject of control by the European Commission .
Apart from the conversion of certain fixed-term contracts to permanent jobs , the rule of thumb in the new presidential decree is that fixed-term contracts which exceed the maximum term of 24 months , as laid down in the presidential decree , are invalid and may constitute grounds for payment of compensation to workers and the imposition of sanctions , including criminal sanctions , on employers .
My question is this : Why should thousands of workers exposed to abuse by employers ,
