a few balanced and fair protocols entailing a cost for the European Union which is reasonable .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group and on my own behalf , I want to congratulate Edward Kellett-Bowman on his months of work , of which this extensive and welldocumented report is the tangible proof .
It has also demonstrated that customs policy has frequently been used as an arm of trade policy , thus endangering the maintenance of the system , which is vital to the functioning of the single market .
Like others , I also want to stress the scrupulous efforts of the chairman , Mr Tomlinson , the rapporteur , Mr KellettBowman , and the officials of the secretariat and translation services , who have supplied all the documents needed properly and punctually .
The third point is the conclusion of everything I have said : we agree with all the recommendations , predominantly technical and bureaucratic , to improve the customs services , the technical information channels , legal and fiscal homogenization , creation of specific Community police forces and so on , but if the underlying neo-liberal philosophy is not changed , none of these efforts will succeed .
Today we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and , after this morning 's fine speeches it would not be much of a celebration if we could not hold an ordinary though very important vote .
This is seriously depleting Community coffers and also means potential losses for law-abiding businesses .
The reform of Community transit ought to simplify operations for businesses as well as find mechanisms for customs and legal cooperation especially in terms of detection of fraud , imposition and implementation of sanctions , and control of discounts and exemptions .
Barcelona cannot go against itself .
Mr Bertens spoke more about political aspects and I want to refer more to economic aspects , given that , for one thing , the delay in approving and subsequently implementing the MEDA regulation has slowed down other projects and dampened the expectations established at Barcelona .
There is also the added risk that the security and stability of existing agreements with third countries in the Mediterranean basin will be seriously prejudiced .
Finally , Mr President , I think that the great objective of our Euro-Mediterranean policy must be to replace fear , mistrust and conflict with a policy which really makes the Mediterranean Mare Nostrum .
I do not need to go to the Commission , I do not need to speak about European policies in support of this , I only need to stay in this House and see the papers we produce .
I think citizens in all our countries feel security is threatened , and - I think this is enormously positive - they feel that Europe should also take responsibility for this area which so closely affects their lives .
What is the conceptual , philosophical , and political reason why Parliament does not have co-decision in all sectors ?
Not to speak for too long , and as the Commissioner will be present at the Council negotiations , I would like to give him a little advice .
The proposals it has presented are a definite step backwards .
Mr President , when we commemorate a truly historic event like the signing of the Treaty of Rome , I do not believe we should concentrate entirely on reliving a past act , however honourable it might be .
I think that is the message that needs to be sent to the Intergovernmental Conference : put figures at the service of ideals , stop concentrating shortsightedly on the coming elections rather than on the coming generations and let everyone seek their own best interests in the common interest .
This is an important topic given that the European Parliament is one of the branches of the budget authority .
I would like to concentrate on the amendments tabled by the Committee on Regional Policy - although not all were accepted in their entirety , many were incorporated into Mr Tillich 's report , either directly or via compromise amendments .
Perhaps the big question mark which remains regarding this budget relates to PHARE , TACIS and MEDA.
To sum up , Mr President , the agreement creates optimum conditions for mutual development of economic and cultural relations .
( ES ) I would like to express my full agreement with giving a parliamentary dimension to the process initiated by the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Conference and , at the same time , I would like to mention the following with regard to the report : The first Euro-Mediterranean Conference marked the beginning of a new stage in relations between the Mediterranean countries and Europe .
As Vice-President Mar√≠n stated yesterday , the Euro-Mediterranean process must now be consolidated - this must be a priority - before new requests are made .
This decision , Madam President , Ladies and Gentlemen , can only help to undermine what has been achieved in such a difficult peace process and - Heaven forbid - could again open the flood gates to tension and violence which it would be difficult to stem .
We have to bear in mind that this decision affects not only political interests , but also human interests - the interests of those citizens who feel themselves under siege and denied the right to free movement in order to carry on the activities of their everyday lives and , principally , to gain access to their place of work .
The resolution we are debating today on the problems facing the Mapuche communities aims to make a positive contribution in helping to resolve an acknowledged conflict because , if this conflict did not exist , the Pulmari Interstate Corporation set up a few years ago would not exist either
