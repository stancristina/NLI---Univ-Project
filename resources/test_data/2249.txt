the ban to be introduced and about the fact that so very many thousands of animals will be destroyed for the sake of our vanity .
We keep seeing these appalling films of animal transportation and slaughter , revealing how we in Europe treat our animals .
There can be no talk of voluntary prostitution and therefore no talk of forced prostitution either .
The task of establishing the extent of these areas has been entrusted by the government to a special commission that exists for the purpose of setting the limits of the reindeer breeding area .
The inquiry must be completed by the end of 2004 and will then have to be referred for consultation .
We wish to make it clear that the Swedish Government responded to the criticism and set up an inquiry that was completed last year .
Human rights are the most important foundation stone of European cooperation .
That is why we cannot vote for the report in its entirety .
We are also opposed to the EU 's interfering in issues concerning forms of family relationship , because we believe that , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , family policy is a matter for the individual nations .
This is due to the fact that the rapporteur ( by discussing , for example , family legislation and the rights of Greek monks in relation to their properties in Mount Athos ) ranges far and wide beyond the original remit and parameters of the report , which are constituted by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We are , however , doubtful about the idea of an EU-financed Corps of Border Guards .
Individual Member States ' provisions and traditions when it comes to police work , especially procedures relating to ID checks and arrests , differ from one another in many respects .
We have our reservations about the content of Mr Mantovani 's report .
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity , whereby decisions are to be made as close as possible to those they affect .
It needs to be clear to everyone that the EU must only deal with those issues it is best placed to deal with , namely cross-border issues .
Each Member State should have full responsibility for deciding for itself about these issues , as well as the right to do so , for these are clear examples of areas not of an obviously cross-border nature .
We support the resolution but wish to point out that it makes no mention of women or their human rights .
Women are the most important actors in the cause of peace .
As you observed , Mr Perry is one of the foremost champions of good administration .
The fact that , during the current term of office , we have elected a new ombudsman also means , I believe , that my fellow MEPs are now still more familiar with the work of the ombudsman and that we are in agreement about what is to be done .
Mr President , quite a few problems affecting Lebanon have been mentioned in this Chamber , in spite of there also being many positive signs in that country .
I only have to mention the 17 000 missing Lebanese , the restricted freedom of expression , the violence against demonstrating students , the death penalty and , of course , the situation concerning the Palestinian refugees , referred to by quite a few fellow MEPs .
The situation concerning these refugees must be clarified .
In the long term , they promote democracy and development - political , economic and social .
We also feel a certain unease , or frustration rather , at the fact that there is always talk about human rights clauses that can be applied if a country infringes an association agreement with the EU.
Mr President , I welcome the fact that the Northern Dimension is now being placed on the EU 's agenda .
In Commissioner Patten , the EU has a strong leader in the area of foreign policy .
We cannot afford to have pariah states adjacent to our own borders in Europe .
The Baltic is not far from being a mare nostrum within the European Union .
These are a necessity .
In the resolution , the European Parliament chooses , in spite of this , to anticipate the study and to ask the Convention to look into the possibilities of finding a legal basis for a European Corps of Border Guards , and the Council to set up such a force .
The EBRD has been , and will be , of great importance to the development of former Communist Europe .
If the gulfs between countries and peoples are not to increase further , the EBRD 's efforts are perhaps needed now more than ever .
We Liberals have especially wanted to emphasise a matter also addressed by Mr Purvis , to the effect that the EBRD must step up its efforts in the EU 's new border countries , for example in Moldova and Ukraine .
We also proposed more emphasis on projects that support democratic development .
Mr Purvis mentioned the Balkans and Serbia .
We in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party support Amendments Nos 2 and 4 , just as Mr Purvis does , but also parts of Amendment No 5 .
I wonder therefore what the Greens have against it .
This means that any resolution becomes obsolete extremely quickly .
At the same time , it is very clear that the EU is not united .
It might be possible to compensate for this if we start now to make attempts to reach agreement on a strategy for what we want to see happening after Saddam Hussein , whether or not there is a war
