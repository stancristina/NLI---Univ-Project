But Estonia is destined to become - and to remain - a multicultural and multilingual society .
Nonetheless the balance of trade is still negative , although the economy in the capital , Tallinn , is largely based on tourists from Finland .
Social transfers - to the unemployed , for example - are minimal .
Let me now comment briefly on the security problems faced by Estonia as a neighbour of Russia .
Estonia has followed a different path in seeking also to join NATO .
The country is in the grip of an illusion , in my view .
As part of the EU debate on the Northern Dimension , it is perfectly feasible to devise a comprehensive and realistic programme encompassing the applicant Baltic countries , as well as parts of Russia , Scandinavia and the Arctic region .
Interpreted in this way , Estonia 's considerable progress since it regained its freedom is to Russia 's advantage too .
Mr President , I am delighted that my report on the environmental effects of enlargement was included in this Parliamentary debate dealing with the subject of applications for EU membership .
The last countries to join the European Union were Austria , Sweden and Finland , at the beginning of 1995 .
Environmental legislation in these countries was in many ways even further developed than the legislation in the EU.
Under the Treaty of Amsterdam we all now have obligations , furthermore , to integrate environmental policy into all areas of EU decision-making , and Member States ' compliance with these obligations is to be examined at future EU summits .
However , the condition of the environment has been steadily improving since 1989 , and there are large areas , for example , of unspoiled nature in these countries .
Furthermore , new investment in production must take account of the latest technology and should be undertaken now while these countries are negotiating their membership .
However , the responsibility for the EU budget is not equally shared : the greatest financial responsibility lies with the applicant countries themselves .
EU funding through ISPA and PHARE can at best only act as a catalyst .
The environmental problems in the applicant countries arise from long-standing shortcomings and neglect , particularly in the areas of water and waste management as well as emissions into the atmosphere from industry , energy production , and the present rapid growth in traffic .
On the whole , however , it has to be said that eastward enlargement will have a positive impact on the environment of Europe , when accession results in the tightening up of environmental standards in the applicant countries , economic growth is placed on a sustainable footing , and the countries concerned are able to comply with international agreements on environmental issues .
Nevertheless , transitional periods must not be allowed to exceed five years .
If successful , enlargement will place countries that have sought membership on a strong footing for economic growth based on sustainable development .
This , however , will not come about automatically : we will have to get to grips with enormous problems in trying to achieve as much as possible with relatively few resources for development .
It will be a process that requires capacity for change and adaptability according to circumstances .
I would like to emphasise the importance of how investment in sustainable development is implemented in practice and monitored .
Madam President , Mr Ombudsman , Commissioner , I am one of those who feel that the Ombudsman is the European Union 's best institution .
I myself recently met an Irish dentist who had problems practising in Greece .
All such questions should be raised when discussing the Ombudsman 's powers .
The legislative bodies have not done very much on the subject as yet , and I fear the Commission 's work on the future regulation on transparency has slowed down somewhat .
I have noted to my satisfaction the Ombudsman 's positive attitude towards civil servants ' freedom to write and say what they wish .
I would point out that the European Parliament must also be a part of this programme of revision and embark on a course of good administration itself .
Overall responsibility for the new anti-discrimination Article 13 is to remain with the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , but as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs also has jurisdiction here , I wish to table an oral amendment stating that , from the point of view of the Committee on Women 's Rights , a small change of focus , in other words an addition , is required : measures etc other than those mentioned in VIII and XVI.
I trust the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , Mr Hughes , will have no objection .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report deals as you know with electronic money .
It is worth pointing out that these two methods of payment have failed to take off in the manner predicted a few years ago .
And using the methods I have been describing , we can in practice already make use of the euro now .
Harmonisation is necessary in view of the single market and the fact that , to a large extent , we live in a common currency area .
There is no contradiction here with the subsidiarity principle .
We know that certain Member States sought such a restriction , whereas others did not want there to be any rules at all .
Many operators - among them telecommunications companies - are currently bringing new means of payment onto the market .
The Committee on Legal Affairs does not have many amendments to put forward here .
We would seriously urge the Commission actively to monitor the situation with regard to consumer
