I think it would be useful to draw up a detailed written list of the programs , their financing and their state of implementation .
Unfortunately , no!
There has been no shortage of initiatives and it is only fair to recall , as others have already done , the great undertaking made by Commissioner Emma Bonino , that has been made by the European Parliament and by national and international organizations , by women 's associations in many countries , not only in the EU , in favour of Afghan women , as well as Commissioner Gradin 's active undertaking against the trade in women for sexual exploitation , of which the victims are women in the southern hemisphere , but also European women and those from countries once oppressed by the Soviet Union .
Without any desire to always want to regulate everything , we are simply talking about establishing minimum rights for European citizens and consumers , equal for everyone , irrespective of the place where the consumer goods in question were bought .
With regard to Amendments Nos 41 and 54 , the Commission accepts their logic and accepts them provided there are a few amendments to the wording .
Finally , Amendments Nos 2 , 13 , 24 , 26 , 31 and 41 will be partially accepted .
Then everything will be clear and transparent , not only for the large operators but for the small traders as well .
Particular attention should be paid to the disadvantaged social groups among the population , including the elderly , those on low incomes and people with disabilities .
Mr President , from our understanding of what the rapporteurs have said , the euro is a small , peaceful , end-of-century revolution , which in practice will obviously change our entire modus operandi , whether as businesses or as consumers .
The citizen , as consumer , will go into a bar , a shop , a supermarket , a restaurant or a travel agency and pay in national currency .
French colleagues will recall that in their country , 30 years on , the elderly are still today thinking in terms of old francs and new francs .
They will certainly have a more stable currency and a greater transparency of prices for goods and services purchased in their own countries from abroad .
We should not hide the fact that we are proceeding in a random fashion .
I am well aware that much has already been said and there is little room for further contributions .
The practical aspects of introducing the euro are therefore of crucial importance , with the basic objective of making the citizens as familiar as possible with the new currency and reducing related costs to a minimum .
But statistics would be a mathematical exercise , an end in themselves , if they were not used to stimulate ideas and to help us draw conclusions .
So we need to start at the beginning and include in the school curriculum the genuinely educational subject of behaviour on roads , and civilized behaviour in general .
One proposal could be to harmonize the times at which alcoholic drinks are sold , which are currently not harmonized at all in Europe .
Quality of life is measured with awareness , also taking into account a harmonic concept of people and objects .
However , I consider it fundamentally important for the national governments and parliaments to be vigilant at the time of presenting the project .
This vigilance is absolutely vital to the cultural sector as a whole ; the cultural policy needs space for itself , special provisions which cannot be provided by purely economic mechanisms .
It is , in fact , a question of providing guidelines on these negotiations of enormous consequence that have been taking place in a semi-clandestine manner for almost three years .
Any regulation aimed at protecting the health of its own citizens , at protecting the environment , at protecting the social standards guaranteed for workers by laws and collective agreements or ( a very important aspect of the problem ) at safeguarding its own identity and culture could be considered discriminatory .
The mobilization generated by the "discovery ' of the MAI in European civilian society , particularly in the world of culture , and in the USA , where the NGOs have begun a real campaign of denouncement , has already had the effect of postponing the conclusion of the agreement .
We would like to raise three issues .
It is for these reasons that we are asking for the MAI not to be signed , at least not before its contents and nature have been profoundly amended .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the action programme on rare diseases which we are here to debate is part of the Community action in the public health sector .
I would like to draw your attention to this point before continuing with the presentation of this programme .
In making a more thorough assessment of the action programme in question , one aspect of prime importance which must be taken into account is international cooperation : the coordination of Community activities with those of the competent national and international organizations allows the work to be rationalized , useless duplication to be avoided , and the time required to achieve the pre-established objectives to be reduced .
Considering the peculiarity of the case , the consultative committee may have two representatives from each Member State , provided one of them belongs to a patient support group .
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , and the very few but highly valued ladies and gentlemen present , almost two years have gone by since this House unanimously voted through its resolution on Alzheimer 's disease and related syndromes , urging the Commission to present a
