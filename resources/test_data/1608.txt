management of bio-waste in the European Union ( short presentation ) Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the Commission appreciates the constructive spirit that has guided the trialogues where the regulation on the European Systemic Risk Board was negotiated .
I want to thank the rapporteurs for the formidable efforts they have made so far , and the work is bound to continue .
We regret that an agreement could not be reached for adoption at first reading at this plenary part-session , but we are satisfied that all parties are committed to carrying out the adoption by September .
Should the ESRB general board and steering committee include outside independent experts and , if so , with or without voting rights ?
The same goes for the many discussions revolving around the involvement of the Council and Parliament in the follow-up to the recommendations of the ESRB.
So while I somehow regret that Parliament will not be able to vote on a text fully agreed with the Council now at this session , I am still delighted by the clear willingness shown by all to reach an agreement by September .
Finally , let me say frankly that we badly needed a modern supervisory architecture , as well as a body doing analysis of systemic risks to macro-financial stability , well before the financial crisis hit Europe .
I therefore want to stress again that the fact that the new supervisory framework will be established rapidly , and certainly by 1 January next year , is indeed sensible .
It is also a key building block to restore and reinforce confidence in the European economy which is so much needed now .
I count on your support on these very important endeavours .
Both the Commission and the Council altered their original views significantly , and the EU will now shut down its market in illegally harvested timber .
This breakthrough , which is of global importance , would not have been possible without the support of a strong majority in Parliament for a ban on illegal timber .
These operators must be aware of the wood 's origin .
Parliament would have liked a ban on the entire chain , and not just the first seller .
I am sorry that the Council did not agree to list this regulation under the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law .
Parliament 's negotiators were concerned about the concept of negligible risk that came out of the Council 's insistence on a statutory text .
We examined the sort of contexts in which this concept occurs in current legislation .
Parliament therefore accepts the concept of negligible risk , understanding it to mean a risk that is , to all intents and purposes , zero .
A total of 20 % of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation , and a part of that by illegal harvesting .
For years , the EU has preached against illegal timber , though at the same time hypocritically providing it with it one of the biggest markets there is .
This legislation is a way for us to support all those countries that wish to curb illegal harvesting in their own territory .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate at this late hour .
I am glad that we have made possible what he thought impossible at the time .
I would like to remind everyone , however , that the bureaucratic demands on all those except the first party to place timber or timber products on the market are extremely modest : simply that they should know and can prove where it was bought and where it has been sold on .
I am pleased that many companies , in the packaging and furniture industries , for example , have supported the ban on illegal timber .
They need to be genuinely effective in the prevention of malpractice .
Madam President , I speak as a Finn and someone from the Nordic countries .
My recommendation to you is this : do not do this to yourselves .
We in Finland have 15 years ' experience of this , and I am not at all satisfied .
You are a strong Nordic democracy , in which referendums do not make a mockery of democracy .
Elsewhere in Europe , however , they vote again a year later if the result is not the right one .
Do not do this to yourselves .
I also wish to encourage the High Representative to act effectively in the spirit of this agreement .
It has also been agreed that parties responsible for human rights will be included in all EU delegations abroad ; these will be responsible for these issues at local level .
Parliament has had a major role to play throughout the process .
It has no visible influence .
Next we need results .
The EU budget should not be increased as a result of more bureaucracy , and especially not in times of crisis , even if the small amounts set aside in certain parts of the External Action budget say a lot about how highly regarded the EU 's common foreign policy is .
Hitherto , France , Germany and the United Kingdom have not spoken with one voice .
He says that these events recall what happened in the Western Balkans in the 1990s .
We are not at all convinced that this is about genuine ethnic tensions : it is more likely to be about ethnic tensions that have been stirred up because southern Kyrgyzstan is a very poor and deprived region .
I would especially like to bring to the High Representative 's attention and that of Commissioner Georgieva the fact that human rights defenders are now in an awkward position .
