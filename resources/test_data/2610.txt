the initiatives to achieve this .
It is the same perverse and obscurantist logic which is at work .
The only thing we should do is transpose into Community law the provisions - which are wholly appropriate - of the Aarhus Convention in order to encourage the effective application of this convention .
Unfortunately , as we know , these geographical areas do not have the opportunity that we have here to provide victims with solidarity .
Reality must fade into the background in the face of liberal dogma in the era of capitalist globalisation .
We want our friends to know that we are not interfering , not acting out of a notion of superiority , nor a wish to preach , but we are in fact acting out of duty , a duty to denounce and condemn violations of freedom wherever they occur .
The shockwaves created by Amina Lawal 's case have just reached Europe ; let us take action to prevent further shockwaves in the future .
These organisations are often under threat , but they are working together despite the lack of resources and the lack of support , other than support from European organisations .
But the icing on the cake is that even here there will be support for holding the West responsible for this situation and this poverty .
How can we expect the Convention ever to allow us more rights and opportunities as colegislator when we are so quick to dispose of our own legislative work ?
During the summer break , I wrote to Commissioner Patten to ask him how he thinks we could help the Palestinian authorities to organise or reorganise their government for the next elections .
It is the Council 's bad faith that Parliament is condemning .
This joint consideration of two equally important and sensitive dossiers gives the impression that asylum seekers are potential terrorists .
Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report is one of a series of reports on asylum , immigration , refugees and security .
Soon afterwards , the Commission presented its Green Paper on compensation to crime victims .
In addition , several changes suggested in the amendments were taken up in the text which is currently being debated in the Council .
We must , above all , force them to take the necessary measures in terms of security and control in order to prevent this type of accident .
This is all well and good but there is , unfortunately , a down side , because although we have certainly made progress in eliminating food waste , I think that the obligation imposed on Member States is being partly deferred .
This agreement is designed to provide the necessary legal framework for the transboundary movement of GMOs , but , at the same time , it acknowledges the contradictory notion of unintentional transboundary movements .
Mr President , everyone is becoming caught up in the revision of the directive on cosmetics .
The reason why we are not opposed to this draft text is so that workers who so desire can leave employment before retirement age .
The European Union must use its influence at international level , not to dilute the dynamic released by Cartagena , but to strengthen it .
The EU Member States have only managed to agree on the smallest issue and that is not to impose sanctions on countries producing illegal immigrants .
Simplification is another area on which we are about to set to work .
It is likely therefore that we will have underspending in 2002 and an increased need in 2003 , which should however be able to be covered by carrying sums over .
I would also like to thank the speakers who have clearly understood what I meant earlier , particularly Mr Pittella who pointed out just now that the Member States have some responsibilities .
What would be unusual is for us to continue to support , through the RALs , very old programmes .
The risks will probably be higher next year , because , since the programmes were signed in 2001 , the effects will be felt in 2003 under the N+2 rule .

Thousands of Vivendi group employees are anxious .
The current policy , however , which consists of privatising public sectors left , right and centre , is exactly the opposite .
