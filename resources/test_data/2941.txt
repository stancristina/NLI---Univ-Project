Yes , Mrs Kjer Hansen , indeed the execution of the PACTE programme was afflicted with many problems , and one cannot be at all satisfied with how it has gone , especially because , as you know , even during the process , because of the justified criticisms which the Court of Auditors and others made of the execution , the conditions for claimability had to be tightened .
The half-time check refers to this 90 % and not to future members which enter in the period from 2000 to 2006 .
I can therefore not give a final answer .
However , I fear , Mr Hernández Mollar , that like the social partners in Luxembourg , the Council will adopt the minimalist approach and the peoples of Europe will ultimately blame us for this , since we in the front line may well have aroused more expectations than the Council is prepared to fulfil .
This directive will certainly lead to better standards in aviation safety .
Publication , for example , is a very important means for ensuring greater transparency in this area .
At the end of this period the cards can be reshuffled to correspond with the new economic situation in the countries of the Union , this applying to both givers and receivers alike .
But an effective cohesion policy is only possible with the cooperation of the people on the ground .
It is a matter which also includes the structural fund .
What does economic and social cohesion mean ?
On the subject of enlargement , which Mr Izquierdo Collado 's report also covered , one can only emphasize that the preparatory phase must be supported by a special financial instrument so that new Member States can really be brought into the European community of nations .
It is simply premature to be discussing increased levels of self-generated resources .
In this respect the harmonization of legislation within the internal market is now so well advanced that the fundamental differences which many legal experts say still exist are in reality no longer there .
This is meritorious , but it is also inadequate .
In the developing countries there is a demand for cheap , adaptable , unqualified and non-Unionized labour .
This does not mean spending vast sums of money , in fact it would constitute a major achievement if the needs and objectives of women could only become a yardstick for all development-policy measures .
In fact it is not really a debate at all , but rather something undeserving of the few speakers and reporters who have to be present , and I wish at this point to express particular thanks to the interpreters and other ministering angels who have endured with us to the bitter end .
I now ask the Commission to ensure that this committee continues to examine the matters referred to by Mrs Junker and that it does this in close collaboration with the Parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation .
Women are the key to sustained development because with them you always have the next generation on board , so to speak .
I personally am of the opinion that the European Parliament has achieved a lot .
To talk about this in the one minute allocated to the advisory committees is frivolous .
Consequently , in their Intergovernmental Conference resolutions , the Committee on Fisheries and the European Parliament have called for the inclusion of a separate chapter on this issue in the new treaty .
What is most regrettable is the fact that very definite instruments are not provided for in the draft treaty .
Yet better still would be to apply the majority principle to fiscal policy to achieve the harmonization necessary in the areas needed .
We must not end up with a huge treaty , but at a smaller treaty .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , with the Méndez de Vigo/Tsatsos report , the European Parliament has today sent an important political message to the Member States to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty .
We have begun to apply Community-wide procedures in the areas of asylum , immigration , control of external borders , status of non-EU citizens and customs collaboration .
That is why we can give our consent in Parliament .
I sometimes thought that if the citizens of Europe witnessed this type of negotiation , they would not understand Europe in future .
Many people , quite rightly , are complaining about this .
Mr President , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Amendment No 45 , which we introduced , should read in the second part of the German version : ' advocates maintaining a cohesion fund ' and not , as was incorrectly translated , ' demands for its part the maintenance of a cohesion fund ' .
That is the historic failure of the governments , not Europe , but the governments .
The next treaty review needs to follow European rules of lawmaking .
I gave away nothing .
One last point in view of the time : fast-track negotiations , talks in the USA , failure and the consequences .
The EU should also remind its friends of its homework in Kyoto and Ottawa , where in December the international agreement banning land mines is to be adopted .
The sweep of political and economic issues really does extend from trade disputes , via the question of how we are to deal with extra-territorial legislation , to a whole range of political questions : What are we doing in the Ukraine ?
It is not a case of denying the partial improvements made to the Maastricht Treaty by Amsterdam when pointing out the lack of a solution still to these fundamental problems .
Only the Member States of destination are ever referred to .
I welcome this action plan and consider it to be a step
