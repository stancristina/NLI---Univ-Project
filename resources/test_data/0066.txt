catastrophe .
It should be remembered that the outcome of ongoing national elections could have both a positive and a negative impact on citizens ' rights .
The idea is to show citizens how and where they can obtain the information that will enable them to take part in European democracy , by giving a simple summary of citizens ' rights in European daily newspapers .
The Commission , which is responsible for organising the next interinstitutional meeting , should therefore promptly - very promptly - organise such a meeting to ensure that Europe 's democratic progress is not delayed .
Finally , I should like to thank Mr Coelho for his very constructive contribution to the democratic development of Europe , in which EU citizenship plays such a central role .
We talk about the forthcoming knowledge society and about lifelong learning , and there are no limits to what we all want .
It is not , therefore , very helpful if we sit here discussing our long lists .
I would point out , in particular , two aspects that I believe are important and that are perhaps not adequately stressed in the long lists .
A transition such as this cannot be achieved after a six-week course .
This is , of course , mentioned in the Commission 's justification , but it should be accorded greater attention .
All the small IT firms that sprang up in the 1990s could afford to let people experiment and learn in the workplace , and the IT sector was very successful .
Nevertheless , I voted against the report , since it would involve , inter alia , incorporating the third pillar into the Community framework .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is with great sorrow that we follow the events in Nigeria .
Transparency International still classes Nigeria as the second most corrupt country in the world .
That is the only honourable way to proceed .
I find it extremely regrettable that my own Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats tabled two amendments which weaken the committee 's original text .
Amendment No 1 removed the wording in paragraph 30 to the effect that the European Parliament 'expresses its indignation at the increasing number of executions in China ' and 'recalls that the Chinese government systematically uses persecution and torture as a means to silence dissidents and minorities ' .
Moreover , there is a desire only to give Taiwan observer status , while other democracies in the region are to be given the opportunity of becoming full members .
The committee believes that a common institutional policy is needed for harmonising European research and higher education , together with significantly stronger support by the EU for the universities .
As a Swedish Christian Democrat Member of the European Parliament , I find it perturbing that the report contains demands and requests covering a long list of areas that the universities themselves , or at least the Member States , should be allowed to decide about , without interference by the EU.
Resumption of the session Mr President , I want to begin by thanking Mr Evans for the well executed piece of work we have come to expect of him .
Our internal security is also at issue , of course .
I know what the solemn declarations say , but I think that the reality is rather different .
It is against that background that Mr Evans 's report is so important .
A common immigration policy is required in the EU so that the asylum system can be made more relaxed .
The objective of the open coordination method in the field of asylum policy must be that all countries shall fulfil obligations and endeavour to bring about improved standards and greater security , and that is a good thing .
To Mrs Klamt , I would say that cooperation and coordination are to be commended within the sphere of asylum too , but that the objective must be that of common legislation .
I therefore give my wholehearted support to Mr Evans 's report .
We must never forget , however , that the Rule of Law must not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , almost two years have now passed since October 2000 when the Commission tabled a very good proposal for a regulation on the permitted uses of those parts of slaughtered animals that are not for human consumption .
Parliament nonetheless made it very significantly better , simpler , stricter and more transparent than it had been at the beginning .
We had a proposal , however , in which we instructed the Commission to put forward a proposal and , in that respect , those of us in Parliament no doubt exceeded the limits of our powers .
Researchers now believe that such feeding is a possible cause of 'mad ' prions that give rise to BSE , TSE , Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease etc .
It is only in cigarette filters , car tyres and such like that carcass fat will be permitted to be used in the future .
By-products approved as food and by-products not approved as food must not , for example , be dealt with in the same building .
It will now no longer be possible , however , to deceive farmers when they feed their animals .
There has been a very good atmosphere and good group debates .
I therefore recommend that we unanimously accept the offer of conciliation when we vote tomorrow .
The overarching purpose of this UN agreement is to establish common rules for the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms with the objective of creating global protection of biological diversity and human health .
The European Union must fulfil its international obligations .
The proposal consists of the following main parts .
