I should like to thank the rapporteurs and my colleagues .
For a number of years , we have had large surpluses and large outstanding commitments , known as RALs , especially within the structural funds system , and these are huge amounts .
That is , to an ever greater extent , particularly worrying when it comes to category 4 , an area in which we have a severe lack of resources .
For several years , we have adopted a variety of reports on implementation etc .
I have seen on several occasions what I think is an absurd situation in which , for example , regions , universities and non-governmental organisations cease to seek appropriations , partly because the application procedure is so complicated and partly because the payments take so long to materialise that the applicants incur financial problems even though their projects have been earmarked for appropriations .
Parliament must perhaps also realise that the budget cannot simply be increased without ensuring that the Commission has the resources required for implementing the decisions .
My ‘no’ to arms exports to China is not only directed against China , but is the expression of a general principle .
It would therefore be quite wrong to remove the arms embargo against China , but do not forget that there are also other countries to which we should not sell weapons .     We would emphasise the importance of our finally getting closer to obtaining a Members ’ Statute that would mean the end of the system of covert compensation that has so far existed in Parliament .
We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of the resolution , but not for those proposals that demand a reduced pensionable age .
I have chosen to follow a more environmentally friendly line than the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and have therefore voted , for example , for stricter requirements regarding nuclear pollution ( Amendment No 42 ) and the issue of genetically modified organisms , or GMOs ( Amendments Nos 43 and 44 ) .
In spite of Amendments Nos 42 and 44 having won a majority of votes , the required 314 votes were not achieved and the amendments were thus rejected .     I have voted in favour of Amendments Nos 20-23 , which were , however , rejected .
The directive could therefore have a serious effect on prices in the event of food supplements being redefined as medicines .
This is a major and common problem which also exists in the regions bordering on the other countries that share a frontier with the present and the enlarged EU but that are not members of the EU.
This promotes the trade in women and children .
I think that this would be a sound way of proceeding .
Is there progress when it comes to police cooperation ?     – Mr President , I wish to take the opportunity of talking about girls ’ education , for without girls ’ education there is no equality for women .
We have had the fast track initiatives within the World Bank’s Development Committee , but what is happening ?
Under the World Bank’s fast track initiatives , the developed countries approved a USD 326 million funding plan last year , but , to date , only USD 207 million has been given by way of appropriations .
The developing countries have put forward their plans and done what they should have done .
The sums concerned are , after all , small in comparison with those entailed in many other pledges .
We must therefore be able to label GMOs and provide proper information about them .
I am disappointed when I hear the Commissioner so positively come out against paragraph 3 on common rules .
The wind does in actual fact blow across national borders .
If we wish to achieve something by what we are doing , we must have common rules .
I actually agree with paragraph 9 , but I consider that it perhaps goes a little too far .
In my simplicity , I had imagined that democratic decisions were always voluntary .
It is very important that we give out this signal and that we can be in relative agreement tomorrow when we take a decision .
She is a positive person who has fought many important political battles for young people , women and , now , the handicapped .
Pentti Tienari , a senior lecturer in experimental neurology in Finland , has researched into these matters , and the fact is , unfortunately , that there is a background of genetic factors .
I also wish to say that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , which is usually scrupulous about the issue of subsidiarity , will for the most part approve all these amendments .
We ought to have a precise division between the EU’s and the Member States’ respective areas of competence .     Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to thank you and my esteemed fellow MEP , Mr  Harbour , for their reports to this House .
It is good that a summit should have been held because international cooperation is required where Internet security is concerned .
As is usual in the case of international conferences , the action plan and the final document contain many sound pledges concerning how this is to be developed and how we can help the developing countries .
After no more than a year and a half , we are over USD 100 million in arrears .
When will the developing countries stop believing in what is said in these international forums ?
Although it contains commitments totalling EUR 200 million for 2003-2004 for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq , the budget is limited overall , amounting in the end to approximately one per cent of the Member States’ total
