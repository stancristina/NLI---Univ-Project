I share Mr Perry 's view completely , that it is incumbent upon us to keep a close check on the existing plants , and when suspicion arises that there is something wrong it is our duty , of course , to get it inspected as carefully as we can .
We should not , therefore , exceed the permitted doses , as I said also in my first intervention .
I had some doubts when I saw the formulation of the question , so it was nice to learn that it is working .
As I mentioned in the reply to the question , the situation will be that we evaluate the different schemes that exist , quite individually , and nothing of a general nature can be said about these schemes .
But on the basis of the question posed by you , Mt .
Papayannakis , we will contact the Greek authorities to ask them to investigate the matter .
This is normally the procedure we use in cases of this kind .
I also mentioned to you at the end of my first reply that we are in fact in the process of investigating drinking water-quality and , taking it all together , our water directives and implementation of them in the Member States .
With regard to the regulations for hunting , I must say that this lies outside my competence .
I do not intend to enter into this argument ; I will rest content with referring to the reply which I gave earlier to the question from Mrs DÃ¼hrkop .
According to the information available to the Commission , there was great risk of the amendment to the above-mentioned law including permission to hunt birds during their annual migration to their breeding grounds .
It will be necessary for us to investigate this , of course , since if this happens , it will contravene the adopted directive on birds , and Spain must , of course - like other Member States - conform to the adopted legislation .
It will therefore be necessary for us to contact the Spanish authorities again in order to get this question settled .
I shall not discuss further the selection of Natura 2000 areas that has taken place in Finland .
Regarding quite concrete choices in relation to the other plants , we will come to a decision on this if we come across an infringement or if we get a request from the Finnish Government to find alternative solutions .
We lose the skills of Member States where democracy exists and transfer them to the EU , where it does not exist .
Then we told them to bring down the wall , come over to us , come to us !
We would like to buy your products , particularly where you are not competitive , but where you are competitive , we are not so keen to buy your products .
We would prefer to make steel , cement , textiles and agricultural products ourselves .
I want suggestions for opening the market up to viable products from Central and eastern Europe , so that , by helping them to help themselves , we can give them an opportunity for good economic growth and allow Europe to heal .
I want Mr Santer to take the slogan "fewer means better ' seriously , so there are fewer rules for central and eastern Europe to accept .
The rules in seven countries have considered the cocoa-producing countries .
Personally , I feel that we could quite well have continued living with this distortion of competition for chocolate making and concentrated on loosening the marking rules in this directive .
It should be stated that what some Member States have always called chocolate must continue to go by that name , and that marking must be used to show what vegetable foodstuffs are used .
But what I find completely decisive is that we pass the proposed amendments which prohibit the use of synthetic methods in making vegetable foodstuffs .
This will give the developing countries the assurance that they can continue to export the products which they produce naturally .
If these proposed amendments are accepted , it would be totally unacceptable to allow any vegetable foodstuffs other than cocoa butter should be used , and I say that as a Dane .
The novel foods directive only applies to markings , whereas what the developing countries need is that production should not take place in the first place .
Mr President , as the debate this afternoon has shown , this directive is about feelings and interests .
As a Dane , I find it interesting to hear that the chocolate I have been eating for nearly 45 years does not taste nice and is not good quality .
We will be able to make and sell chocolate with up to 5 % fat throughout the Union .
We must be able to make the choice ourselves as consumers , and so we are in favour of markings which are neutral , objective and clear and are right next to the list of ingredients .
Mr President , the Directive which we are discussing today dates from 1973 , when it was decided that ordinary milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 25 % cocoa , while dark chocolate must contain a minimum of 35 % cocoa .
I think it is important to bear this in mind in this debate .
That was , and still is , rubbish .
Seven EU Member States , including Denmark , allow and use vegetable foodstuffs .
In other words , as we have seen today , this is one area where the single European market is not functioning .
It is said that we should use cocoa butter out of consideration for the cocoa-exporting countries of Africa , but the dispute is after all only about the maximum 5 %
