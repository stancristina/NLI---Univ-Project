Action plans and programmes are fine , but little has happened so far .
You were here on Monday evening and listened to the debate on Turkey .
This Parliament is always at the forefront of openness and transparency , and the politician who does not dare to look his or her electorate in the eye on this issue has no place in this House .
You mentioned the European security policy , together with disarmament .
We should be very vigilant before making any concessions to the Iranian regime , which must prove that it is serious and that it is not only , as so often , playing a strategic game .
The mullahs in Teheran govern with an iron hand a country in which human rights are completely neglected .
If that is the case , I would remind you of the solid opposition in this House to lifting the embargo .
Current Turkish legislation too is very deficient .
The debate on how large the EU’s income should be should never conceal the importance of how we prioritise our expenditure .
What is at issue is how we are to extend competition within the fields not only of education and health care but also of other areas of our society so that , in Europe , we might obtain the best businesses .
The EU’s basic task is to create safety and security and to bridge differences instead of creating new lines of demarcation .
This is an important reason why the Council must take the historic decision to agree to commencing negotiations .     Mr President , on behalf of President Barroso and the whole of the Commission , I wish to thank you for this debate , which has provided us with many valuable and constructive proposals and viewpoints .
Parallel to the negotiations on which the Commission wishes to embark with Turkey , a cultural dialogue is also proposed .
Remember that such fear is felt on both sides .
What is it that can bring about the strongest forces in favour of a secular Turkey characterised by legal certainty ?
We must not , however , close our eyes to the fact that both Turkey and the EU must change before full EU membership is possible .
The EU must also change .
The common agricultural policy must be abolished , and structural policy must be revised before Turkey , large and poor as it is , can be absorbed .
The June List does not , however , wish to contribute to any Fortress Europe .
We are opposed to drugs being classified as ‘soft ’ or ‘hard ’ and to the fact that drugs described as ‘soft ’ are not regarded as addictive .
It is up to each national Parliament in the EU to make decisions concerning their national drugs policies .     Mr President , in the environmental sphere , Romania at present lags very far behind in terms of what is required by EU legislation .
The delegation examined quite a few of the more controversial projects , and our view was confirmed : the pace of reform in the environmental sphere needs urgently to be stepped up .
Among other things , large quantities of cyanide will be used in this sensitive area .
At the same time , we wish to warn of the problems that will be faced by the EU if we accept a large number of countries as Member States in the very short term – poor and economically undeveloped countries with limited experience of democracy and the rule of law and with large problems involving corruption .
It might also prove dangerous for Romania .
It may be in the interests of both parties not to rush into full membership .     Mr President , I wish to thank the Council for its answer , but I am clearly unhappy to hear that the issue is falling into a black hole between the Commission and the Council .
That is why this recommendation is important , and I see no reasons why the Member States should not take these initiatives .
A number of technical improvements were at the cost of up to six years ’ blocking of the issue of protecting our animals .
I also hope that you make use of the Treaty’s articles concerning transport , consumer issues or health as a legal basis so that Parliament can participate through the codecision procedure .
We could then together break the Council’s resistance to providing animals with reasonable conditions .
If the rules governing the transport of animals are an indicator of Europe’s maturity , we are unfortunately still barbarians .
If we are regarded as chickens , we shall see how faeces from those above fall down onto those below .
Most recently , we have received information about the disgraceful conditions under which animals have been exported from the EU to Lebanon .
Another matter that gives rise to concern is the reports on financial fraud issued by OLAF at regular intervals .
We hope that the Commission will take animal protection seriously and that we do not have to read further reports concerning misused export subsidies .     Mr President , I shall present the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety on behalf of Mrs  Hassi .
We would all drown in letters from anxious people demanding that the forests be protected .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety has tried to express this voice in the form of amendments .
I also wish to speak up for Amendment No 7 , which picks up on the important aspect of there being equipment other than trawl nets that can damage the sea bed .
The objectives must then be dealt with under separate arrangements .
We , Mr Andersson , Mrs  Hedh , Mrs  Hedkvist Petersen
