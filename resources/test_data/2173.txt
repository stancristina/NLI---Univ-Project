.
We believe that the amount appropriated to agricultural aid should be reduced .
We also believe that cohesion policy should be focused mainly on the needs of the new Member States .     Mr President , the situation in Zimbabwe is going from bad to worse now .
The UN estimates that more than 200 000 people are without roofs over their heads , and many of them are in danger of dying of cold now .
According to the BBC , Methodist bishops have warned of genocide in the last day or two .
The worst thing , however , is that the SADC countries , and South Africa in particular , are still protecting Mugabe and accepting the huge sufferings he is inflicting upon his people .
First and foremost , the EU must put far greater pressure on both the UN and the SADC , especially South Africa , and so at long last comply with the responsibility it has by virtue of its own strength .
It can increase support for the victims of torture and of organised violence both in Zimbabwe and in exile and it can provide proper legal aid in connection with obviously unjustified legal proceedings brought against human rights campaigners and those who support , or are believed to support , the opposition .
All this will cost a lot of money , however .
In short , we are pleased about the resolution , but we should like to take the opportunity to emphasise these practical opportunities for offering help , and we hope that the Commission will look sympathetically at them .     Mr President , I think that the right-of-centre Members of the Chamber are trying to make light of a generally serious matter .
Protection of workers ’ health and safety is at the heart of a social Europe .
Sunlight presents a risk to the many people who work out of doors every day .
That is the reality to which we have to respond , and those are the figures that make it our duty to demand that , in future , employers inform their workers as to how they are to protect themselves against the sun’s dangerous rays .
The Commission has been given the task of describing all the risks to which workers are exposed in working life .
For workers , cancer is no less real whether caused by natural or artificial radiation .
We demand only that employers also accept their share of responsibility .
We can only interpret right-of-centre opposition as another attempt to renationalise labour market legislation .
It is an entirely incomprehensible point of view , which will distort competition within the EU’s borders .
There must be common European rules .
The finance ministers have , however , almost ritually sat down together and slashed away at every possible area .
Research has been cut back , as have the funds for supporting other projects within the framework of the Lisbon process that EU Heads of State no doubt still want to keep going .
We must also deeply regret savings within the transport area , including those in relation to the new agencies for aviation and maritime safety .
Even the subsidy for the successful programme for developing medicines to combat rare diseases is at the receiving end .
Unfortunately , we are likely to see a situation in which the budget has to be debated with no agreement on the framework for the 2007-2013 budget .     The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Kreissl-Dörfler’s report on the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status ( A6-0222/2005 ) .
Mr Savary’s report concerns a proposal that almost everyone supports , while Mr Zīle had the job of getting backing for a proposal by the Commission that only very few people are interested in .
My group is satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the committee , where the proposal for compensation in connection with freight transport was rejected .
That is not the same as saying that we see no problems with the quality of freight transport by train .
Lack of punctuality and flexibility mean that , directly contrary to all political intentions , freight transport by train is falling behind .
The Commission ’s proposal was too clumsy and out of step with the conditions in a free market .
I am in no doubt that , as liberalisation and free competition progressively take root , train services will become more efficient and we shall see better value for money and a greater focus on passengers .
I also find it thought-provoking that those countries that invest single-mindedly in modern railway services using high-speed trains also see those services making progress at a time when trains are otherwise losing ground in many countries .
It is also important that we speed up the process .
Mr Savary’s report is therefore the least controversial of those relating to the third railway package .
The big debate has of course been about who is to be covered by the Directive on the certification of train crews .
Shall it be train drivers only , or other staff too ?
My group is generally satisfied with the result we now have .
It was a wise decision to have the rules initially cover international train services .
Where drivers are concerned , this is , of course , expensive training we are faced with , so it is important that we do not impose unnecessary costs on the train companies .
Mr Savary also asks what is to be done about the small countries .
DSB has equipped itself for free competition through modernisation and through the reorganisation of its activities so that the old monopolistic and statist culture has been replaced by a modern business culture that places more focus on the passenger .
