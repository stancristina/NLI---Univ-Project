It is very unfortunate , however , that the appropriations to the UN' s administration in Kosovo , to the Baltic region and to the rapid reaction facility have been put in the reserves .
It is particularly unfortunate in view of the fact that the elected Serbian President is coming here tomorrow .
I am well aware that Parliament wants in this way to force the Commission to behave better , but one ought not to take one ' s own children hostage .
We should do much better to give the Commission a free hand in making the work effective , and we must reserve the right to criticise the Commission if the work is not a success .
We must not make ourselves partly liable for possible damage to programmes of which we are in favour .
Let us celebrate the visit by the elected Serbian president tomorrow by now seriously giving the Commission a chance to put the aid we offer onto a new and better footing .
We agree that the situation in Dover calls for a reaction on our part , but I also think it shows something else .
The word 'agent ' was his own , but to some extent it shows how difficult it is for refugees in fact to make their way to a place in which they can request asylum , and that is of course where the whole problem lies .
It is as if we stand midstream at a place where two currents , formed of immigrants and refugees , often combine .
If this area is further criminalised , the result will be to have contributed to a situation in which only unscrupulous and cynical people and those out to make money from the situation will stay behind .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Garot for his report , even if I do not agree with its content .
I agree that there has been a crisis in the pigfarming sector but I do not agree with Mr Garot ' s proposal as to how future crises might be solved .
If subsidised by the EU , the regulatory fund proposed in Mr Garot ' s report may well be of short-term benefit to small producers and help keep them artificially alive at the expense of larger and more productive producers who are , of course , the future for pigmeat production here in Europe .
We are not going to do this by inventing new aid schemes .
I should like to have a statement from the Commission on the extent to which this proposal is in keeping with the trade agreements with the WTO and with Agenda 2000 .
What is perhaps worse , however , is that it may contribute to a renationalisation of agricultural policy .
I should like to draw attention to a number of problems , and I hope that Mr Karlsson will be able to answer my questions today .
In connection with the 1997 discharge , we in Parliament agreed that , as Mrs Theato has just said , no discharge for 1999 could be given if the Court of Auditors was not in a position to issue a positive statement for 1999 .
However , I should like to know how serious the situation is regarding the 1999 accounts .
We are told that this cannot be properly calculated .
Is the percentage of error 5.5 ?
The Commission employed more than EUR 80 billion in 1999 .
The amount of fixed assets has been set EUR 240 million too low .
If the management of a private firm had committed such major blunders , then I am almost certain that the owners would have given them the sack .
The former Commission , which was primarily responsible for the 1999 Budget , was indeed given the sack .
The new Commission is to be judged this year on how good it has been at cleaning up and implementing reform .
I am therefore pleased that the Court is attaching more importance to following up the earlier annual reports .
I could have done with seeing a much more practical annual report from the Court of Auditors .
Mr Karlsson said yesterday that it is not easy to come up with figures .
If this can be done in an hour by an able employee here in Parliament , then we can probably also demand that the Court of Auditors issue a report of this kind on all sections .
In that way , we can shut the press up , which is merciless and scents blood every year when the Court of Auditors produces its report .
I believe this is a good way of doing that , and I also think that the report should be much more practical .
I could also do with seeing the Court of Auditors produce its report earlier in the year .
It would give us more time for the discharge procedure in Parliament , and we should not need to defer the discharge every single year .
As rapporteur , I now have only 14 days in which to ask the Commission questions , and in 14 days it has to supply me with the answers .
I am also pleased that the Court emphasises that the 7 % margin of error does not only relate to fraud , and I hope that the press is listening hard in the press room so that it is not only the scandals that are reported .
What is really a relief is that it looks as though the right way to combat fraud has been embarked upon .
If it comes down to figures , that amount is larger than the whole of the EU' s development aid .
I shall try as early as this year to see whether this can be done so that we can
