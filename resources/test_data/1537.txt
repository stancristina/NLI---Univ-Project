Ukraine , Moldova and Belarus , and to the countries of the southern Mediterranean .
This will take place both within the framework of , and by means of the development of , the existing cooperation instruments .
I should like to mention by way of conclusion that the European Council also met with the Chairman of the European Convention , Mr Giscard d'Estaing .
It was stated that the new Member States will participate fully in the Intergovernmental Conference .
Now that enlargement is home and dry , the work in the Convention has become the crucial task in European politics .
We have enlarged the EU ; we now have to ensure that the EU of the future , with more than 25 Member States , can also function effectively .
We must simplify the decision-making procedures and stress the EU 's values .
The Danish Presidency is now drawing to a close .
Finally , I wish to turn , once again , directly to the Members of this Parliament , and especially to the President , Mr Cox .
The Danish Presidency has attached great importance to meeting the European Parliament with an outstretched hand and the will to enter into constructive cooperation .
We have had our differences , but the cooperation between us has been characterised by progress , results and a willingness to compromise .
This picture is echoed by Danish government ministers .
Above all , however , I wish to express my thanks for the unqualified support of Parliament for the implementation of the Danish Presidency 's greatest task : concluding the negotiations with ten new Member States .
The decision , in Copenhagen , on the enlargement of the EU marked the reunification of the peoples and states of Europe , the end of the unfortunate division of our continent and the beginning of a new era in the history of Europe .
The Copenhagen Summit also marked the beginning of a new era for the European Union .
Following the Copenhagen Summit , the European Union stands as the overall framework around the Europe of the future : cooperation based on the shared values of freedom and the market economy , community spirit and social responsibility , democracy and human rights ; effective cooperation that respects the national characteristics of our peoples and states .
The enlargement of the EU has made their dream and their vision a reality .
Thank you , Mr President .
Mr Fogh Rasmussen has managed much better than the euro .
Never before have so many rich countries been so miserly towards so few .
They will pay more in contributions to the EU than they receive .
On the other hand , the better-off farmers will see a considerable increase in their capital , which future farmers will have to pay interest on .
One hectare of agricultural land costs 30 times as much in the Netherlands as in Poland .
There should now be a radical revision of agricultural systems so that we avoid a situation arising in which financial gain is made from rising agricultural prices , leading to a new need for subsidies and a million Polish farmers being condemned to a life of unemployment in the city .
Subsidies to the rich countries must be eliminated .
Let us cut EU law down drastically from its 85 000 pages .
Let us give them longer transitional periods , more leeway , greater freedom .
I am not criticising Mr Fogh Rasmussen for the result .
In an EU that has 25 countries and more on the way , it is not possible to legislate as if it were a state .
The EU should now focus on the cross-border aspects and let the parliaments of the Member States adopt the bulk of the legislation .
An enlarged EU can only function as a Europe of democracies and diversities .
They are well deserved .
It is an impressive administrative and technical piece of work , which deserves the greatest credit .
It was an impressive achievement , which was also due to the fact that the aims and priorities were clearly explained .
It was an outstanding achievement .
It was moving to listen to them setting out their priorities : freedom , justice , the rule of law , parliamentary democracy .
Of course , we all wish for these , and this is why we are carrying out enlargement .
We desire peace , freedom , stability and respect for human rights , among other things .
It was our friends that were meeting with us , perhaps with a higher level of ambition in those areas than we normally voice , but then they have a background that justifies this .
This is a giant step forward as regards openness , and indeed it should be pointed out , because if there is one thing we in the European Parliament have wished for , it is just this increase in openness .
This , however , was another demonstration of our will , unity and cooperation playing the role that was needed to put this , too , in place .
We shall be delighted to welcome the new Members to the European Parliament .
Madam President , thanks are indeed due for the great job that has been done .
Mr Fogh Rasmussen is happy , Mr Haarder is happy , and Mr Prodi , we hope , is also happy .
Mr Verheugen has every reason to be pleased with the great job he has done .
The candidate countries should also be pleased with the tremendous job they have done .
While standing here welcoming the fact that a little country can achieve so much , it is possible to be struck by the notion that this could be a tip as to how to structure the leadership of the EU.
