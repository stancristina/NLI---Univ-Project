the sanctions against Yugoslavia will be respected .
However , the system that we have in Europe today with fifteen separate railway systems makes it impossible for railway traffic to compete on the same terms as road traffic .
Such a separation must be effected as quickly as possible , as it is a prerequisite for different transport firms being able to compete with each other on the same terms as apply within other forms of transport .
Wieland report ( A5-0174/2000 )
The way the framework agreement , and in particular Annex 3 , is worded , it gives the Commission the final decision in any dispute as to whether a document shall be handed over to Parliament or not .
As regards information on international agreements , there had been a step forward in this area before the governments of the Member States intervened and changed the text for the worse .
The vote on this issue will be held during the July part-session , but Members of Parliament will not be given the opportunity to discuss it or to table any amendments .
On 8 June , however , they accepted that Mr Prodi would not fulfil all the promises he made when he took office .
However , it ought to be beyond all doubt that , at the same time as a document is given to someone outside the Commission , Parliament should have the right to the same information .
Because the framework agreement involves certain improvements upon current practice , it should not be rejected in its entirety .
We think that lawyers/advocates should , to a certain extent , be exempt from the reporting obligation , but the proposals from both the Commission and Parliament are not sufficiently balanced or precise in this respect for us to be able to support them .
Lehne report ( A5-0179/2000 )
The people who have been smuggled in , or have found their way into the European Union in some other way , have often suffered terrible tragedies on the way here .
This practice , i .e . of having the requirement for a visa as the rule rather than the exception , is not worthy of a democratic Europe .
The basic rule must be that people have the right to enter the EU freely , not the opposite .
It is therefore important that we recognise and welcome people who are seeking a better future in the EU' s Member States .
With this in mind , it would be totally absurd to allow these substances to be used in toys , which children can put in their mouths - something children very often do .
It is obvious that children who are only a few years old cannot assimilate a warning text .
A ban is already in place in several Member States , as several speakers have already mentioned .
We are usually clear political opponents - I am a member of the Swedish Left Party .
Mr President , some speakers in the House today have said somewhat critically that this discussion is dominated by 'emotions ' .
We put safety locks on the doors , we put barriers in front of ovens etc . because we know that it is dangerous to be a child .
This is a principle which should apply to all consumer protection , but particularly protection in relation to children .
Hopefully , more nations and countries may also realise that this is necessary .
The only sensible solution is a ban , a total ban , when it comes to toys for children under three years of age .
Our aim must be to limit the occasions on which we subject ourselves and our children to dangerous chemicals .
Mr President , there is no need to repeat what my colleagues Mr Goodwill and Mr Whitehead have said regarding the significant agreement that we have reached in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Then the quality of the meat would have been to a large extent the same throughout the Union , and it would at least have maintained the EU standard everywhere .
Mr President , in conclusion , the most important thing is that we obtain a system which means that by looking at a label on the meat we can see where it comes from , and that it is then possible to trace back through the complete foodstuffs chain to the original producer .
I still wonder , however , how decentralised the research regime will be with regard to the Community patents .
One question that is important to deal with here in Parliament , and that will definitely be something that affects the linguistic diversity within the EU , is also whether we will guarantee equality between small and medium-sized enterprises that operate in all parts of our Union .
We perhaps , therefore , need to discuss this in the future in order to get a complete answer .
This not only applies to the EU institutions and Member States , but also to the consumer and industry , so that we do not find ourselves in a situation of inconsistency in which one hand is doing something relating to the eEurope initiative , while at the same time we are doing something else in connection with crime .
In Feira it is precisely consumer confidence that is being identified as a key factor for the development of e-commerce .
It is in fact two years since we adopted the agreement .
Experience from those courts we have set up , namely the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia , clearly show that the present system is inadequate for dealing with the type of crimes I have just mentioned .
Commission .
( SV ) The pollution of industrial land is a big problem in Europe .
