I am not expressing an objection in principle to either of these but my concern , too , is with sustaining a good-quality , affordable and genuinely universal service provision .
I speak in support of the 150-gramme limit for reasons of caution .
In the UK, many areas are fortunate enough to enjoy a much higher level of universal service provision than the current directive requires , but aspects of our services are already under threat , particularly post offices in rural areas .
These are particularly vital in my own constituency of Scotland .
No one has yet succeeded in reassuring me about the effects of the Commission proposal in both these respects , which is why I am not only supporting the 150-gramme compromise but asking for a thorough review or reviews on the effects for universal service provision before any other proposal or proposals come forward .
If , as has been reported , the EU is prepared to consider sport in a special way , should we not also consider postal services in a special way ?
Sport is a business for some and leisure for many , but postal services , though they may be a business for many , are indeed a lifeline for us all .
Madam President , the postal services in all of our Member States fulfil functions way beyond what is purely market activity .
Postal services are of immense socio-economic importance and have always played a key role in social cohesion .
The current proposals have been the subject of very emotional debate right across the Union , particularly in my own rural constituency , and rightly so .
I represent the constituency of Connacht Ulster in the west and border counties of Ireland , which is predominantly rural and one of the most peripheral regions .
The Commission 's proposal to liberalise the postal services has been discussed intensively across the length and breadth of my constituency from Malin Head to Connemara and from the outskirts of Dublin to the islands .
It was evident to me when the proposal first appeared that it would never be acceptable in the shape in which the Commission presented it .
Parliament - which is the institution best placed to reflect the views of the citizens of Europe - made this clear to the Commission and the Commissioner even before he was appointed by us .
In spite of this , the Commission chose to ignore the view expressed by the vast majority of Members of this House from various Member States and political groups .
I sense a clear consensus amongst Members that this directive must address the very real concerns of citizens for the future of a viable post office network .
It is regrettable that the Commission opted instead to bulldoze ahead with the ideological proposal that fails to pay attention to the views of the people .
I want to commend the rapporteur on a very fine report : a report that reflects the views of the vast majority of the Members of this House and , indeed , of practically all citizens of Europe .
Madam President , I congratulate Mr Ferber on his report although we have some concerns that it does not go far enough .
We believe in the need for liberalisation , competition and value for money .
It is iniquitous that the Royal Mail in Britain is using taxpayers ' money to intervene in continental liberalised markets whilst at the same time fighting to prevent that liberalisation in the United Kingdom .
That is why I have re-tabled some of the amendments which we discussed in committee and which we will be voting for - especially in relation to the liberalisation of direct mail .
That is essential for the development of the direct marketing industry .
We have concerns , also , about the increase back to 150 grammes from the 50 grammes that we believe is necessary .
We have , alongside this , an absolute commitment to the universal service obligation .
If it can be done in rural Sweden then it can be done in rural Britain without any great difficulties .
I do not take any lessons from the Labour Party about the rural areas .
When I was the Minister for the Environment in Britain I was responsible for producing a rural White Paper , which dealt with some of the problems relating to rural post offices , so I do not take messages from the Labour Party , however nicely spoken by Mr Simpson .
I am also glad to see that our continental Liberal friends are giving the lead to British Liberals .
British Conservatives support Commissioner Bolkestein and we intend to consider , in the course of this debate - and subsequently as the debate proceeds and as the amendments are considered - whether we will vote against the further compromise , however much I respect and regard Mr Ferber 's report as a compromise in the face of many difficulties .
But , because we believe that Commissioner Bolkestein 's original operation is much the best , we may well decide to vote against the further compromise in order to maintain those original proposals .
It remains yet to be seen .
We should consider it at the end of the debate .
Mr President , first of all , we do not want to force Sweden to change its postal system , but please do not force us to follow its example .
In Sweden the Post Office went from profit to loss .
Swedish Post lost jobs .
Sub-post offices closed down .
Prices for posting a letter in Sweden are 30 % higher than they are in the United Kingdom .
And if I may now turn to the United Kingdom , privatisation of the Post Office in the UK was blocked because public opinion simply would not tolerate it .
