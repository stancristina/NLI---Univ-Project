We have seen this in former Afghanistan and in Somalia , where this is still a live issue .
We are now also informed of Russian troops and Chechen rebels together earning a handsome figure from oil which is transported through the region illegally .
We should make it our concern .
This is a reprehensible attitude , but we recognise it in different wars , including colonial wars , such as the one which the Netherlands fought in Indonesia after the Second World War .
For only if we really know what the situation is like over there and if the international press , as stated in the resolution , and the Russian press , are allowed entry , will it be possible to make well-informed proposals which make any sense .
According to a reliable report issued by various NGOs , their persecution has , in recent years , even been ordered at a high level in the Chinese Government .
We in the European Union cannot conceive of spring if in China itself it is still the middle of winter .
In addition , producers must be individually responsible .
Finally , a visible waste disposal fee is significant in connection with competition laws .
Environmental fanatics would only want something that is costly and impractical , and the envisaged environmental benefits could also be achieved without compulsion .
Translation costs push up the price of the patent disproportionately , so that it will become too costly for European industry , the ultimate users .
On the one hand , it is beneficial for intellectual property to be protected from profiteers who want to make a quick profit using what has cost others years of effort .
We have also voted against out of protest against the weak stance adopted by the European institutions on foreign policy in general and in the crisis situation in the Middle East in particular .
The current Israeli Government is employing the fear of attacks as a means of pressing home its minority view .
One thinks of the brutal threats to independent Taiwan and the total lack of freedom of expression .
The self-same conscience of the world falls silent , however , or only deals in words when China is involved , which is something I regret .
In addition to the various summit meetings at government and official level , an open and transparent political dialogue between the European Parliament and the National People 's Congress can help further develop democracy and respect for human rights in China .
The human rights situation in China has greatly deteriorated in the past year .
In June , the China delegation will be visiting China and Tibet .
Without being familiar with any of the intricacies myself , I should like to warn against the large-scale repression of those who practise Falun Gong .
In my view , the chairperson of the China delegation , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , has made some very valid points on this score .
Surely Taiwan is not the PLO from the sixties and the seventies .
Hong Kong is the most telling example where , recently , so-called 'elections' , conducted in an entirely undemocratic way , were held for a new chief executive .
That applies to men and women alike .
An impressive target , but I would cast doubt on whether women , as is the case in some countries , would be prepared to increase their premium contributions for their pensions thanks to the so-called actuarial factors .
My first request is addressed to you , Mr President .
For , since forever and a day , the ECOFIN Council has been working on pensions , but viewed from the angle of the Stability Pact and the broad economic guidelines and , thus , only from the point of view of the fundability of pensions .
This is , in fact , another cause of my concern .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has , in 15 additional amendments , mainly attempted to draw attention to people who have never worked with asbestos themselves , but who can become infected , such as family members , residents of dwellings that contain asbestos or people in the vicinity of asbestos-removal activities .
In the past , I too handled asbestos when making and connecting pipes and tubing .
Based on the fact that , in the past few years , both supply and demand in respect of risk capital for medium-sized and small businesses have been stagnating , it can be concluded that only an approach which removes obstructions both on the supply and on the demand side will be effective .
This is a system on which we had a very interesting hearing yesterday and in which I am also personally involved in the Netherlands .
The Commission evaluation report and the report by the rapporteur , Mr Beazley , confirm this .
This is not just about child pornography .
Finally , I should like to urge the European Commission to encourage the Member States to continue to pay attention to evils which are distributed via television , video games and films .
In her thorough report , Mrs De Sarnez makes the correct assumption that high-quality higher education is required .
I would therefore call on the Commission , in its incentives policy , to pay extra attention to cooperation in the field of higher education A second point I should like to bring up is the use of e-learning .
We now see another trend towards internationalisation , and this is also necessary .
With the enlargement and extension of Europe , we need more people whose hearts are in Europe and who have a feel for Europe , together with a knowledge of , and a feel for , the various countries , languages and cultures .
