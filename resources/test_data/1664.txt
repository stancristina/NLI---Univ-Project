Is there to be a regular process of dialogue in which they will be involved ?
Secondly , could I ask about the process whereby dangerous products , or products that are deemed to be dangerous , are removed from the market .
In this instance , is it the case that it will be possible to speed up the procedure under the rapid reaction process for taking something out of the marketplace once it is perceived to be dangerous ?
Finally , could I ask him about those products about which many people , including myself , have been in correspondence with him , which are thought to be dangerous but are not so regarded at this stage by the Commission ?
Flammable furniture would be a case I have in mind .
Is there going to be a widening of the area of scrutiny which will take into account products of this sort ?
Just in order to concentrate the minds of the Member States , can we ask what the Commission , and indeed the SVC , have concluded as a result of the tests which have been carried out in Switzerland with regard to the number of animals , either by number or proportion , which have entered the human food chain ?
My question to Mr Byrne relates to the recent report of the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin on the incidence of BSE in France .
This was a report which related to a period during 1999 , but which came to the European Parliament and to MEPs not very long ago .
The findings of the report make extremely alarming reading .
A large number of French departments - I think about 23 departments - had not apparently been monitoring for BSE in the cattle populations within their departments , although they were departments in which there were a large number of dairy cattle .
The conditions and the controls in the abattoirs were such that one drew the conclusion from the report that it is perfectly possible today , 29 March 2000 , that animals with BSE are still entering the food chain in France .
This must be an issue of great concern to the Commissioner .
I raised this with the French Agriculture Minister , Mr Glavany , when he came to Brussels last week .
He rejected out of hand the conclusions of the Food and Veterinary Office report and the findings of the inspectors .
I would like to know what the Commission is doing about this .
I realise that my question will be more properly posed to the Agriculture Commissioner , but Mr Byrne is responsible for food safety , and clearly there is a risk to the safety of food in France if the findings of the Food and Veterinary Office are accepted .
Could I therefore ask Mr Byrne what he is doing about this report ?
Mr President , I look forward with great interest to the Commissioner ' s reply to this debate .
The first question one wants to ask is : is The Financial Times accurate this morning in forecasting that the Commissioner is about to answer our questions by saying that only part of the noise regulation will come into force , the part relating to the European Union , on 4 May .
We believe that what the Commissioner is going to say is that the part relating to third countries , which should come into force from 2002 , will not come into force and will in fact be suspended .
The Environment Committee is the committee responsible within the European Parliament for the original regulation on aircraft noise and we have watched with some dismay the reluctance of the United States to accept that the European Union is within its rights to insist on bringing the regulation into force by the due date .
The background to this is from our point of view continued prevarication on the part of the United States ' administration whose attitude has , in the past , given us insufficient guarantees that they are willing to negotiate seriously through ICAO to find a way out of our difficulties .
The Environment Committee insists that we have every right , given the proximity of very many European airports to centres of population , to try to get lower noise levels from planes landing in Europe , no matter where they come from and who operates them .
Europeans should surely be able to legislate as they wish to protect the population of Europe , and give them the highest standards possible of noise protection .
To put it at its crudest , how will we explain the situation to the people of Europe if , after 2002 , they still hear noisy old planes from third countries , fitted with the hushkits we judge inadequate , clattering round our skies ?
This is , of course , a difficult issue to discuss sensibly in a United States election year .
We can understand that American politicians have little room for manoeuvre .
I think , however , that the Commissioner may be about to announce to us that light is dawning and that we can see a way forward that will enable both sides to be satisfied and to allow sensible negotiations to continue for a global solution .
The first compromise put forward a little time ago seemed to many in the Parliament to be much too shaky .
In effect the European Union would have suspended the whole regulation , and then the United States would have suspended its complaint to ICAO and negotiations would have gone forward .
Or would they ?
The danger , it seemed to us , was that the European Union would have been left with absolutely nothing .
We look forward to what the Commissioner has to say ,
