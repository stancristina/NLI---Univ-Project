We can safely say that most of these projects are fine , and that it is likely that the Commission will implement them properly , but the Commission 's document contains no evaluation .
Mr President , it is a good idea , as it may not only save much money and energy , but one might also be able to do a great deal more , and much more effectively , with this same money .
I believe , as Mrs Lenz remarked , that it requires a Commissioner who is entirely responsible for this policy .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , the Lenz and Imbeni reports are an excellent culmination of this year .
Aid should continue to be part of the main thrust of the policy .
Madam President , today we are discussing a document from the European Commission on the implementation in 1995 of its actions to promote human rights and democratisation .
Besides , I am not able to check the expenditure of these funds on my own .
When as far back as 1995 everyone was talking about European employment strategies and the European employment union , the liberals pointed out that the fight against unemployment is primarily a concern of national and regional authorities , and not Europe .
We also look forward to the results of the pilot projects which the Commission has started .
The danger threatening us is the infamous reversal of means and objectives .
I agree with the general tenor of this , but at the same time I set store by the fact that it is not industry which determines the substance of educational programmes and learning targets .
Hence the debate this morning .
Consumers will have to be able to decide for themselves whether to buy genetically modified foods or not .
Such an agreement would contribute to the bringing into effect of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed in July 1996 .
Uzbekistan specializes in exporting raw materials .
It may take a long time .
For this reason we must weigh the matter up very carefully .
These bibles had been donated to the Uzbekistan Bible Society by the Russian and Turkish Bible Societies .
These prisoners run greater risks .
You would give me a much more peaceful Christmas if you were to ask the Commission or the Council to ask all parties in Angola to uphold human rights and observe the peace process .
According to these same newspaper reports the President of the European Commission , Mr Santer , is alleged to be opposed to Mr Silguy 's seeking and accepting a mandate of this kind .
I have read that consultation will take place in the confines of the European Commission , at least between the President of the Commission , Mr Santer , and Mr Silguy .
SNCF does not want to participate .
In the densely populated centres of Europe , traffic grinds to a halt daily .
For it requires - although we are not there yet - the demolition of national barriers and the creation of space for this form of transport .
What 's more , in large cities , road transport is reaching its spacial limits .
They would not have done that without a reason .
The first , from Rotterdam to Milan , was supposed to have started about now .
The splendid cooperation Mrs Moreau spoke of just now could be an example of this .
An antisocial market economy has no place in the profile of a European Union .
Mr President , it might be that I have missed something , or that we have completely different definitions of what a freight freeway is .
In addition , it appears that Member States interpret the transitional period differently , and that exceptions are abused .
Reports appeared in the press , for instance , saying that Ostend airport in Belgium is losing 45 000 tonnes , ie . about half of its cargo despatch , because only 11 out of the 43 African aircraft which now fly to Ostend appear on the list of exemptions .
The takeoff or landing of one Chapter 2 aircraft takes up the noise space of five comparable Chapter 3 aircraft .
It is really unacceptable that the Council and the European Commission wish to place Saudi Arabia on a list of exemptions .
I would like to thank the members of the transport committee who have supported me unanimously .
My second point concerns the position of the European satellite industry .
More cooperation and merging between companies , and political support for technological development , are necessary , as well as tackling risk management .
I would prefer to have seen this oral recommendation as optional .
The number of nations forecasted to join EMU has never been so high .
But in reality , there are big differences in economic and conjunctural developments .
Faith in the euro will be tested .
So , Mr President , the issue at the moment is primarily the information of the public .
The public already finds globalization difficult , as well as loss of identity .
My colleagues have already discussed other points , or will do so .
To what extent will the banks charge conversion costs to the customer ?
EMU will enable the EU better to offer resistance against external shocks such as the ones caused by speculative capital flows .
Today we are on the eve of a transitional period which may be important and of great significance for the credibility of the new European currency .
We must direct all resources , all budgetary resources that we have for information , towards informing the public about the introduction of the euro .
Mr President , I will focus on Mr Friedrich 's report , and on behalf of my group I can say
