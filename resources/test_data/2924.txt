This is the problem we really ought to discuss today .
I should like both the Council and the Commission to return to Parliament in February to report on what has been done up to then and what will happen in future so that the commitments from Johannesburg can be implemented .
I would also like to say a few words about the other commitments that the EU has made , for example at Kyoto , and about how things are looking with our own climate programme , which the Commission approved about a year ago , a two-year programme that comprises one half of the strategy to combat climate change within Europe .
Agriculture policy , for example , is still not included , but this could perhaps be included in the programme now since one year has passed .
Transport remains the biggest problem .
Mr President , the previous speaker referred to Voltaire .
Let me refer to a Danish author , Hans Christian Andersen , who wrote a story that many of us have read , The Emperor 's New Clothes .
I am therefore one of those who cannot in any way see the Johannesburg Summit as a success .
Unfortunately , I am afraid that we will meet here again in five or ten years and that we will then see that a great many of the problems that have quite rightly been identified in connection with Johannesburg will have become worse .
It is therefore obvious that production and consumption must change .
Most of this is carbon technology .
I think that this was very good , especially in the light of the Commission 's previous doubts about making vigorous efforts in this area .
In a few years , we will undoubtedly increase resources in this context , but they are required now .
We should perhaps create partnerships with companies that want to progress further and faster , with popular movements , with researchers and so on , so that we can achieve greater speed in some of the areas where the situation is particularly critical .
As regards the initiatives that the Commission took in the areas of water and energy , we have never had an opportunity to present any opinions , something which is somewhat frustrating considering that there is indisputable commitment and interest in these areas .
The collectivisation of rights can be the first step towards the reduction of their importance .
We have voted in favour of Mrs Hulth√©n 's report , ( A5-0237/2002 ) .
Work on environmental policy must be more clearly focused on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases .
We are opposed to the EU managing the taxes of the Member States .
We cannot support the report since it advocates coordination within areas that we consider are best dealt with at national level , including the coordination of employment and social policy .
We do not therefore adopt a position on the actual measures in the report , but vote against the report on grounds of principle .
After five years , we can now say that this strategy has been successful , even if there is still much to be improved .
A role that is based on co-decision , which is now required in recital R in the adopted report , would undermine open coordination as a method .
For this reason also , I have not been able to support the report .
Foreign policy is one of the most important areas in which we really need strong European cooperation .
If the famous human rights clause is to have any credibility , it is important to find tools that enable it to be applied .
Of course there are exceptions , but my group is not completely happy with the agreement that has been reached with regard to access to foreign documents .
The anti-Americanism that sometimes emanates from here does , however , ring somewhat hollow when it is used solely as an excuse for concealing our own failure to produce a clear , common policy on matters such as Iraq and the Middle East issue .
It is only applicable to NATO or similar organisations ' Status of Force Agreements designed to protect soldiers from sending States , but it cannot be applied generally to US troops or US citizens .
This is not just contrary to the Rome Statute but also to the general duty to prosecute international crimes .
Within the next few years , new engines will reduce fuel consumption and improve exhaust cleanliness .
Poor fuel technology , on the other hand , can be detrimental to the new generation of engines and harm the technology and engine function .
A large part of the debate in the second reading was focused on the question of whether all vehicles should be covered by this directive .
If these vehicles are fully covered by the directive , the environment will be the clear winner .
This shows that the EU has strength and competence in important environmental issues and that the use of modern environmental technology is better than a ban .
Today , however , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Callanan , particularly since he has been so unfairly attacked by his own group .
Already today , we can see a positive development and lower fuel consumption .
In our countries , there is one boat for every seven inhabitants , so this is an important source of employment for us .
The proposal would therefore lead to a slight reduction in hydrocarbons and at the same time produce a considerable reduction in the burden on the boat sector .
I hope that the proposal for a review clause from the rapporteur and the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will continue in its present form , since
