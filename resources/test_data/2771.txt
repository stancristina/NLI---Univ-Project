a formal human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the guidelines for dialogues with third countries approved by the Council in December of last year .
I should also like to add that human rights are one of the four essential areas in which the Council has stated that it wishes to see progress , now that the EU and Iran are in the process of developing close trade relations .
It decided therefore to embark upon such a dialogue on the basis of the conditions , timetable , subjects , benchmark points - that is to say , objectives - and choice of interlocutors discussed in the course of the EU 's fact-finding mission to Iran .
Finally , the Council has , on the basis of an initiative by the Presidency , very recently brought up a number of matters in quite a few different countries , including Iran .
In its declaration , the Council again emphasises , clearly and unambiguously , that the EU repudiates the death penalty and , in particular , execution by stoning .
Mr President , I did not say that I - and the Council - do not read press reports and newspapers .
That is something quite different .
My esteemed colleague is undoubtedly right that , in Iran , the death penalty is not just something that exists in theory but also something that is practised .
That is deeply tragic , but the Council has devised a strategy for nonetheless being able to embark upon human rights dialogues with countries that impose this penalty .
It is of course a dialogue involving , on the one hand , vigorous condemnation and , on the other hand , simultaneous efforts of persuasion to bring about improvements .
Mr President , a question such as that cannot be answered in general terms .
I can nonetheless confirm , however , that there is a Europol document concerning the subject we are now talking about .
The document is not binding , and it has been prepared on the basis of Article 3( 2 )( i ) of the Europol Convention .
These decisions have therefore been integrated into the European Union 's prior regulatory framework , cf . the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union , and both have been published in the Official Journal of 22 September 2000 .
Police use of informers , including questions of payment and immunity , naturally depends upon the state of the national law in the Member State concerned .
I do not therefore think it is fair to talk about an informer state .
Europol was of course set up and has had its powers extended partly at the request of Parliament and of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
That is why it is unacceptable for the American Government to undermine the Court by trying to enter into bilateral agreements with EU countries or candidate countries .
The Council has to a large extent given in to American pressure , and I want , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , to call upon the national parliaments in the EU and in the candidate countries to keep a close eye on what their governments are doing so that the Rome Statute is not weakened .
I hope that the Council will embark upon a new dialogue with the American Government concerning the recognition of the International Criminal Court , which all the Member States and most of the candidate countries have now ratified .
The EU and the United States share the same basic values .
Both parties profess freedom and democracy and the defence of human rights and the principles of the rule of law .
Since 1998 , the EU has tried to accommodate American anxieties in relation to certain provisions of the Statute , but its efforts have unfortunately been in vain .
The United States ' decision is wrong , and we must all regret the American measures .
Now , he is demonstrating good will in the light of the trade agreement with the EU.
I agree with all my fellow MEPs who have said that we cannot enter into any trade agreement with Iran .
Let us think for a moment .
Of course we must embark upon the critical dialogue with Iran , and if this yields fruit in terms of our no longer seeing stonings or barbaric death penalties and sentences in Iran , then we can of course begin to pave the way for trade agreements .
Not a moment before , however .
Thank you , Mr President .
With regard to radioactive waste , I would like to mention a specifically Danish problem .
If we must dump it in Denmark , as the current rules state , it will cost a very , very great deal .
This would be advantageous overall to the economy of the EU , although naturally it would be subject to the recipient country in question being happy to receive it .
This makes no sense in the case of small countries , which have only a small amount of medical and other waste .
It is a cooperation to which we attach the utmost importance , and therefore it is a great pleasure for me to note that the cooperation is taking such a positive form .
The European Parliament and the Presidency have a joint project .
We share the same vision ; we are working towards a common objective .
It is a challenge and an opportunity which extends beyond our own time .
Enlargement of the European Union marks the end of the European tragedy of the twentieth century and is the gateway to a common future in which our people are able to live in freedom , peace and prosperity
