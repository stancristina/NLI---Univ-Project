Overall , the report represents progress towards a modern energy mix .
Since the middle of the 1990s , the technology has been available to enable the safe transition between the European system and the advanced Belgian system , in other words , the so-called TBL 1+ system .
In the original text , the reference is wrong .
However , I do not consider the use of quotas , so-called positive discrimination , to be sensible .
Certainly , under the Treaty of Lisbon , which has just come into force , Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work , but with the introduction of the Assistants ' Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term , there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants .
The first concerns Amendment 3 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance .
That is good and we welcome it .
Thirdly , we must also ask ourselves whether the rights of air passengers and the rights that are in force pursuant to the existing Package Travel Directive should , in the long term , be transferred into a common document , to eliminate contradictions between components of both legislations .
Six months ago , we in the Transport Committee put a question to the Transport Commissioner because in the context of SkyEurope in Slovakia , we had the case of passengers with low-cost flights being stranded and not being transported further .
It is thanks to Mr Gauz√®s that we have got it off the ground .
Firstly , who is responsible for the lack of control in the euro system ?
This proposal by the Commission is , in a way , the flagship of the fight against red tape and the policy for fighting red tape in the European Union , and is therefore of rather central and major importance .
It is important and it is good that we have it .
In all my time as a lawyer , when a business of this size is sold , I have never experienced a buyer depending on the significance of annual accounts in whatever form .
Fifthly , revising the fourth and the seventh directives is no small task ; it is quite a major task .
The second political principle is that we must guarantee a high level of protection of the rights of both consumers and workers .
In the debates in our own countries , we parliamentarians in particular very often notice that these fears of the internal market are still very much in evidence amongst the general public and that subjects like protectionism are , unfortunately , also well received because these sorts of things are not only propounded by governments , but are also supported by many citizens .
We have already approached our Committee on Budgets and emphasised that we , of course , want funds to continue to be provided and that we want the appropriate money to be used .
We should aim for greater harmonisation of consumer protection regulations - and by that I mean an adjustment upwards - on account of the increasing cross-border use of services .
The aim is to have 'empowered consumers ' in the internal market .
Mr Almunia was the competent Commissioner .
However , you continue to persist with the failed Stability and Growth Pact .
However , the majority of governments implement projects that are merely sporadic measures .
In this regard , I am particularly concerned about the school education of children , in particular , of girls .
For me , in order to correctly assess liberalisation , it is important that we quickly carry out implementation or enforce it using the means available to the Commission or means that it still needs to grant itself .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , counterfeiting , smuggling , and the violation of intellectual property rights doubtless pose a huge problem , first of all , for us as the European Union as a whole , but also for many Member States .
The first is , why are we still lacking transparency when the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force since 1 December and we have had an interinstitutional agreement with the Commission since 10 February ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner De Gucht , if you meet with representatives from ten governments in a small group in a back room in order to agree on a global surveillance regulation containing such sensitive chapter headings as 'enforcement of the law ' and 'civil penal measures in connection with border controls and the Internet' , you can hardly be surprised if rumours emerge and if questions are raised to which citizens rightly want answers .
Trade agreements must not be misused in order to curtail the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals .
For example , if countries like Qatar , whose per capita income is higher than that of 25 Member States of the European Union , are included in the GSP system , I am certain that we need to take a very critical look at this when reviewing the whole system .
There is one more point that is important to us : this must be a modern service with a balanced staffing policy .
Particularly when it comes to sustainable growth and employment , and when it comes to climate change , European agricultural policy is highly significant , as it has an indispensable role to play in retaining jobs in rural and peri-urban areas .
Today 's joint motion for a resolution on the Goldstone report once again gives expression to the EU 's striving for a fair assessment and review of events during the conflict in Gaza .
I believe that the tax must be levied where the transaction takes place , and must also , in other words , benefit the States
