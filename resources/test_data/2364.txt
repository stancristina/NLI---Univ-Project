In the economic sphere , there has been an impressive transition from the planned economies of the past to market economies .
Public administration has been reformed so that the EU 's acquis communautaire can be implemented .
That is why we must not disappoint their justified expectations of now shortly being able to become fully-fledged members .
This impressive progress can be read about in the Commission 's progress report and strategy paper for enlargement , submitted on 9 October .
These described all 10 countries , and the Commission judged that the latter are ready to pursue membership .
The Commission has not said that the work has been done and that they are ready .
As a reaction to the Commission 's progress reports , the candidate countries have clearly intimated that they will step up their efforts in those areas pointed out by the Commission , and these efforts will be supported with EU funds .
The Brussels European Council took a number of important decisions concerning the outstanding financial issues .
Clearly , moreover , a successful outcome demands both effort and a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone involved - the present , as well as the future , Member States .
The concluding of the negotiations in Copenhagen in 23 days ' time will be an incredible breakthrough .
Parliament will have to give its consent before the treaty can be signed , and Parliament 's statement to the effect that it wishes to approve the treaty as quickly as possible merely illustrates once again Parliament 's role as a driving force for rapid enlargement .
The Copenhagen European Council will not just concern itself with the 10 countries concerned .
Important decisions concerning Bulgaria and Romania , which still have some way to go , will also have to be taken .
In response to the conclusions from Brussels , the Copenhagen European Council will have to make decisions concerning detailed timetables , including schedules and increased pre-accession aid , so that the accession process involving these countries can be taken forward .
With regard to Turkey , the Commission concludes that , since the last progress report , great progress has been made towards fulfilling the political Copenhagen criterion .
Developments in Turkey over the last year show that the decision taken in Helsinki in 1999 , when Turkey was accorded the status of a candidate country , was a correct one .
In order further to increase its membership prospects , Turkey was encouraged by the Commission to adopt further reforms and to implement those already adopted .
That is why it is important to keep all the doors open in the run-up to the decision to be taken in 23 days ' time in Copenhagen .
It will also be reflected in the forthcoming debate .
Parliament has been involved in establishing the background against which the whole of the enlargement debate will take place .
It is of course MEPs ' and the people 's support that is so fundamental to the enlargement process .
The European Parliament 's debates on enlargement have an important role to play .
That is why I should like again to thank Parliament and the President personally , and also Commissioner Verheugen , for the huge amount of work done by the institutions of the European Union on various fronts .
I think that all of us experienced a pleasant buzz during this morning 's meeting .
Almost the whole of Europe will now be united as a community .
It has been a demanding and often painful process for these countries .
That also applies at regional and local levels .
One of the things I believe is that it is important for there , in actual practice , to be compliance in all the sectors with the requirements for the integration of environmental and health protection .
That especially applies within agriculture and within infrastructure development .
Within the framework established as recently as at the Brussels Summit in October , the conditions of accession are now finally to be agreed for each individual new Member State .
We must see to it that the new Member States are guaranteed fair conditions of competition so that their accession to the EU can make a positive contribution to the development of the countries ' prosperity .
I am convinced that the Danish Presidency and Commissioner Verheugen have the flexibility and the attitude of solidarity that will make it possible in Copenhagen to take the final decision on accession for each individual country , and if not on 12 December , then on 13 December .
Mr President , I have often , in this Assembly , had the opportunity to quote from the excellent Norwegian handbook for mountaineers .
There are many examples , both in this House and in the European Union as a whole , of this fundamental rule 's not being taken note of .
None of the fundamental problems of what is termed eastward enlargement has been solved .
On the one hand , there is no doubt that the economic realities will entail our maintaining the tradition , going back many years , of Western European exploitation of our Eastern European neighbours , involving differences in wages , differences in capital and so on .
On the other hand , the adjustment taking place is an expression of the demand for an infrastructure , which was referred to by my fellow countryman Torben Lund and which is a long way from being in place .
Let me just add that our excellent Minister for Europe is a terrific songwriter but that songwriting ability is not enough in this context .
I should like to thank Mr Bourlanges for his concluding remark which gives me a welcome opportunity now to present my few concluding observations .
