languages which I chair , and he told us about this problem and about the problem of the administrative reform , which is an attempt to rob the minority of the basis of their livelihood .
Mr President , in the run-up to the G7 summit the Council adopted a new action programme to support the Russian Federation .
Thirdly , with whom did you actually arrange your appearance , or did you want to make your independent contribution to the democratic deficit of the G7 , which is of course well known ?
It was to be the summit that would give impetus to pan-European development and democratization .
I am becoming more and more convinced that the heads of government are playing with fire in their European policy and that it is they who are slowly but surely becoming the real threat to Europe !
But now that we are summing it up after six months and suddenly find that some important directives with which we had great difficulties in the past were adopted during the Italian presidency of the Council or at least that a common position was reached , we have to revise some of our criticism and admit that the Dini and Prodi government did make good preparations and proved able to carry them through in a range of areas .
I think the Commission has submitted a sensible proposal here , on the basis of which we can hold sensible talks over the coming months .
It is now up to the Member States to do their homework so that the European Union can make the necessary contribution to this .
These statements have to be reflected in the annual budgetary procedures , Mr Santer !
Overall , the consumers are acquiring more rights , which is something we must also tell the citizens as consumers .
We all know that environmental policy cannot be pursued at purely national level and that every improvement will benefit all the citizens of the Union if it leads to fewer dangerous substances , less air pollution , less environmental damage .
In particular this involves updating the existing legislative texts on the classification , packaging and labelling of dangerous substances , on pest control and pesticides , on batteries and on the lead content of petrol .
Commissioner , Article 69 of the Treaty of Accession states that specific provisions may be retained and will be reviewed by 1998 .
At this point I first want to give warm thanks to the draftsmen of the opinions for their cooperation .
Legislative simplification at Community level certainly does not automatically entail legislative simplification in the individual Member States .
No doubt it is particularly important and desirable to simplify legislation , and above all many procedures , for the small and medium-sized undertakings .
So , the word that became the central concept is not only a little dusty anyway , but as a programme it has manoeuvred our economy precisely into the situation we are now in , namely the economic and social crisis of mass unemployment .
Jacques Santer said : ' Europe has no shortage of trump cards , and lacks only a strategy for playing them . '
It also means that the many policies of the individual directorates-general must at last be coordinated and made more open so that anyone can see what is actually happening there overall .
Why are there major differences between France and Germany , indeed extreme differences in wind-power technology ?
By promoting regional projects and activities new jobs can be created .
That is not what the European Parliament wants !
The real squanderers of the environment and of resources are clearly pinpointed as the highly-developed industrialized countries .
Sometimes , sportswomen from these countries are even threatened by fundamentalist groups .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , nothing has changed .
Countries in which girls and women are prevented from realising their potential cannot and must not receive material or political support from the European Union .
I am very glad to see how energetically you keep doing so , in our committee and here in Parliament .
Finally , we must also pay attention to the balanced distribution of the horizontal information and cooperation networks to preclude from the outset any risk of distortions of competition in this area too .
In our view , the protection of people and the environment in the vicinity of potentially dangerous installations must be improved further .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for the second time , Parliament is debating the Commission proposal amending the sectoral directive .
The discussions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy pursuant to Rule 59 did not bring any new findings to light .
Mr Simpson , Mr Seal , I cannot understand you at all !
Who would not be in favour of the liberalization of competition ?
Thirdly , the concept of self-handler must be clearly defined .
I should therefore like to reiterate that our main objective is - and must continue to be - to ensure that airports remain as independent economic bodies .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , before I start , I should like to make a brief point concerning speaking time .
And this is where my report differs from the other two reports that are before us today , because the legal basis of the other two directives is Article 100 , and they must be adopted unanimously by the Council , with Parliament merely being consulted .
That is why I should like to remind you of something again today , namely that the European internal market began on 1 January 1993 , with fireworks and celebrations throughout the European Union .
Nowadays , criminal activity needs to be tackled using quite different instruments - Interpol , for example , and the data bases that are to be installed there .
