report .     . – In reacting to the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the European Union showed its solidarity with the United States’ goal of preventing and fighting terrorism .
We have to determine which data may be transmitted and ensure that there is no discriminatory treatment and no retention of data beyond a passenger’s stay .
In addition , the bee population has been declining in certain places at the same time , one cause being the use of systemic neurotoxic pesticides to treat the seeds of certain crops .
I am therefore delighted at the adoption of our proposal for the Commission to carry out an overall assessment of the damage and to devise the requisite Community support measures .     . – I voted for the excellent own-initiative report by Mr Arlindo Cunha on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , which underlines the importance of a more active Community policy geared to signing international fisheries agreements .
On behalf of my group , I would like to request that a report be referred back to committee , pursuant to Rule 154 of the Rules of Procedure .
Our aim in making this request is not to change what has already been approved in committee , or to call into question the Committee on Industry’s status .
This prize constitutes a huge boost in the struggle for the emancipation of women in Iran , and in the struggle for democracy against the theocratic rule of the mullahs in that country .
Mr President , I would be grateful if you would congratulate Mrs Ebadi , because this Nobel Prize deserves a mention here , since it has been awarded to someone engaged in a great cause , one of the causes of this House , the cause of democracy , rights and freedoms .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to use this speech to welcome the progress made in the interinstitutional dialogue and the compromise which I believe has been reached .
I would simply like to use this opportunity to remind you of some of the resolutions we have adopted recently .
We all know how important forests are to the planetary balance , to biodiversity and to economic activity , not to mention the aesthetic and environmental benefits they bring .
The first was the cut in the total funding for achieving these lofty ambitions , a cut rendered scarcely less swingeing by the compromise obtained .
The images of last summer ’s towering infernos , which left a swathe of destruction in their wake , especially in Portugal , are still very vivid for us .
That resolution asked not only for more funds to bolster the Forest Focus programme , but also for the inclusion in that programme of adequate prevention measures consonant with the actions laid down in Regulation No 2158/92 , which expired on 31 December 2002 .
Moreover , I regret the fact that the final compromise does not consider all of these measures together .
The prevention measures , therefore , aim to reduce the size of the affected areas , fight the causes of fire and monitor our forests .
With a view to financing these prevention measures , therefore , I have already proposed increasing the amounts in the European Union’s general budget , by means of the financial perspective for the period up to 2006 .
Finally , the care taken over linguistic matters and the principle of cultural diversity , the quality label and coordination between higher education and professional training , are also important .
Some fundamental questions remain , however .
These services are needed for economic progress and modernisation , just as the measure of extending the high speed network is also required , at present , in order to dynamise and revitalise productive activity .
To my mind , this liberalisation can only be understood in the broad sense of greater competition in both the freight and passenger transport sectors , at both national and international levels .
Since these devices have proved to have clear benefits in the air and road sectors , in lorries and on buses , I cannot conceive of any justification for not applying the same technology on the railways .
The main amendment aims to put back the first transmission of data to 31 December 2003 , to allow for the delay in approving this proposal .
I voted against this report , even though I understand its aim of prolonging the application of a lower rate of excise duty on tobacco products released in Corsica .
It is unfortunate that the compromise adopted on forest fire prevention and financing for the Forest Focus programme did not live up to the rapporteur’s original proposals , which we supported .
The main question posed during the debate was this : should fire prevention be covered under the regulation on rural development , or should it be reintroduced into Forest Focus ?
That process began at first reading , which took place in February .
More than that , in fact , it would be totally intolerable , given the striking lessons imparted anew last summer by yet another ruinous disaster .
They should , therefore , be selected on the basis of the quality of the training on offer , as well as the hosting provided for students .
Although the European Parliament agrees with the Commission on this issue , it wants to increase the budget to EUR 230 million , compared to the Council’s proposal of just EUR 180 million .
The amounts earmarked for scholarships and to the ‘quality of the hosting provided for students’ , already mentioned here , still fall well below what is required in order to broaden the social base from which Erasmus students and teachers are drawn .
The importance of the Union’s linguistic diversity will be reflected in the need for third-country students to be familiar with at least two European Union languages .
