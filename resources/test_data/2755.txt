I should like to have some assurances that the Council will be represented at a sufficiently senior level to offer the respect which this Parliament traditionally offers when these sorts of visits occur .
( Applause from the right )
.
Mr President , whilst the Council has made this request and we are quite happy to do what we can to ensure that things are speeded up , there is no need to vote on this urgency today .
It is planned for our agenda in May .
The way the finances are at present , there will be no problem in financing the High Representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina , whose money is guaranteed until the end of this year , as are also the substantial funds available for the UNMIK operation there .
We can leave this until next month .
( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
1998 discharge , budgetary control Mr President , my report is about the European Coal and Steel Community and how that fits in with Mrs Stauner 's report and the discharge .
We have decided to give the discharge on three conditions , and the conditions are clearly spelt out .
We hope that by 15 August those concerned will give us the information that is requested .
What I find extraordinary is that EUR 2 billion are being managed by this vestige - the last remainder of the European Coal and Steel Community , which , of course , was very important historically but is not important any more .
It is being wound up and it is remarkable that such an instrument should continue with that budget and 145 staff .
I believe such an instrument should be wound up as quickly as possible so that it is incorporated in perhaps a reformed European Investment Bank : a European Investment Bank that is transparent and accountable .
Such investments can and should be made by professional banks rather than the little outfit that we have at the moment .
The number of people employed for the amount of money being invested is again quite disproportionate .
I am hoping that this can be wound up speedily and incorporated in either the EIB or the European Investment Fund , because that would be a better way of using the money and resources .
This is for the social and research fund , but again these objectives could be better addressed by a bank that would ask other banks to manage investments so that we have the highest return .
I hope that the three conditions , the conditional discharge and the obligations on those concerned to address these conditions will be taken seriously .
Far too often in the past we have found that promises have been made and not kept .
So I hope that the answers will be given to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I think that is about all I need to say .
On that basis I recommend to this House a discharge .
Mr President , the Committee on Budgetary Control has considered several reports recently , mostly relating to the 1998 discharge procedure .
It is a strange time for us to be considering how the Commission is faring after its forced resignation last year due to many of the issues highlighted in the 1996 discharge .
The discharge procedure is , of course , an opportunity for the European Parliament to exercise its responsibility in terms of monitoring the Commission and the other institutions ' behaviour .
We check their accounts .
We ensure that policies have been well managed .
The Commission spent the last year preparing for a radical reform , outlined in the White Paper presented on 1 March , and we appreciate that it will take more than a few months to turn this massive tanker around .
Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee are , however , keen to ensure that the reform occurs at a speedy pace , which is why we have decided to postpone discharge in the expectation that the Commission will hit the targets that we have set them within the next two months .
The report as it stands at the moment is very different from the initial report that was submitted by Mrs Stauner on behalf of the EPP Group .
That was clearly used as a political battering ram .
Mrs Stauner quoted Goethe .
I will quote Shakespeare .
The report was full of sound and fury signifying nothing .
That is why the explanatory statement attached to this report has not been agreed by the Budgetary Control Committee .
It makes no sense in the context of the postponement report , and it is totally nonsensical and hysterical in tone .
We are delighted that there was an almost unanimous consensus , however , on the new practical approach to the general discharge .
We would like to thank the rapporteur for her cooperation on that .
We expect and hope that the Commission will deliver and the rapporteur will perhaps take a more considered approach in her final report .
But one thing which has become manifestly clear to me during this process is that we need an overhaul of the discharge procedure to avoid this kind of confrontation again .
This discharge procedure should be an opportunity to study systems failures within the Commission .
In an ideal world , it should be based on the Court of Auditors ' Report , but that does mean that both the Budgetary Control Committee and the Court of Auditors must develop a much closer relationship .
There is a massive amount of expertise in the Court of Auditors , expertise that Parliament should draw on in order to reach its own political conclusions .
The discharge procedure should not be a time to score political points nor to hound individuals but , where systems fail and lead to inefficiency
