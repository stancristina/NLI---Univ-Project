if we were laughed at to some extent and told that there was , of course , no danger .
That was why we , back home in Sweden , banned it a long time ago .
The first is that it must be possible to trace every raw material in every type of food back through the chain .
Every food producer must be aware of this fact .
On this subject , I want to point out that those of us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party have tabled an amendment I hope will be voted through .
In economic policy , we in fact do all we can to increase efficiency , dynamism and response rates .
In spite of the fact that there is money around and in spite of the fact that Europe has never been richer , it appears to be more and more difficult to protect the weak and give the marginalised a proper chance .
What is particularly good is that she emphasises so strongly that fine words are not enough and that solidarity costs money .
It may be true of people with mental difficulties and of large groups of people who do not have a good enough knowledge of the language in order to get jobs .
I mentioned what is paradoxical in society .
Mr President , I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a quite excellent report .
This indicates that labour market policy and traditional employment policy are not enough .
It is important for unemployment to decline and for there to be more jobs .
Housing policy , too , is an important area .
We also know however that , in view of the present economic situation with its cross-border economy , it is necessary for us to act at a European level in order to create added value and not in order to take over anything else .
A programme like this , designed to combat social exclusion and poverty , is most excellently suited for this purpose .
Wars and other conflicts have always been a male province , but the majority of victims - 90 per cent - are civilian .
Women are nonetheless excluded from the peace negotiations , and their needs and priorities are overlooked .
In the negotiations which preceded NATO' s bombing of Kosovo four years later , there was only one woman in the delegation .
If we exclude 50 per cent of the population , we shall not obtain a sustainable peace .
This is also apparent from a series of UN documents , most recently the resolution concerning women , peace and security adopted by the Security Council two weeks ago .
I propose a supplement to the fourth Geneva protocol whereby rape , forced pregnancy and sexual slavery are to be defined as war crimes in the same way as terrorism and torture .
I urge the Member States to ratify the Treaty of Rome for a permanent international criminal court .
This applies especially to peacekeeping forces .
Despite the fact that only a limited number of women have been involved , studies show that women ' s participation in the UN' s peacekeeping forces improves relations with the local population , as well as general morale .
Sustainable peace cannot be created if half the human race is ignored .
In my case , it is impossible to do that because I think that Mrs Theorin' s report ought to be rejected .
Instead , the report deals with everything from the conditions experienced by women in refugee camps to the ways in which women develop strength and active influence .
Mrs Theorin fought for a long time to stop Sweden becoming a member of the European Union .
I strongly object to the attitude of mind , expressed in this Chamber this evening , whereby one sex is made collectively guilty .
I do not , in fact , consider it to be a serious piece of work .
It must be respected , and it needs to be valued more highly .
Certain proposals are too detailed .
Wages are too low , there is an increase in illicit work , and a situation often prevails in which women , often immigrants , are the first to be exploited .
Many end up outside the social security systems .
' Legitimate ' domestic help is often too expensive nowadays when VAT and employers ' charges have to be paid .
First of all , that it would militate against equality between men and women .
The second argument is that it would create a B team within the labour market .
It is important , too , to ensure that immigrant women are not exploited in terms of everything from poor wages to a lack of social security and outright oppression .
What , in fact , is the rationale behind saying that you are to have tax deductions for having your floors polished but not for having your rubbish taken away ?
Mr President , openness and public scrutiny of the basis of a democratic form of government are the prerequisites for citizens being able to follow the public decision-making process and to participate in this process .
This report establishes the essence of what will become a European principle of public access to official documents , that is to say , the principle that all documents must be publicly available .
If access is refused , a reason for this must be provided .
We have therefore proposed , as a democratic safety valve , that those documents which - after examination - cannot be made public , could be communicated to a small group of Members of Parliament .
The Cashman report is the first step on a long road towards increased openness , democracy and confidence on the part of our citizens .
