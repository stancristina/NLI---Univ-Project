The process is described in terms of – a word that we cannot translate into Danish but whose content is conveyed by the term .
With the Constitution , a group of Heads of State or Government will obtain the right to give the EU more power without ever having to consult the electorate again .
The right to elect the executive and hold them responsible is to disappear in favour of a top-down bureaucracy without democratic control , administrative law and ministerial responsibility .
The right to regret the outcome of an election and take a different decision is to be taken away from the electorate , which will only be able to get its decisions changed with the approval of the Commission in Brussels – the same Commission in which we , as voters , are to lose the right to have our own national Commissioners .
Without any participation by our countries , a majority of the Commission will be able to adopt a Commission law that takes precedence over each country ’s constitution , even if there has not been a single person from that country present .
During its Presidency , Ireland has paved the way for having to lose that right again .
The electorate is entitled to a vote .
In this Parliament , we have created a group for independence and democracy that calls upon the electorate to reject the proposed Constitution .
Please note that we are to meet during the next sitting , on Tuesday at 1 p.m. after the vote , if you wish to help defend the right to our democracy against the new draft Constitution .     Mr President , dear Mr Barroso , my group submitted three questions about greater openness and better control .
We now hope that you personally will answer our questions frankly .
We want a President who dares , and is able , to answer the questions himself and who dares to accept responsibility for the organisation as a whole .
We have , for example , asked for an internal list of the more than 1 350 working parties in the Commission , which are all funded by European taxpayers .
Who are the members of these ?
Who have their travel expenses refunded ?
Why , in the new accounting system too , will no one be in a position to reveal whether the same people have their travel expenses paid for more than one meeting in the same week ?
I am merely saying that we cannot check up on whether it is happening .
Mr Barroso , we are prepared to be pleasantly surprised , but I am obliged to say that we were given many more pledges by Mr Prodi when he took office than we have so far been given by yourself , and he , for his part , delivered the goods .
It took Mr Prodi a whole legislative period to fulfil that pledge , but he kept his word .
Now , we must go further and have full scrutiny of the legislative process .
We want to know what the Commission is proposing in the Council’s working parties .
We want to know what is going on in the Commission itself .
By pricking their bubble , whistleblowers woke the bureaucrats out of their dream .
I hope that we see a President who dares to make available a list of the committees that get ideas on everything from rules governing the size of strawberries to a common criminal law .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Barroso , as chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I must say one thing to you today .
It is not an impulsive act .
We did not spare you .
Mr Barroso , we have listened with great care to what you have said to us .
You have said what we wanted to hear but , even though the right words about solidarity , progress and security are important , they are not enough .
They must be accompanied by practical and specific political content and focused action and by programmes that are politically binding and that the people of each of the European countries can use in their day-to-day lives .
Mr Barroso , we are concerned here with more and better jobs and with European cooperation that strengthens the social security that people feel is under threat .
It is not a case of first the one and then the other , but of both at the same time and in the same place .
We would therefore ask you again today , Mr Barroso , if , firstly , you are going to commit yourself to reforming – and I emphasise the word ‘reforming ’ – the Stability and Growth Pact so that we obtain more and better jobs .
Thirdly , will you genuinely ensure that European enlargement becomes a day-to-day reality for people ?
We do not have the policies .
We are anxious to hear whether we are to be given them today .     Mr President , dear Josep Borrell , my group would also like to congratulate you on your election as President , and we hope you will be a good President for us all , irrespective of where we come from and irrespective of what we think of the draft Constitution .
It will give more power and influence to us here in this House .
The EU will be able to make decisions in 15 new areas .
We shall be given majority decision-making in 40 new areas in which it will be possible for the national parliaments to be voted down .
The democratic problem is , however , that the national parliaments will lose much more power than the European Parliament will gain .
Democracy is being restricted in our countries , and the electorate will end up losing out the most .
