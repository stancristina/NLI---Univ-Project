Reality has shown that neither of these methods is up to the task and we therefore want to see rules of entry that enable us to be generous in integrating immigrants .
We cannot agree in the same way , however , to the planned creation of a European Corps of Border Guards , which needs to be discussed at greater length .
The situation of the various Member States as regards the services sector is extremely diverse : Portugal , for example , has enormous potential to create jobs in this field , especially intensive knowledge-based services to be supplied to businesses and other institutions , family support services and tourism and associated activities .
Furthermore , the administrative barriers obstructing the free movement of workers and the cross-border provision of services must be removed .
As regards the Purvis report , which deals with defining EU rules for personal investments and covers an enormous range of financial products , it appears to be absolutely essential to plug the current gap in the legislation .
Parliament has already looked into the problem of financial derivatives , highlighting the important role they currently play in capital markets , but , more importantly , spelling out the advantages and the risks involved .
On 23 July 2003 , the Commission published a proposal on the reform of the system of reduced rates of VAT , with the aim of streamlining the system , as part of a move towards a definitive regime that would discontinue the experiment of applying reduced VAT to certain labour intensive services ( Directive 1999/8 5 ) .
It is important now , at the end of the legislative period , to carry out an evaluation of the directive before us .     .
I voted in favour .     .
Parliament has shown that this type of administrative cooperation does not affect material tax law , but rather seeks to ensure that the single market works well .
Yet it does not offer any coherent proposals on how to remedy these problems .
These figures are all the more revealing when compared with the US , where the service sector accounts for 80 % of economic activity and 80 % of the work force .
It is therefore valuable that the Commission was able to pinpoint the areas where coordinated European action can be of benefit , without overlooking different national realities and sensitivities – integration into the labour market , recognition of migrants ’ qualifications , linguistic and educational abilities , housing and urban issues , health and social services and social and cultural integration .
The text raises important issues , such as migratory flows , improving the integration of immigrants and the need for cooperation with countries of origin .
Yet it endorses the Council’s decision that Member States should announce legal immigration quotas , which could be used to establish , at EU level , a joint position in negotiations on readmission agreements .
This explains our vote .     .
I also welcome the Commission ’s proposal regarding the creation of a European Corps of Border Guards , comprising special units and financed by the Community , which , if necessary , and at the request of Member States , could be temporarily detached to help the national authorities monitor at-risk sections of the EU’s external borders , without , however , usurping Member States’ competences .     .
A European public register must be created at company level , containing information on companies that have been fined or subject to other financial penalties within the framework of this Directive .
Within this context , Mrs Glase’s report focuses on reviewing the ways in which the Directive is applied , concerning the posting of workers to other EU Member States within the framework of the provision of services .
Hedge funds were behind the crisis that beset Europe’s financial system in 1992 and behind the Asian crisis of 1997-1998.
The funds to be regulated by this system would be thus defined , since they would be obliged to comply with these particular provisions .
I voted in favour of the motion on humanitarian aid to Iran following the recent earthquake in Bam .
One of the novelties imposed , however , by the changes in recent decades , and which has played an increasingly significant role in the last few years , is precisely that of the collective copyright management societies .
These glaring discrepancies affect us all , leave our creators , artists and other agents in this key area unprotected and make us particularly weak and vulnerable in the face of global competitiveness , which is increasingly aggressive at world level and sometimes even savage and buccaneering , as we know .
I also wish to note the reasons why we support this compromise motion for a resolution , which once again , like the others that we have tabled in the course of this parliamentary term , condemns the regime and which calls for sanctions to be re-imposed and for diplomatic pressure to be exerted on Mugabe that will lead to the democratic transformation of the country .
We need to achieve more effective results not only because of the growing tragedy in Zimbabwe , but also because this could be a focus for instability and could set a bad example .
The Commission will therefore consider extending those measures for a further year .
To be more specific , and in response to Mr Ribeiro e Castro , I would remind the House that Zimbabwe is a focal country in the context of 2002-2004 European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights funding .
Mr President , the Commission joins in the strong condemnation of the brutal murder last month of Archbishop Michael Courtney , and expresses its deep sympathy to his family and to the Holy See .
For example , we
