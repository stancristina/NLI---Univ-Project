The Member States must produce action plans and measures , but people have to put them into practice themselves . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to thank Mrs Bozkurt for her report , which described the situation of women in Turkey very well .
We agree that the issue of the constitutional treaty will be the crucial issue for the 2009 elections - both in connection with our self-perception and our relationship to our citizens , and , secondly , also in terms of a 27-member European Union 's capacity for action .
