I would also point out , as regards the famous bonus which has caused such a stir , that if there is justification for paying every employee at the European Central Bank an annual bonus of 9 % of their salary , then 38 % over a period of 54 months comes out at 8.5 % per annum .
Mrs de Veyrac 's report shows willing and contains certain constructive proposals , which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of it .
Excessive and uncontrolled use of land , buildings springing up in historic town centres , in the countryside and in green belts and the lack of any proper measures to protect forests and the natural environment are evidence of our rape of the natural and cultural landscape .
We could cite numerous other examples in connection with the destruction inflicted or which it is planned to inflict in order to stage the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004 .
The ÅU has a penchant for waxing lyrical about culture , but while it preaches that cultural heritage is a basic factor in the individual identity and historical development of a society , it has done nothing to get the Elgin marbles returned to the natural and historic site of which they form an integral part , even as a gesture of respect for our cultural and historic heritage and for the need to protect historic monuments .
We need to mobilise the masses , all the cultural agencies , all the workers , and we need to impose a different policy , one which respects the working man and the fruits of his creation .
This parliamentary report reveals exactly how the above funding is managed and shows how the EU taxpayers ' money is being squandered , with no controls or transparency , in order to consolidate the expansion of the huge interests of the EU in the NATO protectorate of Bosnia , declarations of 'humanitarian and peace-making ' motives notwithstanding .
We are not surprised that those who 'promote ' peace with depleted uranium bombs , spreading death and destruction , cannot and will not play the role of peacemaker .
People are not accounts ; their consciences cannot be bought off and however much you try to embellish the facts , you still have to contend with the people .
The Members of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the Bushill-Matthews report because the specific " Measures on financial assistance for innovative and job-creating Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises ( SMEs ) " proposed in the report form part of the more general policy exercised by the monopolies and the EU against SMEs , to which there are three strands : · Selective support for a small group of what are - by Greek standards - medium-sized and large enterprises , with a view to consolidating their satellite role around the monopolies and strengthening the processes used to concentrate capital and production . · Worsening competitive terms for the overwhelming majority of the remaining small and medium-sized enterprises , in a bid to strengthen the same processes by the back door . · In addition to the aforementioned , it is clear from all the EU programmes on SMEs that big business is keen to 'offload ' ( on to SMEs ) the jobs which it is forced to abolish as it increases its exploitation of the working classes , helped by technological progress .
Hence , even if grants under European programmes manage to reach small enterprises , they cannot be used to advantage , because each of these enterprises is in an extremely weak position on the capitalist market .
From this point of view , the concern about small enterprises expressed in the parliamentary report is well-founded . 2.
The results of this policy are even worse : 2 238 new jobs were finally created , compared with several million unemployed in the ÅU , at a cost of EUR 122 000 ( GDR 42 million ) each . 5 . 97 % of SMEs which benefited from these measures come under the third strand of the programmes , i .e . the companies received guarantees for funding for which they themselves were wholly responsible .
Of course , the political will must be there but it depends mainly on the monitoring carried out by your office , Commissioner .
If , for example , you receive repeated complaints , instead of dealing with them through time-consuming correspondence , you should take a persistent and decisive stand and make sure the legislation really is implemented .
I should particularly like to draw your attention to Directive 92/43 on Natura 2000 areas .
These factors are , first , that the CAP , especially in its post-1992 form and following Agenda 2000 , does not safeguard a viable income for most small or medium-sized farming households , or a survival income for the heads of these households , which is why no one wants to invest anything at all in the farming sector , however many grants there may be - not that there are that many - because not only is it unprofitable , it does not even afford a basic income .
This requirement becomes prohibitive when combined with quotas .
That is why we cannot vote in favour of this report ; it is because it conceals the real reasons .
May I draw the Commissioner 's attention , as on other occasions I have drawn Parliament 's attention to the fact that , in cases of disasters such as fire , flood or earthquake , what is needed is fast State intervention to tackle the problem and , more importantly , save lives .
You must give a reply here .
First : I should like to say to Mr Solana that when , in 1999 , we and some of our fellow members tried to find out if depleted uranium was
