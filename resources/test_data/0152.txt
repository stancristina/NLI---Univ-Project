The Zapatero government in Spain has done the same , legalising 700 000 illegal immigrants .
So I say , thank you , Switzerland !
As President Borrell Fontelles , Commissioner Frattini and now the President-in-Office of the Council have also pointed out , that is why it is not just a case of a humanitarian emergency or a one-off event ; above all it is a structural problem , which is testing the whole European Union and its ability to implement a European immigration policy at last .
Such a policy is needed not in order to do any particular Member State a favour , but because the Union as a whole is involved .
We are dealing with policies in which it seems clear what Europe can and should do : it needs to develop a common asylum system , common rules on legal immigration , and common management of our external borders .
As the coordinator for my group in the temporary committee on the CIA , I have addressed the problem with my colleagues and we have all looked for solutions together .
Greater control is also needed over the activities of one country ’s secret services when they are operating on another’s territory .
The steady flow of boats trying to reach the Union’s shores shows no signs of abating ; indeed , it is increasing .
It is the Council , however , that has to decide to address a situation that has been a human tragedy for some time .
For that not to be just empty rhetoric , however , we have to give up the hypocrisy of grandiose , theoretical statements of principle at Council meetings and stop using the immigration issue for domestic political ends , a practice that is utterly unacceptable and irresponsible .
Terrorism still remains the main threat to our democracy .
I fully agree with Mr Barón Crespo , and I call on the Member States once more to draft some projects : European funds can only be spent if projects are put forward by EU Member States .
The truth is therefore precisely the opposite of what was suggested : it is in the interests of safety that we intend to propose a system that all the governments have asked us to provide .
The first concerns solidarity .
That , too , is solidarity .
We have talked about it a great deal : we need vision , as Mr Schulz and many others have said , to steer and to activate the political processes .
Practical solutions therefore need to be found urgently to contain and regulate the problem .
Europe just looks on , while their school books still teach Turkish children that the Armenian genocide is a fabrication of history .
Josef Ratzinger is not Javier Solana .
Instead , starting with Mr Pannella’s appeal for peace in the Middle East , we have to revive our federalist and democratic aspirations , so as to create a Europe that can include the largest possible number of people in a political project of freedom , democratic reform and peace .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the humanitarian and political situation in Darfur is getting worse from one day to the next .
It would be even better , of course , if the Sudanese Government approved the deployment of the UN force ; I hope it will , and I also think that the Arab League countries should put more effective pressure on Khartoum to accept the UN resolution .
It was a strategy to Arabise – and I mean just that : not to Islamise , but to Arabise – an area inhabited by what many official Sudanese Government documents termed the ‘Darfur monkeys’ , in other words the people of Darfur .
For it to play that role , however , the great political debate that we must address is how Europe can take these values beyond its borders and uphold them when there are other parties like the Sudanese Government , which tolerates and encourages fundamentalism and the most violent , horrible excesses committed by the militias .
Logistical assistance on the ground is thus another area where we , the European Union , can make a difference .
Do you believe that it would be possible to intervene unilaterally without a strong role for the Arab League ?
In this context I heard somebody mention a ‘no-fly zone’ ; that is a measure that could be explored , adopted and proposed .
Such isolation would be particularly devastating for Sudan itself : being isolated from the rest of the international community would not be in Khartoum’s interests ; that , then , ladies and gentlemen , would take away President Bashir’s excuse for maintaining such a negative attitude .
Sixty-five per cent of the population work in the agricultural sector , with its antiquated structures and methods .
The recent disagreements in the Doha Round in Geneva led to a few difficulties , but India and the European Union should accept the responsibility of revitalising a multilateral framework .
I feel , however , that the efforts made so far in the fight against child labour , dumping – especially in the textile and footwear industries – and piracy , and to steer development along ecologically sound lines have been feeble and insufficient .
The report comes out strongly in defence of employment levels in this sector , which comprises 90 000 vessels and employs some 190 000 workers in Europe .
If we just bear those points in mind , we can help those parts of the weakest regions in the European economic system that have close links with fishing to protect their jobs and to continue supplying Europe’s consumers .     – We are all aware of the difficult situation
