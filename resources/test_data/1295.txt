result of this process will be increased openness in the EU Institutions , thanks to a large extent to the serious work done by this House on operating in a spirit of openness .
I would like Mr Danielsson to confirm that it is the Prime Minister ' s absolute intention that the Constitution of Sweden will not be changed in any way .
However , Mr Schmidt need not worry .
These measures are carried out by the Member States themselves , but the Council monitors actual implementation through its relevant subordinate bodies .
As the honourable Member no doubt knows , the European Council obliged the EU to intensify cooperation to combat trafficking in human beings following the tragic events in Dover last year .
Within the framework of implementing the action plan for Morocco , and as the EU is aware that the action plan must be implemented through partnership and cooperation with the Moroccan authorities , a delegation from the EU under the leadership of the presidency made a second visit to Rabat to open a dialogue with the Moroccan authorities .
The Council ' s subordinate bodies are currently looking at a proposal from the Commission on this matter .
The work on this problem must consist of two elements .
One element involves fighting the criminality that is associated with trafficking in human beings and the like .
I am convinced that with joint efforts we can achieve success .
The dialogue to which I referred , which was introduced to the Moroccan authorities through visits , will hopefully provide concrete results as soon as possible .
I can therefore only remind the house that within the framework of the Schengen regulations there is what is known as carrier ' s liability .
Both parties to the conflict are continuing their military operations and a political solution to the conflict still seems far away .
Moreover , the catastrophic situation in respect of humanitarian circumstances and human rights in the country has led to massive emigration of refugees to neighbouring countries , particularly Iran and Pakistan , making it even more difficult to make an assessment of the population situation in Afghanistan .
The recently updated common position of 25 January 2001 forms the basis of the Union ' s policy in respect of Afghanistan .
We will continue to call upon the Afghan factions to cease their discriminatory policy and to recognise , protect and encourage equal rights and dignity for men and women , including access to education and health facilities , employment , personal safety and the absence of injustices and persecution , as well as emphasising the negative consequences that discriminatory policy will have for active supply of aid .
First of all , we must continue with generous humanitarian aid in order to alleviate suffering , particularly suffering by Afghan women and children .
Secondly , we must continue to exert pressure on the Taliban regime so that it ceases its systematic crimes against human rights .
Unfortunately , the honourable Member is , of course , right in his description of the fact that the situation in Afghanistan has clearly worsened in recent times .
It is our hope that the clear message that was sent out , for example , by the recently adopted resolution in the UN Security Council , together with international efforts - which as we know do not just involve the Union but also a large part of the international community - will gradually produce results .
The Council is pleased to tell MEPs that the environmental protection requirements under article 6 of the EC Treaty are to be integrated into the elaboration and implementation of the Community ' s policies and activities , particularly with a view to encouraging sustainable development .
In December 1999 in Helsinki , the Council established the timetable for the European Council in Gothenburg and called upon the Council to complete its work on incorporating the environmental dimensions into all the Council ' s activities by producing overall strategies , if possible accompanied by a timetable for the measures to be taken and a set of indicators for the sectors concerned .
Internally within the Council , the various bodies that prepare the considerations have a duty to use the various steps of the traditional decision-making process to ensure good coordination in order , as best as possible , to meet the challenge set by the European Council .
Without dealing with this matter exhaustively - which is not possible because it covers an incredibly wide area - I would like to emphasise some of the most relevant aspects of the situation .
The application of these conclusions and the set of indicators is to be evaluated at two-yearly intervals .
A number of measures are to commence within the framework of the action plan for increased energy efficiency based on the priorities established by the Council at its meeting on 5 December 2000 .
Once again : hopefully , the conclusions that will be established at the European Council summit in Gothenburg will be of very great interest .
The Ecofin Council will undoubtedly be urged to apply such a strategy within its area of authority as soon as the European Council has approved such a strategy .
It is on that occasion that we will hopefully be able to answer the questions put by the honourable Member .
The Cardiff process , as it is known , is a new way of working as far as the European Union is concerned .
We are now attempting to gather together all this experience and formulate the strategy and the ideas and proposals that the honourable Member is looking for .
The honourable Member refers to the Council constellation in which it is possibly most difficult to find the concrete framework demanded by the work on sustainable development .
