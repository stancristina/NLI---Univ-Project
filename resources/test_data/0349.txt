That cannot be a desirable outcome .
Mr President , Commissioner , the purpose of the Structural Funds is to target the poorest and most run-down areas of the European Union , those in greatest need of development , with extra money to help them begin to rebuild the economy , create jobs and regenerate poorer communities .
Additionality is meant to ensure that happens and to prevent governments from using EU funding to replace their own aid as this would defeat the object .
But in many regions and nations that is what happens at the moment and I can illustrate the problem using the example of Wales .
The granting of EU Objective 1 status to West Wales and the Valleys last year was an acknowledgement of the poverty in two-thirds of the country .
EUR 1.2 billion of European funding used effectively could provide exactly the additional help that is intended .
But if we look at the government budget to Wales , in practice there will be no more government spending next year with Objective 1 than there is this year before Objective 1 .
The National Assembly budget which comes from the Treasury remains the same so that in the first fifteen months , at least , of the new programme period there are no additional resources at all .
The money will be taken from other budgets in the National Assembly , such as health and education .
Therefore central government expenditure is reduced .
Under the Structural Funds , areas of greatest need are identified and selected on regional criteria .
Yet when the Commission looks at additionality it is dealt with on a Member State level .
This is a clear contradiction .
The rules as they stand allow this to happen .
Member States are not legally required to demonstrate additionality at the regional or programme level .
I agree with the statement made by Commissioner Barnier in a written reply to me when he said that the spirit of additionality rather than the letter of the law on the matter is an important consideration .
We need the revision of the system and a central part of that is looking at additionality internally in the Member States at the programme level as well as at the Member State level .
Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that Member States respect the principle and the spirit of additionality so that funds are targeted and spent effectively .
So we are asking in this question , Commissioner , for confirmation that this will be done and I look forward to the vote on this debate in April .
Mr President , can I begin by thanking my colleague from Wales - though from another party , Jillian Evans , for raising this issue .
I do not think that there is a more important issue in Wales at the moment than the application of Objective 1 funds and it is important to look at the background to the issues that we are currently considering .
There are two major news stories breaking in the United Kingdom today .
One is the shock news of BMW 's decision to break up the Rover-Land Rover Group with the threat of massive redundancies right the way across the UK and the other breaking news this morning is the Conservative Party 's stunning victory in the Ayr by-election driving the defending Labour Party into a miserable third place with a swing of almost 10 % .
Now these stories are not just topical background to this debate .
In my view , they underpin the very issues which we are considering in the context of Structural Fund spending under Objectives 1 and 2 in those parts of the European Union which are facing major economic problems .
As we have already heard from Jillian Evans , a major part of Wales , in constituencies which I also represent , has been granted Objective 1 status , but sadly ever since that announcement was made by the Commission , our problems in Wales have actually got even worse .
As a direct result of what I would describe as UK government policy , our agricultural economy has all but collapsed .
Farm incomes are at their lowest level for a generation and this decline is also hitting the manufacturing sector .
I do not apologise for saying that the massive overvaluation of sterling which gives the UK Labour Chancellor an electoral war-chest of unprecedented proportions has handicapped every Welsh and UK manufacturer trying to export into the European market .
It is little wonder that BMW blames the Rover decision directly on UK government economic policy , but that I fear is little comfort to the thousands of workers in Rover who have strained to improve the efficiency of the company only to find that their efforts have been undermined in Downing Street .
I turn then to the central hand of Labour government at work in terms of the European Structural Funds package .
The unacceptable behaviour of the UK Government over this has already brought about the timely end of the political career of the first Secretary of the Welsh Assembly .
Sadly , the Structural Funds spending issues have been marked by delay by disputes in relation to matched funding and also in relation to the issue of additionality .
Lest it be raised later in this debate let me make it clear : this is not a new issue and I share the view that it is an issue that needs to be examined very carefully by the Commission itself .
I have the honour to be appointed as the rapporteur on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the Structural Funds guidelines 2000-2006 and the committee agreed on that occasion , based on our recommendations to the Regional Policy Committee , that the Commission should pay attention to this issue of additionality .
We reiterated the importance
