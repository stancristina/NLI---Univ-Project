This is an enabling , liberating directive .
It gives them the assurance that they will be able to create new works and to get fair rewards .
Equally , on the balancing side , consumers expect that their existing rights to be able make private copies , to be able to use library facilities , to be able , if they are disadvantaged , if they are blind or disabled , to have access to new forms of media will be safeguarded .
We have got that balance right .
The other point , colleagues , is that we are not arrogant enough in the Legal Affairs Committee to suggest to you that this is here for all time .
We have proposed and recommend very strongly to you that in 18 months ' time this directive be reviewed .
We must , in a very fast-moving world , take responsibility for our work but be prepared to modify it in accordance with what is going on in an entirely new world .
That is a very important provision .
We have strengthened the review provisions .
We propose a very speedy turnaround , and that shows that the Legal Affairs Committee has taken a very responsible attitude to this directive .
We now want to get it transposed as soon as possible .
Why do we want to get it transposed as soon possible ?
Because a crucial element in this quick transposition is that the European Union will be able to accede to the World Intellectual Property Organisation Treaty and that will bring a very important measure of global protection to all the artists involved .
That is really a prize worth having and worth having as quickly as possible .
Mr President , we need to be clear about what we are trying to achieve in this directive .
This directive , as a piece of intellectual property legislation , must try to incorporate structures to reward the creative industries , which in my own Member State alone contribute GBP 60 billion to our national economy and GBP 8 billion of exports .
They also employ 1.4 million people .
At the same time we must not strangle or restrict freedom of access for legitimate users .
This fits in with the EU action plan and the forthcoming summit in Stockholm .
The fact is that the Internet genie is out of the bottle .
We cannot stop technology , but neither can we allow it to render copyright dead or to let it be abused as a safe haven for piracy , parasites and mass illegal copying .
Yesterday 's Napster ruling clearly showed that copyright has to be applied to cyberspace .
We must not encourage people to infringe copyright .
The composition of the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur has maintained this balance between rightholders and users effectively .
The exceptions which currently exist in Article 5 mean that the generous provisions on exceptions that we have in the UK will continue to help vulnerable users and ensure that schools , libraries and research and education institutions can benefit from private copying .
In the UK we also record programmes so that we are able to watch at the time and place we choose and that , of course , needs to remain intact .
It is however regrettable that some unnecessary , unhelpful amendments have crept in at the last stage in committee .
I refer to : Amendment No 11 , which seeks to give an exemption to broadcasting companies which no one else enjoys and which would reduce performers ' and artists ' rights in contravention of the WIPO Treaty ; and Amendment No 4 which , in the second part , introduces an unnecessary and unwarranted EU restriction of the freedom of national courts to decide how to deal with injunctions , in particular concerning piracy , and amendments on levies .
While this is well-intentioned , we cannot support this approach because it could be interpreted , taken in a vague sense , to mean that levies should always be introduced when you have no technical protection in place .
The UK does not operate a system of levies and we do not want to see it introduced through the back door .
Finally , as with every other piece of legislation on the Internet that comes before us in this House , we should use the provisions of the directive , the review clause in Article 12 and the role of the contact committee to prevent both the abuse of private copying and any abuse or limitation on fair use .
Mr President , I am delighted to see that both the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur accepted that it was unwise to reopen a large number of issues in this area and that much of what was achieved in the common position reflects a balance on this very complicated problem .
I hope that the House will also limit the number of amendments that are adopted and not interfere too greatly with the common position .
It is a directive which I and the British Conservatives welcome because it is vital that European citizens are given proper protection of their creative rights and creative works in the digital era and this directive will deliver that to them .
This is essential because , not only is there an enormous music industry and film industry , we must not forget the highly successful computer games industry which is generating a huge amount of revenue in the United Kingdom and in a number of other countries across the EU.
But the British Conservatives also firmly uphold the rights of those who take advantage of the public interest exceptions .
Groups such as the disabled , including blind people who need access to Braille copies in order to access the Internet , groups such as researchers , universities and
