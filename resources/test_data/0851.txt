modified foods will be able to enter the market is mistaken .
If we consider the fact that methods of analysis , using irradiation or other techniques , are being developed on a monthly or even a daily basis , then it is clear that the number of foodstuffs that are labelled will rise considerably in the coming months and years .
Because the majority of Member States in the Council refused to accept the European Parliament 's views on the scope of the regulation and labelling .
Consumers have a right to clear and unequivocal labelling .
This compromise text constitutes a betrayal of consumer protection !
I personally would not do that .
Mr Bangemann should look at a packet of condoms sometime .
The regulation specifically provides that producers can advertise their products as being normal foods .
I believe that we have secured the key point : whenever a genetically modified organism is present in a food , this must be indicated on the label .
Moreover , it is not a question of who has won or lost in this debate , but of achieving a solution which , on the one hand , meets the legitimate demands of consumers and , on the other , is a viable one - since a solution that delivers nothing is no use to consumers .
And indeed , the text on the table is not the end of the story - and not only with regard to enzymes or other substances not yet covered by the regulation , but especially as regards the implementation of the provisions , which will be far from easy .
The opposite is the truth !
I would ask you , Mrs Roth-Behrendt , to name the corresponding health criteria .
Parliament managed to carry through its demand that the directive should take account of any transfer below ECU 50 000 .
In spite of its undisputed economic and democratic upswing in the 1990s , Latin America has to some extent taken a back place in international politics .
That means that the general socio-economic structures have to be improved .
The framework agreement between the partner countries of the 1993 general agreement on Central American integration forms an important cornerstone of this cooperation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately the limitless skies referred to at times by Pam Cornelissen all too often turn into a real hell .
We should also ensure that the technical equipment is properly compatible .
The main difficulty remains an institutional one and in principle it can therefore be resolved politically , provided we want to do so .
So we are now waiting for the Commissioner to tell us whether the European Commission also approves Mr Castricum 's excellent report .
In that regard the report basically points in the right direction , which could also be set out and defined in an article in the Treaty , although good practice is more important than articles of principle .
I am quite worried that the present texts being discussed in the Council of Ministers differ considerably from those on which Parliament was consulted .
New Zealand and Iceland are good examples here .
Let me draw attention to another positive aspect .
The question immediately arises of expanding forestry resources .
The only genuinely genetically modified foodstuff ready for marketing is still the 'FlavrSavr Tomato ' ( USA ) .
Where should the line be drawn for the requirements of this regulation ?
Meanwhile some banks in border regions have introduced cost-saving methods of transfer .
I believe that this has overcome another hurdle and taken another step closer to the European single market .
If you are , on the one hand , claiming that forest management should respect the multi-functional nature of forests , on the other hand - we refer to the Rio and Helsinki Declarations - it makes no sense to say that the commercial utilization of forests should be a priority for the EU strategy .
After it was presented in the Committee on Agriculture some 200 to 220 amendments were tabled .
In the light of the study by the group on stimulating competitiveness in Europe the Commission is urging a speedy adoption of the statutes , preferably in 1997 .
We must not transfer a specific codetermination model from a few Member States to the other countries of the Community , in other words no export of the mainly German model .
May I briefly summarize the position of the Committee on Social Affairs : firstly , both sides of industry should play an appropriate role in establishing the rules on co-determination ; secondly , employee participation in the European company must be more than information and consultation rights of the European works councils , under no condition should there be a European company without employee economic participation .
We should ensure that we really make further progress along the lines of democratising the economy .
I believe we should discuss our ideas on a future European directive and European company statute in detail and without pressure of time .
Here I agree with Mr Menrad .
The Commission 's expert group which is charged with preparing recommendations for co-determination models by April must not be allowed to remain solely a platform for debate but should also give the necessary impetus for action .
Parliament now has formally to adopt an opinion on two questions .
Instead the Council said that information may only be passed on between administrative authorities once individual authorization has been granted by the judicial authorities .
Thank you Mr President , for calling me again .
Access to the Transeuropean networks and other international trade flows is the only way to open the door to close cooperation with Europe .
In my view it makes a real contribution to finding a European Union strategy for its relations with the Transcaucasian republics
