It is essential that the downward trend in rail transport’s market share be reversed , and we must be resolute in our efforts to achieve this , by building an open , competition-based market .
The mutual recognition of train drivers ’ training is essential if we are to promote the free movement of workers , given that by establishing common standards we will facilitate the situation and help towards making these workers more employable .
In our view , the crux of the proposal lies in the implementation of this framework of passengers ’ rights and obligations at both national and international level .
As Lech Walesa has said in recent interviews , heroic though that movement was – and indeed it was – we could not have imagined that 25 years later we would be sitting here alongside MEPs from eight – or rather ten since yesterday – of the countries that had been dominated by the Soviet Empire .
The report should also be looking into the need for new policy to combat , rather than encourage , these disparities , which entails promoting public services , developing production apparatus , guaranteeing basic infrastructure ( transport , communications and energy ) , ensuring that there is a large network of small and medium-sized holdings and establishing a support strategy for small and medium-sized urban centres in interior , rural and outlying regions .
In order to set out appropriately the EU’s action in this area , and the level of intervention in each region , the report calls for the creation of new territorial criteria and indicators , alongside GDP , for measuring development in a particular region and for assessing the obstacles hindering that development , namely specific territorial constraints , a remoteness and accessibility index , infrastructure and transport provision , the amount of research , innovation , education and training and the level of diversification of productivity in the area .     .
Albeit from differing perspectives and with varying approaches , we have joined forces to support the strategy proposed by the Commission for the sustainable development of the outermost regions .
We also believe that in order to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks in the EEZs concerned and to preserve fishing activities in the outermost regions , it is essential that exclusive competence regarding access to the waters of the outermost regions be equivalent to access to its EEZ , in compliance with the national jurisdiction in question .
For these reasons , I voted in favour of this report .     – The recent developments in oil prices has brought the problem of high oil prices to the top of the agenda , in light of the severe problems that this rise has caused in terms of economic growth and employment , and this at a time when the EU economy is virtually grinding to a halt .
We must prepare for the future by investing in research to find ways of reducing oil consumption in terms of GDP.
What we are actually left with is a glass full of words and a hand full of nothing .
The New Orleans tragedy and the New York failure share a common thread – the North American administration .
Let us be clear , however .
With specific regard to the reform of the United Nations , I told the delegates that Parliament stands four-square behind the positions adopted by the UN Secretary-General , such as his view that world security is intrinsically linked to economic and social development , respect for human rights and environmental protection .
Furthermore , the practice of reviewing in September an agreement to which it had signed up under oath three months earlier does the Commission no credit on the international stage and severely weakens it in future negotiations .
What exactly is the state of play with regard to these measures and to what extent does their implementation depend on the financial perspective ?
What we heard , however , was more of the same , and attempts at defending the indefensible .
In September , the Commission , pandering to the wishes of the large multinationals , this time acted quickly , and forced the admission of millions of textile and clothing items , going back on what it had itself agreed .
I wish briefly to point out that there is no paragraph calling for urgent measures to support sectors that are being seriously damaged by the rise in fuel prices .
Urgent action is therefore required , in addition to other long-term measures .     .
The EU is rooted in the same moral foundation as the United Nations , in terms of the values of peace , solidarity among peoples , democracy and the rule of law .
It also glosses over imperialism’s aggression and interference , which , where possible , is conducted multilaterally .
It states that , although some progress has been made , the policies and measures in place will not be sufficient to meet the targets set for the use of energy from renewable sources .
Nevertheless , road accidents remain the biggest killer among the under-50s .
Lastly , road infrastructure should be improved and adapted to current traffic levels .     – Commissioner , as well as listening intently to your speech here , I carefully read the communication that I believe the Commission adopted this morning , and I should like to begin by congratulating you .
This is a problem for the entire Union and undermines our credibility on the issue of human rights .
There are impending test cases such as those of Hissène Habré , Charles Taylor and the perpetrators of Darfur .
This is the same despair and anger that fans the flames of international terrorism , whose recruits manage to find a way
