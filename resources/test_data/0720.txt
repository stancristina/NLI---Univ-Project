They want a new regime .
It is not our intention , here , to adopt a stance towards Baroness Nicholson 's statement or her analysis , but towards the resolution itself .
This is the first time , as far as I can remember , that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has been able to conduct a debate at a time that might be called in any way normal .
The wind of change clearly died down when it reached the Commission , however .
I do not know what kind of impediment it is that prevents the Commission from achieving proper communication and having proper discussions with Parliament on the subject of sustainable development .
Ten years after Rio and five years after our having made a pledge concerning sustainability strategies in all the UN countries , we can of course see what has happened .
Children , who are the most vulnerable , are being allowed to die because of the pattern of life we now have .
There are cities , countries , municipalities and regions that have done an incredible amount to change the situation .
Nevertheless , the overall result is disheartening and . something must be done .
Political priorities need to be set .
The opposite ought , of course , to be the case .
In the light of this , the Johannesburg Summit is very important , but , as has been indicated in this House , hopes are fairly low-key .
There are two main reasons .
The EU must push ahead in this respect , as on a range of issues concerning the fight against poverty .
There are more than 20 000 different disciplines in our universities , and specialisation is , of course , good for solving a variety of individual problems .
In particular , we must help the poor , or developing , countries to develop research skills so that they are themselves able to develop strategies that are both more profitable financially speaking and more sustainable in environmental terms .
I want to thank both rapporteurs for the sterling work they have done .
There ought , however , to have been more respect for democratic debate and for the opportunity for civil society to take part in the debate .
The Barcelona Summit , in which the EU 's position was to be firmly set out , was also a disappointment .
In Johannesburg , the EU must show clearly how it intends to reform , for example , its agricultural and fisheries policies , which have major global consequences , especially for the poor countries .
I think the EU countries have a specifically moral and economic responsibility for showing the way to sustainability .
The situation should not , as at present , be the other way round .
Significant parts of the report confirm and clarify the current situation , but the report also includes other important features , such as a demand for open coordination necessarily to be accompanied by parliamentary control .
We do not believe that the funding of the EU 's budget , its foreign and defence policies and the whole of the third pillar should be made competences of the EU.
Paragraph 30 of the draft report states 'that the exercise by the Union of its competences , whether exclusive , shared , additional or coordinating powers , must no longer be thwarted by paralysing ( no power of initiative , unanimous decision-making , ratification by the Member States ) ? procedures ' .
That would entail the centralisation of labour market policy in the long run and a shift towards unilateral economic policy .
This process should therefore be strengthened and not , as proposed in the report , dismantled so that it disappears from Community policy .
I support intergovernmental cooperation , but not the supranationalism advocated by the rapporteur .
Nor can I accept compulsory coordination of budget and finance policy .
The terrorist group Laskar Jihad - for it is nothing less than a terrorist group - is digging the grave of anything that might be called religious life .
The group is a grave-digger for Islam and has shown that it does not stand for anything other than hatred , violence and the undisguised killing of the Christian population in the Moluccas .
Vigorous action should be taken to ensure that the Indonesian Government gives the Christian population every form of lawful protection .
Of the Moluccas ' 10 million inhabitants , 350 000 are refugees .
Mr Nielson , let the EU do everything it can to ensure that Indonesia becomes a region of peace .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the effort to improve relations between the EU and Latin America .
The attitude to international conventions such as the Kyoto Protocol and to the International War Crimes Tribunal is considerably more constructive in Latin America than in North America .
The EU must open its markets to Latin America , especially when it comes to agriculture .
A significantly stronger commitment is required in this area than is currently the case .
The referendum project , the Varela project , is worthy of all our support .
We have to realise that improved communications , both physical and electronic , are making us increasingly dependent on the world around us .
This is emphasised by the fact that the countries of central Eastern Europe will soon be included in the EU.
An enlarged EU will in fact be the largest player on the global food market .
This would also create an opportunity for the developing countries to demonstrate , through their growth , that they are a purchasing force on the global market due to their having an enormous need for food .
Mr President , it is very sad .
There is a great risk
