have , not necessarily worse , but certainly different and with a different basis .
Finally , is it intended that the EU regulations should replace national regulations on weapons exports to other countries , or will the national regulations even be taken over ?
Whatever we say , it is still the case that the question of the existence of duty-free sales has extremely little to do with economic benefits .
I would like to ask Mr Henderson the following : Is it really worth it for the sake of this small gain to see so many people made unemployed , and to anger a large proportion of the Union 's population ?
Should it be paid in the country which has the highest duty or in the country which has the lowest duty ?
Or could people even buy goods in a third country in the EU and pay the duty in the country which has the lowest duty ?
He said that as an ex-seaman he was concerned about the consequences of abolishing dutyfree sales .
North of the Stockholm area - you could say that Stockholm is in southern Sweden - there is only one scheduled ferry link .
In addition , old historic ties between these areas would be broken .
This is really funny .
There should not be tax advantages for certain sectors .
Our colleague , Mr Sjöstedt , mentioned one of the most threatened ferry lines and spoke of the beautiful city of Umeå .
In addition , I would like to ask the President-in-Office what attitude the Presidency has towards contributing to an extension if other countries raise this issue in Ecofin ?
Mr President , the liberalization of the aviation industry has been taking place for decades .
Clearly , if that is what we want to bring about through liberalization , we can say we have succeeded .
In practice , this continues to disable competition in the air transport market .
Together this will enable the development which will allow us to satisfy passengers ' demands by the year 2000 .
Swedish domestic air services have been open to competition for a number of years , and this initially led to much price competition .
Unfortunately , this is all happening in a country which is highly dependent on domestic air transport since there are often no alternatives .
I have made particular reference to the Irish airline Ryanair , which has distinguished itself through its anti-union policies .
We must show that we do not accept anti-union attitudes or social dumping as a means of competition .
Mr President , let me begin by thanking Mr Grosch , on behalf of the PPE group , for a thorough piece of work .
We know today that safety rules vary greatly from one EU country to another .
In this context , one of our biggest and most important tasks is to help ensure that safety requirements are increased and not reduced .
This could happen in various ways , such as through a licence of this kind .
Basically it is a question of adding zeros and ones .
However , this relates to the old methods in the same way that computers relate to the old adding machines .
Modern biotechnology makes it possible to manipulate nature in ways people could not do in the past .
In these new areas we must move with great caution .
Madam President , I am pleased to see that you , Madam President , are a true friend of Finnish jewellery .
Central banks will no longer regulate the money supply .
It is a minor modernization of a ten-year-old recommendation which actually has minimum requirements for terms of agreements and legislation in the Member States .
If recommendations which are supposed to increase consumer confidence are unclear , that is worrying .
Something which I also consider to be important , and which we stress in the report , is that all customers should have access to the terms applicable to the means of payment they are going to use .
We should also be aware that when new means of payment are introduced , a long time may elapse before consumers become aware of the new problems which can arise .
I must also say that a few weeks ago we had an unfortunate example of what happens when there is a lack of clarity about means of payment .
During 1998 the Commission shall monitor what happens .
Obviously it is Parliament 's business to protest against what is happening in Iran , and not only there , but also in Algeria and other places .
Mr President , after many years of negotiations and strong opposition both from nuclear powers and threshold states , it was finally decided to have a comprehensive ban on all nuclear weapons testing .
In September 1996 the treaty was opened for signature and all the countries of the EU have signed up to this treaty .
Many citizens were not convinced of the goodwill of the nuclear powers and warned that development of new nuclear weapons could take place through laboratory testing .
The argument that these tests have to be carried out in order to be sure about the safety and reliability of existing nuclear weapons stocks fails on its own absurdity .
Even if , contrary to expectations , they did not contravene the letter of the test ban treaty , it is clear that they contravene the spirit of the treaty .
It might perhaps be appropriate to explain to Günther that the reason for our criticism is precisely that it has not been possible to check that these tests really are subcritical .
The Americans still have nuclear weapons .
Mr President , I wonder how long we are going to continue to speak in appreciative terms about the SLIM programme .
