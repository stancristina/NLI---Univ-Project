the present policy is bold or supportive enough , particularly as regards the reforestation of the southern regions , which are threatened with increasing desertification .
The recurrence of fire hotspots was detected on 19 January with prevailing fires occurring mostly in the northern areas of East Kalimantan where rain has not fallen since December 1997 .
Also , and in a more long-term perspective , the Commission and Member States in Jakarta set up in 1997 a joint European Union Fire Response Group ( EUFREG ) composed of forest fire experts from various Commission and Member State projects in Indonesia .
In the short term , the European Community Humanitarian Office - ECHO - envisages channelling funds towards the communities affected by the forest fires , namely indigenous communities .
One known as PRODESQ concerns fire monitoring and afforestation control and the second one , known as ECOFORCA , aims at developing and applying low-cost monitoring technologies for the detection of fire in forest areas .
Finally , I wish to say that , even if we do not have budget lines specifically for disasters , the Commission takes the resolutions seriously .
The Gas√≤liba report adopts the stance that has virtually become dogma , namely that the euro and the Stability Pact are essential tools for growth and job creation , and that the obstacles preventing these tools from doing their work are non-labour costs , lack of adaptability on the part of workers , and over-regulation .
We also want to draw attention to our amendments : a tax on speculative capital profits , a reduction in working hours without loss of pay and an evaluation of how the development of EMU will affect unemployment .
Furthermore , it would have been sufficient to give it that status , and allow it to be debated as such , if some of the recommendations expressed by our social partners in their reports had been approved .
Finally , this regulation formula is intended to tell you that we in Parliament are drawing up a report based on the Commission 's document .
Since the agreements were signed at the end of the Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organization was created , not one positive decision has been taken , even though this House and other legislative assemblies only agreed to ratify the Marrakesh Agreements because those agreements envisaged a package that included environmental matters .
Secondly , the Panels themselves have acknowledged their limitations and requested guidelines from the policy-makers of the World Trade Organization , and no such guidelines have been forthcoming .
For example , the international conventions for the protection of the environment , such as CITES , the Washington Convention , which seeks protection for endangered species , has been torpedoed by a recent decision of the GATT Panel .
We have questions concerning the labelling of products , such as timber products from forests that are not under sustainable forms of cultivation , but the WTO does not allow us to distinguish between timber produced by destroying virgin forests and timber from sustainable plantations .
Secondly , we need to have a clear position from the Commission about the idea of a special procedure before the Panel convenes in the case of a conflict between environment and trade in the WTO .
Mr President , I apologise for having gone on so long .
Turning to the Commissioner , I would firstly like to thank him for being here , and tell him that I know him well and know from his background and his lifestyle that he is sincere when he speaks on environmental matters and participation in civil society .
It should be a ministerial initiative , because it is not the Director-Generals who answer to their national parliaments on policy and receive policy directions , however well qualified they may be technically ; it is the ministers .
In 2002 this programme must stop being an extended intergovernmental pilot scheme and unreservedly become a Community initiative for which Governments , the Commission and Parliament share responsibility .
Since the event was first instituted in 1985 , the European City of Culture has taken various forms , and in the last few years has shown a maturity which has been apparent not only in the consistency and innovation of most of the programmes suggested by the cities , but especially in the extent to which those cities have in some cases been transformed .
It must be selected by an independent consultative Selection Panel , and must finally be approved by the three European institutions .
For many people , including ourselves , this report represents the latest political position to be taken by the European Parliament on the basis of the single currency before it is formally adopted .
Being realistic , we do not agree .
If , on the other hand , we were to vote against this report , we would be casting doubt on the rules of democracy , and failing to recognize the efforts of so many people , particularly the Member States concerned .
I congratulate the Group of the Party of European Socialists on having succeeded in obtaining the removal from the report of the call for the immediate implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact , since this could have been interpreted by European citizens as a sign of a negative attitude to the euro .
This has been the desire of most Portuguese citizens , and strengthens the ties which have bound us to the European Union for twelve years now .
We are now living out the first day of the ancient dream of a united Europe .
We have taken a decision that will make a decisive contribution to progress and bring people and nations closer together .
There is no doubt that it has categorically refuted the negative allegations of its many detractors .
