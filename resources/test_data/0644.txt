A joint European socio-economic policy , in which the Union provides a broad outline of the necessary reforms .
Convergence also enables the various Member States gradually to develop in line with each other and the Union to become competitive again faced with other growth regions in the world , the main difference being that cut-throat internal competition is prevented and that the Union is not forced to give up its social approach .
If anyone had doubts about the need for , at the very least , a form of economic governance in a monetary union , they need only imagine the United States with one currency , the dollar , and one central bank , the Federal Reserve , but with a different socio-economic policy for each of its 50 states .
What might strengthening the eurozone entail in terms of creating the social and economic governance that is so lacking in the Union ?
With regard to this last point , we must acknowledge the fact that only a European defence can move us closer to a common foreign policy of that kind .
The disadvantage of these coalitions is that they disintegrate easily following each change of government .
The question remains : what does all this have to do with the Constitution and the draft Constitution ?
It is highly doubtful that ratification in two or three years ’ time will have a greater chance of success than today .
We could also take a ‘roll-back ’ approach , where we interpret the outcome of the referendums as a sign that the citizenry actually want less Europe , meaning that we should reduce Europe back to nothing more than a free-trade zone .
Moreover , in my view those who in recent months have put ratification on the back burner are duty-bound to start or resume the ratification procedure – and I will tell you why .
It would be good if a second track were opened alongside the ratification track .
In fact , they knew perfectly well what they had to do .
Today , the majority of the French and Dutch citizens voted against the constitution , and today we must not let ourselves be thrown off balance .
In fact , we had another glowing example of this only a few minutes ago .
As it happens , the opposite is true .
Above all , I believe that the history of Europe moves in a certain direction , and that is something that we must never forget .
That is something that we cannot accept .
I try to give exactly the same message to both the Council and Parliament .
That is not how things work .
There is the Constitution , which we shall perhaps have to renegotiate to achieve unanimity .
Indeed , only as one Europe can we be a real global actor that defends our interests and values in this global world of tomorrow .
It is highly likely that the Council will extend the period of reflection , and to it and to the Commission , I would like to say that the period of reflection is too long .
I would first of all like to mention the schizophrenia among Heads of Government , Heads of State and ministers who meet to take joint decisions on average once a month , in the case of ministers , and four times a year in the case of Heads of State or Government , without whose permission nothing can be done in Europe .
I agree with you that the period of reflection is likely to prove fruitless .
We acted like , and that is something for which we will pay the price in time to come .     .
What will we do about this now ?
Finally , it is very easy to focus on Guantanamo Bay , which is a well-organised location with a limited number of prisoners , but people lacking any rights is , of course , also a common phenomenon in the rest of the world , because prisoners are increasingly being transported , also to other parts of Europe – as someone mentioned a moment ago – and I hope that the governments are prepared to consider what their own part , albeit passive , has been in this .     .
I should like to ask your support for paragraph 11 from the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , which has been tabled as Amendment 34 .     .
My question is only whether the USA is prepared to recognise the European Union to such an extent that it is prepared to enter into such a contractual relationship .
I think that we could , by combining transatlantic forces , persuade China to be a real stakeholder in the international system .     Mr President , although the draft resolution points out – and with good reason – the need for a stable institutional framework for transatlantic relations , I do believe that this debate should not just be about structures .
Children take medicinal products ; lots of them , relatively speaking .
Blockbusters command even higher amounts .
It is , of course , also possible that the profits are a little lower in the case of medicinal products for rare diseases .
Since estimates show that 50 to 90 % of the medicinal products that are currently being used in paediatrics are never specifically studied or approved for use in that age category , the negative and positive effects of their application are virtually unknown .
Mutual notification of disbarments from employment also means that the Member States will enforce a ban when that has been issued in a different Member State .
Would it not be better , therefore , if official Europe were to send out a different message
