Any policy which helps wipe out all forms of discrimination is needed .
Moreover , learning and speaking other languages , in addition to our mother tongue , encourages us to be more open towards others , to their cultural values and to their opinions .
It should therefore be our objective to shape a society in which the percentage of multilingual citizens , as a factor for unifying society as a whole , increases steadily .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the own initiative report by Mr Portas on integrating immigrants in Europe through schools and multilingual education touches on an issue of capital importance , which concerns all the Member States equally .
The multilingualism safeguarded by the Union as a means of dialogue between cultures thus takes on a new integration dimension .
In Greece , for example , the permanent foreign population accounts for 10 % of the total population .
All this reality transfers to schools , which act as the mirror of a society .
Until very recently , our education systems functioned on the basis of an assimilating approach , under which the presence in school of immigrant children with a different linguistic and cultural expression from the official language and culture was approached as a problem which had to be sidelined .
The redistribution and proper deployment of manpower in quality jobs is a strategic tactic in achieving the objectives for 2010 .
Congratulations , therefore , to the Committee on Culture and Education and to Mr Portas on this own initiative report .
Thirdly , the coordinated offer and controlled use by the Member States of the numerous programmes which you referred to and of funding mechanisms , under the supervision of the Commission .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur , Mr Beaupuy , for addressing such an important issue to the development objectives of the European Union and the daily lives of its citizens , given that the majority of citizens live in urban and suburban areas .
Within this network of policies , the gender dimension must be taken into serious account .
The same gender mainstreaming , in other words the participation of women , must also be a criterion for evaluating our policies .
Therefore , with reference to the report by Mr Beaupuy , I should like to comment on five points which I consider important .
The effort , therefore , to address and find a viable solution to the problems which are the scourge of towns and cities must be a joint effort in all 25 Member States of the Union .
The fact that over 80 % of economic activity is exercised in towns and cities makes local authorities pillars of regional development .
This message is particularly important not only because it will increase the competencies of the committee in question , but also because it will send a message to the citizens that we are concerned , we are listening , we are paying attention to the problems of their daily life and we are trying to find viable solutions .
This European Parliament has always shown an interest in the problems of towns and cities , both small and large , and in 1999 , I would remind you , the Community URBAN initiative was maintained at the insistence of the European Parliament .
At the same time , we shall try in these negotiations to highlight the urban dimension even more , by emphasising the call for it to include a list of towns and cities which will be covered by the Structural Fund programmes for all the Member States for the period from 2007 to 2013 , in order to make action by Member States on towns and cities more specific .
On the one hand , they are levers for development in an ever-increasingly competitive global economy , concentrating wealth , knowledge and know-how .
The connection between regional development and urban development is clear and cannot be ignored in the efforts which we are making to achieve economic , social and territorial cohesion .
Our towns and cities are not isolated .
Policy on towns and cities needs to be at the epicentre of efforts to achieve a strong , competitive and viable Europe , while maintaining social cohesion .
It is a basic tool for the privatisation and commercialisation of education and research and aims to create two-speed institutions , with centres of 'excellent ' and second-class institutions .
The balanced development of scientific sectors and the response of universities to their social role are a matter for the university community , in cooperation with the grass-roots movement , not the subject of revision and control mechanisms with private-sector economic criteria .
They cite nuclear risks but keep quiet about the existence of nuclear weapons in and the threat to use them by the USA and other imperialist powers .
The nuclear problem in Iran cannot be addressed selectively ; it must be addressed under a more general nuclear disarmament policy .
The peoples in the area as a whole need to be mobilised against American and Euro-unifying imperialism .     – Mr President , one of Europe 's leading journalists wrote a few days ago that we are opening the gates to barbarity .
Today , however , I shall speak of a different type of violence ; the violence against Archbishop Okhrid , the Archbishop of FYROM.
FYROM , or whatever else it wants to call itself , cannot ask to enter here , in the European family , while its Archbishop is in prison .
At the same time , innovation and novelty are not orientated towards promoting technology and the quality of life .
This will create a vicious circle for young
