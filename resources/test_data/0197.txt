were adopted for inclusion in association agreements or cooperation agreements concluded by the EU.
This is the reason why the Commission , whilst accepting some slight improvements in the immigration policy , is attempting to achieve its objectives by concluding a more wide-ranging agreement which also includes a readmission clause .
I agree with the rapporteur when he says the unprecedented acceptance by the Chinese authorities of a readmission clause is to be welcomed and could open the way to the conclusion of a genuine readmission agreement with China .     As I said in relation to Mrs  Frahm 's recent reports on membership of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and on the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution , I support any measures that effectively and actively help to raise environmental quality standards .
The central issue in the report is the inclusion of a revision clause for a general review of the system , with a view to introducing European taxes to replace the present system of national contributions , before the approval of the Financial Perspectives .
Furthermore , the Commission itself has proposed simplifying the financing structure so as to create a system based more on GNP contributions , and has at the same time recommended the gradual elimination of correction mechanisms .
Action at Community level , the positive effects of which include solutions such as the open method of coordination , the sharing of best practice and the adoption of common quality standards , should , as the rapporteur says , focus on , if not actually be restricted to , those issues for which there is a legal mechanism attributing competence to Europe , or those issues where action at Community level is genuinely effective .
This makes it essential for the next Spring Summit to emphasise the need to enhance coordination of the economic , employment and social policies of the European Union and of the Member States , and to carry out structural reforms following a clear route map with specific deadlines .
A policy should be implemented to boost economic growth and to support short- and medium-term demand , through a commitment to promoting output and jobs with a view to fostering economic growth , employment and social cohesion , and based on a sustained increase in public investment at national and Community level , especially in basic infrastructure , in professional skills and training , in research and innovation , in the environment and in support for small - and medium-sized enterprises .     I regret that my proposal to call on ‘the Commission and Council immediately to make the necessary adjustments to the economic and monetary policy guidelines with a view to replacing the Stability Pact with a Social Progress and Employment Pact in line with the objectives of full employment , sustained economic development , and economic and social cohesion ’ has not been taken on board .
Furthermore , the appreciation of the euro against the dollar is also a brake on Europe 's competitiveness .
First and foremost , it is only possible to discern the limits of budgetary restrictions once we look at how they operate and can be improved , and , almost importantly , how to deal with both existing and new requirements .
In this area of participation , however , it is important for certain factors that impact on participation to be taken into account , such as equality of access to education ; participation in school life over and above curriculum requirements ; freedom and autonomy of association for students ; the right to work and to employment with full rights and trade union freedoms ; and an appeal to young people to become involved in various social and political areas in connection with diverse local , regional and national circumstances .     The report emphasises certain aspects that must be taken into consideration , in particular the need for those Member States whose GDP is lower than the EU average to focus more on their educational budgets and to insist on the need for pupils to learn two languages .
Nevertheless , I would like to sound a warning note about educational rootlessness and Eurocentrism , which ignore national cultures and their presence outside the European area .
Are these adequate reasons for us to weaken our commitment towards our strategic relations with Russia ?
Without lessening its criticism and its vigilance , it is up to the European Union to encourage the creation of a framework based on trust and the strengthening of links with this important partner .
The possibility of these countries joining the European Union at some point in the future , which is mentioned by the rapporteur , gives me some cause for concern .     I voted for the proposal for a recommendation as I believe that the European Union should pay particular attention to the Caucasus region , which since the fall of the Soviet empire has been embroiled in a worrying situation marked by its inability to deal with the numerous problems it faces .
Today , we must remember the suffering of women who are victims of war , in Iraq , in Palestine , and in so many other countries .
Since the issue became a matter of public knowledge in January , the interest of the Portuguese public has grown , as has the interest in Spain , because some Spanish missionaries have been threatened .
I would ask you to write to the President of the Republic of Mozambique and to the President of that country ’s National Assembly to express the concern of Members of the European Parliament at a truly appalling situation .     .
In the 1990s , this area received a substantial boost and a great deal of Community legislation was implemented in this field
