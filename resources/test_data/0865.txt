As there is clear evidence in this case and grounds for suspecting the Commission of maladministration , an independent body should be set up to look into and report on everything the Commission is suspected of .
Today I voted to express confidence in the Commission , because my judgement was that the Commission 's departure now would do more harm than good to the Union .
My decision was guided by the fact that the final negotiations on the budget , structural policy and agricultural policy should be able to be completed as soon as possible .
The issue now is one of recognising responsibility and not of demonstrating power , which has wrongly become an issue for many Members of the European Parliament .
That is another reason why I have given my support to the ideas in the resolution from the Liberal Group .
The fact that mistakes have been uncovered is largely due to increased efforts to bring about a sound and healthy administration .
Mr President , it is understandable that many states in the Schengen zone have been undecided about accepting the institution of a passport-free area in its entirety .
There has been alarm over such issues as the easy transportation of drugs within the internal market , and spillage over the EU 's external borders , which we have had some grim reminders of , especially in signs of organised crime emanating from the east .
When the Treaty of Amsterdam takes effect it will bring with it important changes to the judicial status of the Schengen provisions , bringing them largely within the scope of the first pillar .
Because there will be no checks at borders within the zone , the so-called system of invisible surveillance must be effective enough to ensure that the enormous benefit of freedom of movement is not abused by criminal organisations and tax evaders .
This must be borne in mind when this issue is next discussed at the summit in Tampere .
I am most concerned that force has been used against peaceful demonstrators and that no progress has been made in freeing political prisoners .
I wish in particular to speak about East Timor .
There is also reliable information that military power has been increased to a greater extent than official sources would have us believe .
The aim must be to cautiously set the scene for a national referendum on the future of East Timor .
It would not need to be a fully-fledged diplomatic mission if the matter were deemed too delicate .

Physical and spiritual development is possible only in circumstances where there is general protection under the law and equality of social rights .
It has already done much to further this cause , and will continue to do so .
The birth and growth of political parties have to be encouraged .
Corruption and the custom of favouring relatives are fairly common and , worst of all , widely accepted and tolerated .
In such circumstances it is difficult to use European Union funds wisely , because that can also easily lead to abuse .
When it was preparing last year 's budget Parliament decided that an interinstitutional working party , including a representative from the European Parliament , should be set up to decide on funds - how to spend them and follow them up - to promote democracy , respect for human rights , and the furtherance of the rule of law .
However , we in Europe are in a situation where there is natural demand .
They have obsolete industrial plants which are a serious risk to the environment , and outdated nuclear power plants which are also a risk to health and safety .
Nuclear safety must improve in these countries to comply with international regulations , and defective nuclear power stations must be taken out of use .
But what should replace them ?
What it will mean for the present Member States is that we will be able to export the know-how .
When , for example , the international funding institutions of the European Union support energy programmes in the applicant countries , special attention must be paid to making sure the money is spent on the best possible technology as well as renewable energy sources , in order to improve our chances of acting in accordance with international climate agreements .
This problem will diminish if new jobs are created from the production of energy .
Renewable energy technology and its markets are a global issue , requiring EU resources for development .
I would also like to emphasise the importance of something close to us in the Nordic countries , which people are not always sufficiently aware of in more southern parts of Europe , which is that the most important aspect of renewable energy is the biomass that comes from the natural forest , such as branches , crowns and small-diameter trees in a thinned-out forest .
It has also been adopted on a very large scale , as , according to the latest statistics , bio-fuels are the largest source of energy in Finland .
Some of the know-how already exists , as do more efficient boilers .
The common policy of the European Union calls for a particular focus on the most important issues , having , as we do , limited resources at our disposal .
For that reason , the European Union must , as a priority , strive to support commercial exports , through marketing subsidies and investment aid , for example , in the less developed regions of the European Union .
During the first stage , however , we will still need financial incentives .
That means that by the year 2020 the world 's energy production figure will have increased by 50 % .
Democracy of energy consumption demands new thinking and new technology .
It requires us to make room in our developed capitalist countries
