centres and European firms and must be allowed to develop .
Donation must be anonymous as regards both the donor and the recipient ( except for the requirements regarding traceability ) .
I shall mention just a few points this evening - four , in particular .
I would therefore call upon the rapporteur , Mr Liese , should Amendments Nos 7 and 19 be adopted , to introduce more flexibility at second reading to avoid unwieldy administrative procedures slowing down research in Europe in key fields such as pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics , for example , whose objective is to develop new drugs which are much more effective and have no toxic action .
Let us rather find political , pragmatic , practical solutions to the issues raised by the directive , which , through the directive , the Commission is attempting to resolve .
We still have to analyse and express a position on a number of points .
That said , I would like to focus briefly on the fact that the regulation in question certainly does not cover all the questions related to detergents , and I am not criticising the Commission 's work here but pointing out two further characteristic aspects of both this and previous provisions on detergents .
Lastly , I believe that it would be appropriate to provide for a single labelling system for these kinds of products in daily use , for that would allow the consumer to recognise and the producer to promote products which are less harmful to the environment .
I do not agree with some of the objections raised in the House , including those raised by a Member from the Green Group , which , as usual , whenever it is not the instigator of proposals , sees only the negative points - a half-empty glass , so to speak - and not the positive points .
Mr President , a great deal has already been said .
The regime is on its way out , and the large number of detentions is a sign that Fidel Castro has lost control of the situation .
This is the acid test : we have to decide whether these debates are destined never to have any effect outside our archives or whether we want , once and for all , to take that leap forwards and make a clear , definitive political decision .
I mean an approach that is a little oversimplistic , which does not , indeed , take into account the two fundamental factors already mentioned .
The Space Agency is an asset which we must not waste , and it is no coincidence that it is cited , not least in the recent action plan to increase research , as one of the major technological platforms to be considered if we are to respond to the need to make the European economy competitive .
Quite frankly , I am amazed that the Council should invoke Rule 112 for a matter of this nature , which we would have been able to address in a few week 's time anyway without it making any difference to the measure , which , as you are aware , has already been in force since 1 January .
If I am not mistaken , the farming world welcomed the proposal for a directive on environmental liability , particularly because the Commission had opted for a horizontal approach .
Extending the directive 's scope beyond that of the Commission 's original proposal would , as I see it , be likely to jeopardise the certainty of the legal framework proposed and the resulting insurance guarantees , thus making it difficult to enforce a principle useful to European society in general .
To this end , we in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy have endeavoured to achieve the removal of some of the dangerous exemptions which allow wide-ranging , general means of protection and which , in actual fact , turn the environmental authorisations into a sort of licence to pollute , with the serious danger that the effectiveness of the proposed legislative system will be nullified .
Mr President , a legislative framework on environmental liability is necessary because it is right that the polluter should pay .
The definition of GMO soil contamination is inappropriate in that it is part of a general definition which does not list all the sources of contamination .
In fact , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not made any fundamental changes to the Commission 's approach , but it has clarified a number of essential principles .
We all must be socially responsible about protecting the environment because it is inherently a finite resource .
The object is to maintain the legal certainty of law on the territory of the Union by means of greater involvement and dynamism on the part of economic and social operators .
Firstly , I tried to make the concept of voluntary agreements as instruments for integrating Community legislation more explicit .
All things considered , the distinction between coregulation and self-regulation is appreciated here .
I must point out that the proposals advanced to the Commission by the UEN Group on that occasion have almost all been adopted by some of the Member States , including Italy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 7 May , a Commissioner who is not present in the House today - and I regret that because , for once , I would have liked to congratulate a Commissioner - said : as regards the prevention of animal epidemics we have developed a cutting-edge system , creating a Committee of Veterinary Experts which lays down the law for every Member State , whereas , when it comes to human health , we have no say on the matter .
