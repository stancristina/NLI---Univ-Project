will automatically bring about changes to the agreement .
Fourthly , if the USA infringes the agreement , the only solution open to the European Union is to abolish it completely .
This is not an international agreement ; at least not as the citizens understand the term .
Capitalist restructurings in the public health sector come under the general anti-working class policy of the Î•U , the deteriorating terms of insurance and the increased retirement age of the workers .
Under the proposal for a directive : The private sector - in other words monopoly companies - acquire jurisdiction in issues of national security which were previously the responsibility of the government alone .
Mr President , Commissioner Mandelson is not only an inspired orator , he is also a tireless negotiator .
There are high import barriers , which result - according to estimates - in lost profits of EUR 20 billion a year to European businesses .
Dialogue would appear to be the way forward .
As far as footwear of Chinese origin is concerned , the Commission is called on to monitor imports closely , in order to prevent the risk of China 's circumventing the already inadequate trade defence measures adopted by the Union .
Madam President , I thank my honourable friends for their cooperation , which allowed us to formulate the joint motion for a resolution .
As you know , the Union has played a decisive role in achieving the agreement under discussion within the framework of the WTO .
Doubts as to the efficacy of the mechanism provided for in the Protocol to the TRIPS agreement are reasonable .
At the same time , the transfer of know-how and technology and research in developing countries must be encouraged .
I should also like to emphasise the importance of safeguards against the diversion of trade .
( Applause ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , at the heart of the EU 's foreign policy on air transport lies the establishment of an open aviation area between the European Union and the United States of America .
The strong pressure and threats experienced by staff at Alitalia , Olympic Airlines and other aviation companies in the Member States are typical of what is now happening .
This is far from meeting the needs of the people ; it will contribute to the increased rate of concentration through buy-outs and mergers of aviation companies .
Madam President , I welcome the Commission 's initiative on the cross-border regulation of the attachment and temporary freezing of bank accounts .
The measure is a move in the right direction ; it must be completed soon with the submission of a relevant proposal .
The Lechner report and the opinions of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Finance set out the basic parameters for preparing a balanced proposal for a Council decision on the issue .
It emphasises the need to meet the requirements for issuing a cross-border attachment order for bank accounts .
I call on the Commission to proceed at once with preparation of the proposal on this issue .
Their diet is anything but healthy .
Commissioner , children are not eating more , but they are less active and get less exercise .
A sedentary life and obesity often cause high blood pressure and diabetes , which affect a steadily increasing proportion of the EU 's population .
Member States must also lay down a minimum requirement for the number of physical education lessons in schools .
As a result of lengthy consultations with interested parties and the Member States , soil was recognised as a valuable natural resource and its degradation in Europe is becoming problematic .
I find it very satisfying that soil degradation is recognised as a grave problem that must be overcome .
Thus efforts will be guaranteed to be more focused and resources will be used more effectively to serve our purposes .
It is therefore vital that businesses should be confident that similar procedures will be adopted for the designation of contaminated sites , thus allowing for planned investments .
In the light of this , allow me to summarise the basic aims of the measures proposed by the Commission : Firstly , a highly flexible , but consistent and comprehensive European soil policy must be developed .
The aim of the restoration should be to achieve soil quality consistent at least with the current and intended use of the land .
I should like to draw your attention to certain key aspects of the framework directive on soil protection : Firstly , the document produced after the codecision process has to be unambiguous and provide legal clarity for the interested parties affected by this legislative process .
However , you must be sure that these amendments will not create difficulties in the application of the directive by all Member States .
To conclude , let me state that from now on the Commission will follow developments during the discussion of its proposal in the Council and in the European Parliament .
I should also like to thank the other three committees for their participation and their contribution to the discussion .
This is the clear message that we will be delivering in a few weeks ' time in Bali , where the Future International Action on Climate Change Network is to be discussed .
In terms of taxation and VAT , international air transport continues to enjoy privileges enjoyed when it was still a small , emerging economic sector after the Second World War .
In negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990s , air and sea transport were exempted from targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
The Commission fully recognises the importance of air transport for international trade and economic development .
We cannot of course allow this situation to continue without taking measures to combat it .
