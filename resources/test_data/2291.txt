first wave of new countries to join the European Union if no solution can be found .
I should like to put two questions to you .
The impression we get is that the Commission and the Council , the European Union in general , has not explored every feasible way of exerting pressure on Turkey .
Commissioner , I think that the European Commission really has taken a constructive and positive approach to the integration of Cyprus and the resolution of the Cyprus problem and I welcome that .
I should like the Commission to make quite clear what its recommendation will be should that happen .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during last year 's debate on the employment package , Parliament made a clear demand for procedures to be streamlined .
The Barcelona Council tabled the same demand .
It is not simply better timing .
First , both strategies will clearly be strengthened and will have a higher profile within the Lisbon framework .
So there will be a mid-term review , when we set objectives and guidelines , together with annual controls and annual cooperation in monitoring policies and it is this that will maintain the momentum of the strategy .
My next point concerns better governance of economic and social policies , which is also one of the items on the agenda of the Convention set up to revise the Treaty .
Our aim is to ensure that , with this new framework , we can cooperate efficiently with Parliament .
One clear objective , as I said , is that these two policies should be independent .
I think that we now all have a political responsibility to achieve this both for political reasons and because we need distinct employment policies in the European Union as a whole .
Mr President , I should like to comment on three points .
So , to come back to what Mrs Van Lancker said about other policies , such as pension schemes or policies on other social issues or the problem of exclusion which we discussed recently , I have to say that all these procedures are in a state of flux and that our final objective is to coordinate them within a common framework .
They leave cyclical changes out of account , which is why medium-term objectives are much more significant and help governments to focus their efforts and apply specific objectives .
One of the few points I wish to comment on is the plan to allow below cost selling .
But for over 20 million small and medium-sized enterprises , it spells mortal danger from unfair trading by large retailers who , by selling below cost , could wipe out thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises and minimise any possible competition .
That is why , if we want to say that we represent the millions of workers and businesses in the European Union , if we want to maintain that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy and society , if we want to carry on claiming that we are in touch with reality , then we need to vote against below cost selling in tomorrow 's vote .
I do not think this will help foster healthy competition ; what it will help foster are unfair trading practices by very large companies ; smaller businesses and consumers will be the ones to suffer because , once the competition in the vicinity has been wiped out , one or , at most , a few companies will corner the market .
If the amendment by Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs is adopted , there should be no problem , and it is therefore vital for us to support these amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs .
However , the painful truth is that violence persists in our society , forcing us to adopt more radical and efficient measures , such as introducing a legal basis in the Treaty or organising a European year on this topic , as the rapporteur suggests .
It is therefore vital , I think , that the final report contain an in-depth analysis of the quantitative and qualitative involvement of the various agencies and the mechanisms they use to cooperate and of the impact which the programmes have on local society .
Mr President , without doubt the DAPHNE programme was a very successful initiative on the part of the European Commission ; but it was also brought about by pressure from the Committee on Women 's Rights and the campaign which it started in 1997 under the slogan 'Violence against Women : Zero Tolerance ' , a slogan , Commissioner , which is as topical now as it was then , given that violence or , to be more exact , terrorism and the war against women are waxing rather than waning both in Europe and worldwide .
A percentage of European women which , depending on the country , varies from 20 to 50 % , has fallen victim to domestic violence , while rape and sexual harassment are a daily occurrence .
As the fight for sexual equality and de facto recognition of the rights of half the population on planet Earth steps up , so does violence against women .
Our rapporteur , Mrs Avil√©s Perea , has drafted a very valuable report and has tabled proposals on behalf of our committee which I ask you , Commissioner , to take on board .
The first year , 2001 , was a special case which we discussed last year .
I think it is clear that , this year , we have a detailed description of all the agencies involved in each action .
The period from 2003 to 2005 is also important .
I should like to comment on three points which I feel are instrumental to the debate .
