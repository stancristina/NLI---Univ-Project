the confines of an energy system which , together with its legal bases , was built at a time when renewable sources of energy were more or less unknown .
I think that Mr Piebalgs ' recent five-point action plan moves in this direction .
Allow me now to focus our attention on two issues .
Advanced hybrid generation technologies , which combine renewable sources of energy and storage technologies , need to be applied to independent energy systems as a matter of priority .
The Commission needs to study best practices in managing networks , in order to resolve these problems .
If we look at the situation as described in the reports by both the High Commissioner for Refugees and the special UN envoy , we see that , since 2004 , after the bloody events and the murder of Serbs and other minorities , nothing has improved in Kosovo as regards the protection of minority rights .
The European Union designed a European strategy on the basis of the conclusions of the European Council in Thessaloniki .
The restoration of the churches and cultural monuments of the minorities , especially the Serb minority , must also be funded .
The Commission has given preference to the interests of importers .
That is the European interest and the European Commission , the guardian of European interest , is being called on to protect it .
In addition , I believe that effective measures for the gradual adaptation of the European textile industry are needed , as are the necessary balancing measures in keeping with WTO law .
At the same time , thousands of workers are being thrown out into the street of unemployment .
The workers need to draw the necessary political conclusions , given that the statistic quoted in the relevant reports is this : that 60 % of Chinese exports to the rest of the world come from foreign investments in China .
It is a crucial problem and the traditional productive fabric of the country is being damaged and unemployment is increasing .
The question is what integrated European policy does Europe have at its disposal to modernise and strengthen the competition of the European textile industry .
It is very difficult , Commissioner , to persuade the European citizens losing their jobs and finding themselves unemployed that the European Union has every interest in full liberalisation because it can export its goods and services to China .
This is simply because not all European countries have heavy industry , they do not all produce cars and airbuses .
To close , I call on the Commissioner for the European Commission to tell us what it intends to do about the textile companies financed from Community funds which then either relocated outside Europe or closed .
A new intervention mechanism is being created entitled ' Peace-Building Commission' , which includes a military corps , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( see Iraq ) .
What has angered them is the fact that the authorities in Belarus took certain measures against the activities of the so-called ΜΚΟs , which everyone knows are funded from the state coffers of imperialist countries in order to promote their policy .
We are against creating a separate ' European Democracy Fund ' , because it will be yet another tool at the service of imperialist intervention by the European Union .
With its accession to the WTO in 2001 and the opening of its market to international trade , China is now a very important factor in international trade .
The Member States , in turn , need to carry out effective controls of their internal markets in order to protect European consumers from products which do not meet the 'C' standard .
This is also the only way to safeguard controls of exportable products .
I worry about seeing more innocent victims , as in Madrid and London .
To reduce its intolerance and to disarm its fanaticism .
I do not want the cat at my throat , I do not want the cat at Europe 's throat .
There is an outstanding question : the question of the name is still outstanding .
We must not allow this to continue : the hijacking of a name which does not belong to them and of a history which does not belong to them either .
The truth is killing us .
We want an initiative by the European Union .
Africa will not have a future if it continues to rely on charity from the rich .
The implementation of the objective being set by the European Commission to strengthen regional , economic and commercial integration is of decisive importance in combating poverty and to the economic development of the African continent .
The objective of lifelong learning is the satisfaction of the demands of big business , flexible forms of work and the creation of lifelong semi-educated workers , who will be forced to retrain in order to constantly generate more profit .
True democratisation in education does not mean access for all young people to retraining and to fragmented knowledge ; it means a standard , free , state education up to the age of 18 which will give them an integrated knowledge base .
The objective of this pact is to improve education , training , mobility , professional assimilation and the social integration of the young people of the European Union .
Consequently , the society of knowledge is the key to the success of Lisbon .
To close , improving the foreign language skills of young people is an important requirement for the young people of Europe and contributes to the society of knowledge .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , immigration flows to the European Union , which increased significantly after the 1980s , confirm the need for special educational support measures to be introduced in the schools of the Member States for children whose mother tongue differs from the language of their social environment
