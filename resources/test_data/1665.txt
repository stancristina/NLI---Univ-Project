( Applause) I would strongly urge you to take on this task , in which you can count on my support .
The third phase - which is unavoidable - has to be that of another Intergovernmental Conference proper .
It is based on a dual legitimacy : that provided by the peoples of Europe which you , ladies and gentlemen , represent , and that of the Member States represented in the Council , which is in turn based on the democratic national vote .
This is especially true as , wherever ideas diverge about the desirable degree of integration , we now have the extremely important - I repeat , extremely important - instrument of enhanced cooperation , made possible by the Treaty of Nice within the framework of the Community method .
Mr President , Mr Simpson 's report is truly excellent , and I am qualified to say so for I consider myself to be one of the few people who are familiar with the technical as well as the political side of the sector , having recorded almost 10 000 flight hours precisely as a member of a flight crew before devoting myself to politics .
The problems here are enormous : on the one hand , there is the need to make both aircraft and staff fly as much as possible , and on the other , there is the need to avoid pushing human beings , especially , beyond their physical and mental limits .
Sleep , the disruption of circadian rhythms and so on clearly influence flight safety as well as the personal health of the members of the flight and cabin crews .
Mrs De Palacio , I am sure that you are familiar with part of your communication which highlights a disturbing disparity between the different Member States in the quality and safety of roads and number of victims claimed .
We feel that the Commission should present a directive setting the maximum blood alcohol limit at 0.5 parts per thousand for all the Member States .
The development of intermodality hinges primarily upon the level of efficiency provided by the rail services on offer , which unfortunately , in many Member States , rate poorly in terms of quality , efficiency and cost-effectiveness .
By way of illustration , the working hours of drivers and crews do not tally with intermodal operations , and terminals are not always able to accommodate round-the-clock train and shipping timetables .
The globalisation and liberalisation of the markets are already producing a substantial increase in the demand for the transportation of goods and commodities .
Clearly , if the wise sayings " Whoever breaks it pays for it " or " Polluter pays " crop up in a discussion on the cost of the roads , then , apart from anything else , there needs to be fewer heavy goods vehicles and more rail transport in the Alpine region in future .
The first is that if the methodology which we hope the Commission will decide upon and we will be able to endorse enables us to produce a clearer definition of the internal and external costs and a clearer system for charging users , we will create the conditions to be able to transfer the financing of infrastructure from purely public resources and general taxation to the users as such .
This would make it possible - and I feel that the time is now ripe - to obtain operative indications for advancing European policy in this direction in practical terms .
Quality in the context of transport , in my opinion , means above all safety , accessibility and coordination of infrastructures .
Although done with the best of intentions , that could be the road to bureaucracy and subsidised representation and representativeness in our parliaments , and it is a road I do not feel we should take .
I told him that administrative procedures in the civil aviation sector , including provision for regulating the work of aviation employees , were due to be debated in the European Parliament , along with technical regulations , and I assured him that I would ask for a recommendation to the Member States to give pilots higher and earlier pensions , for pilots are of key importance for our safety .
Madam President , on the very crowded motorway between Bergamo and Milan I was sitting next to Lino Miserotti again , and we were talking about motorway tariffs .
Madam President , there is a lot of talk about quotas in Mrs Karamanou ' s report .

It is up to the government to act .
That is why , like other Members , I believe we must not hesitate to condemn terrorism and offer full cooperation to the Algerian government to defeat it .

As the resolution suggests , it is vital to prevent changes to the statute and there needs to be action to bring the implementing regulation rapidly into force or , at least , finalise it .
I remember the early resolutions , when we called loudly for a European Union with 15 Member States united and resolute in this fight , defending the essential principles of the court : the independence of the prosecutor , the court ' s autonomy in trying criminals , the definition of the purpose of the court ' s mandate and so on .
That said , I want to tell you that I consulted my daughter Elisabetta about this report .
It is clear that enlargement will not just mean problems for the struggling regions which we are attempting to embrace in the Union .
We all realise that Europe needs a new philosophy , namely that in order to be effective , common strategies must be realistic and practicable .
A new policy of trilateral trade , safeguarding typical productions , including European productions , condemning and
