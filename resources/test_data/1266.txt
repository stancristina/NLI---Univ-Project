nor the word 'constitution ' can conceal the anti-grass roots essence of the new Treaty , which adds yet another link to the chain binding the peoples post Maastricht , Amsterdam and Nice .
The people do not need a European constitution .
Nonetheless , I want to express a number of concerns .
I want to express particular concern about the Youth programme .
But why spend around EUR 40 million a year over five years in order to reinforce the so-called European message ?
A multisided mechanism is therefore being constructed which even wants to involve and buy off independent organisations and foundations .
That is why we shall vote against all three proposals , without entering into the debate on the details .     .
Over the last decade , we know that three million new jobs have been created , of which 1 600 000 have been taken up by women .
In the field of research and science , women are not only seriously underrepresented , they are present in just a few scientific fields and completely absent from others , while they are markedly unequally represented throughout the scientific hierarchy and have less opportunity to secure funding for research .
Better access for women to research would certainly help to enrich scientific methods , themes and subject matters .
Similarly , we have worrying evidence about the small percentage of women Internet users in the accession countries .
That is why both the Commission and the Member States should undertake the commitment , with the full use of Structural Funds and in particular the Social Fund , for training in the new technologies , particularly with regard to the entry or return of women to the labour market , always in the context of the Lisbon objectives .
At the same time , sexual equality policies and programmes need to be implemented that aim especially to vocational training , lifelong learning , compatibility between professional and private life and the equal division of family responsibilities between men and women , which will facilitate women 's access to the information society .
At the same time , policies need to be adopted that will improve working conditions in new sectors , such as teleworking .
Similarly , the Commission needs to collate additional statistics on structural differences in the IT sector , so that we can investigate the real participation of women , their representation and trends in the job market .
Integrating the gender dimension into the development of new technologies does not only raise the question of access , quantitative participation and the equal representation of women ; it also raises a deeper question and presents an opportunity for a critical evaluation of the culture of the information society , with its values , development strategies and objectives and the involvement of human resources .
The European Union is lagging behind the United States in research and the use of new technologies .
I should like to comment in particular on facilitating Internet connections for housewives , because this will make life easier for women themselves .
Today , we can find websites on the Internet where mothers exchange experiences and promote solutions to an impressive degree .
Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Committee on Foreign Affairs has discussed the proposal for a regulation implementing an initiative by the Hellenic Republic , as decided at the Thessaloniki summit , on the crucial social and political issue of illegal immigration .
In one way , it communitises this policy and creates prospects for further improvements .
Honourable Members , we constantly witness thousands of drownings on our shores or in our border rivers , deaths in containers , on the shores of the Mediterranean or the Channel or in inaccessible mountains .
Our fears are also reinforced by the traumatic experience we had last year , with 17 % participation by women in the constitutional convention for the European constitution .
In the run up to the European elections , we need additional strategies and legislative measures , positive action , quotas or political agreements which will safeguard the balanced participation of men and women in electoral combinations and in the elected bodies which result .
I think that promoting exchanges of these experiences is very important because it raises the awareness of the competent agencies , it gives them ideas about applying measures and evaluating progress .
However , I suspect that it has nothing interesting or progressive to tell us , because the initiatives of the non-governmental organisations , to which the programme mainly refers , cannot bear fruit if there is no public dialogue in the Member States on the subject which will engage the parliaments , national and regional , where they exist , and will bring parties , local authorities and social agencies face to face with their options and responsibilities , in order to make the whole of society aware of the issue of the participation of women , an issue which concerns the future of the whole of society and not just the future of women .
We also need an open dialogue between the parties themselves so that everyone is informed and aware , from the leaders to the regional cadres , of the deficit in the participation of women and the need to apply a strategy to support and promote women cadres to positions of responsibility .
This is a challenge which concerns us all , at both European and national level , and the European elections give us an opportunity to demonstrate our determination to face up to it .     Mr President , we members of the Communist Party of Greece also observed a minute 's silence for the Italian soldiers and policemen killed in Iraq recently and for the victims of the bombings in Istanbul
