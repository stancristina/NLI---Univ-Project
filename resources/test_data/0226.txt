We have asked Parliament to give its approval to both agreements so that they can enter into force permanently , as at the moment , they are being applied merely provisionally .
When the Commission proposes new mandates for negotiations with the United States and Australia , the Council will examine them carefully .
These , I believe , are three important principles .
I think the debate we had on SWIFT may clarify matters .
Both principles are therefore expressed and recognised in constitutions and in European legislation , and they are both present in the Treaty of Lisbon .
All citizens need to partake in the digital revolution for it to become a success .
There are already multilateral organisations such as the United Nations for this sort of dialogue .
We called that the Community method .
That is why , Mr President , the European Council addressed a letter to you asking that , in accordance with Article 48( 2 ) of the Treaty , this Parliament give its opinion on two questions .
I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference can be very quickly called and can even resolve the issue in a single morning , given that the political decision has already been taken .
That is why I am pleased that this report has been drawn up by Mr Méndez de Vigo and that it has been adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in the form that he proposed .
That is all this is about , but it is an important question .
I think that this problem that has come up , which must be examined and presented realistically , has been satisfactorily resolved .
That is why , in the last analysis , I agree with Mr Méndez de Vigo , who proposes that there is no need for a Convention , that an Intergovernmental Conference be called as soon as possible , that the 27 Member States ' parliaments ratify the decision at the earliest opportunity , and that , as a result , the 18 MEPs in question can be seen in this Parliament , as they should have been here from the outset of this parliamentary term .
Indeed , we say as much in paragraph 1 of the report , to the extent that the 18 MEPs should enter en bloc , otherwise we would lose representativeness .
In other words it is going to formalise the commitment - which at this stage is a political commitment - made at the meeting of European Union Heads of State or Government on 11 February , a commitment to support Greece in resolving its extremely difficult financial situation .
The European Economic Recovery Plan and the decisions made by the Member States have made a clear contribution to this by injecting large amounts of money into the economies of the various countries from the budgets of the Member States and from the Union budget , through the European Economic Recovery Plan .
The first of these is taking responsibility for the commitments made , for example when a Treaty on European Union is signed and ratified .
This package should involve the regulations and directives that are being debated here and now in Parliament , and are going to be debated in the relevant committee in the next few days and then in the relevant plenary sitting .
We cannot continue to simply play a monitoring role .
The Stability and Growth Pact is one of the elements that has most demonstrated the need to coordinate our economic policies .
Thirdly , we must develop a new concept of European solidarity .
The future of Greece will largely depend on the growth of its neighbours - us - as we are its main economic partners .
It is about not returning to a crisis that has not yet completely come to an end , and it is above all about doing so by establishing a strategy for growth , a model for growth that is adapted to the new times .
All of this is on the basis of the communication adopted by the Commission , which was a determining factor in the subsequent decision and the conclusions adopted at the March European Council .
Fifthly , there are the 'flagship initiatives ' that are being developed by the Commission .
The European Council is going to play a very important role and undertake a very important task in developing and guiding this strategy , alongside the European Commission .
However , if I had to choose one of those reasons to explain the lack of success of the Lisbon Strategy , I think that the most conclusive one is that the European Union - which adopted the single market at the time , which adopted a single currency - has not taken the necessary step towards economic union .
For example , the technological dimension or the social dimension that Mr Cofferati , Mr Cercas and Mr Arif mentioned , and the dimension of combating climate change , which links to what Mrs Schroedter was saying .
They could also , if they wanted to - and in my opinion they should - coordinate their social policies .
In addition , we need instruments to incentivise this strategy , such as the authorisation of the Structural Funds and the European funds to guide this strategy , something that did not exactly happen - or at least did not happen to a great extent - during the years of the Lisbon Strategy .
The Spanish Presidency of the Council would like to express , on behalf of the Council , its condolences and sympathy to the families , and therefore echoes the statement made by the President of Parliament .
This means , among other things , accepting the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights , and increasing the guarantees for citizens .
The Council has also very closely followed the debates and hearings held by Parliament in March of this year , and
