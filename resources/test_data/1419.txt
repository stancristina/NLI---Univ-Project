Meanwhile , Indonesia is dealing with a total of one million refugees internally , 130 000 of whom are in Timor and 300 000 on the Moluccan Islands .
In addition to the quantitative criteria , a number of qualitative criteria will need to be developed .
However , in Europe ' s most densely populated area around the North Sea and the Channel , there are major ports , including that of my home town , Rotterdam .
Mr President , the trans-European networks are intended to link the different regions of the European Union , not only as a means of transport , but also as a way of sharpening the competitive edge and hence of increasing employment in certain regions .
The link with the hinterland can be made in different ways .
There is also the risk of over-regulation , which is the case , in our view , with the obligation for all buses longer than 12 metres to be fitted with three axles , irrespective of the use made of those buses .
This is exactly where there is room for improvement .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , the questions which Mr Napolitano asked the Council and Commission on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs bear witness to a view of the Charter , which , unfortunately , our group is unable to share .
We would therefore be in favour of the Member States discussing the European Union ' s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as one of the subjects within the framework of the IGC.
I do have two minor criticisms I would like to make .
I believe that we have a sound Charter before us .
On a legal plane , I can think of forms of enforcement other than direct enforcement by the European Court on an individual basis .
Last week , the Benelux governments proposed in an IGC memorandum that next year , under the Belgian Presidency , a plan for giving direction to Europe ' s will have to be laid down which addresses these points , such as the anchoring of the Charter , but also the discussion on reforming institutions and authorities , which Mr Prodi was referring to .
What I would also call for , however , is to look beyond immediate concerns in Biarritz .
All this represents a step forward .
The roads there are wide and as straight as an arrow .
That is the main reason why I intend to reject the proposals .
In reality , they often have more in common with gamblers who hope to tap into goldmines .
Every year - and this is shortly to happen again , on 8 November - each candidate country awaits with bated breath the judgement of the Commission with regard to the progress made .
Let us also recognise the huge progress we have made .
We have learnt a great deal from this exercise .
But at the same time we have set a process in motion whereby there is no longer any communication about when something will take place and this has removed any commitment to making an effort .
We would like other countries to join in the session after 2004 and negotiations with the candidate states in question to be completed more quickly .
The enthusiasm for Europe in the East has made way for fairly harsh criticism .
As for this strategy , I have in mind a phased enlargement in relatively small rounds of genuinely suitable candidates , spread out over a period of fifteen years or so .
Then the course of enlargement would truly run smooth , with public opinion forming its crucial social basis .
I do not want to encumber this agenda any more , nor do I want to lighten it .
Slovakia does not really gain from political exemptions either .
Policing must be stepped up , also in tandem with the European Union , and more investments must be made to improve border control .
A distinction must be drawn between judgment and prejudice ; otherwise we will continue to have a lack of understanding , which will stand between them and us like an invisible wall .
The Law on the Use of Minority Languages is a large step in the right direction but the technical implementation of this act has been inadequate .
The level of improvement has even been such that Slovakia has been admitted to the exclusive club of the OESO , and I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to Slovakia on this achievement .
The problems I mentioned are not insurmountable .
What procedure , for example , will be used to decide on these transitional periods ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the EU' s enlargement , to include ten Eastern European countries and the two Mediterranean countries Malta and Cyprus , is upon us .
The ten new countries in Eastern Europe can only dream of having a rich sugar daddy such as that .
Environmental aid will need to double in order to help the new countries .
Accordingly , their decision in favour of rail transport , which takes up less space and emits less polluting substances than road transport , was a sound one .
In addition , new industrial sites are being built .
Mr President , with enlargement on the horizon , today ' s debate forms an excellent opportunity to reiterate what the representatives of the European people regard as being the key points .
Telecommunications and technological developments only surpassed by time itself should not be kept from the consumers of the enlargement countries .
This is why the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats is of the opinion that all amendments and viewpoints which implicitly tighten criteria and
