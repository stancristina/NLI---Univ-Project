perspectives , I should nevertheless like to point out one particular aspect pertaining to the appropriations for the common foreign and security policy .
In the draft budget , there is a surplus left over to the tune of EUR 53 million under the ceiling of heading 5 of the financial perspectives , which allows new needs in the field of administrative expenditure , notably for the budget of the European data protection supervisor , to be accommodated .
With regard to the other 239 offices , the Council failed to adopt a position on 20 July because , on the one hand , it requires more clarity concerning the decision on the regulation for the definitive termination of service by Commission officials and , on the other hand , it nurses the hope that your discussions on this matter will yield a solution which can accommodate our respective wishes .
In this way , we prevent the individual European taxpayers from being faced with too heavy a burden .
Failure to conclude a new fisheries agreement with Morocco has led to an explosive situation along the Spanish and Portuguese coasts , an area which is already facing major social problems in connection with illegal immigration .
As a final point , I have to say that I am delighted with the fact that , with regard to foreign policy , the PPE-DE Group will be tabling an amendment for more attention for Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan , and I should also like to recommend this amendment warmly for further discussions .
The Commission , as well as the majority in this Parliament , want to press on .
The Commission ' s and Parliament ' s urge to stress the distinctive features of the European political parties does not end at the Union ' s borders .
Mr President , I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteurs , particularly Mr Costa Neves .
We can put all kinds of restrictions in place , but I do not think that we can rely on the fact that , in the years to come , there will be an annual surplus of one to two billion in the agricultural budget .
On a final note , I think we ought to bolster Eastern Europe .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that is the key aim of our efforts in Central Asia .
You said you have come to listen , rather than make any comments , and I can understand that .
I also have to say that there are clearly fewer disagreements at the level of our committee , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
Despite this , I hope that it is possible to restore the Commission ' s preliminary draft in this respect .
There is thus a major risk of the Commission backing useful actions which would also be implemented without ESF subsidy because national or local authorities have already recognised their usefulness .
Experiences with ESF subsidies in the Netherlands indicate that it has been unclear on more than one occasion as to what can and cannot be subsidised .
On the contrary : it is of the utmost importance for men to be given the opportunity to be more involved in the new life that they have helped create .
It contains a number of major failings .
There were hardly any innovative ideas in it , except for how to tackle sexual violence , something which , for a directive which is already 25 years old , is telling .
Hence , also the green amendment to establish one regulation for both mothers and fathers so that fathers can look after their children more but are also protected in the same way .
The two amendments that were tabled subsequently by Mrs Hautala have caused a great deal of difficulty , for a large majority of people who are already unhappy about this directive have found in these amendments a reason to vote against a whole host of things .
He will faithfully transpose what is in the European directives , sometimes too late , but it is done , anyway .
The combination of work and care still poses problems in many cases .
However , as is often the case - that is , in any case , what I have gleaned from people who have far more experience as Presidents of the Council - the news has somewhat played havoc with that agenda , and with good reason , in my view .
Three elements are essential in this unanimous approach and I should like to outline them briefly .
With regard to the creation of a European arrest warrant , I believe it is safe to say that we have reached a break-through .
Moreover , we , along with the Council , have once again warned against the risk of the Islamic world embracing terrorism .
The foundations of the economy , however , remain healthy , which inspired both myself and the Council to be cautiously optimistic .
During the second part of our meeting , we discussed the issues relating to the future of the European Union and the Laeken Declaration .
Madam President , I do not believe that the Laeken Declaration must be a conventional declaration , and it must , above all , be a source of inspiration .
The streets were calm .
Ghent was an informal Council in the true sense of the word , which will certainly help us to make great progress in Laeken , in other words , to develop a common policy on asylum , immigration and justice , to declare operational the common foreign and security policy , to move closer towards enlargement and - which I think the most important thing - to adopt an ambitious declaration on the future of Europe .
