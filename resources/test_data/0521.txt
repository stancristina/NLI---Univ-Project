Numerous villages were flooded and many houses were totally immersed under water .
Turkey is obviously demonstrating with these actions that it intends to resolve this problem not through democratic process but through violence , with the survival of the fittest .
It is unacceptable and scandalous for Europe , under the shadow of a crisis of anti-terrorist hysteria , to turn itself into a mediaeval fortress and to promote the operation of centres in which immigrants and asylum seekers are kept under detention conditions , contrary to the relevant international conventions .
Depriving asylum seekers and immigrants of their freedom is unjustified .
Governments find it convenient to blame the Union for decisions which are not in their interests and to claim the merit for decisions which benefit their country .
This can indeed be the course of European unification .     – Mr President , we are sorry that the competent Commissioner , Mr Mandelson , is not present .

The general framework of limitations on duties must be evaluated in conjunction with : firstly , the important offer made by the European Union to eliminate the Community export refund system , secondly , the drastic reduction already made to internal Community aid and , thirdly , the comparatively disadvantageous position of European farmers and producers due to their obligation to comply with stricter rules .
On ΝΑΜΑ , the final agreement should guarantee new , real market access opportunities through substantial cuts in applied rates in both developed and dynamically developing countries .

Guaranteeing an ambitious and effective Aid for Trade programme is particularly important .
Can we promise them ?
We have no energy of our own .
Gas from Russia , oil from the Middle East ; energy which will constantly increase in price as a result of excess demand from China and India .
That is the reality .
The factories of Europe are going to third countries and wages of course are going with them .
This sentence would therefore be reworded as follows : 'Stresses the importance , therefore , of achieving positive results in reducing and eliminating its domestic subsidies ' .
It is a lie that competition helps to reduce consumer prices .
They constitute the hope for radical change against the exploitative policies of the EU and the governments , which is why we are with them .     – Τhe Kommounistiko Komma Elladas voted against the report on the assessment of the Doha Round , because it moves in and repeats the reactionary , anti-grass roots framework of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong and the extravagant claims of Euro-unifying capital , as defined and promoted in splendid cooperation with the USA .
There are numerous alibis : the ageing of the population in order to increase retirement ages , energy security in order to privatise the energy sector and convert it from a social to a commercial commodity , reduction in deficits as required under the Stability Pact by 'containing ' public spending on grass-roots requirements and salary/productivity links in order to safeguard reductions in wages and pensions .
Sanctions by the Union itself would appear here to be the most effective measure .
Such texts , of course , presuppose clearer agreements between their authors .
Social dialogue is therefore needed with the agencies involved , which will thus be in a position to act as joint legislators .
That is why we need a programme which will be able to motivate European citizens on the weak points ; in other words make them participate more actively in common ventures , with the objective of mutual understanding between citizens and between the different cultural and historic permutations of the European identity itself .
We cannot and must not forget the tragic moments which our continent experienced 60 years ago in the concentration and extermination camps at the hands of Nazism , nor of course can we or must we forget the crimes committed by Stalinism .
We also celebrate the 25th anniversary this year of the accession of Greece to the European Community .
The ' Citizens for Europe ' programme which we are debating today will therefore acquire material and overall value .
That is why the amendments referred to earlier by my honourable friend Mr Catania and others must also be adopted , because they supplement the most extensive and very important report by our honourable friend Mr Takkula .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I want to give my honourable friend Mrs Pack an explanation as regards the letter .
I receive such letters , just like everyone else .
No other cultural action in the European Union has the same range today or , most importantly , the same projection and mass participation on the part of citizens .
This is something that has been done and the honourable Members who participated in the previous committee chaired by Michel Rocard worked a great deal on this .
Finally , I want to say a couple of words about the prize .
Of course , there has been a compromise in relation to the initial proposal .
But did we not teach national reflexes to the peoples of Europe at the time when communism and internationalisation reigned supreme ?
That is the truth , and when you talk about a common energy policy , it means that you are committing the states to not being able to have their own national energy policy .
