Commission !
Mr Prodi is entitled to cross the bridges of his choice rather than the ones you build .
Let me issue a warning to those Members of this House who advocate rejection : if that were to happen , the Commission would be entitled to examine the situation in each individual port .
To this end , ports and the providers of port services are obliged to disclose to the Commission and to the Member States the financial relations between themselves and public undertakings .
We cannot , then , describe this as a fair compromise ; it is more like kow-towing to the Council .
What you said was completely one-sided , and , as you said , it indicates that you want to let liberalisation advance .
On Thursday , then , will be the hour of decision .
We all know that .
It is with reference to that , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that I would like to put a question to you .
As regards the work now ahead of us , as the Commission sees it the main issue is to maintain and defend the considerable progress represented by the draft Constitutional Treaty .
We need to be aware of that .
I say that because ultimately there are only a few issues that are really controversial , and they are unlikely to be resolved next year either .
When it comes to overall willingness to compromise , there is one thing that should not be overlooked , and that is efficiency .
There should be an opening , with the exception of the " Changes in Competence " and " Charter of Fundamental Rights " areas , which must , of course , continue to be covered by the existing procedure .
What is this all about ?
But I warn all those who are toying with the idea of attacking this right that they are opening themselves up to accusations that they do not want to use the Constitution to extend democracy in Europe , that they do not want to strengthen or further democracy , but that they want to bypass it and undermine it , by depriving Parliament of one of its central rights .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would specifically like to thank the Italian Presidency for all its efforts to ensure that the result of the Intergovernmental Conference closely reflects the draft Constitutional Treaty .
The majority of governments do not understand that a Union with over 25 Member States needs to have a new basis .
I must say , however , Mrs Maes , that the example you chose was not a particularly apt one .
It was the driving force in fostering cooperation between the parliaments of the Euro-Mediterranean area .
Let me say in conclusion that intercultural dialogue must play a special part in our entire concept .
Unfortunately , this was turned down by a tiny liberal left majority of this House and I must make it perfectly clear that that is probably the end of compromises in this matter .
The President-in-Office of the Council has already drawn attention to the signing of the agreement between Europol and the Russian interior ministry .
We will continue to press for a more workable political solution , but that will not be possible without full respect for human rights .
We are very clear when we say that we want to seek a strategic partnership with Russia , because we know that relations between the European Union and Russia are crucial for peace and stability on our continent in the twenty-first century .
However , it is also important that we agree on a common policy and therefore on a formulation when meeting with the Russian president .
The same is true of the media .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission has already informed Parliament in detail about the strategy and individual elements of the neighbourhood concept .
The Commission will be presenting concrete action plans for a whole number of countries to the Council by the middle of next year ; compared with previous strategies , these will have the advantage of being joint action plans , negotiated documents , which we intend to implement jointly .
We must offer as much cooperation as we can manage in the foreseeable future .
I should like to make one final comment on the European constitution because we discussed it this morning : clearly , at all times in the procedure we must also ensure that Parliament’s right to shape and decide on legislative and budgetary matters is respected when drafting these definitive strategies .     – Mr President , may I first thank the rapporteur very warmly for being so willing to discuss , cooperate and compromise throughout the drafting of the report .
I would expect this from the Commission , because it is of course in the Commission communication itself , but I had thought that the discussion in the Council would have moved on by now .
The New Neighbourhood Instrument also contains very good ideas .
I understand what the Commissioner said , but we do not know what will be decided in 2004 .
This would create a second multilateral ring of countries with whom we maintain close relations , but where full membership is not the only option .
This also means that the scope and substance of the common ground will vary quite considerably , at least at the outset .
As a follow-up to the preparatory work done by the Danish Presidency last year , the Commission carried out an open and integrated consultation process in the first half of 2003 , involving the most important partners .
Only with the active support of all of the stakeholders in the region can the Northern Dimension be a complete success .
