Colocation or aerial sharing , as recommended by the Commission , is therefore extremely important .
A fair Information Society is therefore created methodically and patiently with decisive strategies .
The rapporteur has successfully supplemented the Commission 's basic proposal with a comprehensive report , which has been intelligently negotiated between the various political groups to which we belong .
However , which region in the world does not have problems ?
Now we have dropped that figure to 2.3 % .
I sincerely believe that it is vital for our future , which is why I wanted to say it again here , this morning , seriously and forcefully .
It is therefore clear that our proposals look like pious hopes or we appear to be reaffirming our will while we know that we do not have the tools to achieve it .
Having heard your speeches , I am forced to admit that once again , this Spring Council meeting will not achieve that objective .
In reality , European policy amounts to very little and even that is very weak .
This call is welcome , because today we look more like an old Europe falling into a depression .
On the contrary , if we want to gently reduce budgetary support , at the same time we need to strengthen the Community preference .
( FR ) We are not going to vote against people having access to public sector information .
The rapporteur does not hide the fact that her main preoccupation , when she talks about the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment , is that they should satisfy what she calls 'the needs of the labour market ' .
We should not forget this when we come to prepare for the European elections of June 2004 !
It is already possible to see that the current proposal , even though it is presented to us with no assessment of its consequences , will compel the European Union to adopt the principle of the decoupling of aid .
- ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report .

Mr President , the European Union is facing a test of truth .
The attitude which it will shortly be taking towards the prospect of a new Gulf War will be crucial in defining our vision of Europe and our conception of the world .
In rural areas , all activities have collapsed , desertification is progressing and the population exodus is speeding up .
First of all , as long as the inspectors are present , it will be difficult for Saddam Hussein to manufacture prohibited weapons .
Let us hope that those who are holding the cards are able to measure the weight of their responsibility .
Is this really how we imagine we are preparing a future for the people of Iraq ?
Another thing that propaganda has achieved is to make us believe that what it calls the international community has the right to topple a regime , which is absolutely contrary to international law and even - and this is my final remark , Mr President - contrary to the most fundamental truth in the world , which is the liberty of nations .
Mr President , last Monday 's joint declaration by France , Germany and Russia begins with a sentence which I believe everyone will approve of .
Before that , all reasonable solutions should be explored and attempted , or at least that is the idea which we , the representatives of free and democratic countries , have the honour and the duty to recommend and to put into practice .
What Europe needs , therefore , is a new immigration policy .
In the final analysis , therefore , the question is whether , in the light of what I believe to be the satisfactory results of the Convention working party , we should encourage the Council to work this year , or whether we ought to wait until new decision-making methods make it possible to achieve greater equilibrium between the three aspects of the area that we have been talking about just now .
Yet in Afghanistan , contrary to the official denials , even more powerful weapons were used , weapons equipped with a covering of depleted uranium or even natural uranium .
I heard on television a journalist who was covering our Members ' visit to Iraq mention enriched uranium in connection with these weapons , and it was mentioned on two occasions , so it could not have been a mere slip of the tongue .
I totally agree with this important step , but I would also ask that research into the causes of such fires should be reinforced .
We are always saying that we want to be closer to the people , that Europe should have solidarity , that Europe should be on the side of Europeans .
As for the right to abortion , it still has to be defended , and for some women , including some in Europe , it still has to be acquired .
They should therefore have more access to education , information and training , and they must be able to pass on to their children all that they have learned , so as to enable their countries to experience real development , in which access to health and information will occupy its rightful place .
The dictatorship exercised on society by industrial and financial groups , which is unbearable in all areas of society , has drastic consequences in areas involving the health and physical integrity of human beings .
Finally , as far as anticipating enlargement is concerned , we now believe it urgent that the Commission addresses the administrative capacity of the candidate countries to ensure compliance with single market legislation .
Drug-related deaths are on the up , and that seems to
