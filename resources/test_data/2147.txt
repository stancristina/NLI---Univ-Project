be able to approve it here in Parliament when the time comes .
The committee supports the development of a framework , which seems to be a sensible and realistic measure , and the proposal to establish a Directive on the minimum level of information to , and consultation , with employees .
In Sweden there is already a well developed system of participation through collective agreements which has proved to work well .
On the other hand , sometimes we also call different things by the same name which is not really the right thing to do .
All this is a very difficult area and it is important that we try to sort it out .
Perhaps it is just that the food consumer would like to keep the local character of their food , or perhaps he or she would like to think that they know how a certain food is produced ?
For this reason , I think it is important that we settle this matter to avoid misunderstandings in the future .
I would prefer not to see any restrictions on this opportunity for extension .
Commissioner , Mr. President , a few States on their own cannot represent the Union as a whole .
Mr. President , Commissioner , my first question concerns whether or not there is a risk that the cooperation between those countries wishing to move on quickly and those which feel that we are moving forward too fast will break down , and that a move to a more flexible form of working , in which the right of veto is effectively removed , will damage the close cooperation which we currently enjoy .
Who will decide when flexibility is applicable ?
This was a harsh and disturbing , but extremely significant revelation .
These days it is not so uncommon for pupils , usually with short cropped hair and army boots , to come to school wearing their swastikas and to shout their racist and xenophobic views .
Leaders in sporting organisations have the same problem when they are openly confronted by leering scornful racists .
We have spoken about a centre against racism , but this is not enough .
Mr. President , terrorism cannot be tolerated in a society governed by the rule of law .
It must be fought at every level , using legitimate means .
Practical and technical improvements can be made .
Europol must cooperate more with Interpol and such cooperation must be based on the wishes of the individual Member States .
Mr. President , this is not the first time that Parliament has discussed the issue of terrorism , and it is easy to understand why it has been discussed so many times .
Thirdly , terrorism , together with organised crime , forms the greatest barrier to the free movement of European citizens within the Common Market .
It is totally incomprehensible to me that Member States are not fully engaged in this task and that we do not fully utilise the available capacity through a better organised cooperation in matters of justice and in the deployment of the police .
Mr. President , I am a great advocate of cultural initiatives and international cultural exchanges .
This report talks about a European culture and a European cultural identity , but there is no such thing .
I believe that such attempts are doomed to failure .
Equally absurd are the plans to introduce common , obligatory material for schools covering European history .
The transport sector is one of the most important sectors in this respect .
It is also one of the most appropriate sectors on which to apply our vision of the free internal market .
As a Swede , I see the long distances between Sweden and the large continental markets as a great disadvantage to competition .
It is therefore important that we take this into account when we talk about loading external costs on to transport .
The same applies to the discussions on tax harmonisation .
We must tackle these problems somehow , but not in a way which threatens the fundamental principles of the internal market .
We ought at least to keep it in mind when the proposal is implemented .
Mr. President , Article K.9 , the so called ' Bridge ' for Article 100c only gives Parliament consultative powers in matters of legislation .
Article K.9 has been applied only once , in connection with schoolchildren going on school trips .
The Commission shares this view .
The more areas which are brought within the Community Pillar , the fewer problems we will have in the Third Pillar .
Perhaps we can also hope to see a document on organised crime .
Only then if no agreement can be reached should amendment proposals be put to the plenary session .
To do this anyway , by including points which do not add anything new to the discussion cannot , in my view , be justified .
The Intergovernmental Conference should consider resolving the problems of internal security and making the appropriate amendments to K.9 as one of its most important tasks .
It is my opinion that these are matters which we in Europe must resolve together , and that is the most important point .
Let us look at drugs policy for example : in Sweden and Scandinavia we have a restrictive drugs policy .
We also know that many of our EU citizens and other European peoples believe that drug policy and the fight against organised crime should be given high priority , and rightly so .
Transfer of all the areas mentioned in this report from the Third Pillar to the First would involve a huge shift of power from national Parliaments to EU level in matters which are considered typically internal and national by our people , for example , matters concerning the police , customs , civil rights and criminal law .
