I hope that Parliament 's requests will lead both the Council and the Commission to quantify the funding and/or population size allowed and clarify the possibility of granting state aid by way of exception to the competition rules under the terms of Article 92( 3 )( c ) of the Treaty , as has been done in other so-called 'special cases ' .
The importance of balanced and complementary growth in urban and rural areas is essential for economic and regional development .
To start with , there is the semantic confusion : the air war against the whole of Yugoslavia is described as the 'situation in Kosovo ' .
There is no assessment of the absolutely trifling role played by Europe .
Let me quote what we say in the resolution , that Parliament 'welcomes the statement issued by the Berlin European Council on the peace process , particularly the Palestinians ' unconditional right to self-determination , including the right to create a State , which the European Union is prepared to consider recognising in due course , and the undertakings given by the European Union concerning the future settlement of the conflict . '
This is the request we are making in this resolution , which I think will meet with the approval of all the groups in Parliament .
Our group fully supports it in any case .
Unfortunately this is just one aspect of the ethnic and political oppression which has deprived most of this country 's people of their basic rights .
I would like to thank Karl Habsburg very much indeed for mentioning the role of the intergroup we set up with so many colleagues .
Furthermore , the international community , working inter alia through the Organisation of African Unity , but with the European Union playing an active role , should back this agreement and get to work preparing an economic assistance programme of both emergency and long-term aid , to allow the country to recover in economic terms as well .
And having expressed this hope , Mr President , I would like to thank you in your capacity as President for the achievements of these last five years , and I would like to thank my colleagues , particularly those taking part in meetings on human rights and matters of urgency , for all the work they have done here and for all that I have learned from them .
Mr President , I would not wish the Italian language to remain unheard at this moment of farewells .
Mr President , I would like to take the floor in order to invoke the Rules of Procedure , for future reference , of course .
Mr President , the Presidencies of the Council of the European Union are not isolated entities and cannot be judged without taking into account the sequence of past events .
The responsibility of the national governments regarding the excessively delayed implementation of political union is huge and the German Presidency really does not seem to have changed the rhythm .
But the Presidencies talk about these issues , pass them , yet fail to implement them .
They are sitting here in front of you and their names are well known to you .
I am happy that this is so , but it should be specified that the Commission does not operate according to the same procedures as political parties .
One of the first actions of the new Commission will therefore be to adopt formally the new Code of Conduct for Commissioners , including also new , stringent rules for avoiding conflicts of interest when the Commissioners leave their office .
Practically every major development in the process of European integration can be traced back to the commitment and dedication of the personnel in the Commission .
However , as is the case in numerous public administrations , the world has moved on and the Commission has failed to keep up .
The Commissioner 's offices , that is , their private offices , will be in the same building as their respective Directorates-General .
All this will have to be discussed in depth with the European Parliament .
However , we will only succeed if we confront the issues which have genuine importance in the daily life of the citizens , such as unemployment , economic growth and the challenge represented by sustainable development to ensure a balance between the creation of riches , social justice and quality of life .
I think we can all testify to this .
What the citizens persist in demanding are clear answers to the important problems in their everyday lives .
As time goes on , my concern grows that our capacity to make war far exceeds our ability to co-ordinate the reconstruction after the devastation suffered by the populations involved .
Are the men and women of our generation unable to display the same farsightedness and courage over the Balkans issue ?
I believe this is the reason the Commission has refused , for example , to draw upon the budget made available by the OBNOVA reconstruction programme , approximately EUR 45 million to pay the salaries of the seven hundred people working for the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia .
I do not share this view .
For enlargement to work , an in-depth , thorough examination of the institutions is essential .
The challenge facing all of us is that of restoring the credibility of the European Union in the eyes of its citizens and ensuring that they understand the benefits that the European Union provides for their personal , everyday lives .
We have to deal with the same tasks .
This Parliament , which is the voice of the citizens of Europe , is the supreme judge of the Commission 's work .
We will carry out this assessment with great care and , naturally , try to be constructive .
However , it is also essential to
