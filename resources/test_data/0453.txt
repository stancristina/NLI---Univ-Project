I voted against this report because I do not agree with the wording that implies that economic restructuring , in other words the change from the communist system to a market economy , has only negative effects .
The ECB 's proposal would , in fact , allow the larger Member States to dictate monetary policy .
We would like to protest against this concealment .
Metalworking and textiles are not the only industries affected by industrial desertification .
Just as , at the very least , we should refuse to grant subsidies to businesses which , having received aid in one Member State , transfer production to another State .
Nothing .
Europe must use the many channels available in order to stabilise this country , and the entire region as well , especially at election time .
I do not , however , believe that that will be enough , and with regard to the electoral observation mission , I believe that the ball is currently in Parliament 's court .
We need to ensure that the industrial policy of the Member States is a moral one .
I also fully agree with the questions raised by Mrs Karamanou .
President Bush brazenly refers to notions of honour and moral principles and appeals to God , when he has taken the most inhumane and inexcusable of decisions .
Will they pursue battles with other rogue states ?
The European Union must strongly oppose the very grave precedent set by the American Secretary for Defence in failing to rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons or nerve gas against Iraq .
Old Europe must prove itself capable of setting out a vision of a new world .
We are told today that Iraq is dividing the European Union .
Mr President , with the United Nations ruled out of the game , with NATO rendered powerless , and with the European Union coming unravelled , the revelation of the day , ladies and gentlemen , is not war , or to be more precise the international 'rat hunt' , which it is claimed began tonight , although this claim is wrong because Iraq has been bombed every day for the last twelve years by the empire - or rather by the empire and its flunkeys .
This crisis has proved the senselessness of the European Union , torn apart by the opposing positions of its members , and has also proved that with average-sized powers and unable to become a major power , it is possible to create an organisation with no power at all .
The primary victims of this war are the pre-eminence of international law , the necessary respect for all human life and the need to work towards a fairer , more peaceful world , which imposes the essential requirement that force be used only as a last resort .
If consumers in the United States and Europe were to lose confidence , internal demand would collapse and lead the global economy into a prolonged recession .
Not only will the weapons conflict cause desolation and ruin in Iraq , it will also affect the social and human condition of hundreds of millions of men and women all over the world .
The inspections produced evident results and , as Mr Blix himself said , opened the way to genuine disarmament by Iraq without the need to engage in armed conflict .
I am sure none of you will have difficulty understanding it .
One is the stance taken by the coalition of those in favour of the war because they believe it is important and necessary , as has just been stated .
Consequently if this motion is passed , we will have notched up a victory .
The rest is simply a brazen lie kept alive by Heads of Government afraid of their own people .
For once too , the Europe of the institutions was at one with the people of Europe .
That is the crux of the issue .
To have the so-called economic giant settle for the lowest common denominator in its economic , social and environmental conclusions is , however , cause for despair .
The must-have list even includes a study on the means the European Union could deploy to assist the people of Iraq to live in freedom , dignity and prosperity .
That was almost surreal .
We would deserve the derogatory appellation of old Europe if we indicated we no longer wished to be the privileged area where different conceptions of world order wrestle with each other .
Yet you say we can do nothing about it and we should change the subject .
That too was a lie .
Mr President , how many more innocent victims will be added to those who have already fallen ?
We believed that a peaceful solution was possible in Iraq , thanks to the intervention of the inspectors , but the decision had already been taken .
It is time for us to react if we want a strong and independent Europe .
We must recognise that Bush has succeeded in bringing off a double tour de force .
This declaration said that the United Nations must continue to play a central role during and after the crisis .
Are they fundamental reasons ?
Secondly , our institutions , which find it difficult enough to operate when there are only fifteen Member States , need to be changed , and that means that the Convention must complete its work in the best possible conditions .
However , was it actually relevant , since we are now talking about a future Europe consisting of twenty-five members ?
These two questions are , on the one hand , the multi-annual salary adaptation method and , on the other hand , and most important , the pension scheme .
Thirdly , and finally , on a broader level we must not lose sight
