seek to humiliate nobody , avoid any confusion and not create rifts , which would be a huge mistake .
Pursuing a unilateralist approach is not a response to this deep-rooted evil .
In this respect , I would like to add something to the extremely interesting comments and thoughts of Commissioner Vitorino , and that is I hope the European Union will cease to subsidise the States that harbour or assist terrorists .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the tragic events of 11 September do not only implicate the criminal organisation that carried out these dramatic attacks to express its hatred of the West , but they also reveal that there is immense frustration towards US Middle East policy , which dates back as far as 1991 .
However , I would like to praise the courage of the first rapporteur , Mr Schmitt , who refused to have his name associated with such excesses .
If all citizens have a duty to stand in the way of terrorism , it is not sufficient merely to arrest and pass judgment on the perpetrators and organisers of terrorist acts .
There is not only Europe , however .
In order to combat fundamentalist terrorism , we should mainly focus our efforts on increased assistance to all supporters of moderate and tolerant Islam , whether they be in power or in opposition .
With regard to the statistical information in the second report on cohesion , one fact stands out in our minds : enlargement will bring a challenge twice as large as the one we are currently facing , for the figures indicate that regional disparities are set to double .
Poverty and inequality are persistent problems and we realise that we will need to fight them for a long time yet to come .
The Council then debated the issue in a calm atmosphere where everybody had the chance to speak and be heard .
We are , of course , not calling into question what current Member States receive from the Structural Funds from now until 2006 .
Secondly , I have had no negative feedback regarding the enlargement process .
I also plan to commission an additional study on the situation of mountainous regions or regions that have long-term natural handicaps .
It is in this frame of mind that I shall be entirely available today and in the forthcoming weeks to listen to your suggestions , your recommendations and your criticisms .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this debate has essentially been an exploratory and orientation debate concerned with future developments in structural and cohesion policy , as you expected .
We are opening this debate two years early without taboos , without waiting for enlargement to have taken place .
It is for the Council , the Council of Heads of State and Government in 2006 , based on the proposals we make , and whilst we are on this subject I would like to say , as I could have said later to Mr Nogueira Rom√°n , Mr Walter , Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pittella , who talked about the aims and values of the EU as set out in this cohesion policy , I would like to say to you , ladies and gentlemen , that in 2006 we will only make the right financial decisions if we first have a true and worthwhile political debate and if , naturally , within the framework of this debate and after this debate , the Commission , playing its proper role , puts forward proposals that are courageous and strong willed .
As for errors , delays or irregularities , we will progressively reduce these by taking the attitude I have just pointed out .
Naturally , we shall concentrate , as we have today , on the poorest regions and countries , for this is the true meaning of cohesion , created so that we can opt out of such a scheme when we are successful .
It is a question worth asking .
Fourthly , Mr Marques , coordination between the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds has been given real impetus with the new regulations for the period 2000-2006 and , within the Directorate-General , with the integrated management of the various departments concerned with the Cohesion Fund and the other Structural Funds .
For the period 1994-1999 , however , Member States did not have to provide information on the access of women to the Structural Funds .
In conclusion , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me repeat that the Commission is committed to the basic principles of the Structural Funds : concentration , additionality and partnership , and the best possible coordination with the Cohesion Fund .
I therefore hope that a large section of Parliament will also vote for this paragraph tomorrow .
It is also known as part-time work .
But it is not enough simply to make this statement ; if Parliament really wanted to put an end to this injustice it would take binding measures and force all employers without exception to respect the principle of equal treatment for men and women on pain of heavy penalties .
For one brief moment , we had faith in the hope that was born in Schengen , a hope that was virtually suffocated at birth by intolerance , a failure of courage and a lack of calm political analysis .
Mr President , first of all , on behalf of the Commission , I would like to congratulate Parliament and its rapporteur on their detailed work .
The rapporteur has taken these concerns on board and the Commission certainly shares them .
This may seem to be a generous gesture in principle and indeed it is , but in the context of the troubled times in which we find ourselves today it fails to take account of other interests at stake , and above all those of the European public .
