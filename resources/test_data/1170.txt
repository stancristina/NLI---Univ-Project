is not sufficient to fight terror .
The United States’ requirements have put airlines in an impossible situation , as the requirements infringe EU privacy protection , or obstruct air transport .
The data-protection commissioners in the Member States and the EU , the Article 29 Committee , point out the worrying lack of data protection .
The work in combating terrorism must be carried out globally and be preventive , but the fight must always be weighed up against respect for the privacy of individuals .
Therefore , we propose instead that a real international agreement between the EU and the United States be drawn up that clearly stipulates purpose , data , guarantees and responsibilities .
We support the collection and handing-over of data on air passengers to the US authorities , but this must be carried out on the basis of clear rules of law ( in the USA and Europe ) , it must be proportionateto the objective , and there must be clear provisions governing which data is collected .
It is regrettable that the personal data of European passengers is being surrendered to the USA without a legal basis , because this means privacy protection being disregarded .
We have voted in favour of items 1 and 10 (adopted by 226 votes to 203 and 233 votes to 207 , respectively ) in the resolution , and in favour of the resolution as a whole (adopted by 229 votes to 202 , with 19 abstentions ) .     In our opinion , the boundaries in matters of public health should as far as possible be drawn at national or local level where individuals themselves cannot make decisions .
I should think that the vast majority of us in this House can see cracks in the EU façade .
Welcome to our Union : refugees are insulted and excluded and run the risk of losing their lives on the way to a better life in Europe .
Women suffer genital mutilation , risk being forced into marriage and suffer abuse daily just for being women .
There is evidence of hatred and violence in the report being presented today .
Islamic fundamentalism is growing strong in the suburbs of our towns and cities .
I should like to conclude by saying that it is regrettable that virtually all Member States are introducing restrictions on the new Member States .
This morning it was Mr Sjöstedt’s report , and now it is this resolution that indirectly concerns the mining and quarrying industry .
It points out the opportunities for these industries , and also the risk of the activity not taking place within a framework of social , environmental and human rights criteria .
It is important that the World Bank bear in mind the criticism levelled by the study , and I note that both the Council President and the Commission agree with many of its recommendations .
Commissioner Vitorino indicated that a certain amount of agreement has been reached on the activities of export credit agencies .
All of that activity was fossil-fuel based ; not a single cent was spent on energy efficiency or renewable energy .
It is quite right , therefore , that we should discuss this issue and endeavour to coordinate the approaches of the EU Member States .
I hope that Mrs  Frassoni will be able to address this matter , too , as part of her work with the other members of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank .
We know that the World Bank has experience in this area , as it said long ago that it is access to resources of this kind that leads to increased conflicts .
There are almost twice the number of farmers in Turkey as there are in all the 15 Member States .
Many positive things have taken place in Turkey in recent years .
We have similar problems in countries like Romania and Bulgaria .
Personally , I think it would be useful for a Muslim , but secularised , country to become a member of the Union , as a bridge between the cultures of Europe and the Arab world .
I am , however , concerned about one item in the report and would gladly have voted against that particular item .
Just like the grounds at present specifically mentioned in Item 9 , abuse within the family also constitutes grounds for seeking asylum , and these must be fully recognised .     Despite promising attempts , current fisheries policy still involves the EU buying the right to abuse the natural resources of the poor .
This is an issue for each country to settle itself .
A common basis of values for the new , enlarged EU is now even more necessary .
All adoption decisions should be made on the basis of what is best for the child .
We have , however , adopted a position whereby the EU should push for women to have access to safe and legal abortions , essential contraceptives and economically accessible services within reproductive and sexual health and sex education .     I have today , together with a majority , voted down this report ( 184 against , 177 in favour and 13 abstentions ) .
Here is an example : in one and the same item there are references to torture on the one hand , which of course must be condemned outright , and demands for the introduction of euthanasia on the other , which is neither an EU issue nor a human rights issue .
The report covers a series of subjects that fall outside the area of competence of the EU and are not covered by the Charter , for example , changing national legislation on marriage between men and women , together with the very concept of the family , or including the extinguishing of life in the form of terminations/abortions under the concept of human rights
