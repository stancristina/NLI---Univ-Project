date , as we know , its main achievement has been to paralyse the Member States and to cause stagnation throughout the European system , which is becoming , in all areas , more and more cumbersome , more and more rigid , and more and more difficult to get moving .
First , the battle for the Constitution , which , we hope , and we are working to that end , will reach the decisive stage of adoption in June at the latest , thanks to the skill and efforts of the Irish Presidency ; it is based on a project in which we can all see the work we have put in , because that project is our own .
You may be sure of one thing : neither my ideas , nor my method , nor , in particular , my availability or my friendship with this Parliament and those who sit here will be affected or changed now that I am Minister of European and Foreign Affairs of the French Republic .
Firstly , the situation of women in the new Member States , which requires special attention .
There is a very great difference between the Commission ’s proposals for 1.24 % of gross domestic income ( GDI) and the 1 % proposed by six States , and regional policy runs the risk of being used as a balancing item for European politics .
Not only must these budget lines be funded , but more especially the Commission must fully realise what its role is in this information policy because all policies must come back to and finish with the citizen .     – Mr President , my congratulations to Commissioner Patten , Commissioner Verheugen and Minister Zuzul , who has worked hard over the last several months to make up the large amount of ground lost by Croatia .
The Commission has assured us today that these conditions have been met in the final version of the Annan plan .
On the first point , the Annan plan raises fundamental objections .
Consequently , we must lodge an appeal on this matter , especially since the European Parliament is now so overloaded with work .     Mr President , various amendments were worthy of consideration , but any amendment would have resulted in a conciliation procedure which would definitely have entailed the risk of a fundamental reassessment and would also have meant equally serious delays .
It cannot be admitted any more clearly than this that a European tax would allow the Union to avoid national scrutiny and to finance its expenditure as it wishes .     Although elected by the inhabitants of the Belgian regions of Wallonia and Brussels , Mr President , I have as usual supported the continuation of European Parliament activities in Strasbourg .
I shall leave it for our French colleagues to respond to the attacks on Strasbourg .
I shall not be intimidated by this manoeuvring and this blackmail on the pretext of restoring the credibility of the European Parliament .     Mr President , the draft plan for the reunification of Cyprus supported by the Commission , and just approved by the European Parliament , simply cannot be right for us .
We must provide ourselves with the means of enforcing the legislation , strengthening the ranks of the inspectors or establishing a European coastguard force .
In Iraq , the blinkered attitude of the Bush administration , producing daily human tragedies , should mean , in this area too , far greater involvement of the European Union so that a real transfer of sovereignty guaranteed by the UN can take place as soon as possible .
Some have been quoted .
None of this , however , can justify our support for a country where the present authorities came to power by means of a military coup and where the most recent elections were held in circumstances condemned by our observers and resulted in the installation of a coalition of supporters of President Musharraf and Islamist fundamentalist religious parties not afraid to express their support for Bin Laden .
The report refers to infringements of this law which could , owing to the feelings of injustice and despair they engender , produce an even more fertile breeding ground for terrorism .
Are the rights to education , mobility and accessibility and the right quite simply to establish a family mere details ?
In that sense I support the rapporteur’s action , particularly as regards reproductive health .     Mr President , after the collapse of the Berlin Wall , many people thought that the end of the cold war meant that we would finally have a world at peace .
Several reports by NGOs condemn flagrant violations : people in prison because of their opinions , political exiles , repeated interrogations , interruption of speakers , arrests , torture , and sometimes disappearances .
I should therefore like to ask you to intervene as a matter of urgency with the Syrian authorities , and ask them to guarantee the integrity of the people I have just referred to , to order their immediate and unconditional release , to put an end to the constant pressure and harassment , to respect international law and to comply with the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the international instruments which have been ratified by Syria .
However , with regard to the central issue , to which Mrs De Keyser had wanted , in a way , to give preference , I think that she has dealt with it rather poorly .
The process is still developing , and it will go on developing .
That is why the Commission wishes to separate the stage involving the integration of the new Member States from the debate on the need to remodel the whole procedure
