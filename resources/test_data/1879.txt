or administrative organs , national law should take priority , as in the case of the European company .
Mr President , Commissioner , there can be no doubt that , especially recently , tourism in Europe is going through a serious crisis , due in part to the Iraqi crisis .
I know that from time to time the Commissioner , Mr Liikanen , also does what he can and what he is allowed to do on the basis of the current legislative framework ; however , there are initiatives which affect the tourism sector and do not fit into a single approach and , at the same time , there is the strange phenomenon that , although we have policy for industry , we do not have policy for the most important part of industry or , in all events , a part which is becoming more and more important , which is tourism .
We are talking about added value at Brussels level .
If you look at the positions taken by Parliament from time to time , your reply is rather neutral .
This is an opportunity for us to make a fresh start on tourism at European level .
The presence of violence is strong everywhere .
From a military point of view , the operations have essentially been completed .
At the present stage , the allied forces are responsible for consolidating security and providing humanitarian aid with the presence of Member States of the European Union ; however , the assistance and support of the international community as a whole are needed for there to be a fast , efficient and operational return to normalcy .
There are plans on the part of the European Union for a grant of EUR 250 million for 2003 .
I should like to express my disgust at the looting and destruction of archaeological treasures , museums and monuments and stress that our immediate objective must be to find the priceless exhibits that have disappeared and seize and return them to the country as and when they appear .
It is precisely the joint objective of contributing to the more general reconstruction of the country which is yet another point of convergence and reason for putting the differences which recently split the Member States on the question of Iraq behind us .
The basic principles governing our action to manage the situation in Iraq , however , remain unchanged .
The appointment by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of a special representative to Iraq is a positive step in this direction .
Similarly today , attention has also been turned to the question of the road map for peace in the Middle East .
The issue of disarming the country must be settled definitively in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations and must be linked to the adoption at broader regional level of an overall and efficient policy for preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
These priorities do not mean that we do not face problems and dangers .
A third issue relates to developments in trans-Atlantic relations .
In the final analysis , it is the stability , security , normalcy and economic development not only of the country but also of the wider area which are put into doubt or which are linked to these developments .
The whole issue is also connected to the credibility of everyone involved in the Iraqi crisis and , consequently , of Europe also .
It is this constructive stance that also appeared in our discussions in Gimnich and which , I believe , can make us more optimistic about the ability of the European Union to finally play a positive and active role at this stage in Iraq .
Secondly , I feel sorry for the European Parliament .
We did not pass a single decision , a single resolution .
They are occupying forces .
That was also clear from most of the speeches today .
It is a disgrace !
It is up to us to roundly condemn the crime .
And finally , for the Iraqi people to be left free to take its fate in its own hands without conquerors .
The third element is the effort and the positions to protect the cultural heritage of Iraq ; this too is positive and I hope there will not be some people , in a few years ' time , who maintain that the stolen exhibits are in various museums , just as the Acropolis marbles are in the British Museum , and that these antiquities or cultural monuments are better protected than they were in the countries in which they originated .
I hope that the experience and problems will lead us to more positive thoughts , will lead the leadership of Europe to more positive prospects .
If certain powers continue to endeavour to give answers to the area with similar variations , be they sultans or maharajas or emirs or puppet political prime ministers , Europe must not allow it .
We 25 came here with an understanding of democracy , freedom and rights .
Mr President , I too should like to express my deepest disappointment at the fact that we proved unable to agree on a joint resolution of the European Parliament , despite the fact that today 's debate shows that there is common ground , that there are the materials to build a common European identity .
Certainly , the collapse of the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein cannot be used to whitewash the Americans and their allies .
I think that , at this stage of the debate , this is much more important than debating internal divisions and a series of other issues which are of course important , but which are not as pressing or urgent as the situation in Iraq .
There are important gaps here which need answers
