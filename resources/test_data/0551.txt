so on .
Parliament now has to vote on the amendments .
Men occupy two-thirds of all jobs in new technology sectors .
Access to the new technologies in all areas must not be confined to helping women to find new jobs .
The ideal situation would be to have Community ‘Immigration ’ liaison officers with their own duties , who are trained and paid by the Union , but unfortunately neither the jurisdiction nor the budget for this yet exists and some States remain unconvinced .
Furthermore , it is crucial that we avoid making a link between immigration and organised crime .
On the other hand , as regards diesel vehicles , I agree with Mrs Honeyball that they should benefit in terms of taxation .
It is acknowledged that involving both sexes in policy development improves policy and makes it more relevant to a varied population .
In the event , and in the absence of a uniform electoral procedure , the European Union has no competence at all to intervene , as this report invites it to do , in defining the rules governing the organisation of the European elections .
Of course , we are disgusted by the absurd and socially unjust development of urban organisation and of the transport system and by its effects upon the environment .
We were very keen to improve a number of legislative texts .
It also promises to have significant medical applications , such as in the treatment of diseases that have so far been incurable , particularly degenerative diseases – cancer or Alzheimer’s disease for example – which are placing an increasing burden on European society in terms of human suffering and in economic terms .
I should also like to stress that funding for research using embryonic stem cells is in addition to funding for research on adult stem cells .
And then we perhaps need to talk about something that no one has yet mentioned , even though I have been listening to the debate from the outset .
We will therefore be voting against any amendment that seeks , on pseudo-ethical grounds , to ban research on stem cells from supernumerary embryos .
These amendments clarify the content of the proposal and thus correspond , as Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel stressed , to the position agreed by Parliament when the framework programme was adopted .
Mr Nisticò , the amendments that you have tabled here are not entirely neutral , however , and this also answers Mrs McNally’s question .
Research is being carried out on imported stem cells that have been traded .
First and foremost , existing cell lines are sufficient and this is the proposal by Mr Liese .
Nor must we forget however , as you stressed , the issue of public support for research and innovation , which remains essential , as does , of course , the whole issue of fundamental research , and I will return to this after the speeches  – which will no doubt provide some responses  – on this European Research Council which is being discussed and formed .
As a result , from 1 January 2004 , it will no longer be necessary for small and medium-sized enterprises to inform the Commission and , therefore , it will be possible for the various States and regions to adopt more individual and specific measures for their small and medium-sized enterprises .
This is an essential process if Europe wants to keep its place in the world , but that requires financing and being given the priority , which is granted to research policy .
As regards the issue of calculating the costs for special financing , the answers vary significantly depending on the choice of the relevant territory .
We therefore support these projects .
If , as we all hope , there are signs of an economic recovery , the Commission must be able to respond so as to take advantage of all of the opportunities likely to benefit its economic and employment policy .
This is one of the public’s major expectations .
Approval also has to be given to efforts to establish sustainable growth through a whole series of initiatives , including , amongst others , the Lisbon objectives and the major public works programmes that are currently being planned .
Lastly , it seems to me that the Commission ’s programme ought to give a higher profile to the issue of sustainable development .
At the next Brussels meeting of the European Council , the Council’s first multiannual programme will be presented .
These are always mentioned when social issues are concerned , but they never enter into play when it is a question of subsidising large European companies or providing military equipment for European defence .     – To justify increasing tax on diesel fuel where it is lower than on petrol , the Commission either puts forward the argument that harmonisation is needed at European level or gives bogus reasons about protecting the environment .
The method proposed to achieve this is research carried out on a competitive basis , which bows more to the commercial interests of private companies .
The report presented to the House by Mr Clegg comes out in favour of taking an additional step in this same direction .
Thirdly and finally , any law must be able to give rise to sanctions .
It is not certain that this wayward trend , while very obviously increasing the Commission ’s supervisory powers , would make an effective contribution to increasing maritime public safety .     Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , it is indeed very important for our fellow citizens that we are able to offer them the best possible security measures in connection with all forms of transport – air , land and sea .
Commissioner , you have in fact completed a piece of work – and a terrific job , at that – in close partnership with the European Parliament .
