we are calling for – together with an immediate end to all political prosecutions – are also victims of the accusation of nepotistic behaviour on the part of the regime .
I also refer to other cases of journalists prosecuted under the same Article .
As we speak , the Turkish authorities are in the final stage of constructing a dam .
I believe that the European Parliament should take a stand on the question of this loss and , given that the Commission 's reply was unsatisfactory , I propose that the President of Parliament write to the Turkish president calling for a halt to work to complete the dam , which will result in the definitive loss of a piece of European cultural heritage .     – Mr President , the Gdansk shipyards , for the benefit of the previous speakers , where the 25th anniversary of the start of the Solidarity strikes in 1980 was celebrated , employed 6 000 workers .
Unemployment exceeds 15 % .
All social achievements have been eroded .
The leaders deceived the workers .
As far as democracy in Poland is concerned , let me quote you just one statistic : 20 % voted in the last European elections .
Why does the Council insist on ignoring the Convention on the Rights of the Child and persist in discriminating against 17-year-olds ?
Is it perhaps because the rate of refugees is increasing or perhaps because we have a deluge on the European borders ?
Fear seeks scapegoats and the easy scapegoats are the persecuted of this world .
The international conventions we talk about here bear the stamp of European humanitarianism and we cannot , on the basis of fear , insecurity and even sometimes racism , attack and violate our own humanitarian borders .
In Greece , for example , it is less than 1 % of applicants and last year the number of asylum applications plummeted .
We consider that the amendments by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , with the exception of the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , are gratuitously critical of the directive in that , to all intents and purposes , they accept the basic anti-refugee approach .
This agreement might indeed be considered as one of the most long-winded international sectoral trade agreements , given that issues have been pending since 1983 .
First , protected names are not adequately safeguarded , it would appear , in the agreement , while the recognition given to the wine-making practices of the USA , allowing 7 % water to be added or for wines to be matured with wood shavings in the barrel , which are not of course a health hazard , jeopardises the reputation of wine as a quality product .
Fourthly , the procedure to safeguard recognition of the 17 names in Annex 2 needs to be speeded up , so that all protected European names are strictly protected by the American authorities .
Parliament and its comments will , I think , help in this direction .     . – Mr President , we simply changed places because Mr Galeote will be along later .
For its part , the European Parliament will indeed do what it can in its negotiations with the Council to ensure that this principle of territorial cohesion is promoted through the regulations on the Structural Funds .
I should like to say that the ratification of the Constitution , in relation to the principle of territorial cohesion , will give us many more tools than we presently have at our disposal for proceeding beyond regional policy and seeing territorial cohesion within the framework of competition policy , within the framework of the transport policy of the European Union and so on .
That is the huge wager before us and I think that both Parliament and the Commission need to make every possible effort not to waste valuable time and to ensure that the European Union acquires the Constitutional Treaty to which it is entitled and which it deserves .     – Mr President , I am delighted that we have the opportunity today to debate and vote on two important reports on the regional policy of the Union .
The services which the European Commission insists on liberalising ?
How can a private individual replace the state as a general interest service provider ?
Obviously , we are proceeding with a firm step , in this instance , towards both the decline of the citizens in outermost areas who expect a service of general interest , and of the workers who risk finding themselves unemployed in the Community of the future .
Territorial cohesion is desirable but on the right bases , bases which relate to social opinion , not on the basis of market pressures .     – Mr President , I wish to refer to the report by Mr Marques , whom I warmly congratulate on the work he has done .
The European Union is the country of solidarity .
We need to give them solace .
They are doing us a favour by living there under these difficult conditions and we must return the favour .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is an undisputed fact that , without economic , social and territorial cohesion between the regions of the Union , we shall be unable to meet the internal and external challenges which we face .
The role and importance of territorial cohesion must not , under any circumstances , be downgraded .
It is precisely on this point that we consider that the policy of liberalisation , of so-called 'free competition' , has created a situation of unaccountability which , among other things , makes victims both of its passengers and the workers themselves .
