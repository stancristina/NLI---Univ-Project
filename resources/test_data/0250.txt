Moreover , our proposals will include these , and they must be discussed in both Parliament and the Council .
The few overarching objectives the programme now contains are generally known , and so they should be .
I cannot approve the incorporation of other objectives into the programme , as has been done in Amendments Nos 17 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 34 and 42 .
We thus have a stable platform for future work and cooperation .
We can perhaps meet the deadline for some isolated thematic strategy , but scarcely for all of them .
I must inform Parliament that I am opposed to most of the amendments concerning chemicals .
Regarding the proposal that the REACH Register should include all existing substances and that all products , unlike substances and preparations , should be labelled , all I can say is that it would be practically impossible .
They differ considerably from one another , depending upon how flexibly they are adapted to different situations and objectives .
In addition to those I mentioned earlier , the Commission is able to support Amendments Nos 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 39 and 45 , together with parts of Amendments Nos 43 , 46 and 47 .
No repetition of the debate is required because her amendments have been carefully selected , something which bodes well for the next step in the procedure .
Mr President , I must not be especially critical , but try to look ahead to a future White Paper rather than discuss the rather odd draft Green Paper .
These account for more than half of the consignments transported on our roads and consume an incredible amount in terms of resources , despite our perhaps not even thinking of them as products .
The designation , 'intellectual services ' should be specified .
In Sweden , framework agreements concerning , for example , architectural , medical , auditing , banking and consultancy services are quite usual .
It is desirable that public contracts should not be awarded to economic operators who have belonged to criminal organisations or have been guilty of acts involving corruption or fraud .
I have voted in favour of the committee ' s proposals for increased threshold values to force public contracts , especially for goods and services , to be awarded at European level .
Not only European integration but the growing together of Europe has its first roots in the sea voyages of antiquity which took merchants and explorers from the east coast of the Mediterranean to the North Atlantic and to the British Isles .
The merchant shipping sector is , for example , of strategic importance to the economic well-being of the European Union .
Third-country nationals who might not be as highly educated and trained as their EU colleagues are employed instead .
Modern technologies are not used enough to improve living and working conditions on board .
I encourage , therefore , the building of networks between the academic institutions for seafarers ' education and training .
I urge Member States and social partners to exploit fully all possibilities of funding , such as the European Social Fund , Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes .
Employment and training of seafarers depends closely on the market conditions of the maritime transport sector .
These accidents are mostly caused by human error .
There is a clear need to safeguard the employment of EU seafarers on board and on shore , to preserve the maritime know-how in the Community , to develop maritime skills and to improve the safety of maritime transport .
But you clearly know that the Commission has a big role to play in this area .
The fact that our borders are becoming ever more open is basically something to be welcomed , of course , but the downside of this is that smuggling , including drug smuggling , is on the increase .
Mr President , I am well aware of Mr Oostlander ' s problems in arriving at a balanced view .
To embrace a permissive attitude towards so-called soft drugs would be devastating .
We are able to accept Amendments Nos 32 and 36 .
It stands to reason that it should be completely obvious .
We do not want citizens to be divided into an A team and a B team .
During the conciliation negotiations , there were several occasions on which I specifically emphasised the road safety aspect , which I think is important for those governments which are to administer this legislation in the future .
The second directive , on information and consultation , is a kind of framework agreement providing a legal basis that is important to workers ' being able to demand information and consultation rights .
We can adopt directives which are sound and well-intentioned in many ways , but when they are then actually put into effect we know that we cannot , in this House , do very much .
Nor do I believe that the governments of the Member States can do very much .
It is difficult to know what goes on behind closed factory gates .
Mr President , I want to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for their work on two important directives .
Just as Mr Schmid says , this is also a road safety issue and , from that point of view , it makes no difference whether the person driving is employed or self-employed .
I can add a fourth .
Well now , that is true .
Finally , I again want to thank the rapporteurs for two good directives .
What we are now discussing is energy efficiency .
If the necessary objectives are to be achieved , political initiatives are required that include both
