quite clear about this - because xenophobia and racism do exist in our societies , in all our countries .
If we have to accept the fact , for reasons of the sovereignty of States , that these political movements might hold governmental positions in our States , I have to say in all honesty that , in my opinion , a political movement that uses xenophobia as a means of winning votes and gaining power does not have the same set of values that I do .
Of course , with regard to the decisions of the fourteen Member States on relations between their governments and the Austrian Government , a procedure is currently being defined which will enable us to reassess these decisions when the time it right .
The Commission proposal has a legal basis taken from the Amsterdam Treaty , and its content and wording take account of the institutional constraints that I have just mentioned .
To clarify our position : Amendments Nos 3 and 4 can be accepted , as the changes they make to the wording avoid any contradiction with other provisions of the regulation .
Finally , the Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 6 .
- ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during the LIFE III second reading debate held here back in February , we concluded that this regulation was better than the LIFE I and LIFE II regulations .
These areas were the budget , comitology , provision for a fourth stage of LIFE and the objectives of LIFEÂ­Environment .
In any event , we told the Commission and the Council once again that , as far as Parliament is concerned , although these appropriations are more than the common position provided for , they still fall short of the sum that LIFE has demonstrated it deserves .
Whatever today ' s policies may be , they must reflect this new philosophy of a relationship between mankind and society with the environment .
It is undeniably important for LIFE to be adopted .
It seems pointless at this juncture to make threats , to proclaim Parliament ' s power or to put forward all of our views at once .
Taking the appropriations for payment as a point of reference , in 2000 these totalled 1.11 % of the gross national product of the Member States , but a lower amount is being proposed for 2001 , corresponding to 1.0 % .
I could also give my support to the legal separation of the management of railway infrastructures from the provision of transport services .
Furthermore , liberalisation must not lead to necessary lines being closed , to unemployment or to safety standards and the quality of service falling .
While water , electricity , telephone and supermarket bills are also shown in euros , I regard that as a mathematical exercise of limited usefulness .
Schools are nerve centres for information and have a multiplier effect , so they must be used in the most appropriate , simple and effective way possible .
The directive , which applied to various financial sectors , including banks , insurance companies , and so forth , is to be extended to other non-financial activities and professions which are nevertheless extremely vulnerable to money laundering .
Because the world is becoming ever more sophisticated , many organised crime syndicates can take advantage of legal loopholes and differences between legislation in the Member States to exploit anomalies between the various systems .
In any case , one important and central issue , that is the growing liberalisation of financial markets and movements of capital , is not addressed , which means that the practical effects of this liberalisation will continue to be weakened .
In view of this we fundamentally and above all reject the prospect of cuts in the cooperation policy , as implied in the Commission ' s preliminary draft .
Furthermore , some of the amendments made in the final vote limited and even changed its scope .
( PT ) I was unable to make the speech I had prepared during the sitting itself for lack of time .
The agreement reached represents a limited step forward as far as the guarantees involved are concerned , but it is positive in terms of what it offers for the future by way of security .
On the one hand , privacy protection authorities have considered that the most effective means of reducing unacceptable risks to privacy , while recognising the need for effective law enforcement , is that traffic data should in principle not be kept only for law enforcement purposes .
The e-Europe draft Action Plan , prepared by the Commission and very recently adopted by the Santa Maria da Feira Summit of the European Council , includes the establishment of a coordinated and coherent approach to cyber-crime by the end of 2002 in order to ensure greater cooperation on these key issues .
Nobody has yet found the right answer .
I share your view that the question of having a strategy for encryption at European level is a key tool in enhancing security in the use of the Internet .
In several areas of the European Union , the forests are often the only viable economic option , because of poor soil or the lack of other natural resources .
Despite the fact that the European Union ' s forestry strategy is a step forward in terms of ideas , it is yet to have any practical expression .
Forests are , furthermore , an imaginary , mythological and symbolic asset , which we should not forget .
This regulation is specifically aimed at the cofinancing of systems for the prevention , monitoring and provision of information about fires , as well as for identifying their causes .
