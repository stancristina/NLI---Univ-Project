suspicion of asylum seekers and immigrants from third countries .
A blue bond , Mr President .
Mr President , this is an important and symbolic vote .
I shall just take up the most symbolic and outstanding of them .
And Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today this banner of fundamental rights , this European flag , is a blue standard symbolizing the bond which extends across the European Union , from Las Palmas to Malmo and from Rhodes to Dublin .
So our group firmly supports the amendment calling on the Council to adopt the necessary measures to prevent any national of a Member State accused of terrorism or collaboration with an armed group obtaining refugee status in another Member State .
The men , women and children who die like that only make the news once they are dead .
In the name of these things , they assassinate , kidnap , torture , and end people 's lives indiscriminately - as Mr Alonso Puerta mentioned - people like Enrique Casas , a politician , Tom√°s y Valiente and so many other members of the security forces , and ordinary citizens whose lives have been destroyed just by chance .
I congratulate the rapporteur on that .
But let me highlight two points in this report which I consider fundamental .
Without adequate infrastructure , many terrorist acts might not come about and , that is why we need to extend criminal responsibility to those who collaborate with terror .
In a democratic society like Europe , all projects must be lawful and defensible , and progress peacefully with popular support .
As the text of the resolution emphasizes , police action is not enough to resolve deep-seated conflicts in our society .
In Spain two citizens are being held captive at this very moment by the terrorist group ETA.
Throughout the political history of the West , the acquisition of citizenship has always been linked to existence of an ideological and cultural community .
Finally , examination of Community cultural action goes beyond existing direct programmes - Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael , which certainly deserve praise and encouragement - and involves any administrative and financial act which has any repercussions on culture .
But I do not subscribe to the new text that Mr Perry proposes for paragraph 18 , which deals with investment in works of art to adorn public construction projects and is the result of an intelligent amendment by Mr Aparicio .
You will not hear European culture mentioned without someone immediately adding 'based on diversity and respect for the plurality of cultures ' .
His rigorous and erudite approach , demonstrated in his five minute summary before I spoke , exemplifies European thought .
We therefore await the culmination of the work and we encourage the Commission to continue with the effort logically required by any attempt to transform habits which are still very deep-rooted in the various countries , and to establish a clear Community standard .
Of course , there are many causes .
We consider these European databases , this European 'bibliometry ' , essential now unless we want to end up running a branch office of the United States and have no identity of our own .
The demoralization of the citizens , and indeed their defencelessness against the slow progress of the procedures , does nothing either for European construction or the extension of the sense of citizenship which ought to accompany the magnificent adventure of sharing such a wide , rich and plural common area .
The Commission is the guardian of the treaty , but the governments are responsible for applying the law and monitoring its strict fulfilment .
In respect of the vote which we have just held on the Fisheries Council , my Group welcomes approval of Amendment No 5 tabled by the GUE/NGL Group , but I am personally upset that Amendment No 7 tabled by the same Group was not approved .
I congratulate him on his appointment .
There is little sense in this interference and it weakens Thursday 's vote on the motion of censure .
So on behalf of my group and the 71 Members of Parliament who have tabled the motion of censure , I put it to you , with the full agreement of the Group of the European Radical Alliance , that the voting on the motions for resolutions should take place after the vote on the motion of censure .
I hope the new directive governing the liberalization of the gas market will soon be before this House , and what happens in the Russian Federation is therefore of paramount importance to us .
From the environmental point of view , I consider it urgent to carry out prior environmental impact assessments and ecoauditing for all measures promoted under the Energy Treaty in the existing installations , so as to correct the massive deterioration that exists - and not in the eastern countries alone , but in our countries too .
We note with concern that the gap between the more developed regions and the less developed regions of the European Union , far from narrowing , is tending to increase .
You have highlighted two important points in your report which could also be applied to other States .
In fact , in implementing the programmes , the Commission concentrates priority action on the environment in terms of legislation and regulations .
Their deterioration would make growth unsustainable .
Madam President , Madam Commissioner , to avoid repetition , I will just emphasize a few points : First , I note that the results of the cohesion policies in terms of regional development are positive overall .
I end by congratulating Mr Hatzidakis on his excellent report .
I think that is the report 's objective framework .
We must not expect things of this report that it cannot and should not provide .
