that , despite repeated appeals , by both my fellow Member Mr Korakas and me , still no representations have been made to the Turkish authorities .
So the message which we should send out from the House today is that we need more efficient administration on all sides , especially on the part of the Member States and regions and , of course , we need incentives , such as the performance reserve , so that we can use European taxpayers ' money more efficiently .
I therefore think that we need to concentrate resources , we need to make better use of resources , we need to call for better administration both on the part of the Commission and of the Member States and regions ; however , that must not cause us to forget one basic fact : that more people will want a slice of the cake after enlargement and as far as I am concerned , Commissioner , it is vital that we increase the size of the cake , that we increase the resources of the Structural Funds after 2006 .
As Mr Naïr rightly said , the European Union only appears to be interested in the Mediterranean for reasons of security and only intervenes economically in order to gain a foothold on the markets in the southern countries .
The Communist Party of Greece defends collaboration between people on equal terms and without one country 's interfering in the internal affairs of another .
Mr President , today we are debating two reports which are political reports par excellence and with which I fully concur .
Europa was Zeus 's wife , the mother of Minos , Sarpedon and Radamanthe .
We need to get a few things straight .
There are Europeans on the other side of the Mediterranean and we would do well to remember that .
Surely , everyone involved in this issue will want to give praise where praise is due , i .e . to the European Parliament and , of course , the Commission , for the simple reason that they have been urging the Council for years to take the action which it has , I think , now been forced to take - action which will certainly benefit European citizens , consumers , rail passengers and rail freight customers .
I should like to close , Mr President , with a wish : that from now on the Council will operate with greater transparency , that it will talk to the rapporteurs early on , that it will attend European Parliament committees not simply to strengthen the role of the European Parliament but so that faster decisions can be taken , faster than the 16 kilometres an hour which is the present average speed of the railways .
I refer to coordination and control .
Other Members have raised the same point .
What is to be done with the meat and bone meal which has to be destroyed ?
But what I do not know is how they can be reliably destroyed or , more to the point , how the costs can be covered .
Proposals for covering the cost as the budget now stands and with the financial perspectives which you support there are none .
Madam President , may I congratulate Mrs ÏáToole on her report , which throws into relief the dramatic changes which have taken place in the world of books over recent years as the result of new technologies .
To the question of whether books should be protected from uncontrolled market forces we say yes , given the huge cultural importance of books and reading in our society , which we must strengthen as much as we can .
But all the Member States should facilitate access for the young to books and encourage them to read during their education , because it is they who represent the future of the European Union and there can be no future without books , be they in hard or soft copy .
The motion calls for measures to abolish malfunctions in the application of the system of mutual judicial assistance , strengthen the role and extend the powers of the Court of Justice , set up a European Public Prosecutor 's Office , speed up the harmonisation of the criminal legislation of the Member States and so forth .
Except that we should add " ...for the new order of things , in the post-EMU era" .
And who exactly is talking about organised crime and terrorism ?
We agree that organised crime must be combated .
Madam President , I should very briefly like to welcome a new Member of the European Parliament , Yiannis Patakis , who comes from the same town as I do .
They met the political groups and raised the question of their lost relatives for the umpteenth time , but purely from a humanitarian point of view .
At the same time , however , the European Union has to monitor and react to legislation introduced by international organisations and , more to the point , it has to do so instantly , so that the Member States do not appear to be shirking their international obligations .
Consequently , the European Union needs rationally organised and centralised powers for maritime safety policy .
All other existing committees dealing with related matters will be disbanded .
At the same time , however , the European Commission has opted for a procedure which ensures that it has the right to decide whether an international amendment to the regulations raises or lowers maritime safety standards .
Finally , the purpose of the proposal for a directive is to amend existing directives in order to incorporate the Committee on Safe Seas .
Finally , I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for their highly constructive comments and unanimous support for my draft report
