In addition , I ask the Commissioner to address specifically in her reply our additional demands for application of the principles of the directive in the policies and programmes of the EU itself .
Second , to give public authorities the right to require companies to demonstrate compliance with anti-discrimination in awarding contracts .
Third , on the importance of statistical monitoring , if we are genuinely to combat discrimination .
Finally , I offer my sincere congratulations to Kathalijne Buitenweg for her work and I thank her for her cooperation in bringing this before Parliament .
Members should all acknowledge the campaign by the anti-racist movement throughout Europe .
National groups such as the UK Race and Europe Network in my country , the European Network against Racism and , in particular , the Starting Line group have worked for 20 years to get this legislation and for them today is still simply the beginning .
Mr President , I want to add my voice to those Members calling for the swift passage of this legislation through Parliament .
This is a Parliament with a proud record .
Since the 1980s we have led on action and on initiatives to combat racism , xenophobia and discrimination .
We now have , in the Buitenweg report , a unique opportunity to see those efforts incorporated into a package of legislation and an action plan .
I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs to extend the proposal to cover institutional racism .
We , too , believe that we have to see a ban on incitement to racism .
Groups and anti-racist organisations in my region , in the North-West of England , are eagerly awaiting this legislation .
For some of them , victims of racism , action cannot come quick enough and PPE pleading on respecting parliamentary procedure , I am afraid , will fall on deaf ears in my region ' s organisations .
Racism is on the rise again .
We all have our local examples .
For example , in Liverpool an Asian scriptwriter was attacked , his car forced off the road and local thugs then tried to impale him on a fence spike .
So vicious was this attack that Merseyside police called for an urgent press conference .
The Jewish community in North Manchester are persistently the subject of victimisations and racism , their property defaced and they are subjected to racial threats and abuse .
This has to stop .
This is why it is vital that Europe gives a strong public statement on racism and discrimination backed up by legislative action to ban this and to extend the scope of legal redress by shifting the burden of proof from the victim to the racist and allied groups and organisations to bring race discrimination cases to courts across the EU.
In voting through this report and its recommendations , this Parliament can give a strong signal that it is prepared to be tough on racism and tough on the causes and perpetrators of racism .
Those parties which seek to legitimise and promote racism and discrimination through the ballot box , and we have examples in many countries , should take note of this directive and incorporate the recommendations and its legal force in their own constitutions .
Firstly , I want to congratulate the Commission on this text .
It is a good text .
Many of the basic principles we wanted to see are in it .
I also congratulate the Portuguese Presidency because they have pushed this through and given it their political clout to make sure we get it on the statute book because , as Mrs McCarthy has just said , people who are victims of racism cannot wait until all the procedures are sorted out .
They want this legislation quickly and they want it now .
That is why it is important that we vote this afternoon .
It is important legislation .
In the context of what has happened in Austria , it becomes even more important .
There are a few things which would add to and strengthen the text .
Two things I would like to highlight : Amendment No 29 , which tries to make sure that there is no hiding place for racism , no hiding place behind considerations of religion , considerations of belief and considerations of nationality .
We need to make sure that these are not just covers for racism .
The second amendment , which is important , is the amendment on incitement to racial discrimination which is as important as the act of racism itself , and I hope the Commission will take it on board .
My own committee , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , thought it particularly important that we make sure that the applicant states are aware of the legislation and are in a position to implement it as soon as possible .
I hope the Commission will make sure in the Action Programme , proposed to accompany this package , that we have a lot of projects from the applicant states .
This directive will have a direct impact on the lives of many constituents of mine in Yorkshire , people from ethnic minorities and many thousands of people across Europe .
It is very important that we get it through today .
I hope that at the end of the afternoon we will have no more shenanigans , no more delays and we will make sure we get the vote at 6 p.m. so that we can get it through before the end of the Portuguese Presidency .
I am delighted to have been able to work with Mrs Buitenweg .
She has done an excellent and inclusive job producing a balanced text , which usefully strengthens
