We have not come here to establish relations between our two continents , but to recognise that these relations have existed for a long time , and that any attempt to improve them should start with an attempt to understand them as a whole .
Bloodshed was dividing our peoples and pitting brother against brother .
Now , 21 years later , I am returning to Europe , and like Fray Luis de Le√≥n when he came out of four years in prison , I feel compelled to start with ' As we were saying yesterday ... ' , because in many respects we need to pick up where we left off .
Today I would like to give you the perspective from down on the plains .
The Association Agreement between Central America and the European Union , which may be the first agreement between regions that the European Union concludes , is the closest , clearest and most immediate opportunity that Europe has to revitalise its presence in Latin America .
If we reach an agreement on the basis of these assumptions , Europe would be making a giant leap to benefit the people of Central America , but also of Europe , because in times of international crisis , Europe could benefit greatly from an economy that has been growing at approximately twice the rate of the European economy over the last five years .
The developed nations of the world must not support , with aid and resources , the decision of those who prefer to equip their soldiers rather than educate their children .
There is just one more thing that I would like to mention , and it is something that also has to do with violence and destruction , but not only against human beings , but against all forms of life .
We are leading an international crusade against global warming , and today I humbly ask you to join us in it .
I believe it is time to leave the pendulum set at union , to take the path once again that the winds took 180 million years ago , before the first crack appeared on earth , when Europe was joined to America , and it would have been possible to walk from Paris to New York .
It is worth making special mention of the commitment made by all the public authorities to eradicate violence against women and on the role that advertising and marketing should play in this process .
For example , it insists on the fact that the Council , by adopting the above-mentioned Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures , has committed itself to doing so as part of a comprehensive approach , which should have room for tools such as human rights and democracy clauses , the system of generalised preferences and development aid .
A few notes , a few strains of mistrust towards free competition , free enterprise , and the possibility of citizens receiving services through society itself via the free economy .
It is important for the European Union to take the initiative on this in all of its trade agreements , especially when we are seeing the collapse - which we do not know whether it is temporary or permanent - of the Doha Round , and of the multilateral framework as a whole in this area .
In this context it is worth mentioning the advances in navigation technologies , logistical telecommunications and exploitation , the commitment to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases , securing new investment and the need to bring training up to date for the staff that manage and deal with these aspects .
We need the port authorities to cooperate with each other and with the local and regional authorities and transport sector associations , not only maritime and river transport , but also rail , air and road transport .
We welcome the fact there is to be a European Maritime Day on 20 May each year , with an open day to help the public gain a better understanding of the work and importance of the port sector for our lives and our well-being .
I also welcome the fact that emphasis is placed on using the existing rail traffic networks which are being freed up as a result of the progress made with high-speed passenger trains , and can be specifically dedicated to freight transport .
We should not forget that the risks threatening this finite and non-renewable resource affect , to a greater or lesser extent , the whole territory of all the Member States of the European Union , including significant cross-border effects .
In this way , the Member States would have a specific regulation to protect the soil , not only with the aim of protecting the environment , but also to fight against climate change and the deforestation and desertification that are occurring .
However , we also call for the political tensions to be eased within the relevant institutions , which are the ones that still have the capacity to do so at the moment .
However , our issue with Iran is not just about stoning , but about the very existence of the death penalty because the number of people executed in Iran is still one of the highest in the world .
Please note that in this amendment we also include Mr Hutchinson 's oral amendment , in which he also asked for the opposition members to be included .
We are succeeding .
The Committee lacks resources .
Yet this is how Europe will be strengthened .
We currently have a number of petitions such as the petition for a single seat for the European Parliament , which has been signed by one and a half million citizens : we demand the right to process that petition , a right which has not been granted by the Bureau of Parliament
