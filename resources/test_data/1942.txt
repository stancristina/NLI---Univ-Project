At this point , Commissioner , I wanted to ask you three questions , but given your reply , I will ask two .
Or , should we then talk about the violation of international law in the form of the claims made by Abu Ali in our institution a few days ago , when he defined Hamas as a normal and general political force , rather than as a factor contributing to international terrorism ?
So then , let us avoid this .     Mr President , Commissioner Liikanen , ladies and gentlemen , I must admit that not just in Mr Turchi’s speech , with which we certainly agree , but also in the speeches by Mrs Morgantini and Mr Laschet , I detect a different mood from what we have seen to date .
It is by imagining that it can that we continue , for example , mistakenly to posit the national State of Palestine as the problem we have to resolve on behalf of the Palestinians and the Israelis .
I would therefore ask that this minority opinion that does not appear in the final text be reinstated into the report .
We can therefore see why we do not enforce the rules : because we are already preparing to adopt those mechanisms which infringe privacy .
We should therefore clarify whether we are also conferring powers of investigating judges , which I hope is not the case , or only powers of adjudicating judges .
Four hundred and ninety thousand people would lose their jobs , in terms of workers in the industry and 10 000 holding owners who , leaving aside the temporary receipt of a payment decoupled from production , would in any case lose their jobs as the lack of economically viable agricultural alternatives in tobacco-producing areas has been amply demonstrated ; there would therefore be multitudes of newly unemployed people in the European regions which already have the highest unemployment rates of the current 15 Member States of the Union , and the same would happen in the tobacco-producing regions of the ten new acceding countries , also in view of the fact that over 50 % of workers in the European processing industry are women .
With regard to the aid system , in our view , the extreme variability of socio-economic and environmental conditions suggests that we should make the decoupled percentage flexible , starting from a minimum of 60 % in any case .
I have examined other Member’s amendments .
Moreover , I cannot understand why , unlike all the other production sectors for which specific production-related payments have been maintained , or where the Member States have been given the opportunity to implement partial forms of decoupling , the tobacco sector is the only one where the Commission has decided to apply total decoupling .
Health reasons , among others , have been cited , ignoring the fact that dismantling the production of tobacco in Europe will not contribute in the slightest to combating smoking .
It is difficult to think this , and not to think instead that 500 000 jobs are being put in jeopardy in Europe .
The choice to make the decoupling percentage flexible , the possibility that the national States will have , I hope , to modify these percentages , is a positive process of osmosis between the rigid rules of the Commission and the choices of the Member States , an intelligent decision which will allow the national governments to adopt the most appropriate options for the regions .
I would conclude by calling on President Prodi , having taken note of Parliament’s opinion , which we hope will be favourable tomorrow , to steer the forthcoming new mandate of the European Commission in this direction .     Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , I will not repeat what my fellow Member , Mr Lavarra has already said – because I fully agree with his report on olive oil – but I wanted to say a few things about the question of tobacco .
There are no suitable , economical alternatives because tobacco is grown on small holdings .
On the other hand , the Commission has been more sensible with regard to olive oil .
Raised by whom ?
Lastly , you were absolutely right when you claimed that the key to early agreement is political will .
His brother Magomed Minister for Defence , gave himself up to avoid further bloodshed .
We are going to put a question to the Council straightaway , but I think it is our duty to at least react to these methods .
Now we need to make an additional effort to rise above the obstacles which concern , above all , qualified majority voting .
In fact , we are at an historic turning point and not just because the reunification of Europe makes a constitutional charter both more difficult and more necessary , but also because the next Parliament will see a significant generational replacement of the parliamentary groups which created the European Community .
Nevertheless , we do not support harsh discriminatory treatment to the detriment of tobacco growing expressly based on a ‘prohibitionist ’ approach to the smoking phenomenon .
For someone like me who lived through – albeit in the privileged position of foreign correspondent – the hard years of the communist dictatorship and who then went back to cover Poland as rapporteur , this is an important , and I would even go so far as to say , an emotional moment .
Now of course it needs to be watched , spurred on and monitored , but it should also be encouraged , and this is why the reprobative tone which Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne used in her report was excessive .
In foreign policy , the issue of relations with Croatia remains open : there has recently
