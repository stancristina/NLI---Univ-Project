Basically , they institutionalise the EU Member States ' refusal to participate in initiatives to accept or apply amendments to international conventions or resolutions , their obligations as contracting parties to international law notwithstanding .
This will lead to distinctions being made outside generally accepted principles and this in itself is fraught with dangerous consequences for the basic safety of shipping in practice .
We believe that a policy based on protecting the safety of ships , passengers , crews and the environment must , first and foremost , fight the unaccountability of shipowners , apply strict sanctions against those who violate the law , which is being flagrantly flouted time and time again , with impunity , within the framework of the ÉÌÏ and international conventions .
I think that it is only to be expected that the House should unite almost unanimously behind the report presented by Mr Bakopoulos , whom I should like to congratulate on his work , first , because the aim of the Commission 's proposal is to replace the five existing committees dealing with safety at sea with one committee , thereby cutting the red tape and , secondly because , in its legislative proposal , the Commission grasps the opportunity and safeguards the right to decide when an amendment to international regulations raises or lowers maritime safety standards .
Having said which , Commissioner , I think that the presence of everyone here today proves not so much that we agree with Mr Bakopoulos 's report , which goes without saying , but that we are most concerned about the issue of safety at sea .
Once again , my congratulations to Mr Bakopoulos .
This double proposal clearly seeks to facilitate the implementation of amendments to conventions by the Member States of the Union and , of course , by having just one committee , to improve efficiency in the implementation of safety policy .
The rapporteur and the parliamentary committee have , I think , supported this effort by tabling amendments which improve and supplement the proposal and which we hope Parliament will accept .
Within this debate , I think that the role of the European Parliament , which is where all the currents and all the trends in Europe officially exist side by side , must be an important one .
And because today 's debate , apart from anything else , has been full of poetry , drama and references to the axioms of older civilisations , allow me to close by referring to a political figure in Europe who is familiar to you all .
Mr President , as the honourable Members have said , some of the directives were obviously adopted in times of full employment and very slow change .
We recently saw over 5 000 jobs lost in a single month as the result of takeovers .
The first is forecasting .
We reckon that , with the undertakings made by the Swedish Presidency and following the Belgian Presidency , significant changes will be made to the legislative framework .
The third strand is specific policy .
But we cannot just ask workers to change their behaviour , which is why companies too have a new role in this area .
With the new technologies available , artists are now looking more than ever to the European Union to deal with this issue at Community level .
We also have to take care with libraries and archives because , if we make various amendments here , we will end up infringing intellectual property rights .
Also , in order to break the general thrust of his reply a little , can the interventions to deal with the extremely serious environmental repercussions for the people in the area be quantified and specified ?
Is that what you meant ?
These shells have been used in tens of thousands of military exercises and have exploded in the air , not just in the water .
What can I say ?
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Your reply was most satisfactory .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Turkey has been offered a partnership agreement and , from a procedural point of view , it is right that we should now give this partnership agreement a legal basis , even though Turkey has not yet presented a national programme which will allow us to judge just how far it is prepared to assimilate the various points of the partnership agreement .
Turkey 's candidacy puts not just Turkey , but the European Union to the test .
The opinion which , I think , prevails among most European citizens , is that a different religion should not be an obstacle to the accession of a new member .
I stress substantive acceptance because Turkey has not refused to accept democracy formally ; hardly anyone in the world today does .
Turkey creates the impression , following the European Council 's gesture in December 1999 , which was welcomed joyfully by the Turkish people , that it is moving away from - rather than towards - a substantive democracy .
The tragedy provoked when the security forces stormed the jails caused public outrage .
We expect words of reconciliation on Cyprus ; instead all we hear is the clang of arms .
Herein lies the power of Great Europe and anyone who wants to share in Europe 's greatness must truly espouse its principles ; otherwise the door to Europe will remain firmly closed .
And , if you believed your own declarations on democracy and human rights , declarations which come thick and fast , you would not spend a single euro of the European Union taxpayers ' money supporting a military regime which crassly tramples all over human rights .
The funding proposed by the Council and basically supported in
