A second reason is that this report leads to more bureaucracy , while we in Europe need less of it .
Mr President , at the moment , there are certainly more than 30 000 demonstrators outside this Parliament building , which is where I have just been .
With this compromise , Parliament is only displaying its political lack of power and soon , workers , consumers and the environment will be at the receiving end of this lack of power .
I am also indebted to the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
Very often , the Services Directive is seen as giving to the phasing out of workers ’ labour conditions and to wage cuts , and in some countries – quite a number in fact – incidents have been reported lately that are the result of fraudulent practices .
We have seen examples with Laval in Sweden , Struik Foods in Belgium , and Irish Ferries , but there are many more .
I think it would be good if these could be deleted from the directive after all .
The potential for creating 600 000 jobs is not something we can simply ignore .
We should not now get bogged down by small print .
The failure to invite them is simply not an acceptable way of working .
For that reason , ...     Madam President , I support the gist of the directive , subject to the restrictions on which the two major groups have agreed .
The directive is not about the working conditions of temporary staff , for those are provided for in the Temporary Employment Directive .
It turned out to be beneficial for the new Member States , but I warn you that the social unrest it may cause may mean that we will go from bad to worse , and the directive would not only lead to social unrest , it would also undo the good work .
We should not lose sight of the directive’s objective , which is to break down unnecessary barriers for small and medium-sized companies , enabling them to offer their services in other countries .
A compromise that intends to batten up the markets even more will not receive my vote .     Mr President , since the compromise that is before us is in the spirit of the best Dutch tradition of combining open markets with a reasonable level of social protection , it enjoys the full support of my delegation .
Along with many others , I fear that we are not .
What would cause more prejudice against Islam – the publication of a few caricatures , or images of Islamic hostage takers who cut the throats of their victims in front of the camera ?
We should also draw lessons from this for the negotiations with Turkey , because Turkey can never become a European Member State , simply because it is not a European country , and also because the basic principles of Islam are incompatible with the European values of freedom , separation of church and state and gender equality .
The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and of weapons of mass destruction is in the balance .
On the one hand , we hear from the Supreme Leader Khamenei very reassuring words about the use of weapons of mass destruction being prohibited in Islam ; it is in line with this that Iranian leaders claim to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear energy .
If we are shocked today – as we rightly are – by Teheran’s barbaric execution of minors , at the same time as it plays a leading role in the smear campaign against Denmark , should we not also question the human rights situation in the large Islamic country Saudi Arabia , which is claimed to be the USA’s major ally and hence ours too ?
The threat to use nuclear bombs , as is being publicly considered by the French President , is even more dangerous .
We feel , though , that the emphasis in the proposed resolution is too much on a different type of approach which fits in with the regrettably widespread opinion in Europe that , since the 1992-1995 war , Bosnia-Herzegovina has remained a violent and intolerant chaos for which an external solution must be found with military means and administrative interventions until such time as a strong leader appears .
Then it became a guinea pig for an EU which at the time , more than ten years ago , did not have real foreign or security policy .
The authorities are trying their level best to make life for the opposition as difficult as possible and they also have more than halved the election campaign period .
I hope that Parliament , with today’s statement , will in any event give the opposition and candidate Alexander Milinkevich a moral boost .     Madam President , let me give you the score .
I have therefore written to Commissioner Rehn , asking him to get the Commission to mount a thorough and independent inquiry into the circumstances of these brutal killings , which should not go unpunished .
I am delighted that the Commission is prepared to mount a comparative inquiry into the way in which Member States treat prostitution in legal and practical terms and into the impact of that policy .
If we , in the European Union and its internal market , want to compete with major markets outside Europe , we will need dynamic , young , well-trained people who are also mobile .
That is something to which we have always aspired within the European economy , and so it makes no sense whatsoever to keep the labour markets closed off .
That has proved impossible , for every year , we notice that seasonal labour , in particular
