by accident or for some other reason .
Do not increase the amount of bureaucracy .
I believe that the objective of investigating alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law in relation to BSE has been met in full , and that reading part A of this report will answer any questions in that respect .
Lastly , there were no veterinary inspections .
During the debate on BSE I had the honour to take Mrs Pery 's place in the chair , and when Mrs van Dijk was speaking I gave Lord Plumb the floor .
And Mr Whitehead 's report , which was unanimously approved , says what all of us are saying , more or less .
So one of today 's priorities is food safety and the establishment of an independent food safety watchdog .
We cannot keep silent in the face of such barbarity as human beings , let alone as politicians .
A great deal is at stake .
To end the Algerian tragedy , it is essential to guarantee the stability of the Maghreb and the Mediterranean , a priority objective for Europeans and even more so for neighbouring countries like Spain .
Last Ramadan indeed resulted in an escalation of violence and terror .
Algerian women should lead civil and political society in that country .
Let us do so .
I shall end , Mr President , by saying that all this is necessary because , unfortunately , the goal of a single language is not as close as the goal of a single currency .
After the great fanfare of 1992 , we are immersed in the application stage , the final objective of which is to bring Europe closer to the daily lives of the citizens .
Mr Caccavale 's report takes up a series of basic principles of civil law which give me great satisfaction as a lawyer : the reciprocal obligation to give correct and complete information ( principle of good faith ) , capacity of the parties , agreement on the essential elements of the contract , the cause , the object and the purpose .
It is not just a case of legislating for the Staff Regulations of the Officials of the Community ; it is also a matter of constructing a working model for economic and social rights and for promoting systems which constitute an expression of equality of treatment , and the end of all legal forms of discrimination based on sexuality .
Finally , taking on these commitments means making progress towards not only a more democratic society but also a freer society .
There is no urgency because we passed a resolution in December , and the matter needs further thought , so we think it is better to adjourn the debate for two months .
The way the BSE epidemic has been handled , especially by the United Kingdom , and its utterly tragic consequences for consumer health require a response from this Parliament that is not just convincing but also responsible , and which will help to guarantee proper protection for citizens in terms of public health .
So I have voted against the motion of censure .
Only a month ago we were congratulating ourselves on the launch of European Year against Racism and Xenophobia , and today we find ourselves obliged to deal with this matter again in topical debate .
Something like that is going on now .
It is also satisfactory - and the rapporteur mentioned this - that the democratic representation of the ACP countries has undoubtedly improved and we are on the point of implementing genuine measures to ensure this representation , a reflection of the process of democratization which is happily in progress , not without upsets and setbacks , in many of the ACP countries .
I think all this ought in fact - as our Dutch colleagues have said - to justify the presence of the minister , Mr Pronk , who is undoubtedly a very competent man , but perhaps could learn a little respect for the feeling amongst Members of the European Parliament who are interested in these issues .
Remember too , that prevention is better than cure , and this Parliament 's Committee on Foreign Affairs has once again received the support of the House for the Council to engage in serious study of the prevention of conflicts .
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , we are all commenting on the death of an important leader , Deng Xiaoping , whether or not we agree with his ideas .
As regards the functioning of the Schengen Agreements , we regret the emergence of new types of discrimination : on the one hand between citizens of the Union on grounds of nationality and on the other with regard to the citizens of third countries legally resident in the Union .
However , when I see labels entitling my luggage to travel through airports , whilst I on the other hand , have to show my identity card or my passport , I do feel a little perplexed .
Flexibility to move forward .
In the face of the challenges and social consequences wrought by the 'information society ' it would be a good thing if the European Union were to plan ahead in order to set up a joint legislative framework suitable for regulating some of these consequences already mentioned : telework , privacy , linguistic differences , the effect on health , on schools , on teaching , the protection needed for users as such and as consumers , etc .
This is one of those debates we shall come back to ; it began because , as I said , the information society is at the development stage and is bound up with many aspects of our lives - amongst other things with a matter so fundamental as employment .
