Community system for preventing and remedying environmental damage , including water pollution , damage to biodiversity and soil contamination , which poses a serious risk to human health .
I therefore voted in favour .     .
In conjunction with traceability , this principle could allow for rapid action that would put an end to risks to human and animal health and to the environment .
In my view , without wishing to play down the importance of food safety , we must avoid measures that are excessively restrictive or harmful to animal feed producers and which are unreasonably harsher than those that apply to producers of food for human consumption .
Special care must , therefore , be taken with the materials that come into contact with food , and also with the functions of these materials .
This is an attempt better to preserve consumer health and to facilitate the free movement of goods , by establishing a legal framework for technological development , issues currently governed by a directive that dates back to 1989 and which is now under review .
I share the rapporteur’s view that trade and development policies must be geared towards combating poverty , to promoting employment and social justice , to creating wealth , to ensuring a fair distribution of income and to general economic , social and cultural development .
According to experts in the field , this proposal for a regulation is crucial to the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP ) and is intended to establish a legislative framework for reducing hydrofluorocarbons ( HFC) , perfluorocarbons ( PFC ) and sulphur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) , which are powerful greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol .
Signing the Århus Convention requires measures to be adopted that are legally binding on the European Community’s institutions and bodies , and this regulation does this specifically as regards the three pillars of the Convention : access to information , public participation in the decision-making process and access to justice in environmental matters .
This report should be seen against the backdrop of the important package on the ‘environment ’ and , more specifically , on the European Union’s incorporating into its legal system the Århus Convention on Access to Information , Public Participation and Access to Justice in environmental matters ( II I pillars ) .
As a follow-up to the Commission communication which addressed , amongst other matters , the management of mining waste , given the specific characteristics of mines and the considerable disparities between subsectors of the extractive industries , work was undertaken on re-assessing Community environmental policy , in light of recent mining accidents , for example at Baie Mare , in Romania , and at Aznacollar , in Spain .
In order to meet its international commitments , the European Union must formally approve the decision on the conclusion of the Århus Convention .
The Commission therefore suggests creating two bodies : a Supervisory Authority and a Safety Centre .
I therefore voted in favour .     .
We can , therefore , only regret the fact that the framework decision on the European arrest warrant has not been implemented throughout the EU by 1 January 2004 .
This proposal falls in line with the federalist approach , which seeks to remove fundamental powers from the Member States , powers that go to the heart of their sovereignty .
The report refers to a proposal aimed at enabling a Member State to issue a European Evidence Warrant , which may be executed in other Member States .
This report is concerned with the European Evidence Warrant , and , given that this document is not the appropriate place to address the issue of procedural safeguards , I have no choice but to vote against .     .
In December 2003 , the Commission , exceeding its competences , concluded an agreement with the USA on transmitting air passenger data .
The responsibility for ensuring the protection of people in terms of the basic data on air passengers currently lies with individual countries , yet this agreement seeks to remove from individual countries any responsibility effectively to block transfers in order to safeguard citizens ’ rights .
It is , consequently , a pity that the report makes a brief reference to the need for ‘an intersectoral approach’ .
Between 2004 and 2010 , SCALE will focus on the four main problems of public health – childhood respiratory diseases , asthma , allergies ; neurodevelopment disorders ; childhood cancer ; and endocrine disrupting effects – and on its three ultimate objectives , namely to reduce the disease burden caused by environmental factors , to identify and prevent new health threats caused by environmental factors and to strengthen EU capacity for policy-making in this area .
I should also like to highlight the way in which the report condemns all forms of violence against women and calls on Member States to combat and eliminate violence against women and children in Europe .     .
We have always viewed such agreements as one part of a gradual definition of asylum policy and migration .
It cannot be denied that we face a threat and in order to protect our open way of life we must prevent terrorism and protect our citizens .
We do not wish to be cut off from the general development of the protection of fundamental rights across Europe as a whole , notably in the scope of the Council .
The specific instrument in the mining sector , Sysmin , was discontinued under the Cotonou Agreement .
It recently announced an agreement to strengthen common approaches for evaluating the environmental impact of infrastructure projects supported by the export credit agencies of OECD governments to ensure that they meet established international standards .
In doing so , it seeks to promote the choice of the most economic solutions on the basis of economic , social and environmental impacts
