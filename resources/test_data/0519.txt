Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs .
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany , Italy , Ireland , Spain , Sweden and Britain , to remove the retrospective nature of this measure .
Retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law .
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case .
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this .
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry .
Mr President , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled .
Now who should pay the costs ?
Whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer .
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars .
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals .
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers !
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments .
Mr President , like so many others here today , I believe this is a good measure .
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need .
Most of the technical issues have been resolved .
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved .
We have arrived at the final question .
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament .
That is quite simply : Who pays ?
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said .
In fact perhaps as little , the lawyers tell us , as 20 % or one-fifth of the cost .
That is not unreasonable .
If you look at the UK consumer for example , who buys a Rover , as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars , over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe , why should they pay ?
They have paid already .
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers , pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from ?
I cannot accept that .
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case .
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it .
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer .
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal .
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government .
The common position is a reasonable compromise .
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road .
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments .
Mr President , this is an extremely bad directive .
First of all , as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out , it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle .
Secondly , it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment .
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment .
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect , which has not been examined well enough in this debate .
It is like so much European legislation .
It is far too prescriptive .
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling .
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago , I believe , by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles , to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them .
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars .
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so .
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars , recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts .
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach .
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery .
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead " car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process
