these procedural rights to be considered as a package .
I would also like to take up the point raised by Mrs Flašíková Beňová , which I believe is very important , on the need to take this step specifically at the time when the European Union is about to sign the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
It is therefore one of the great challenges we must tackle , and one that we must tackle together .
It is a very important idea that must also be seen through .
It is also one of the priorities of the stabilisation and association agreements between the European Union and the Western Balkans .
I believe that this wide-ranging debate has served to highlight that we are faced with an enormous problem , a problem that poses us an enormous challenge .
I believe we can also say that this is a problem that must be tackled from a European perspective .
The authors of the question , Mrs Sargentini , Mrs Ernst , Mrs Thomsen and other speakers indicated the importance of victim protection , which normally refers , above all , to women and children - the most vulnerable people .
We are going to demonstrate our commitment to what is happening in the world and to the countries that are suffering most .
It is a great honour because I am speaking on behalf of a country which , in the next six months , will be celebrating its 25th anniversary of joining what was then the European Communities .
It is a time of political change because of the Treaty of Lisbon , which is changing the way that the European Union is governed .
There has been an effect on public finances , and therefore on the prospects for financial stability , which has impelled and is still impelling us to take urgent cooperative measures .
We also know that we have difficulties in some specific areas that will determine the future of our growth , competitiveness and innovation in a globalised world .
It needs to move forward with economic union and cooperation , starting with the sense of responsibility of the Member States , but also ensuring that the Community institutions , specifically the Commission , have new powers to lead and achieve objectives .
Progress has been made in the field of energy , but not the progress that we want .
We are leaders in this field as Europeans , because we have leading companies , but we do not have a digital internal market .
I will only give you one example of what we see as a priority in the context of combating climate change .
We need to promote , facilitate and open up expectations for increasingly European universities and increasingly European research , because they are undoubtedly the impetus for the future .
Economic change and political change , and change in the government of the Union .
That is how we shall work .
In addition to the economy , I said a few minutes ago that Europe also needs to bet on itself in the area of external policy .
The first of these is the people 's legislative initiative , which is so important to Parliament .
Social dialogue and social agreement made Europe strong when it first came to be , in periods of weakness and now , in this period of renewal and change , after a serious economic crisis ; social agreement - namely the social pact - could be a major driving force behind the objectives that we are setting ourselves for effective governance .
First of all , at this very tragic time for Haiti , I would like to reaffirm our complete solidarity and desire to help its people and all the victims of the earthquake .
I am sure that we can count on Spain 's special vocation to ensure that the summit to be held with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in Madrid in May will be a success for Latin America and for Europe .
Determined action has succeeded in preventing the worst .
However , I am confident in the capacities of Europe .
To offer a clear direction towards a competitive , innovative , sustainable , socially inclusive market economy , able to prosper in the global marketplace .
It means empowering people for the future with the right skills and with a labour market ready to seize the opportunities for job creation ; and targeting action on the big problems , like youth unemployment .
And , of course , we must complete our reform of financial markets to put them back at the service of the economy , and not the opposite .
This will be one of the distinctive features of Europe 2020 : reinforced coordination of economic policies , in which the Commission will make full use of the new possibilities given by the treaty , including those concerning the euro area .
Our citizens , be they households or entrepreneurs , should feel that the European Union is part of the solution to their difficulties and anxieties .
But , of course , this does not exhaust our agenda .
( Applause ) Welcome , Mr Rodríguez Zapatero .
Therefore , unfortunately this part of your programme , which for us is substantial , does not change or alter anything and does not introduce anything new .
We need civil protection .
I will talk about the most important matters , starting with Mr Daul .
This is so much the case that in its first four years , before the economic and financial crisis , the government of which I was and still am the President had a surplus in its public accounts and decreased its deficit to 32 % of GDP.
