We have done so because we should like to repay a good presidency which has set a commendable and forward-looking agenda for Europe , as is also reflected in the section of the resolution concerning the follow-up to the Lisbon Summit .
In this connection , we would refer to our explanations of vote on these matters , issued in connection with the Helsinki Summit , the calling of the Intergovernmental Conference , the European Parliament ' s position on the Intergovernmental Conference and preparations for the Feira Summit .
It is gratifying that the efforts to create a liberalised energy sector now look seriously as if they are to bear fruit .
Some countries have already implemented full liberalisation , and I am especially pleased that Denmark is in the vanguard .
It is therefore unfortunate that the Danish Government does not apparently have any plans for the time being to take the final step towards full liberalisation .
In particular , it should be emphasised how important it is to take account right now of the candidate States ' situation .
It is also important to draw attention to the fact that all electricity production should be transparent , and that special support for this must in no circumstances constitute a distortion of competition .
Introduction of the new common notes and coins will have considerable practical significance for individuals and companies , not only because the coins and notes are new but also because the 'new prices ' have to be got used to once the present ones have been converted into the common currency .
Money is something in which it is necessary to have confidence .
It is therefore important that the necessary information should be made available , and more information should of course be made available than we receive whenever countries at present introduce new designs on notes and coins .
We agree that it is right for the Danish Government not to have entered into such an agreement .
It is not a problem for us Danes that the Conservatives have nothing to do in England , but are acting the fool in Denmark .
Rather , it is a question of improving the quality of the external service the Community already has and of improving cooperation between that service and the Member States ' external services .
We in the Liberal Group attach importance to the fact that what is at issue here is in-service training and not basic training .
By that , I mean providing training to people who are already in service or on the way to joining the service .
And we attach great importance to the fact that the training should be open to participants from the national external services so that there is interaction between EU and national diplomats .
It is debatable whether there is a need for a new institution with its own building and board of management , as well as a heated dispute about where the institution is to be located .
We have proposed - and had accepted - an amendment which emphasises that it is simply a question of in-service training and that the courses are to be open to diplomats from the national foreign services .
Nor do we want the present delegations to develop into EU embassies .
We also support the initiative to give further training to EC officials engaged in external activities .
We are opposed , however , to setting up a college of diplomacy for training the staff .
It must be possible for such training to take place as , for example , in-service or on the job training .
That would create an unclear picture of which problems are to be solved by the national embassies .
Our countries have a special responsibility , being among the few democracies in the world .
Interventions of this kind should primarily take place with the help of economic sanctions but , depending upon the circumstances , military intervention may be necessary .
At present , statements from the Commission ' s delegations are too dissimilar because of the divergent positions held by the Member States .
The path to those goals is partly by way of social and economic development , and the way to social and economic development is partly by means of foreign investment .
The Union ' s finance package will be an incentive to further investment in Turkey and , in the process , will also promote and consolidate democracy and human rights .
We have seen this strategy succeed in former dictatorships in Southern Europe , we shall see it work in Eastern and Central Europe , and it ought also to work in Turkey .
Finally , I would emphasise the need to rebuild the thousands of Kurdish villages razed to the ground .
In the same way , we must insist that the rights of the Kurdish minority are respected , just as the rights of minorities are respected in the countries of the Union and in the other candidate States .
Mr President , may I first of all thank the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries , Mr Varela , for a particularly good piece of work on these reports .
It is , of course , only right that they should be involved in financing those agreements from which they themselves benefit more than anyone else .
By means of the fisheries agreements , the EU is able to develop its activities in this sphere and exchange fishing rights with third countries .
I want to conclude by asking the Commission to provide the Committee on Fisheries with a report on what for third countries are the positive and negative consequences of the EU' s fisheries agreements .
Mr President , I am very surprised at what I heard from our British fellow MEP ,
