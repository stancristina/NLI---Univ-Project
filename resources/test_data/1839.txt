The Finnish Presidency will comply with the European Council mandate , which means preparing a brief agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference .
I do not wish , in this connection , to estimate when the Member States will be ready to take steps in a more ambitious direction and amend the Treaties for the further development of the Union .
The Union has the potential to develop into a strong global player , as it has at its disposal a vast range of political and financial instruments and resources .
The report that we will present at the European Council in Helsinki discusses an approach to integrate both civil and military means to solve conflict situations .
This is a key question when securing the confidence of the people in the work of the Union .
During our presidential term we have started to reform the work of the Council .
A debate on other proposals for reforms to increase transparency is presently under way .
Madam President , I await with interest the opportunity to enter into discussions with the Members of Parliament .
The issues discussed have great importance in the everyday lives of ordinary people and for companies as well .
A precondition for the continued support , by the people , of the principle of free movement , is that there needs to be better opportunities to obtain justice within the whole area of the Union .
Improvement in police cooperation in practice and growing support for Europol will boost the investigation and prevention of crime .
We are nevertheless disappointed that the decisions of Tampere do not mention a European public prosecutor , whose field ought to have covered the fraudulent dealings behind the Community budget .
We hope that the Council , with its decisions to ultimately create a common asylum-seeking process and a common status for those who have received asylum throughout the Union , has opened up the way for Europe to become a united area in matters of asylum and refugees .
This is a matter that was only mentioned in the Council ' s decisions , in which the Commission was urged to explore the possibility of considering some sort of reserve fund for situations where large groups of refugees are applying for temporary protection .
Our group welcomes with satisfaction the composition of the institutional assembly that will work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , believing that the strong parliamentarian dimension contained within it reflects the democratic implementation of EU development better than a conventional Intergovernmental Conference .
We shall participate fully in the work of this institution .
The decisions are , however , just words on paper .
This is what will happen , although the Council has borrowed a good idea from the world of business , the scoreboard , the actual term being a perfectly balanced scorecard .
Madam President , there is every reason to congratulate the President-in-Office of the European Council on the very well organised Tampere Summit , which proved even more fruitful than anticipated .
The steps taken thus far have , owing to the basis of the agreement , been modest .
The issues are difficult and lead easily to conflict .
Criminal investigations and convictions must take place within the context of a real European area of justice .
It was important that , in the fight against crime , prevention was raised as a Union level issue .
The results of the meeting at Tampere also confirmed that we do not want a ' Fortress Europe ' , but want to take responsibility .
It is important to take account of issues relating to the applicant countries as well as regional cooperation in this area .
Face with these challenges we will need seamless interinstitutional cooperation .
Despite its positive features , therefore , the outcome must be seen , from the point of view of fundamental and human rights , as the victory of a defensive battle .
We need more light !
I would like to take up your valuable time , first to move on to some general comments , and then to reply to your points in detail , and finally speak about the future , and about implementation and monitoring .
In my opinion , the last speech , by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , was very important , as it put forward the notion that we should be setting ambitious targets .
The problem for Tampere was that the issue of justice and home affairs is , all in all , a very conservative area .
For example , we do not have in our legislation any coherent definition of what organised crime is .
First , I will speak of Eurojust and the European prosecuting authority .
It is quite another question , as it would be expressly concerned with crimes committed within the territory of the Community , in which the Community has a financial interest .
This has quite a lot to do with the issues that were discussed mainly last spring , but they can certainly be returned to once more .
I think that is very justifiable , as this must be monitored as Europol ' s mandate or , to be precise , its competences , expand .
This must be monitored closely .
This means that we shall go as far as possible in the direction of full citizens ' rights but , for example , there is perhaps a certain unwillingness to grant voting rights in parliamentary elections .
We must clarify our concept of what we are trying to do .
What we mean here is that , when masses of refugees suddenly arrive seeking temporary protection , we should support those countries that are the target of such large-scale migration .
Speaking of the share of the burden , we
