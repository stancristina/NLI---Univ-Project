Member States .
It creates problems for farmers if only some farmers are obliged to pay to reduce nitrate run-off .
It is vitally necessary that pressure be put on all Member States to implement the nitrates directive , so that the burden is evenly distributed .
Countries which have not implemented the nitrates directive on time should not be rewarded by higher support from the EU than those countries which have already implemented the directive .
Besides , it would mean that the EU is throwing money away .
The last point I wish to mention is the deplorable situation with regard to reporting to the Commission .
The Member States must be made to report correct figures to the Commission , so that it can prepare overviews of how the nitrates directive is working in practice .
After all , that is unfortunately the main reason why the reporting does not take place .
It is necessary to put pressure on the Member States to ensure proper implementation and better reporting , if the nitrates directive is to have any relevance at all .
Mr President , I am glad that we are getting another opportunity to debate this important subject .
Leaching from 22 % of agricultural land in Europe exceeds 50 mg per litre , which is the generally accepted health limit .
The figure should in reality - as the rapporteur also pointed out - be down to 10 mg per litre , as recommended by the WHO , FAO and Greenpeace , since at this concentration drinking water would become safe for children .
We must not forget that the nitrate issue is a serious health problem and , in the light of the very serious environmental and health-related nature of the nitrate problem , the calls made in the report with a view to bringing about a solution are too vague .
I of course , along with everyone else , wholeheartedly support the call for the Commission to expedite the infringement procedures .
The Commission must also be called on here to bring about a radical change in the EU 's agricultural policy , so that it becomes attractive to farmers to minimise water pollution caused by nitrates .
A comprehensive switch to organic farming in the EU in this way would also bring with it innumerable other environmental and health-related gains .
I therefore call on the Commission to take the initiative to introduce common nitrogen levies in the EU , with the explicit proviso that the proceeds of such levies be passed back to the Member States .
With these comments in mind , I hope that the European Parliament will give its support to the report , since its demands constitute an important step in the right direction .
Mr President , nearly ECU 100 billion , or 750 billion Danish kroner , can be spent in the EU next year .
The Danish contribution will top DKK 15 billion by the turn of the millennium .
Danes are now going to pay more in their contribution to the EU than farmers and others in Denmark receive from the Union .
The problem is not just that it is expensive insurance .
Consumers and taxpayers pay high prices for products which encourage the use of pesticides and growth promoters , which gives rise to new expenditure for storage and destruction , without the farmers getting a reasonable income for their daily toil .
Imagine if we stopped all the support for destruction and let our EU contribution assist a changeover to organic farming or promote sustainable development in poor countries and regions , or imagine if the budget and the accounts were made so transparent that democratically elected representatives could check every record and citizens could see what had been appropriated for whom .
Here in Parliament too , we shall be able to set a good example on Thursday by cleaning out our own pigsty and finally switching to the procedure of only refunding expenses actually incurred .
It is the thirty-eighth time we have tabled it , so I hope that it will also be the last .
Mr President , the late hour stands in stark contrast to the importance of the proposal we are now debating .
It is indeed a question of a good or a bad life , or even death , for many people who work with or are exposed to VOCs .
We therefore have good reason to thank both the Commission and the Council for not bowing to the massive pressure from industry , which was in favour of getting the matter shelved .
On the one hand they are carcinogenic and cause brain damage and many other forms of damage by their direct effects , i .e . on people who work with the substances .
On the other hand , if they are released into the natural environment , they can undergo chemical or physical changes and , amongst other things , create an ozone layer .
It can harm both people and animals .
A number of studies have shown that peaks in ozone concentrations bring with them serious disorders , such as asthma , eye diseases , constant headaches and , in extreme cases , death .
The ELDR Group cannot support all the amendments , because we do not actually feel that they all represent improvements .
We cannot protect ourselves against the problems arising from VOCs .
There is no use trying to do that .
We must quite simply be rid of them .
There was a mood of despair in this Chamber when we debated these matters , and with good reason .
Picasso gave form to that tragedy in his depiction of Guernica .
And it was our troops who failed , and were failed .
I know that it is NATO and not the EU which holds the means of exerting military pressure
