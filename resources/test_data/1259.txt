This is despite the unmistakeable pronouncements of government leaders in December last year that economic policy and wages policy remain national responsibilities .
The currency which ought to be a powerful symbol of European integration , nevertheless threatens to sow division .
Nevertheless I will take the vote seriously , as it is in fact about Italy .
If we do not start working seriously on that , the euro could well end up as so much monopoly money .
I want to make an urgent appeal here today to the European Council not to replace disunity over monetary policy with disunity over the President of the Central Bank .
But let us not deceive ourselves : a single currency and a single monetary policy is not enough .
The low exchange costs , stable prices and interest rate trends which will result from it will promote growth .
The crucial point now is to provide strong support for the introduction of the euro , not only by coordinating the economic policies of the Member States , but also with a voluntary Europe-wide economic policy .
Madam President , the Dutch people within the Union for Europe Group are in favour of the euro but have voted against .
They are right .
Careless ?
Parliamentary immunity is intended , and must be used and continue to be used , so that the institution as such can safeguard itself from the obstruction of our duties as a co-legislator in the meantime .
After all , the question of waiver of immunity cannot arise for us yet , because no charges , criminal or otherwise , have yet been brought .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights greatly appreciates this and throws in its lot with the common position of the European Council of Ministers .
I consider , therefore , that the right balance has been found in the draft directive , the right balance between technological and ethical dimensions .
The directive turns genetic material into a mere resource for commercial gain .
The patenting of genes is not something to be taken for granted .
But it has not gone far enough yet .
The amendment guarantees correct information and the free consent of donors of genetic material , independently of national provisions .
Thirty four countries , I will not read the list out to you but we will make sure that the Commissioner and the rapporteur also get a copy of that text .
No matter how desirable it would be to have more precise detail , in fact too much is still being left open because there is a statement at the end of the communication to the effect that the communication , which was drawn up in response to a judgment of the Court of Justice , can ultimately only be finally and conclusively judged by the Court of Justice .
The first question , in my opinion , ought not to be asked at all , Why is it actually necessary that banking institutions be subject to a notification procedure before they set up in another Member State ?
This report examines the regulations for credit institutions which are operating in the Member States of the European Union .
Not all Member States were represented in the SLIM group for the banking system , which means that not all Member States would want to abolish the notification procedure just like that .
The WTO speaks of national treatment for banks .
They were very useful and very interesting conferences , I have to say , because we did not engage in political battles with each other but , the Commissioner will acknowledge what I am saying , were able to talk about that difficult subject in a highly rational way .
To paint the picture even bleaker than it already is , people have died .
What we do know is that large quantities of synthetic drugs are made and consumed in the European Union .
The Liberal group is very ready to agree to the main points of the report and I would like to compliment rapporteur Pirker sincerely .
I want to point out the essential role of the traditional family in the prevention of drug use .
I remain convinced that a great many of the serious evils of our society today can be ascribed to the decline in the role of the family as the cornerstone of society , as protector , place of learning and example to children .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights did not talk about public health .
If people want to reduce the use of the car on public health grounds by banning advertising which restricts trade and hinders the operation of the internal market , they should do so on the grounds of Article 129 .
Advertising bans on legal products are nothing new .
And for those who are swayed by the argument about jobs , the economic and social consequences of this directive will be limited by the long introduction period before it comes into force provided in the compromise reached in the Council .
However , if you opt for the economic point of view , things turn out differently .
In the case of the ban on sponsorship and advertising of tobacco products it is obvious , of course , that this serves the interests of public health , and that is no small goal either .
I think that is why I was rather late seeing my name .
I would mention , for example , paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 3 , which are to do with indirect advertising .
Mr President , we can only come to a different decision if we no longer take our own legal services seriously .
I think the members of the Green group ought to know that
