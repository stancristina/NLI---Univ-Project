, however , because some countries are fighting a hard , long-fought battle against uncontrollable animal diseases .
Various measures have been taken : quarantine of varying lengths , double-checking with vets both before and after travel depending on the destination country , expensive compulsory vaccination of wild animals at national level - to name but a few .
I can therefore well understand why some Member States fear any easing of their stringent national regulations , and I consider it necessary that we respect their high safety requirements and would like others to emulate them .
That would also provide an opportunity to check pig and other animal transports that do not meet EU requirements , and the smuggling of puppies and kittens which are far too young could also be exposed by border controls .
A number of them have been mentioned .
There is the question of natural resources , in that the Arctic region offers enormous riches .
However , the crucial question for my group is from what angle we should approach the Arctic .
Or should our starting point be how the development of the Arctic region can benefit the global community - while at the same time , let us not forget , fully respecting the right to self-determination of the Arctic people ?
Obviously , there is a difference between the North Pole and the South Pole , the Arctic and the Antarctic .
However , it is interesting that we have succeeded in forging a treaty on the Antarctic , in which we have ruled out military presence and stipulated that this region may only be used for peaceful purposes .
The major issue facing the Commission is whether it should work towards making the Arctic a demilitarised area , and should that be the case , which specific initiatives it should take in that direction .
In this regard , it is very valuable indeed that we have chosen Gilad Shalit as a topic for our debate today .
There are thousands of Palestinians who are being detained under totally unacceptable conditions , something that is contrary to international rules in every respect , and that is just as difficult a situation for them as it is for Gilad Shalit and his family .
The issue here is not just one prisoner , but thousands of prisoners who are victims of this major conflict .
I think this is a really productive way to go about finding a common solution , and I hope that Baroness Ashton will put the EU in a position where it does not only have to pay , pay and pay , but where it can also make its voice heard every now and then .
The low turn-out at the EU elections speaks volumes .
Our group is therefore calling for the rules not to be made too stringent .
For example , issues may still be relevant to Europe as a whole even if the first million signatures come from only a very few countries .
However , as the European Parliament , we can also do something to take the citizens ' initiative seriously .
In this way , we will also be taking citizens ' wishes seriously and I hope that the groups can work together to bring about the adoption of something along these lines , for example , in the form of an amendment to the rules of procedure .
If I abstain from voting , it is because the report seeks to prevent individual Member States from presenting their opinions in the UN , for example , where they are more critical than the EU of various dictatorships .
Today , the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of the priorities for the 2011 budget .
Likewise , the Danish Social Democrats fully support the appropriation of the necessary funds for the EU 's growth and employment strategy , EU 2020 .
Madam President , once upon a time , an airport was a place where you bought a ticket for a flight , checked in your baggage , showed your passport and took off or landed .
Certainly , aircraft crashed in the old days , and unfortunately they still do .
That is why it is important that the same rules apply both within and outside of the EU.
In this context , the EU is too small to be an isolated island .
That also applies to charges .
Nobody should be lost in a jungle of unclear charges and levies .
I wholeheartedly support the report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism ...
When the debate is over and the votes have been cast in May , it is us that our citizens will hold accountable .
Of course , there are a lot of good things that need no further comment .
However , there are still too many areas for which we must say that things are not acceptable .
One example is the Commission 's accounts .
Where the structural funds are concerned , the Court of Auditors concludes that at least - I repeat , at least - 11 % of disbursements from the funds were contrary to the rules .
That does not change the fact that billions of euro in this area alone should not have been paid out .
We know all the excuses .
The Member States say the Commission is to blame , because the rules are far too complex .
The question we must ask ourselves is as follows : would we approve the accounts of a sports club , a trade union or a political party where 11 % of the expenditure in a central area had been paid out in contravention of the rules ?
We must therefore use the discharge to push through such changes .
In April last year , Parliament refused to discharge the Council 's accounts for 2007 by a large majority .
