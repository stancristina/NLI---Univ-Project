political impact on the future of the Union , even though we will have to wait for the new treaty to see the realisation of the ambitions of those who have always believed in the need for increased legislative power for our institution , which is unique in the world because it is elected by the citizens of 27 countries .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Herr Pr√§sident , you have had the immense privilege of presiding over the most original institution in the world , and we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are sure that you have done so with motivation and with passion , and we thank you for this .
It has resigned itself to not making this fight or transparency privileged areas in relation to which voters have visibility - one need only think of the entirely orchestrated failure of the working party on lobbies , which has come to an end today having achieved nothing despite a very explicit resolution approved a year ago , or the silence on the matter of the two seats in Strasbourg and Brussels and on that of the waste of money and CO2 that is incomprehensible to our electorate .
I would not like to call it a dirty game simply because of the respect that should be shown to a European Union Member State , but our fellow Member should have honestly stated that Malta has always sought to maintain its excessive expanse of territorial waters , which stretch as far as the island of Lampedusa .
This is therefore what I believe we are talking about when we talk about asylum ; we are talking about this real need , this commitment that Member States must show to reception policies .
My particular gratitude goes to Mr Demetriou , whose previous excellent recommendation provided a starting point for my report .
We need to get to the root of the problem , identifying the causes of this disappointingly low increase so that we can prepare the most effective solutions .
I believe that the main causes lie in the lack of reciprocal awareness and trust between States , and in the report I therefore lay emphasis on training , assessment , information sharing and good practice .
Lastly , the use of new technologies , which are very important for data collection , reinforces existing database systems and the circulation of information .
With the question we have asked and the draft resolution we will vote on today - let me say straight away to reassure the Commission and Vice-President Tajani who is here on its behalf - we are not opposing the draft implementing regulation that the Commission has adopted on this issue .
Lastly , the second thing we are asking the Commission - and we would appreciate a reply on this , too - concerns a point that is critical for us , namely the fact that a Community list of articles containing asbestos for which an exemption applies has not yet been adopted , and so we are of course asking for this as soon as possible , by 2012 , to enable better control and a better understanding . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Mr Tajani , ladies and gentlemen , it really seems as though the thousands of deaths already caused by asbestos , and the tens of thousands of people at risk of dying in the coming years due to progressive exposure to asbestos - the latency period , we know , can be up to 15 or even 20 years - count for nothing at all .
This inertia can be seen in the events in Italy , in Brioni , where asbestos has not been removed , in Porto Marghera and in Cengio , where deaths are still occurring .
Is this how the Commission respects directives ?
We need to move on , however , to practical action and commitments .
Perhaps the two of us could form a club of European Parliament observers , especially to follow those matters on which we have done so much work together , and seen great fruit , I believe .
As regards the remarks made by Mrs Ferreira and Mr Agnoletto , I would point out on behalf of the Commission that the European Trade Union Confederation was consulted , and chemical workers in particular have declared themselves in favour of keeping the exemption .
These are all issues that we have been able to touch on very quickly , but which we have laid on the table .
A series of events - the economic crisis , the financial crisis , the new type A flu virus - is further aggravating the situation in the air transport industry , and this situation demonstrates just how urgent and indispensable support measures are , not only for the airlines , but also their employees .
Suspending the 'use it or lose it ' rule for the summer season will benefit all companies , European or otherwise , without any discrimination , as the IATA and many non-European companies have pointed out , moreover .
I do not think so , Mr President .
Mr Costa rightly said , ' We are trying to do the best we ca n' .
You see , Mr President , these systems are known as 'lobbies ' in Europe , whereas in Italy we call them 'economic entities' , 'the mafia' , 'camorra' and 'ndrangheta ' . Mr President , I would like to thank you and all those Members who took part in this debate regarding a temporary measure - and I would emphasise that temporary nature - in the field of air transport .
Nonetheless , any future proposal for renewal must always be preceded by an impact assessment , taking account of the effects on consumers and on competition
