If we are to have an equal society in future we must ensure than everyone , men and women , those who are now poorly educated , the unemployed and others can share in the education society , can share in basic education and can share in life-long learning .
It is not possible to have a quick education .
Society has a responsibility by providing sufficient resources , by creating an active labour market policy , by creating a tax policy which encourages education and by creating a social insurance system which also provides the opportunity for education .
The social partners have a responsibility , because in future it will not be possible for people to simply sit down and negotiate about loans and general terms of employment .
There are clear connections .
These are excellent proposals , concrete proposals on best practices , on using the structural funds and on improving the statistics .
I would like to congratulate the whole of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , partly on this report and partly on the report which we adopted a few months ago concerning life-long learning Both of these reports are very important .
However , reality looks a little different .
There are , for example , teacherless classes and a shortage of school materials .
Where the social partners are concerned , as is taken up in the report , it appears as if their discussions about the level at which decisions about further education should be taken have stalled .
You cannot dictate from above that this is what people should do and expect that things will necessarily be so .
These cooperatives therefore work well .
I personally am also very much convinced that people support companies which are wholly employee owned .
We also believe that this can create employment in Europe 's Member States in future if it is drawn up in the right way .
However , it must happen at the speed and in the way which each Member State itself desires .
Mr President , I would like to begin by reminding all of us that the left , both the political and the trades union left , has never in any way been against the people working in companies also having a very , very large influence over the business , both over the corporate environment as a whole and over the use of profits .
I am of course very keen for the Council and its members to use all conceivable opportunities in their contacts with President Yeltsin and other members of the Russian Duma and government in order thereby to be able to influence Belarus so that the country takes in at least some of our criticism of the undemocratic system which prevails there .
This is not just a matter for Sweden and Finland alone , but just as the President-in-Office says , it is a violation of the EU 's principle of free movement .
There are now a lot of examples of almost 'persecution ' of Swedish citizens .
I wonder whether you think that is the spirit of the directive which the Council adopted ?
The question which I would like to ask the Council of Ministers is whether it would not lay the foundations if the Council of Ministers and the Member States could agree on common guidelines , firstly with regard to car taxation , and secondly with regard to what is a person 's domicile according to tax legislation , which is something which has often been raised in Parliament 's Committee on Petitions .
Thank you for the answers we have so far received regarding this question .
But it said a lot about Cyprus .
I would like to thank the Council of Minister 's for its reply .
The draft resolution which existed for the Council of Ministers ' meeting in December included a British and German reservation with regard to the possibility of removing personal information on refugees who have been granted residence permits .
There you can see that refugees ' rights are looked after very badly .
These are not criminals , but refugees , i .e . people who are seeking protection .
That is what is important .
Rather it reinforces a stagnating perspective .
It is doubtful how effective this approach is .
In order for people to achieve the goal , general measures are required which make things easier for enterprise and new businesses , increase profitability of new investments , improve training and research programmes and make Europe competitive .
Paragraph for paragraph , this report contains a lot which is interesting , but together it presents an incomplete perspective .
The countries of the EU are closing themselves more and more to large parts of the surrounding world .
Every asylum seeker should be dealt with separately , regardless of whether they are included on such a database or not .
One wonders what is going to happen to them when this system begins to work in practice .
Taking fingerprints is an infringement of personal integrity .
That is a serious infringement of personal integrity .
In practice the asylum seekers cannot say no , because it would damage their case if they refused to provide fingerprints .
The requirement that data should be erased from the system is incomplete .
I believe it is a quite natural demand that has been made in connection with these negotiations , it is a demand for legal certainty .
We know that the supervision is poor , the legal certainty is weak and the opportunities to appeal are small .
She points out serious defects in the existing system .
The European Union is also suffering from another obsession , that of wanting to control and dictate the internal policies and relations of other countries , and
