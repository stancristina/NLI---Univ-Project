euro must be strong and dependable .
That means better democracy and monitoring of the Central Bank , which is responsible to the democratically-elected bodies .
But the situation is more problematic for small companies .
The SME sector is Europe 's most important employer .
The SMEs , however , do not have the resources to create new information systems nor always the staff skills or money to acquire them .
In order that the costs of transition do not overburden the taxpayer , the introduction of the euro must not mean consumers having to pay for it .
Confusing and inadequate information has led to an image of much dithering and secrecy , and in times of mass unemployment this has increased opposition to it .
That is why the information on the new money must be solid and comprehensive .
I agree with Mr PÃ©rez Royo that the electricity , gas , water and telephone companies must get involved by stating their customers ' bills in euros as well as local currency .
We cannot , however , suppose that commercial companies , for example , - and I do not mean supermarkets - would be able to train up staff members as experts on the euro , as has been hinted at here .
Here are some observations .
US foreign policy does not want a strong European involvement in the Middle East or anywhere else despite some verbal assurances .
With regard to the economy one can say the following : American business , having heavily invested in Europe , will welcome the advent of a single currency in Europe .
On the other hand , in the US itself protectionist thinking is still rife .
The European Union maintains a high profile in Washington and New York but , except for occasional visits to the West Coast , there is no presence there .
Compare Florida , Texas , Alaska , Minnesota and California ; they are very different worlds .
For this reason I have drafted , on behalf of the Liberal group , certain motions for amendments , which contain positive and constructive attitudes towards the development of cooperation between the European Union and the US.
On another note , I would like to mention such cooperation in the Nordic regions .
The report before us cannot , however , be improved upon in any fruitful way .
I would respectfully ask the Commission this question : are you endeavouring to have a person 's right to strike eclipsed by the needs of the common market , and do you intend to do so without consulting the trade union movement and in total disregard for the tripartite system - as we call it - of industrial negotiations ?
But in practice , to fulfill these goals we need a clear working strategy as well as strong political will .
Every region and citizen must have access to the basics of the information network .
Furthermore , we need effective training , not only in how to use the equipment , but in understanding how the systems work .
There is a demand for the new skills , and they create jobs .
Mr President , I voted for Mr Fayot 's report differently from my group , because life outside Parliament requires Parliament to take a quick decision on this issue .
This is no precedent for how things should proceed in future .
Regarding secondary issues in connection with the report on the third stage of economic and monetary union we would also like to deal with , the opportunities for doing so will no doubt present themselves .
Mr President , Mrs Waddington has once again succeeded in producing an excellent report on an important issue .
I myself would like to remind everyone particularly of the right older employees have to further education and training .
This is worth bearing in mind .
Mr President , Commissioner , as Mrs Waddington in her excellent report stresses , and as has been often stated here , we need proper information on the feasibility of structural funds and Community programmes for training before we can take decisions on their reorganization and continuation .
For that reason Community actions in these areas must be better coordinated .
In this way we will be able to effectively spread the word on expertise and exchange experiences to learn from one another .
Naturally the quality of school education plays a key role in the effectiveness of further education and training .
Those who work in or intend to become entrepreneurs in SMEs need special support in the organization of suitable further education and training .
The right type of training could encourage women to even found their own small businesses and learn production skills .
Training has to be extremely flexible and diverse , giving consideration to greatly differing needs and individual circumstances .
The report mentions a regulated economy without offering any further explanation .
Capitalism is both a process to increase the value of capital and a social order structured round it .
The European Union is the modern version of capitalism in Europe .
We export this culture to other countries in the shape of company relocations and massive investment programmes .
This explains why companies relocate to where the return on capital is greatest .
Consider this : there is sixty times more loose cash circulating around the world that what would be required to pay off all world trade debts .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the VAT system on telecommunication services , which distorts and weakens competition , is driving European telecommunications companies into a worse position than that in the developing world .
This means that telecoms working within the Union pay VAT , and those outside do not .
The harmonization of taxation systems is obviously a step in the right direction .
