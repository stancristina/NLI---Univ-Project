It more or less says that the existing regime will remain .
Have you wondered if all the citizens have this facility , even if certain international federations have complied with this and allow these international events to be broadcast free to air ?
The question is : how will Turkey be persuaded to apply and respect the and the legitimacy of Europe ?
I have the 76th question and you have prevented the Commissioner from replying to my question , which was the next question , even though you only allowed 12 of the 20 minutes to which he was entitled .     – Madam President , I believe that Parliament understands the Commission 's intention of less and better targeted state aid , obviously with the emphasis on the poorer regions of the European Union .
Nonetheless , these restrictions on state aid must also have a limit .
This is unfair .
I have examples from Greece which illustrate that the cost of transport on the islands is three times that needed to travel the same distance on the mainland .
I believe that there are numerous contradictions in the discussions being held in the Council and in the proposals by the British Presidency .
In addition , farmers are being discussed .
Parliament will not keep quiet ; it is not prepared to accept every Council agreement , every decision taken next week ; we are here to fight to the end for the cohesion policy and we shall exercise all our rights .     . – I voted against the proposal for a directive on the retention of data because , despite the improvements to the initial proposal by the British Presidency following the efforts made by Members of Parliament , I still believe that these measures alone will prove to be ineffective in practice and will , furthermore , crack individual freedoms wide open , with painful consequences .
Will it also investigate this or will it wait for others to do so ?
We welcome all these changes and reforms in the political , economic and social sectors .
That would be a mistake for both countries and for the European Union .
It is important that we remember this .
I believe that Bulgaria should honour the commitment it made when it signed the Accession Treaty and close units 3 and 4 .
Finally , as far as Romania is concerned , I too believe that the very important question of adoptions must be addressed in its correct dimension .     – Madam President , I thank the Minister for his reply , but I should like to ask if any such measures will be included in future planning for development , job creation or mobility , which we are celebrating in 2006 .
We need to support and to safeguard the social and economic rights of women in all sectors of the fishing industry : equal pay , pension rights , social security and access to public health services .
As far as the full application of the principle of equal treatment and equal opportunities in the fisheries sector is concerned , I consider that we have fallen a long way behind .
I think that the time has come for a bold decision , so that the contribution of women to the development of fisheries and of economic life in general is recognised .
The traditional role of women in fisheries and the various modern forms of participation in the women 's job market by areas with fishing activities were certainly strengthened decisively following the Commission conference in 2003 and the start of networking of this specific category of workers .
Not only the European Fisheries Fund but also the Structural Funds and other programmes , such as FEMMES and LEADER , can become tools for special actions , in parallel to educational development and the development of professional skills , the development of adaptability , research programmes into the impact of restructuring in the fishing and farming industries , innovation in production and the promotion of consumption with environmental awareness and respect for biodiversity .
On the other hand , in France , the Minister of Home Affairs , Mr Sarkozy , proposed an original method for reviewing the proposed text , which would be based on a study by a group of experts , which would tour the European capitals and set its conclusions out in a short text that could be passed by the national parliaments .
They believe that the European Parliament 'moves ' on a smaller scale than the national parliaments .
This is clearly a slight .
We want the right of coexistence .
We therefore fail to understand why a knowledge of the language of the country of origin of European citizens living in other countries in the European Union is not maintained with lessons in the mother tongue right from nursery and school age , so that this can be maintained and developed , both by the specific host country and by the country of origin and the European Union as a whole .
This will be a symbolic and material initiative to combine policies on economic development and on combating unemployment and poverty with policies against racism and xenophobia .     – Mr President , with the fourth report on citizenship , the European Commission is honouring its commitment under Article 22 of the Treaty of the European Communities to submit a three-yearly report on the application by the European institutions of the provisions of the second part of the Treaty entitled ' European Citizenship ' .
The Catania report , however , does not present for us all developments in the individual sectors which , together with the right to equal treatment , make up the particular character of citizenship , sectors such as freedom of movement , citizens ' participation in elections to the European Parliament
