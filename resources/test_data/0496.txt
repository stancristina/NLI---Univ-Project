Most importantly , indicating an action framework for the implementation of gender budgeting , providing for bottom-up democratic participation and the involvement of organised individuals , NGOs and women 's associations .
Approximately a million people have been displaced in Acholiland and in the Lango and Iteso regions .
The crazy orders were given over the frequency used by the network of two-way radios belonging to the Catholic missions of northern Uganda .
Mr President , before the August holidays I was in Romania , not least in order to carry out a task assigned to me by the Robert Schuman Foundation , of which I am Secretary-General .
If there is a distinction , it is at the level of the causes , for I am afraid that many of the fires were caused by man 's folly , by a pyromaniac , while it would be extremely difficult to blame anyone for the drought .
In this sense , it might be useful to set up a European summit coordinating all the parties affected by disasters , which is necessary to support measures to improve the situation , particularly the state of the farming economy .
I am writing a report on European public finances in 2003 and it shows that we are facing problems of increased GDP in some countries and falling GDP in others .
The future of the European Union is firmly linked to the quality and future of cohesion policies .
I would also like to urge the Commission to make greater endeavours to simplify the regional policy implementation rules and to ensure clearer distribution of responsibilities and competences between all those involved in cohesion policy .
Mr President , I believe that economic and social cohesion will make or break the future of the European Union , the Union of 25 .
It was done for the outermost regions and I believe that such a unit would provide valuable information and , consequently , facilitate the implementation of strategic measures for this fragile sector .
I hope that the rapporteurs and the Commission will favour the amendments that I have tabled and that they can be incorporated .
To conclude , a few observations regarding the two specific , additional problems that we are facing : as regards the statistical impact , on which much has already been said , I agree with the rapporteur 's proposals , but , regarding interventions in regions with structural territorial handicaps - islands and mountain regions - we should not forget that we are talking about structural handicaps .
It must also be said that not all mountain regions are the same and that the reform of the Structural Funds , with the abolition of Objectives 5a and 5b , has created considerable confusion .
How ?
For the same reasons , I will make just one last point regarding the proposals that have been illustrated by the rapporteur .
One day , will we have a discounted European air fare for pensioners and the elderly ?
Once again , however , I have to speak on behalf of many pensioners , who ask me when they will have rules forcing banks to give pensioners more money and to be more willing to give loans to the elderly who , having few years left to live , have trouble obtaining loans because they do not have much time to repay them .
) I envy Mr MacCormick , who has succeeded in saying so much in one minute to illustrate his vote , while I can only manage to say a few words , as on this occasion too , to justify why I voted for Mr Pom√©s Ruiz ' report on cohesion policy in the islands and regions with low population density .
This is a concept which has already been enshrined in Declaration No 30 , annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam , although I regret to say that the different translations of the document are extremely misleading .
For a long time now , thanks to a previous amendment of Regulation 1408 , many pensioners who are in financial difficulties due to illness or disability have been unable to draw their pension or illness allowance when they change their country of residence within the 15 Member States of the European Union .
Since we do not know what price will be set for water , we clearly do not know what effect the plan will have on prices either .
It happens , in particular , as a result of the ageing of society , but that is not the only cause : consider - and I am quoting a figure relating to Italy - the 24 000 young people who become disabled each year as a result of accidents caused by the frenetic approach to life and social activity today .
In particular , we cannot let the different countries get away with inertia as regards their legislation .
We can therefore imagine their quality of life .
I regret this too .
Recently , on 21 July 2003 , the European Council confirmed that the objectives of the European Union 's policy on Cuba remain respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the promotion of a process of transition to a pluralist democracy , and sustainable economic recovery to improve the quality of life of the Cuban people .
The Presidency notes that , since the last evaluations , not only has the Cuban Government not taken any positive measures to satisfy the objectives of this European measure but the human rights situation has also deteriorated further .
In the light of what I have just said , the Presidency calls , once again , for a change of attitude .
I will merely say that we were not surprised .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , today 's debate on the situation in Cuba tells us one simple fact
