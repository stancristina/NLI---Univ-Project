is the first real test of the European Union 's new Central Asia strategy in a critical , emergency situation of the type currently existing in Kyrgyzstan .
We must provide long-term assistance in this area .
In my humble opinion , something else is lacking - and that something is security .
What is preventing it ?
Privileges and burdens go hand in hand , and since we have the burden , we should also have the means of dealing with it .
On the PNR system , which will be discussed later , the same logic applies : a passenger recognition measure , once again for the purposes of combating terrorism , is absolutely crucial .
I fully support the work done by the Commission , and I would point out that the fight against fraud and corruption is an important duty of the European institutions and all Member States .
This , then , is a series of measures which , in my view , fall within a broader process to cut red tape which is helpful for European enterprises , especially at such a critical economic juncture .
In this regard , I welcome the proposals to simplify the procedures for the decommitment of the funds and to facilitate payments to the beneficiaries of the various programmes implemented using the aforesaid funds .
On this point , the report offers many positive points with regard to the demand for incentives for the maritime sector at national level , and for greater regulatory coordination at EU level .
The safeguarding of areas with natural handicaps will be one of the main points of this policy that the EU and the regions of the Member States will be implementing , thereby putting subsidiarity into effect in practical terms .
The path to ensuring the computer literacy of families , students , businesses and European governments will be aided by various strategies that will deal with the issue of defining digital rights , and also implement infrastructure to improve and extend broadband , especially in rural areas .
As I strongly believe that the future of training must necessarily go hand in hand with the enhancement of computer-based training and the interoperability of IT skills , I am in favour of the report .
This political action , however , must set out appropriate guarantees to avoid widening the gap between large enterprises and SMEs ; public authorities and the private sector ; densely populated areas and rural , insular and mountainous areas ; and national and cross-border electronic commerce .
I would therefore repeat , clearly , my full support for these actions , in the firm belief that Europe can once again become a leader and prime mover in this extremely important sector .
Following lengthy discussions , my committee concluded that this is a fair position .
Decisive moments have been the meeting of the Council of Ministers in San Sebasti√°n , under the Spanish Presidency , the announcements of national programmes for electric mobility and the motor shows , not only in Europe , but also in Detroit and Beijing .
If we let slip this opportunity , we could find ourselves in a fragmented market for many years ; not only would this be negative for consumers and European businesses , it would also be unwise given the numerous competing international initiatives .
The measures taken on behalf of the car industry , to ensure that it can definitely innovate but that it can also compete on the international market , are part of this strategy to safeguard industry but also all those small and medium-sized enterprises that revolve around major European industry , which actually represents one of the pillars of major industry .
Choosing an electric car does not mean excluding other options : I say this to Mr Cancian , who stressed the importance of hybrid cars , of hydrogen cars .
She raised the issue of lithium , along with other MEPs who have spoken about batteries during this debate .

In April the Commission issued the communication on clean and energy-efficient vehicles , which is to say on the European strategy for encouraging the development and eventual widespread use of vehicles that are 'clean and efficient ' in terms of low emissions of carbon dioxide and pollutants .
We need to achieve a critical mass , creating the conditions to ensure that the result of one person becomes the legacy of us all .
They enriched the initial report and our work with many suggestions , additions and amendments .
