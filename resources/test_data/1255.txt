I would like , however , to stress that it is important that the demarcations regarding authority that exist between institutions and bodies in Europe are relatively clear so that each one knows its business and where its ultimate responsibilities lie .
Therefore , a common defence is stated as a future possibility in the Treaty on European Union in compliance with the conditions set forth in the Article .
Heads of State and Government undertook to develop an effective European military capability founded on existing national , as well as bilateral and multilateral capabilities , and to strengthen the European capacity in this connection .
Thus , the WEU is not integrated into the Union as such .
The aim is to take the necessary decisions by the end of the year 2000 .
The special nature of militarily non-aligned states is preserved .
Under the Treaty , all Member States have the same rights and obligations .
Let it be said that decisions taken in respect of crisis management action , especially decisions having military and defensive effects , will be taken in compliance with Article 23 of the TEU.
Mr President , the Council is aware that it is desirable and necessary to draft and propose joint positions concerning the draft UN Convention and protocols thereto .
It also wants to participate actively in talks on them and ensure there is consistency between the future Convention and the EU instruments in this area For this , the EU countries holding the Presidency , after a call to do so expressed in the Council in October 1998 , reconciled the positions of the Member States and put them to a multi-sector working party and the K.4 Committee , which is now a committee within the meaning of Article 36 , at meetings in Brussels and also during talks held at Vienna .
During the German presidential term , the Council confirmed the common position on the proposed Convention based on Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on 29 March 1999 .
Member States continue to reconcile their positions in talks on the proposed Convention as far as possible , and on the initiative on the part of the country holding the Presidency , and are endeavouring to reach consensus on all issues that significantly affect the interests of the Union .
Nevertheless , this sort of bugging might be violating personal and national privacy , and may also be criminal .
I would ask what the Council intends to do in order that these Enfopol regulations come within the scope of parliamentary and democratic control .
Mr President , obviously at the stage when regulations on concealed listening devices in each Member State are finally agreed , they will certainly be the subject of extensive debate and they will have to be assessed .
Mr President , as the Member quite correctly stated , the Schengen Agreement became part of the European Union framework when the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force .
We intend to have this pamphlet sent to the Member who asked the question .
For this reason , among other things , during the Finnish presidential term , we will be publishing Council and other committee agendas , so that people may know , if they need to , what issues are up for discussion , and so that , if necessary , they can find out more about those issues and , besides , hold public debates on them .
As far as my personal experience of the work of the Council is concerned , I have to say that , although , obviously , issues are prepared in a way that is not always open , in most cases the best way of acquiring information on the preparatory work of the Council is to read about it in condensed form in the Financial Times .
Mr President , opposition to the death penalty plays a central role in the Union ' s policy on human rights .
To achieve this aim , the Council is urging those countries still applying the death sentence to agree to establish a moratorium on capital punishment , and is calling for compliance with minimum standards .
The initiative was a great success , being in content more radical than former resolutions and , in addition , there were more who were jointly proposing it - 72 , in fact - than in 1998 , when there were 65 .
The Council believes that the Union initiative will strengthen the international trend towards abolishing the death penalty .
I also hope that we can have talks with other possible supporters of the project .
Setting a deadline is a good thing in itself , and it would be good to achieve such a thing , but it is not entirely without problems .
This principle of feeding off the burden has to end .
For that reason , I would like to make three points .
Actually , I could put it this way : reconstruction is not a matter of bricks and mortar , but co-operation .
At the same time , however , we must remember that Russia ' s leaders are primarily and directly responsible to their own people , the Russians themselves .
I would like to raise the issue of this ruthless campaign of terror and bombing - the most recent explosion took place yesterday evening .
Russia has two elections in the near future , the situation is very tense , the country has a sick president , and the whole economy is in difficulties .
Russia has a political crisis , and that has continued since the country changed direction .
With regard to the West , I would really like to bring up another issue .
One reason for that is , in practice , we do not know the Russian
