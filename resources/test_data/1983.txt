I would point out , moreover , that even the rapporteur seems to have reservations as to whether the effects of opening up the electricity market to competition will be entirely beneficial .
They will favour short-term vision and calculations .
It is easy to call for ever-increasing 'deintegration' , but absolutely nobody has any idea as yet how to regulate a 'deintegrated' , multinational competition system properly .
Over and above this report on double hulls - we must not , in any case , allow the examples it quotes by way of illustration to mislead us as to the impact , for we know very well that double hulls will not remove all maritime risks and that there is no such thing as zero risk - we believe that it is extremely important that the European Union ensures that the Erika I and Erika II packages are actually being enforced .
We therefore need to leave them the means to do so and strike a fair balance between European policy and national interests , between supervision by the European Parliament and supervision by the national parliaments .
But when it is a question of reducing our protection , unanimity is , I believe , useful , because it is not right that a majority should be able to impose measures that damage the interests of a minority of Member States .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Pi√©trasanta and I worked together in perfect cooperation : you will not therefore be surprised to hear the same points stressed again in the few comments that I would like to make .
Similarly , we have high expectations of the various strategic documents , multi-annual programming exercises and new shortened and simplified procedures .
Given that , if crimes are committed , there is a hierarchy between US citizens , who cannot be tried before the International Criminal Court , and European citizens , who can be extradited to the USA in order to be tried before the US judiciary , such discrimination is also counter to our principles .
We would call for the introduction into the directive of researchers , who are no longer students but do not carry out paid work .
A change in status from student to immigrant worker is of course possible , but is outside the scope of the directive in question .
The Europe of the future must become a land of exchange , of meetings and mixing .
On 13 May , Austria experienced its first national strike in fifty years , on the same subject : pension protection .
We need to invest in high-quality services so that women can reconcile employment with family obligations .
We need a more effective partnership between the Member States .
We are in favour of the principles underlying this step , even though we disagree with certain provisions concerning the sum and taxation of remuneration for Members .
.
Unfortunately , nothing in this statute can be considered a real improvement in transparency .
But what of peoples ' access to basic rights ?
However , they raise for the first time the question of the interpretation of Articles 38 and 24 of the EU Treaty , introduced by the Treaty of Nice , concerning the conclusion of international agreements by the European Union in the fields of the second and third pillars .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as I am rapporteur on two counts , I will begin , if I may , by presenting the report on reform of the common organisation of the market in cereals , which our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted by a very large majority , and I will then go on to present my second report , on reform of the common organisation of the market in dried fodder , which was also adopted by a very large majority .
It is a gift to third-country starch producers , with the European Union receiving nothing in return .
This crop , which ensures that fodder derived from it is fully traceable , can therefore replace imports that raise a host of GMO issues .
You seem , Commissioner , to see the decoupling of aid as a miracle solution , but it would be better if this were done partially and gradually , to put the Union in a better negotiating position at the WTO , but also so that we can make a first-stage appraisal before possibly going further .
I am sure that will encourage States to correctly finance all the social , food quality and environmental aspects of rural development .
That should give us some food for thought .
Commissioner Fischler , you are very talented , above all in that you have packaged your reform perfectly .
In the meantime , they are safe for 10 years , and if they are safe for 10 years , they are going to be paid for 10 years , quite apart from the young people .
We must therefore abandon this crazy , pointless idea of decoupling .
As far as I am concerned , it is the result of a compromise achieved through the desire of the members of the Committee on Agriculture to preserve the key provisions on the management of agricultural markets laid down by the common agricultural policy , whilst allowing us to move towards a form of agriculture that gives greater consideration to the general interest .
The legal basis already exists , in Article 299( 2 ) ; what we need now is the political will .
All linguistic minorities , including those whose language is a majority language in other Member States of the enlarged Union , have been able to take part in these consultations .
Naturally , Catalonia , with its language , its history and its
