ECHO help in this area .
The EU and Member States have the diplomatic and logistic capacity to head any humanitarian intervention , to support a decision on the part of the United Nations Security Council to provide military protection for such intervention and to see it implemented .
But it must be set up and it must be deployed because , if it is not , it will be too late .
The first reason is historical and moral in nature and has to do with the fact that , for better or for worse , Europe is historically involved with Israelis and Arabs , as we Spaniards well know - a historian , Benjamin Netanyahu , wrote one of the best books ever about the Spanish Inquisition and also happens to be the father of the current Israeli Prime Minister , and according to Shimon Peres it was he who convinced him of the absolute isolation of the Jewish people .
We have to continue along this road and I would ask the Commissioner to persevere with this .
At the present time , the Oslo agreements are our best means of achieving and consolidating peace in the region , despite their obvious shortfalls and deficiencies .
This was the course mapped out at the Barcelona Conference and this is the road to peace that the Union has to attempt to establish in the Mediterranean , a peace that will be finally achieved only when there is a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem , which will surely be the best guarantee of Israel 's security .
It is to our credit that we have finally appointed a mediator to represent us - and I am pleased to hear that he is my friend , compatriot and colleague , Ambassador Moratinos - and that we are able to give our support to Mr Colajanni 's report .
As you can imagine , this was a tense and complicated meeting .
Mr Colajanni 's resolution is a good one and I fully support it .
This dialogue has already had positive results - an autonomous , recognized Palestinian Authority now exists -and it will be dialogue - nothing else - which will make it possible to resolve the conflict .
Allow me , Mr President , to finish by lending my support to the slogan which has been heard on the streets of Tel Aviv : Only peace will put an end to war .
Am I to assume , therefore , that the text to be published by the Irish presidency on 27 November will record the position you have outlined ?
The Commission has got it right overall , i .e . in extending codecision to the entire legislative field , but this kind of all-encompassing statement comes to nothing , as the co-rapporteurs observe , when we actually move on to definitions and specifics .
There is also a further reference to restriction in paragraph 6 , but the comment which includes the words 'risky ' and 'restrictive ' may be found in the report which the Commissioner should have read .
I would also like to join in previous speakers ' denunciation of the lack of respect which the Council has shown in not consulting this House when drawing up this resolution .
My second point , Mr President , focuses on the concept of 'guarantee ' as an element of legal security .
Moreover , the introduction of lists of safe countries of origin constitutes a breach of the duty to assess every asylum application on an individual basis , prevents detailed consideration of an applicant 's status and breaks with the legal principle that rights are individual in nature .
Situations like that which occurred last July , when a number of asylum-seekers were expelled in breach of the most elementary fundamental rights , must never be repeated within the European Union .
This is a difficult situation because it continues to lie with the Member States and therefore direct access , or a direct claim , will encounter a great number of obstacles .
I believe this is wide-ranging in scope and I therefore would like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative .
I believe this is important .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , it is truly an honour and a pleasure for me to begin by thanking Mr Verde i Aldea for his excellent work - excellent not only from an objective standpoint but also from a subjective standpoint .
It is my belief that these two topics are important : both Commission action for consumer access to justice and this proposal for a directive .
It is a magnificent report , and we shall be voting for it , as we shall for the ten amendments tabled by four different political groups , which I hope the rapporteur will accept .
Let us use them in the most rational way possible to create a true Euro-Mediterranean partnership in the energy sector .
Finally , there is one central question ; we talk of rationalization and the proper and efficient use of energy , but we are directly encouraging an increase in energy consumption , whether using it on individual or public transport , or boosting the manufacture of goods which , by their ephemeral nature , generate a continuous increase in consumption .
Mr President , let us get back to the point of the debate .
I am sorry Mr Scapagnini is not with us on this , but his report also has the full support of the Socialist Group .
I believe it is essential for the European Union to promote various Community programmes for those Mediterranean countries which have a serious problem of water shortage .
Such developments could have very serious consequences for our industry , if we take account of the real effect of dumping by countries such as India or Pakistan .
