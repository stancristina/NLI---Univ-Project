The quality of life in the area around Ostend is being seriously undermined by the fact that this airport does not impose strict standards , which apparently only apply at Zaventem .
This invitation is a point of order .
This week it has started a tour of various cities in the Netherlands , Belgium , Germany and France , and is scheduled to bring this mobile euro-exhibition here to Strasbourg next month .
This means that there is no chance of meeting the Treaty criteria by 1998 .
VAT can also cause shifts in intra-Community trade flows and in the attractiveness of certain services that we offer to consumers outside the European Union .
But this solution will clearly never be achieved as long as this whole issue is still subject to the unanimity rule .
Not just Europe 's unity , but also its competitiveness is at stake here .
The socialists clearly see large government deficits as synonymous with social policy , so the proper organization of government finances has been pushed into the background , a move which I deeply regret on behalf of all of Europe 's unemployed .
The VAT system too will come under pressure from the euro .
Experts believe that the travel and tourism sector offers the best chances of creating new jobs over the next ten years , particularly for women and young people .
If we fail to do so , we shall simply undermine Europe 's credibility further still .
What is currently happening with the stability pact is supported not just by France , but by Parliament and Parliament 's largest political group .
This does not mean 3.0 for a country such as France with a debt ratio of less than 60 % , and there needs to be room for some discussion on this point .
The words 'stricter legislation concerning ' should be added , otherwise the amendment does not make sense .
However , I think the most important thing is for the Commissioner to ensure that tourism in Europe is presented to the outside world as a unified sector where the same rules and standards apply , which is why it needs to be included in the Treaty .
Mr President , the prices package that we are looking at this evening is principally part of the strict budgetary policy currently being applied in the different Member States .
Then we heard the argument which appeared this week in a serious publication by the Commission that this stemmed from an excessive payment of around 6 billion EC U.
To conclude , I think that premia for oil-seeds should be paid out as quickly as possible and 1998 premia should be transferred to 1999 as the Commission proposes .
In countries with a strong currency some growers have even been slightly under-compensated .
But this cannot lead to a reduction in promotional activities .
Mr President , I should like to insist that we must be particularly circumspect concerning subjects such as new food products in Europe .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Mr President of the Commission , both of you have offered us a serious and remarkable introduction and I should like to thank you sincerely for that as well as for the work that has been completed .
Furthermore , the criteria and the deadline set in the framework of monetary union must be applied as they were agreed upon and we want the Amsterdam IGC to be a success .
We all agree on this .
I now come to the IGC.
The third main point : integration of an 'employment ' title into the treaty .
For 12 years I opposed this with many others in the European Council .
Mr Van Mierlo speaks of a more dynamic , more effective Europe closer to the ordinary people , as well as a kitchen in which it is possible to prepare better dishes .
Let us take the example of Prosecutor Van Der Voort who had all the proof on cocaine traffic from Surinam passing through the Netherlands .
Concerning the IGC , kitchens and a citizens ' Europe .
I am also of the opinion that we must not expect the situation to be simplified during the negotiations on enlargement .
Is it not possible to think up a new system ?
I am particularly referring to the openness of administration , the democratic nature of the European Union , foreign policy and the weighting of votes .
This is one of my main concerns and I know that Mr Van Mierlo has good intentions on this .
What I would ask you is to fight in order to achieve this aim .
I wish the Dutch Presidency a great deal of strength , wisdom and a dose of good luck .
It is not preparing for enlargement , settling the final details of EMU but actually how to recover public confidence , considerably shaken in recent years .
My gratitude also goes to the Minister , Mr Van Mierlo , for his detailed apology of the CFSP in 1996 .
In various other situations , however , the European Union has not been able or has not succeeded in contributing decisively to solving conflicts and tense situations .
We support this approach .
We welcome the fact that proposals such as improving the information of national parliaments in terms of European matters should be taken up in the protocol on the role of national parliaments presented by the Dutch Presidency , with a view to the Amsterdam Summit .
Madam President , the rapporteur , our honourable colleague Mrs Neyts , whom I warmly congratulate from the other side of the barrier on her report which I disagree with , is wrong according to me when she states that the democratic deficit can notably be combatted by granting this institution , the European Parliament , greater powers .
I would like to put a supplementary question : what
