specific action programme for combating this terrible disease as soon as possible .
Keeping faith with the commitment undertaken for those who are in the front line today , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party , I once again call on the Commission to provide the Community with a specific programme for Alzheimer 's disease as a matter of urgency .
I am sure that , unfortunately , many of those present in this Chamber have known families affected by this terrible disease .
That is why Community intervention is essential , intervention with a high moral , social and human value .
Older doctors find it difficult to move , so we need to think of investing in doctors currently in training , as the rapporteur says , trying to get them to travel in the various countries .
Madam President , despite the limited number of Members present and the late hour , I think everyone is aware of the importance of this debate and the fact that the health problem is assuming ever greater political importance for the EU , although still not enough as regards the problems raised today .
Certainly , from the point of view of competence , the EU should try to coordinate the overall policy and , by adopting initiatives , promote systems that ensure prevention above all .
At present , Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , linked with BSE , is considered a rare disease , but unfortunately it could become common in the future , owing to mistaken choices having been made in terms of prevention .
Some people say we should not always make comparisons with the United States , which are precisely that - United States - and therefore governed by federal regulations , with a federal institutional organization , a single currency , and so on .
The Commissioner has already expressed his regret and illustrated the existing objective difficulties , but I hope he will accept Parliament 's support , for as a budget authority it has the right and the duty to adopt measures so that the programmes we are approving can really have the intended results .
When we are talking about protecting the health of our citizens , with particular reference to the quality of foodstuffs and agriculture in general , we need to overcome the schizophrenia which sometimes exists within the Community Institutions , between the actions of the economic committees on the one hand and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection on the other .
I am sure the rapporteur will accept this amendment as a positive contribution to a statement already made in her report .
I believe it is necessary to return to the more political aspects .
The economic dimension of the measure may be criticized , but certainly not the political validity of this Marshall plan for the central European countries .
The Commission has promised us the wording of the new measures on structural intervention by 18 March .
Allow me to say here that what the Commission has written on the division between short- and medium-term objectives is not true .
I am somewhat perplexed , however , over the replies made by Commissioner van den Broek to the objections to the division into short- and medium-term made by Mr Oostlander .
It seems advisable for the Commission to introduce into the new accession strategy the so-called conditionality clause .
I believe it is important and correct to expand the European Union to include other countries , but this union should not be established before achieving the political union which is the only premise that will permit peace and progress in our countries .
Had it not been for that hypocrisy , we might not have reached this point , since everyone knew that Kosovo was a dynamite store .
The EU has adopted a document which was mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council this morning and which I believe is a good document , a text that provides specific information .
But that is not the problem .
I believe this to be a feasible path , which the Council should endeavour to follow , according to the dictates I share that have been established by the contact group .
I cannot accept that the Council 's right of veto , an abuse of power which defies the course of history , should block the judicial activities of the Court itself , preventing it from judging crimes that are committed .
The last session of the preliminary negotiations will begin on 16 March and the Rome Conference will begin on 15 June , in a Member State of the EU , thereby giving the Union a key role .
Naturally , the characteristics this court has to assume are those we can import from our model : independence and , in the rule of law , procedural guarantees for those under investigation .
Mr President , the European Training Foundation , which has had its headquarters in Turin since 1995 , is one of the best examples of how the Community institutions can contribute towards growth in the job market through its objectives , which are both economic and social .
Mr President , the full report on Tuesday night 's sitting , which I only received yesterday , included my speech on the oral question on Alzheimer 's disease .
We should be aware that we are discussing a programme which has been at the pilot stage in the last few months and has given rise to enormous interest and great expectations among thousands of young people , associations and local communities throughout Europe .
While accepting some of our amendments , the Council did not want to include a series of developments and suggestions of great importance .
