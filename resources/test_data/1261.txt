wanting to force them to accept bad regulatory systems which belong in the Union .
To subject a country to pressure to make it take a step backwards in its environmental policy is highly objectionable .
That is why the Union currently has an immature position on many important environmental issues .
The fact that a majority of the EU 's Member States have at least signalled their readiness for a code of conduct is gratifying .
However , it is surprising that my home country , Finland , has not discussed this or supported the initiative .
Why are people not prepared to discuss cooperation and common rules for exports ?
All countries should be allowed to participate in these negotiations .
We also have mountain regions in Central Europe and mountain regions in Northern Europe .
Not least the question of climate is important .
The mountain regions are Europe 's greatest ecological heritage , but they are a sensitive one whose unique biological character can easily be destroyed for a long time to come , perhaps forever .
Environmental damage in both air and water is increasing .
In spite of everything we Greens are not in favour of the creation of special programmes or objective areas for mountain regions .
That also applies in this case to mountain regions .
There are a lot of things people could consider , but we would like to know what the Commission wants .
Everybody should be able to live a good life in our Europe .
That is why all discussions about aid should be based on the individual local and regional conditions , because it is very easy for large scale forms of aid and exploitation which do not suit the areas to do more harm than good .
This also applies of course to all other mountain regions .
What is going to happen with Objective 6 Aid for Sweden and Finland , now that the Objective Areas as such are being abolished and are being included under Objective 1 ?
It is very difficult for those who have not been there to imagine a landscape which looks like this .
Swedes , Finns and Sami live in the area .
I have a question which I am very anxious to have an answer to from the Commission , if the Commissioner is now listening .
Mr President , last Sunday , 25 January , in Finland 's largest newspaper , Helsingin Sanomat , there was a long letter from our colleague , Mr Raimo Ilaskivi , an article which in my view exploited racism and xenophobia , precisely what we aim to condemn with this resolution , especially in paragraph M and paragraph 14 .
He also said that clashes between cultures cause problems , that most of the Somali refugees who came to our country , Finland , at the beginning of the 1990s do not work , but live on social security .
It is clearly not enough for Parliament to pledge itself .
That gives you an understanding of the speed at which this market is developing .
It is also good that the Member States can monitor the rules and can intervene to ban products which do not meet the requirements .
The buttons need to be easy to press and the figures should be clear .
The telephones should be easy to use and safety should be good .
We have had the opportunity to follow this closely from the Nordic perspective with successful companies like Ericsson in Sweden and Nokia in Finland .
It is also good that a European standard is being developed so as to facilitate such a development .
However , I think there are a few things missing .
In addition , there is a complete lack of debate on the environment and health in connection with the use of mobile phones , such as radiation damage and the recycling aspect .
Zoos are too crowded , there are low standards , many animals are injured and get sick .
I think the following argument can be made : there is no difference between animals in cages and animals in farming .
It should be the same where animals in zoos are concerned .
I think it is important to make it clear that it is the Member States who should have the principal responsibility for ensuring that these rules are followed , which they do have through the proposal now under consideration .
However , I think that the original question , i .e . whether measures are required , is more important than whether the regulation takes place via a recommendation or a directive .
Madam President , this may appear to be a rather out-of-the-way issue for us in the European Parliament .
Two questions must , however , be asked .
Are the large-scale proposals for the interconnection of European hydrological networks good ?
That is natural , since forests and land lie within the nation states .
So the question is this : is the proposal to interconnect hydrological networks good ?
It is also true that many of the problems which exist because of water shortage , droughts and floods , which we are trying to solve here , were caused by our human intervention , such as logging , plantations and earlier water controls .
I myself am going to abstain from voting .
This is quite simply governed by the laws of nature .
Mankind 's way of living gives us a number of explanations for today 's problems with water shortages or surpluses of water .
Of course we should consider the issue of water here in Parliament , because the kind of water we have is vital .
That is the way we should exercise our supervision .
SEM 2000 is not a good enough answer , even if good work is being done .
