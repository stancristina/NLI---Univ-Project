6 area agriculture receives the same support as in the Objective 5 and 2B areas , and no more .
It would therefore be disastrous if less support was given to agriculture in the Objective 6 area than in the more favoured areas , and therefore I disagree with Mrs Myller on this point .
The European Union was founded partly as a means of resolving conflicts through negotiation and with the aid of common legislation .
One function of cross-border cooperation across the EU 's internal borders is to implement fully freedom of movement for persons , goods and services .
Local authorities in border areas may also save substantial amounts of the taxpayers ' money by setting up joint services and common infrastructure in border areas .
In places , considerable progress has of course already been made in this direction .
Another noteworthy example comes from the border between Finland and Sweden , where the towns of Haaparanta and Tornio are cooperating .
Despite all the difficulties , though , strong foundations exist for the development of such cooperation .
Cross-border and interregional cooperation strengthens neighbourliness and solidarity between the regions of Europe , creating and renewing arrangements for cooperation in the best possible way .
By means of this and other programmes , the EU must improve exploitation of the regions ' own resources through joint activity .
At the EU level , Mediterranean cooperation has already been institutionalized .
However , in the north of the Union - in the Baltic and Barents Sea regions - regional cooperation is also developing .
A third important aspect of cross-border and inter-regional cooperation is the development of effective and practical cooperation between associated countries and EU Member States .
A particular problem lies in the fact that cooperation programmes between EU Member States and third countries are based on separate , differing legislation .
In my opinion a possible solution to these differences in the length of programmes and in how they are regulated might be to set up a single common fund for cross-border cooperation with third countries , which could be used to fund and administer joint projects .
I believe that the Commission should consider this recommendation very carefully , because it could reduce bureaucracy , improve the implementation of these programmes and enable genuine cross-border cooperation to be achieved with third countries .
Mr President , our colleague Mr Christodoulou has drawn up a very interesting report on economic policy , most of which can readily be endorsed .
Firstly , the 3 % figure beyond which strict penalty interest becomes payable has been selected arbitrarily .
Secondly , after the third stage of EMU, national economic policy-makers will have their hands tied .
The only remaining weapon will be budgetary policy , which it should be possible to use , especially in countries with low rates of public indebtedness , to fund investment which would generate employment .
For this reason I tabled an amendment in the Economic Affairs Committee , but it was rejected .
Since similar matters will be considered later in the Four√ßans report , certain of my amendments to which have been adopted , I support Mr Christodoulou 's ideas .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Secchi most warmly on a very fine report , and to thank Commissioner Monti for allowing members of the Economic Affairs Committee to participate in close consultations on taxation .
Ultimately it could be said that the whole of the European welfare state model depends on how we succeed in adjusting taxation .
The central message is that the more mobile production factors move to lower-tax areas , with the result that human labour , which is less mobile , is crippled by an unreasonable tax burden .
Things cannot go on like this if we wish to eliminate unemployment .
Capital , for example bank deposits , is one of the most mobile production factors , and taxation of it must be harmonized .
Tax systems must become more equitable in the interests of employment and balance .
The greatest problem is the increasing concentration of the burden of taxation on labour .
For some reason it is imagined that businesses which provide employment are wealthier , as they are taxed disproportionately in comparison , for example , with business which go in for automation .
The minimum requirement is that businesses which provide employment should be placed on an equal footing with businesses using automation .
Madam President , I should like to thank Mr Lannoye for his good report and for highlighting the problems associated with alternative medicine .
I have myself benefited from both of them .
Trained chiropractors , for instance , have already acquired a legalized status in many Member States , such as Denmark , Sweden , Finland and Britain .
Because of the differences of approach , it would be difficult to integrate alternative medicine as a whole into European social security systems .
In my view , treatments which do not form part of conventional medicine ought to be precisely defined , as should the levels of training required of their practitioners , so that , when choosing among treatments , patients know as accurately as possible what the various options are .
Madam President , in this House it is customary to congratulate rapporteurs on their excellent work .
Other employment and social policy measures are in vain unless people have decent housing from which to go out to work , in which they can bring up their children and where they can relax in their free time .
It can also be said that housing policy has been shamefully neglected at Community level .
It is not too late for us to seek the insertion in the Treaties at the Amsterdam summit of an article on social policy which would create the legal basis for common housing policy measures
