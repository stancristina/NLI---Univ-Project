Here , we are not discussing whether Turkey is fulfilling the conditions it needs to fulfil in order to become a member of the Union in the near future - and we can be rigorous in demanding that it does fulfil them - we are opening a debate on whether or not Turkey is to be allowed to join the Union in the future and wondering whether a different sort of association might be appropriate .
Yesterday we discussed enlargement and I confess the occasion was moving and gratifying .
But the results so far are very encouraging .
In 2003 the Commission will send Parliament and the Council regular monthly updates of its operational planning .
So it is naturally our top priority for 2003 .
This process has been going on for years now and it has produced excellent results , but the final phase needs to be monitored with special care .
And this will allow the EU to develop an area of freedom , security and justice .
The EU 's definitive borders have recently become the centre of debate .
Lastly , the Commission intends playing its full role on the international scene .
In the next few days we will be putting forward proposals for improving the application of the Pact and for more coordinated management of budgetary policies within Economic and Monetary Union .
But we must not forget that , though it represents a huge step forward , in some sectors the work is not over .
I am thinking of services and particularly of financial services . 2003 is also the deadline we have set for the completion of the internal market for risk capital and securities .
In September the World Trade Organisation will be holding its ministerial-level meeting in Cancún .
From next year on , the Commission will begin preliminary analyses of subsidiarity and proportionality in respect of around 40 selected proposals and will examine their economic , social and environmental impact .
It gives the system the practical impact and political perspective the EU needs to achieve its goals .
May that thought serve to inspire and guide us , to bring us all closer together , and to heighten our awareness of the great responsibility we bear .
The legislative programme mentions the importance of the success of the Cancún meeting .
Another environmental issue which we feel needs attention but which I am afraid is no longer part of the programme is PVC , a material which is recognised to be highly dangerous by at least five Commission ongoing studies .
I listened to your speech , President Prodi , and I very much appreciated some of the points which you stressed with your usual enthusiasm , particularly the social considerations , which are very relevant at a time when we are discussing security , solidarity and measures which could even include a new direction for the world of work .
Here , too , we must listen to what is being said about globalisation , about new forms of poverty which genuinely exist , on north and south , east and west .
I am going to meet him this afternoon , and I feel this is important precisely because I believe that we need powerful , direct dialogue on these matters .
My response has been simple : the demands of history have led us to take that road , but it is our intention , firstly , to strengthen the Barcelona policy , with whose development we are still encountering major problems , and secondly , to define the new policy which I have outlined - the ring of friends sharing everything except institutions with the Union - which , this is the point , I hope the Greek and Italian Presidencies will help to boost next year , given that we are going to have two consecutive Mediterranean presidencies in the same year .
I have no objection to this .
I would point out that the Commission 's programme for 2003 focuses on new initiatives whereas the Council 's programme , with very few exceptions , deals with initiatives which have already been presented by the Commission but which have not been adopted .
The Commission has constantly drawn the presidency 's attention to the need to find solutions which will not upset the smooth functioning of the institutions .
I fully share Mrs Frassoni 's concerns regarding sustainable development , about which Commissioner Wallström is going to speak later on .
A further concern , expressed by Mrs Boudjenah , relates to the interpretation of peace and development issues overall , as a matter for general concern .
I agree - as I said before - with this too .
It is true that we need to focus on legal as well as illegal immigration , it is true that the issue of integrating immigrants is something that needs to be discussed , but , first and foremost , there is the major issue to be resolved of whether or not integration is taking place .
Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , I would like to focus essentially on section 1 of the Commission communication .
In any case , when Russia accedes to the Union - however far in the future - we will not be able to stipulate that only the part on this side of the Urals can do so , and that will bring great changes , particularly in the way the Union defines itself .
It is just a nod towards the environmentalism of the Greens , towards the left with 'solidarity ' and towards the right with 'economics ' . In short , a little semantic correctness would not go amiss .
Mr President , I just want to inform you that the coordinators of all the political groups in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have adopted the decision , which will be endorsed by the committee itself , to table an oral question during
