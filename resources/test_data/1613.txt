We have only just begun on the process of transposing the previous directive and an assessment of its impact is required .
Nonetheless , we are all united in the common cause of boosting the rail sector and of giving it new hope .
Safety must always be our objective and our watchword .
I trust Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 5 will be upheld .
Indeed , I believe the opposite is the case .
Where liberalisation has severely reduced its status as a public service , this must be restored .
The second principle is this .
Worse , they have serious safety problems .
From my point of view , I would have preferred interoperability to be firmly implemented .
It has even been necessary to renationalise in some cases .     – Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have been invited to decide at the second reading on the schedule for opening up freight rail services to competition .
They are also neglecting the equipment and networks providing important links between regions in order to concentrate solely on the most lucrative lines .
As an MEP , I shall not wait for the next disasters to be announced before joining forces at European level with rail users and railway staff to thwart these trends .     Madam President , by adopting the Jarzembowski report , Parliament , in collusion with the Council , would be pursuing its policy of demolishing the public service status of the vital sector that is rail transport .
For this reason , among others , my colleagues and I shall therefore also continue to oppose Mr Sterckx ’ report .     Mr Purvis’s report has the virtue of gently putting an end to exceptional arrangements for Corsica , which there is nothing to justify .
An entire section of the regulation deals with forestry , involving an annual subsidy of EUR 450 million .
If , clearly , the budget made available for this new instrument must not in any way put a strain on the budgets for the existing programmes , it remains no less the case that the budgets initially provided for by the Commission ( EUR 200 million ) and by the Council ( EUR 180 million ) are far too niggardly to give full scope to this new instrument of exchange and cooperation within the field of higher education .
Governments prefer to shower the employers with subsidies , while reducing the social budgets , including that for state education .
I am thinking in the very first place of Palestine .
I do not think that is the way .
All that to increase the number of civil servants responsible for noting breaches of environmental legislation .
In France , we lose between EUR 2 and EUR 4 billion every year , which is the equivalent of one TGV line every year !
This year , two headings fail to comply with the financial perspective .
This is an essential requirement if we are to be able , in future , to develop real policies of growth and solidarity and policies for the future in the context of an enlarged Union that wishes to succeed for the benefit of all its citizens .     . – Community legislation on medicines strictly regulates their authorisation , their placing on the market , and their classification .
I believe – I am not speaking in my personal capacity but on behalf of several Members , who have waged this fight side by side with the Commissioner throughout the work carried out on this proactive and important directive – that we are talking here about vital issues , and this is something that needs to be said !
However , when we are talking about international relations , which is the subject of this report , there is often a clash between two world views .
You also stressed , almost more so , through your proposals and ideas regarding future regional policy , the need to learn both from the most distant past and also the most recent past .
Will this be enough to deal with all the appropriations available in the 2003 budget ?
My intention is also to continue to be transparent .
I would like to put forward my point of view , and I must say again , as I would say to Mr Markov , that I have to implement these procedures because they are in the regulations , which you are well aware of , which were established at Berlin 2000-2006 .
We have therefore reduced them practically by half .
As long as the European Commission is practically solely responsible to the budgetary authority , and the Court of Auditors , I am obliged to check , control and ensure that the control systems are correct and are operational .
In saying this , I am not moving away from the subject that we are dealing with this evening , because sweet products , whether or not they contain sweeteners , are interdependent .
The European Union is the major donor to Senegal ; its presence is felt in all sectors of our economy – health , the road network , agriculture , decentralisation – and supports all our efforts to achieve sustainable growth .
This is not an option .
I have faith in the type of agreement that we concluded in Cotonou , on 23 January 2000 , which introduces the requirement for enhanced political dialogue , without which there can be no economic cooperation .
This plan shows that without infrastructures , it is impossible even to develop agriculture , because it is impossible even to make the link between centres of production and centres of consumption or of export .
Malaysia dedicates 35 % to these areas .
I should like to draw a few brief conclusions .
The impression that they give of their exchanges
