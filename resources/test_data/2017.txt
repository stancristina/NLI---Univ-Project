absence of the Commissioner here this evening .
Perhaps she is stuck at Brussels airport .
Perhaps she should have taken the train .
I begin by welcoming the Commission 's proposal to integrate Europe 's convention on a high-speed rail network .
I thank the rapporteur for his patience , his skill and , above all , his commitment to the cause of Europe 's railways .
I would also like to thank the Portuguese presidency for its skilful handling of this very complex dossier - an example of Europeans working together to solve common problems .
This problem , I believe , can only be solved satisfactorily at EU-level .
What is the problem ?
As we have heard already this evening , in 1970 the railways had a 21 % share of the freight market , today just 8.5 % .
In 1970 the railways had a 10 % share of the passenger market , today just 6 % .
If these trends continue just 4 % of travellers will go by train at the end of the decade and rail freight will all but disappear .
The sad fact is that the railways have lost ground even where there are well placed , for example , in long distance freight .
The very future of our railways is at stake , together with the jobs of one million people employed in the industry .
A key reason for this decline is that , in contrast to aviation and road haulage , a single market does not exist in this sector .
For 150 years , the railways have been organised along national lines .
Even the opportunity of electrification further divided Europe 's railways because there are now five different systems in operation .
More recently the railways have adopted 16 different and incompatible electronic signalling systems .
That all adds costs and it means railways cannot compete .
Differences have also contributed to the fragmentation of the market for railway equipment .
This proposal being considered here tonight , together with other proposals from the Commission , aims to create an internal market in rail services .
It will help achieve a harmonisation of technical standards for equipment and rolling stock and the integration of national networks to boost cross-border traffic .
That will make the railways more efficient , reliable and more competitive .
It would also boost the railway equipment industry in countries such as my own .
It will contribute to the fulfilment of our aim of switching freight from the congested and polluted roads to Europe 's railways and encouraging the development of more high-speed rail services to take the place of short-haul flights .
The revitalisation of the railways is crucial to the future of Europe 's transport system , our environment and our economy .
That is why Mr Savary 's report deserves our full support .
I would like to speak on this particular subject but from a regional aspect .
I cannot speak about high-speed railways in Northern Ireland , never mind the island of Ireland , because the railways do not go at any great speed in that particular part of the world .
It is extremely important that we recognise the importance of a railway system .
One thing that has concerned me recently in my region is that , in Europe , we talk about how important to regions it is that we should have the most environmentally friendly type of transport .
At the same time within my area people are talking about doing away even with parts of our present minute railway system .
I find that totally atrocious .
We have one of the main links between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland between Dublin and Belfast .
This is a very important link and one that has been upgraded recently .
Probably that would be up to at least half the standard of the rest of continental Europe , but it is very welcome to those of us who live in that area .
Then we have the link between Belfast and Larne which links us to the rest of the United Kingdom .
Parts of this have had to be closed down because there is not enough money to keep it in repair and upgraded .
We have also recently had Northern Ireland Railways tell us that they are going to close the link between Coleraine and Londonderry which is absolutely unbelievable and totally unacceptable .
This is the one commuting area from the Northwest and it takes in part of the Republic of Ireland and the inner shore and peninsula .
They need that railway system as a link for those who want to get to Belfast to reach airports and everywhere else .
So we have to take a really serious look at what we are talking about here .
For too often within Europe we have talked about trans-European networks - be they road-rail , air or sea - but at the end of the day we are not prepared to put in the finance at either European level or national level .
We have to take on board the challenges that come before us and we have to ensure that we have a very highly established rail link .
I certainly want it within my region because that is important .
There should be no more closures and we should make more finance available to improve the present railway system to have more goods moved by rail and not by road , which is totally unacceptable from an environmental point of view .
It is hurtful when I go back to my region and am told the money is not there .
It is hurtful when you go back and you are told that : " No , we must improve the road system - we must not improve the rail system" .
The rail system has a tremendous future
