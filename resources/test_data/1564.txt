A person who has become allergic to nickel keeps this allergy for the rest of their life .
This coins deposit nickel on contact with the skin .
A decision to introduce coins containing nickel in the outer layers could prove very difficult to change and could cause serious health problems for a growing proportion of Europe 's population , particularly for women , since they are often dominant in the professions where nickel coins are handled .
Mr President , at the risk of again being mistranslated , because the last time I spoke Swedish the word travestera , travesty , became transvestite in translation , I am using Swedish again .
On the other hand , I do not think the proposal from the large Groups , the majority , for a joint resolution is serious , with 50 different points which we should consider during the coming year .
We must also make sure that we help the Commission to use its existing powers as much as possible .
The same applies to the northern dimension , which was mentioned in the Council 's resolution .
I shall begin with the positive and would like to warmly welcome the cooperation with the USA which has inspired a new strategy with regard to synthetic drugs through , for example , the early warning system against new substances and tougher legislation against producing and dealing in narcotic substances .
But the work programme for 1998 does not contain anything about this .
We have the Weil report which clearly shows the problems which exist .
If it is the case that normal , decent citizens find they have their pension indirectly confiscated , at least temporarily , while criminal assets are not confiscated , the Union will of course risk losing credibility and even democratic support .
I would like to say that I think this is a very important debate , because the Schengen material will probably become EC law in the near future .
People often talk of the advantages of the Schengen Agreement , but people must also be able to discuss how it works in practice .
Does the Council of Ministers think we are going to need to tighten the supervision of the SIRENE database and the information which is provided there so that we shall have a control authority , as in the SIS database , if it is integrated into EC law .
These resolutions have clearly had no effect whatsoever .
I must say , it makes catastrophic reading .
When some inspecting was done , it was found that there is different information about the same persons in different parts of the Schengen Information System , that it is difficult to find out who has had access to the Information System and has looked for various sensitive pieces of information , that those who have been registered , such as asylum seekers , do not know how to find out whether the information is correct , and that certain Member States use the information in an incorrect way .
There is a quite threatening tone in that if it is true - I only got the information via telephone and radio .
I would like to have a comment from you on that .
However , I do not support the rapporteur when he says that we should limit this debate to a small part of the tobacco issue .
It is not only non-smokers who think that is wrong .
That applies to almost all the paragraphs .
However , I have some observations .
It does not make sense to use very large sums of money to subsidize tobacco growing at the same time as we are going to fight the effects at the other end .
Another observation is that it is important to distinguish between what measures are effective at an EU level and which belong at another level .
That includes tax issues , age limits , where people sell tobacco and what rules should apply to jobs .
Therefore , as the good partners and good complement that they are for the other aid , they must be treated both with respect and trust .
It is good that there is now a clear regulation .
I believe we have an opportunity to go further in this area so that there is more time left to deal with applications from the small organizations which perhaps require not only an extra careful examination , but also advice about their work .
The truth is that these mines are deliberately designed to disable people .
However , the result is not only that soldiers are maimed and killed , but that civilians , women and children also become victims .
Fourteen EU countries have done so , but regrettably neither Finland , nor the applicant countries of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania have done so .
To produce a landmine costs 3 dollars .
The EU can assist greatly in such work .
But we as individuals can also contribute in fact .
I therefore call upon my colleagues here in Parliament to take the same initiative in their countries so we can rid ourselves of these terrible weapons for ever .
This is , of course , particularly important for countries with which we have agreements , countries with which we have some connection .
I would particularly like to emphasize some of the ELDR Group 's amendments in the report .
According to the Commission , and also to the report which we shall decide upon today , benchmarking should not only be applied at the company and industry level , but also in relation to framework conditions for companies .
But at the same time I would advise against having too much faith in a single method which is still a very blunt instrument ,
