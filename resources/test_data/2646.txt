Indeed , the errors were legion .
Some lessons should at least be learned to prevent any recurrence of such situations .
It should be remembered that the Council itself , when it learned of the results of the audits , stated its opinion on the matter in the clearest terms .
First of all , we need to improve financial forecasts for the amounts and the justifications given for the various budget headings .
The question of whether the Ilois people of the Chagos Archipelago would be entitled to British citizenship is a matter between the UK Government and the concerned persons .
Although the European Commission is aware of the problem , this is the first time it has been raised , be it by the Mauritian Government , the UK Government or the Ilois people concerned .
The last one should be sent , we hope , very soon .
As far as I understood the speech was not cleared with the ACP group .
Therefore , whatever the solution , things will have not only to be gradual but monitored very closely in order to avoid derailment of the situation .
This is why the Commission supports the full participation of ACP states in the WTO and has taken several initiatives to promote this .
As for the initiatives on WTO which the Commission has taken for the ACP states , and which I referred to above , I would like to mention the following .
The Commission also confirms that it has a received a proposal for gender action on the WTO presented by the International Coalition for Development Action , for financing under budget line B7-611 .
The first is WTO as a whole .
Even where third countries are concerned , action at European level is justified , since action taken individually by countries is of limited effect while action taken jointly can have a far greater impact and far more significant results for European tourism .
And since it has no legal base , neither does it have any activities : the PHILOXENIA programme is still on ice .
We all know that regional policy supported tourism-incentive projects during the 1994-99 period to the tune of ECU 9 billion , but this cannot be used to justify the absence of a Community action plan for tourism , because there are areas in which potential exists for Community added value , with external promotion outside the European Union , reduction of seasonal variations , coordination of the activities of different programmes and policies where they affect tourism , fiscal harmonisation , classification of tourism structures , safety and information for tourists as consumers .
A European concept of tourism exists which links it closely with the promotion of the environment , culture , regional development , health and the safety and well-being of individuals .
Under the present conditions of increased competition , with the absence of coordinated measures and common policies in the areas of mobility of professionals , efficiency of communications and marketing , in short with the failure rapidly to upgrade the sector as a whole , Europe could well lose its leading position , which it would subsequently find it difficult to recover .
Only yesterday a normal debate took place and today it has been the subject of only one amendment .
It is essential that objective criteria should be established , once and for all , regarding engine power and tonnage in order to compare capacities and productivity and ascertain ( non ) compliance with POP commitments .
Moreover , if Community inspectors were to be given broader scope , it would be useful if they could be accompanied by national inspectors , and observers from other Member States should attend only on pre-arranged inspections .
The Commission report on Community actions with an impact on tourism carried out in 95/96 clearly demonstrate two essential aspects .
It is essential also to guarantee the quality of that employment .
This is also true if we wish to base our thinking on a foundation of redistributive justice and solidarity .
This is because its main concern would appear to be to settle not the problem of own resources , but that of existing imbalances .
In my own case , being Portuguese , the situation is of particular interest given its inevitable implications for the integration process for Macau .
It is important , therefore , that the Commission - and for that reason , I address the Commissioner - should give Macau a higher profile through its representation in Hong Kong or , preferably , by opening a representation in Macau , whose administration , we are sure , would not fail to offer whatever support was needed .
However , there are points that must be improved , in particular access to justice , which Mr Whitehead mentioned .
We already have immense experience of countless cases of contracts where consumers have been taken in by misleading advertising or bad contracts .
Lastly , the recognition of the vital role of non-governmental organisations and the clarification of rules under which they are given assistance or contracts are concluded with them ( Amendments Nos 17 to 20 ) .
Therefore , I will now confine myself to the single matter of SMEs .
And the question is an eminently political one , concerning the role that must be given to SMEs in the execution of the framework programme and its individual programmes .
Whether such programmes are incorporated in the framework programme or not , they should in any case be given an increased budget , since convergence in this sphere is far from complete and cohesion in Europe should include energy as well as economic and social matters .
The new government is encouraged to consolidate and enhance the momentum of political reform , including in the area of protection of minorities , and to promote confidence and stability in
