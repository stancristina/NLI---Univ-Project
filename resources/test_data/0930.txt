, develop competition and privatise public-sector corporations .
The European Commission ' s report endeavours to evaluate the application of this policy to date and proposes measures for the future .
Even yesterday ' s competitors are coming to private agreements and arrangements , thereby adulterating the competition .
I remember from my time as chairman of the representation for relations with Transcaucasia that we had thousands of refugees from Abkhazia who were kept in wretched conditions in Tiflida .
As I am sure you understand , this problem is seriously hampering the political situation in Georgia .
As far as the Observatory is concerned , the Commission has understood and stresses the importance of the Observatory , especially at a time of constant mergers and structural change in whole sectors of the economy .
As you know , competition legislation in particular does not take account of these repercussions , which are unquantifiable , but we are making an effort and the Commission has been at the disposal of employees and employers alike , so that the best possible preparations can be made and we do not have thousands of people on the streets with no provision made for them .
These are matters governed by subsidiarity , matters for national federations of employers , which is why the dialogue is taking such a long time .
In other words , how we intend to address structural unemployment and how the people hit by the impact of industrial restructuring can find new jobs in the new sectors being created which , as you know , are mainly services and the information society .
Social exclusion is a particularly complicated problem which cannot be addressed through education , health or social security policy or through employment strategies .
However , we should point out that , in the housing policy sector , any endeavour on the part of the European Commission comes , it must be said , as added value to action taken by national governments .
Our aim with the new social exclusion programme , which is orientated towards political collaboration between non-governmental organisations or between local governments , is to implement joint innovative programmes and joint studies and draw up statistics , analyses and proposals for policies which will help the Member States to learn from one another and apply more integrated policies .
Obviously , and I repeat , the housing problem is a complicated issue , it differs from one Member State to another and it depends on numerous parameters , from the employment rate to the land development policy in individual Member States and from the organised social system to social benefits ; it is not therefore an issue which can be addressed by national polices .
Clearly , the European Commission has stated its position on the need for a balance between competition and social cohesion .
And that is what we are constantly trying to achieve : maintaining social cohesion with no loss of competitiveness .
Of course , its justification is that it is supporting television so that it can introduce the new , digital technology .
And it is precisely the problem which you mentioned , i .e . that it is difficult for radio to introduce digital technology when it has no specific audience to address .
Do you intend to do anything , if not under MEDIA PLUS , then somewhere else , under some other programme , or are you leaving it until later , until you have seen how television does ?
We requested the amendments this morning between 8 and 8.30 and they were not available .
Mr President , the resolution proposed by Mrs Lalumière seeks parliamentary backing in the form of proposals for the necessary means and structures so that the European Union can assume international policing duties alongside ÍÁÔÏ , especially when and where ÍÁÔÏ fails to act immediately , as specified at Helsinki .
How should we describe someone who stirs up tension and conflict between peoples inside countries and then uses that tension and conflict to control and plunder the countries in question ?
Mr President , honourable members , for reasons of security in Europe and in order to safeguard the security of others outside the Union who may need our support , Europe requires an independent military presence which differs from the presence which it has by reason of its membership of NATO .
If someone , be it a person , a country or a group of countries , considers that it has no initiative to act , it loses interest , neglects its duties or goes through the motions of performing its duties , but there is no substance to them and they are performed perfunctorily .
It is the only way in which it can take its NATO obligations seriously and reassure the political forces in the United States which object to American armed forces and American resources being tied up in the defence of Europe .
Consequently , Mr President , we must ensure that our immediate decisions are geared towards European unity and the defence of a common border and , sooner or later , that is the point we must reach .
After all , crises all over the planet are the predominant issue at the dawn of the twenty-first century .
The problem with a European foreign policy is not quantitative .
Having said this , may I suggest , Minister , that we act with the greatest caution when it comes to questions such as the integration of the Western European Union or relations with ÍÁÔÏ .
However , although there is serious doubt as to whether the Commission ' s proposals will reduce consumption , they will undoubtedly have a decidedly adverse impact both on Community tobacco producers and on tobacco industries and merchants .
