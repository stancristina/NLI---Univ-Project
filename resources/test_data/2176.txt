We must therefore promote the participation of our neighbours , of Russia firstly , but also of all the Mediterranean countries .
There is therefore a clear need to manage globalisation by means of multilateral standards drawn up from a policy perspective in order to make trade relations at world level a beneficial force for all , which contributes to the objective of eradicating poverty and achieving fair , sustainable development .
Terrorism has been identified as a phenomenon that should be condemned in its own right and eradicated .
I believe we need to show that democracy means a consolidated , transparent State .
The Lisbon European Council set a strategic objective for the European Union .
Economic activity , jobs and favourable conditions for development cannot be isolated and dealt with as a self-contained area .
Then there are the policies on equal opportunities .
I believe the recommendation I am presenting today on behalf of the committee I chair gives a faithful account of our views .
Thirdly , no international agreement can make sense unless a reciprocity clause applies to both sides .
Fifthly , agreements as important as those signed with the United States must be monitored by the Council and the Commission .
Another is that parliamentary monitoring of this type of agreement is the rule in all Member States .
It can only be in its interest and that of the Union as a whole for it to change its attitude and avoid creating a serious democratic deficit .
Regarding content , I think it would be very positive to come to an agreement with the United States .
I believe the text of the agreement should make it clear that a request submitted by the International Criminal Court takes precedence over one submitted by a third country .
Habeas corpus really is a basic right .
In so doing it contributes to approximation of national legislation in this area , as recognised at the Tampere European Council .
I believe the European Union must grant entry to immigrants wishing to study here .
Immigration for study purposes needs to be regulated to prevent ghost centres from springing up .
This would allow students to complete more than one academic year in the same institution .
I am not opposed to the idea .
The existence of entry or residence facilities should not influence the choice .
It cannot and must not be achieved solely through strict regulations .
Hopefully this will be achieved for once , and a precedent set .
Commissioner , the least protected open markets are also the most vulnerable .
The situation is set to be exacerbated in 2006 , as tariffs are to be significantly reduced following implementation of the Everything But Arms programme .
Reform should also be compatible with fair trade and promote the interests of less developed countries .
If single-crop agriculture ceases in these areas , drought , neglect , or salinisation will inevitably ensue .
The latter will not work .
The price of husked cargo rice would therefore not be above 180 or 188 % of the intervention price , depending on whether the rice is Indian or Japonica .
Still others concern preventing social phenomena such as triangulation , and call for strict traceability and labelling procedures to guarantee food safety .
I agree with Mr Cunha 's decision in that rice should be a special case , and that it should not be affected by decoupling .
You cannot ask us to accept the validity of this great imbalance in the distribution of aid in order to support the implementation of a new CAP.
You yourself recognise that this proposed decoupling will create serious problems for many small and medium-sized farms , in less favoured and less productive areas .
In 2008 there will be problems , as you have acknowledged .
This reform , essentially , does not provide cohesion , it does not contribute more social justice to an agricultural policy which is in great need of it .
I have been draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on this reform , which has given me the opportunity to observe certain accounting contradictions in the European Commission 's proposal .
For example , the Commission proposed a modification of the common organisation of the market in the milk sector - which is no more than a reform of the reform already adopted in Agenda 2000 for this product - and the costs of which will rise to EUR 1 500 million in 2013 , a figure which coincides in that year with the budgetary deficit which the Commission estimates in its financial record sheet .
The important thing is that this text does not guarantee balanced development of European agriculture and livestock breeding , and neither does it guarantee a territorial balance amongst the European rural areas .
However , in negotiations , to grant prior concessions sometimes leads to double concessions .
Furthermore , the granting of aid based on the average aid received over the last three years would perpetuate the existing imbalances between farms , sectors and regions .
The Commission 's proposal would benefit the food industry and distribution , which will be able to increase their profit margins by buying raw materials more cheaply .
Mr President , the key elements of this reform are decoupling and modulation ; the two measures combined are going to have a very considerable impact on the development of the least-favoured areas and that worries us .
Furthermore , it does not make any sense to adopt decisions today on the basis of calculations and estimates which could vary over the next few years .
And I would also like naturally to congratulate all the rapporteurs who have been involved in this series of reports .
But no , far from it , these proposals intend to make these social imbalances permanent and furthermore , Mr President
