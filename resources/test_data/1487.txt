We must pay particular attention to the rights of children , and not just the obligation to take care of them .
The Committee on Development and Cooperation is in unanimous agreement on this .
The European Parliament has the opportunity to point the direction internationally as a defender of human rights .
It would be a lot better if there were more blatant confrontation as the indifferent are opposed to the development of cooperation between the industrialised and the developing world .
But it is not enough that development cooperation , and in this case the status of NGOs it embraces , is only discussed by the ministers responsible .
In the struggle the European Parliament can play a decisively crucial role .
We will gauge the value of enlargement in relation to the world 's poor people and nations .
I hope this recommendation will do much to point developments in the right direction .
Madam President , first I should like to restore the discussion to its real scale .
But this aside , I wish to add my congratulations to those of my colleagues to the Commission and the Commissioner personally for the excellent work done in Kyoto .
We saw this very clearly in Kyoto .
I agree with my colleagues and my group insists that the European Union must continue to be among the leaders in this project .
We must stick to our original bid of minus 15 % by the year 2010 .
Energy-saving solutions are being developed and they will certainly have got an extra thrust from Kyoto .
Thus the European Union has a very great responsibility in this matter and a major task ahead .
Namely , the Finnish government .
Finland imagines she will require around another ten years ' transition time to ratify the convention , but I believe that a major breakthrough in Finland has already occurred .
Politicians will certainly do all they possibly can to get Finland to give up the use of all anti-personnel mines .
I myself would rather Finland revised its view of the threat from the outside .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , as has been very clearly shown in these talks , the labelling of packaged genetically modified soya and maize has become a serious problem , which could have been avoided by the Commission and which now we must address without delay .
Consequently , these products can now be marketed with no clear labelling on the packaging , which has led to uncertainty , confusion and understandable concern , as different Member States have gone their own way in the matter , which has caused even more confusion .
Like many of my colleagues , I cannot but wonder why no proposals or guidance were given before the decree came into force .
Now the situation remains vague and awkward for both industry and the consumer .
We are also still in the dark as to scientific criteria which could decide , for example , whether a genetically modified product corresponds exactly to the original .
We all agree on this , certainly .
Too much detail can obscure what the consumer needs to know .
All in all , both the food manufacturer and the consumer have a right to more precise information to increase food safety .
And further research needs to be done on the combined and cumulative effects of genetically modified ingredients and products on the whole food chain .
Madam President , the UN is now taking ten years doing research into natural disasters partly with the aim of developing satellite charting applications for the prediction , charting , and avoidance of natural disasters , and to aid relief and rescue operations .
It involves scientific and technological considerations and civil and military applications .
It will presumably only come together in the first half of the next millennium , and the possibility of building stations on other planets is still a very distant one .
It would be better to put more money into smaller carrier rockets - booster systems - and small-scale satellites .
Every European country would be able to contribute to projects like these .
The role of the Fifth Framework Programme for research funding is important and necessary .
Mr President , Mr Ruffolo speaks of the exchange rate balance between the euro and the dollar .
Today 's basic stability will mean considerable instability for some countries .
It cannot come about in practice , as all countries are different .
So now we are headed for an administrative and not an economic exchange rate and mechanism .
Finland will be brought into EMU only through political force , which our political elite is prepared to use in the spirit of commitment to the Dublin Treaty .
That is why we should have a national referendum on EMU in all those countries which intend to join .
Because there is just no parliamentary or democratic supervision of it .
Mr President , I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that we face a revolution .
Its elements consist of what we speak of here today , the advent of the euro and electronic money .
All these factors together will bring about changes in the behaviourial patterns of the economy .
Hence , there are many unknown factors which can endanger the EU economy .
Mr Friedrich mentions something in his report that may raise our hopes on this issue : when the national currency risk disappears , so too does one factor that affects differentials in interest rates .
It will differ , obviously , from other regional models .
It would thus be very important to create mechanisms to ensure that the European partners , at various times in their recent history engulfed in recession , do not get into inordinate economic difficulties .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the
