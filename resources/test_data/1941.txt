Industry plays an important part , developing technologies , expanding the language industry , but the preservation of one 's own language is primarily a cultural matter .
So do not accuse the Green Group of destroying the environment by asking for roll call votes .
Mr President , obviously ornamental horticulture is a sector of high ambitions in many countries which have concluded or would like to conclude a free trade agreement with the European Union .
This was to be done primarily by means of a Community contribution to action funds held by these producer organizations .
Mr President , the Commissioner can count herself fortunate this morning .
Mr President , ornamental horticulture is having a difficult time at present .
Together with the 40 million ECU which the private organizations themselves spend on marketing and promotion , that makes an available total of 100 million ECU which is still well below the 2 % of the value of the trade which the Commission recommended for this objective in an earlier study .
Let us not forget either that this fund is the only form of European aid to ornamental horticulture .
This attitude is hardly helpful to the ornamental horticulturalists .
Slovakia , Mr President , has seen unexpectedly positive economic development : economic growth of 5 to 6 % , a sizeable improvement in the balance of payments - from a one billion dollar deficit in 1993 to a small surplus in 1995 - and a rapid fall in inflation .
Broad dialogue with the Slovak authorities would appear appropriate .
I think it is very important in the near future , if the door is not to be shut in Slovakia 's face , to encourage NGOs from the West and from Slovakia to contact each other and try jointly to get a dialogue going from the bottom up .
So for the longer term not all the economic signals are green .
Mr President , the Liberal Group fully endorses Mr Valdivielso 's report , and I compliment him on it .
A provisional objective solution seems to have been reached with the agreement on a phased plan based on scientific criteria .
The networks were put forward at the Edinburgh Summit at the end of 1992 to strengthen the internal market and as a boost for employment .
The blocking by Greece of the MEDA regulation with regard to the Mediterranean policy might be added to that .
With a Union of 20 or more countries and more majority decisions that phenomenon can only increase .
So as far as that is concerned I should like to congratulate the Italian presidency .
What is the reason ?
Then there is one great potential danger - that we adopt a number of measures , and the trans-European networks are one of them , where we say : Money must be found for that , but actually there is none .
The one big danger is , I think , that this might be regarded as a solution .
In my opinion we have not so far had any concrete decisions giving any 'body ' for example to Mr Santer 's confidence pact .
The Molitor Group made a fundamental mistake by resorting to casuistry and identifying themselves a little too much with the point of view of employers in general with the wishes of those who want the minimum legislation possible .
We cannot bring out any proper coherent legislation in that way .
European business circles have long been demanding an internal market , the market in which a large number of national laws are collected into uniform EC legislation .
Finally I very much regret that Commissioner Monti is not here , because we have an anniversary to celebrate today , not the Commissioner 's birthday , but the fact that it is precisely one year since the Commissioner promised me in reply to a question of mine that we were to get such a right of complaint direct .
It is striking that the Council never makes cuts in nuclear energy or nuclear fusion programmes .
My group asks the Commission and the Council why we do not export these gas-fired surplus power-stations to the Ukraine where they can soon be supplying electricity .
It is not so much that the means are not there , but those related projects connected with the eradication of poverty , and dealing with environmental issues and population growth , those flanking measures do not get off the ground because not enough staff are available .
I think it is of great importance too for the Commissioner to tell us how he would like to change this organization to give shape to projects of this kind in the future .
Things are very tragic and that is not the way in which we want to put the brake on population growth if I may put it like that , so , Commissioner , we hope more can be done to link those projects to the field covering AIDS prevention .
I think that is much more important than old traditional patterns of family planning because they , as has been clear for a long time , do not work all that well .
I must say that these are not only the Islamic countries .
I should also like to know from the Commission if it can indicate more precisely which of the countries to which it gives aid are guilty of this .
There has already been mention of Barcelona where it became very clear , where one country refused to follow a female standardbearer .
The International Olympic Committee shrouded itself in silence and even gave way to the blackmail of Iran , which did not want a woman to carry its standard at the official opening .
Secondly we call upon
