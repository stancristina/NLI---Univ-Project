That is why the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats is calling for the rejection of the common position and is requesting a vote .
We hope that Turkey will make substantial progress in the coming years .
We have stated quite clearly that the use of the Kurdish language - also in the media - and the fostering of , and the opportunity to express , Kurdish identity are key factors in changing the political conditions in Turkey as well .
Let me make one last comment : in the coming years , we will all have to push hard for real new money to be made available to Turkey , which is now a candidate country - and indeed to the other candidates for accession - rather than merely bundling the existing programmes together .
It is not an attempt to pursue the application for EU membership towards its proper goal ; it is an end in itself , in order to secure financial resources , to utilise the benefits conferred by the Customs Union , or even to ensure that the criticism of the situation in Turkey is toned down .
This would have two consequences .
As far as the two programmes are concerned , I wish I could agree with my colleague Mr Stenzel , but I must also point out that it is not enough for us to view the 177 million already envisaged for the pre-accession strategy as a general framework .
This is the strongest productive force that Europe can release .
If we can achieve all this , then we will surely manage to give every schoolchild in the European Union access to the Internet .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are living in an age of globalisation and digitalisation , and we talk about a knowledge-based society .
We also need to make more effort in the area of high technology .
An example is water .
Of course , the truth lies in coming up with an intelligent combination of the two approaches .
So , on this point , Germany , the biggest country in Europe , is showing itself to be incapable of meeting the new challenges as the most attractive economic area in the world .
For that reason , there is no alternative but to introduce structural reforms in the goods , services , capital and labour markets , which must lead to increased output potential and productivity .
I hope they are as good as their word .
Here , Europe can only make a contribution through dialogue ; it is not empowered to make decisions .
Madam President , I would willingly have gone along with Mr Corbett ' s suggestion but , since everybody else is doing it , my financial interests are obvious .
Then there were 90 pages ; today there are 150 .
But we are disappointed that the principle of the best available technique is not incorporated into this report .
The checks and balances within intracommunity trade , which have been created by necessary laws , are inadequately enforced by the controls which are currently in place .
I also believe that the work of the European Central Bank in other areas is of great importance , especially where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned .
It is undignified for preparatory documents on Summit meetings to be slipped surreptitiously into Parliament , and often not before they have first been made available to the press .
But we want economic and social cohesion in the Community and active labour market policies , which are reflected in the four pillars of the Luxembourg process .
The transformation of our society into a service and knowledge-based society is making great strides forward .
From what I have heard , I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will follow suit .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs Peijs , I would first like to wholeheartedly thank the rapporteur for her work and for her clear explanations , which once again spelt out to us what this directive is all about .
In this , Macao is of great importance because , in this region , a European cultural tradition has become intermingled with an Asian tradition and a whole host of thoughts about human rights and freedom has sprung up .
For us , the agreement with Mexico has a high priority .
What is more , this works in both directions .
I say this as Vice-President of the Delegation for Relations with Central America and Mexico .
We should not ignore the fact that , sadly , even today , tens of thousands of people have to flee from various forms of persecution and war .
I am also convinced that , during the course of this year , working jointly with the Commission , we will be successful .
We should insist that the knowledge of large companies and the research findings of scientific foundations and institutions be passed on to the universities and recycled from there into the business world through incubators in order to create new jobs and new businesses .
Research means taking risks , and some of these risks will inevitably be financial .
All I can say is ' Have fun ! '
This , in turn , would mean an increase rather than a decrease in production incentives , which would also tend to undermine the environmental safeguards .
We cannot accept these amendments , because they would mean the existence of two different sets of rules for producers ' organisations as well as two different funding systems .
This was the basis on which the Commission drew up its proposal .
These producers have made good use of the money we have provided over the past ten years and a number of them will surely also be able to benefit
