Aid , including that given by the European Union , must be provided under the aegis of the United Nations .
Mrs Buitenweg addressed the issue of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation .
It would certainly be premature to give precise figures for the amendments that we will be proposing , but I am already able to tell you something about the important factors that make these changes necessary .
I would also like to respond to the accusation that we are continuing to fund the tobacco sector .
I agree with the statement in Mrs Langenhagen 's report that fisheries agreements should be endowed with appropriate funding and that their budgets should be as transparent as possible .
It would be fatal if the forces that want to put things back the way they were were to prevail , as the Structural Funds criteria for rural areas are not very favourable .
Not only have we learned that from the Consumers International report , but the Court of Auditors has also enjoined us to take good note of it .
( Applause )
The first is that it is , in my view , unacceptable that the Commission 's administration does not reflect what the budgetary authority wants .
We need more jobs - sustainable jobs - and we also want to promote training - training with qualifications - and strengthen its role in the Member States , while at the same time offering businesses incentives to discharge their obligations .
Whilst we have heard that in many contributions to today 's debate , we know that we are directly affected by many developments on the international stage , one example being Basel II .
When I compare that figure with the numbers required in the Member States and compare the quality involved , I can say loud and clear and with a clear conscience that the service is first-rate .
I can speak for my group when I say that no , we would not , even though our hearts are in the right place where the associated problems are concerned and there is adequate awareness of the problems associated with it .
The support package amounts to EUR 2.8 billion .
Commissioner Bolkestein also made it very clear that this minimum solution is a small breakthrough , but that the European Union has not actually succeeded in a consistent approach to energy taxation .
Mr President , the thirty-nine data elements that we have been dealing with today can be divided into three categories .
The road has been long and , in parts , an arduous one , but we have now found a compromise that reflects the whole House , that reflects opinion , and we should do our best to ensure that , in this week 's vote , the compromise as such is no longer challenged , but that there are only editorial changes to be made .
That being so , I hope that the compromise , which was reached through very tough negotiations in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , will encourage the Council to come to similar compromises so that this important legislative act on implementing an integrated financial services market can actually be passed in this term .
If the financial institutions concerned achieve this , then so much the better , it is in the interests of the customer .
Firstly , investor protection .
I believe that the democratic principle has also been decisively strengthened .
I believe that we have to introduce this into the equation , just as we also have to make it clear that , in structural cooperation in defence and in other areas , when some go on ahead , the door must always be open for others who want to join in at a later date , and that we must put no new obstacles in their way .
Many governments are now calling for a 'real ' Intergovernmental Conference ; this is a dangerous threat , and one founded on very dubious legitimacy .
If , at this historic moment , we make the wrong choice , we will be leading Europe into a crisis .
Mr President , I would like to add a footnote to the discussion .
I might add that the same applies to other aspects .
You can just imagine how they will again be haggling , the sort of cattle market it will turn into , and things can , in fact , only get worse .
Just as a planet 's gravitational pull captures everything that draws close to it , the courage of six states has resulted in a process of cooperation that has been spreading and becoming more profound right up to the present day .
Will this draft by the Convention give us fair and , above all , truly transparent decision-making structures ?
Is the draft so clear and comprehensible that young people will be able to get to grips with it and get some idea of what Europe is ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to urge you most earnestly to adopt the recommendations drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , that the EU had to respond to the enormous increase in the number of patent applications in this area is not a matter of doubt , nor is there any doubt about the fact that these must not be allowed to be detrimental to the interests of small software companies .
In the EU , we agreed , at the beginning of the 1990s , to lay down only minimum rates and to retain unanimity in the Council on matters relating to this .
