Mrs Fontaine and all her predecessors have already expressed their support and asked for them to be released and sent to Greece .
The Bureau should call for his release before he , too , gives up the ghost .
New knowledge about human genetics will help us understand at which points genetic dynamics are vulnerable and open to environmental factors and pressure and the way in which we live , thereby allowing us to develop new strategies for the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of illnesses .
So we can look forward at some point in the future to the beneficial medical applications which this research promises .
Mr President , it is mankind 's misfortune , in my view , that recent discoveries in the field of biotechnology have come at a time when the capitalist system still prevails .
In all events , ladies and gentlemen , we must proceed very cautiously with genetic engineering .
We also face the depraved phenomenon of applications for patents on living organisms and human genomes .
The Fiori report contains interesting and useful views on a number of questions .
Mr President , when we decided , about a year ago , to set up the temporary parliamentary committee on human genetics and other new technologies in modern medicine , we did not for a minute imagine that the vote in question would coincide with statements by Heads of State , scientists , private companies and other interested parties .
It was easy to reach a broad consensus on these issues .
The lack of any international framework or regulations for applying this research and the risk of embryos being created in obscenely large or commercial numbers were behind some of the relatively strong reservations .

It is perfectly clear that the horrendous events of 11 September have been used as a pretext to speed up the application of political decisions taken a long time ago .
The real aim here is to terrorise any civil resistance or disobedience movements and the parties proactively opposing and reacting to political and capitalist globalisation as a whole or certain aspects of it .
The framework decision on the European arrest warrant , the legality of which is open to question , undermines the sovereign rights of the Member States and contradicts Articles 5 ( 2 ) , 6 and 7 of the Greek constitution .
The abolition of double indemnity , the facility to extradite a national to another state , the facility for the state to which the accused has been extradited to extradite him ( without the permission of the state which extradited him in the first place ) to a third country which is not a Member State of the European Union ( for example , a Kurd is extradited by Greece to Germany , which then extradites him to Turkey without asking Greece ) contradict basic principles of criminal law .
