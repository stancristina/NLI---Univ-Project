The way he put it was to say that we cannot continue to provide aid in this form .
The second problem is that EU legislation and administration is still not good enough .
I was talking recently with a Danish expert who works for a private firm and for the EU in the former Yugoslavia , and he reported that the aid provided by the World Bank , the EBRD and the EIB is monitored quite differently .
In contrast , the EU lets things slide .
When the money is used , all is well .
My group supports this report .
We have found ways of reprioritising under the Commission ’s proposal and of making savings in relation to the latter .
It is , of course , precisely in these areas that we must invest significantly more of the EU’s budgetary means .
That is why it is all the sadder that it is specifically in these areas that the EU’s Heads of State or Government are considering wielding the axe in order to make cuts .
It is precisely from these areas , where common efforts really could strengthen the EU’s competitiveness , that they are withdrawing and are saving amounts that , seen in a larger context , are exceedingly modest .
Those of us in the ALDE Group are particularly pleased about the greater resources Parliament is setting aside for asylum and legal policy and for the common foreign policy .
Legal policy is a rapidly growing area , and it is important for a large enough framework to be set aside for us to be able to respond to new needs over the next eight years .
A lot can happen in eight years .
This is shown by experiences in recent years , when we suddenly had to find money for Kosovo , Afghanistan , Serbia and Iraq and , most recently , for the victims of the tsunami .
We have attached particular importance to there being adequate resources for supporting the enlarged EU’s new neighbours .
Agricultural policy and support for poor regions in the old Member States will continue to account for a lot of the budget .
The EU budget still amounts to only approximately one per cent of gross national income , and it cannot be claimed that the amounts we are now debating are going to be the source of a budget crisis in any Member State .
I agree with Mr Böge when he says that we also want Parliament to provide a solution , but not at any price .
We are obliged to find a solution so that the structural fund programmes designed to develop the economies of the new Member States can be got under way on 1 January 2007 .
Not to achieve a result and not to display a willingness to negotiate would simply be contemptible .     Mr President , the Constitution is dead in France and buried in the Netherlands , yet the Council’s otherwise decent President-in-Office is behaving like a body snatcher in wanting to continue with the process of ratifying the rejected document .
Start afresh .
This Parliament’s Referendum Group would be happy to be involved .
Read our proposal .
They were supported by 80 % of the electorate and opposed by only 12 % .
Use your ears , listen to the electorate and do come to our press conference at 4 p.m .     Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , the greatest task for the European Council in a week’s time is to create clarity , more clarity and yet more clarity .
With a whole series of referenda , there is a risk of setting a self-perpetuating spiral of ‘no’ votes in motion .
What , moreover , I fear , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , is that , if no clarity is brought about , the real choice we shall face will be that between being satisfied with the Treaty of Nice and gaining a little more time ; and , if I have to choose between being satisfied with the Treaty of Nice and gaining a little more time to think through how we resolve the situation , I prefer to have more time .
We cannot live with the Treaty of Nice .
We cannot solve the problems using the Treaty of Nice .
Mr President , we can hold all the conventions and present all the treaty documents we like , but that will not help if we do not tackle the real problems in Europe .
Our greatest task now , under the British Presidency – and I really do think we have received some very exciting signals from Prime Minister Tony Blair – is to combine people’s need for social protection with new jobs in a globalised world .
That would be the most important signal of all that we are not incapable of making decisions but that we take people’s concerns seriously .     Mr President , there are 90 of us who , as MEPs , have signed a motion of censure on the Commission , because it was the only way we had ...     Mr President , there are 90 of us who , as MEPs , have signed a motion of censure ...     Mr President , the problem is that there are 90 of us who , as MEPs , have signed a motion of censure on the Commission , because it was the only way we had of getting the President of the Commission to come here to Parliament and explain the connection between a gift of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 25 000 and a subsequent decision to provide EUR 10 million in regional aid to his friend .
We were given an explanation , but Parliament’s President has in the meantime decided that , contrary to the wish expressed in the motion itself , we must
