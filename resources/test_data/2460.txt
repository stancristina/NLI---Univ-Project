There is no need to go into all that again .
Madam President , I will end by saying that I both know what Turkey must do to become a member of the European Union , and assure you that I wish for it .
I refer to Kosovo .
If these events continue , they may trigger chain reactions .
The absolutely unacceptable and foolish violence exercised by Belgrade and the atrocities by the Liberation Army must be stopped by any possible means , and a satisfactory solution must be sought for Kosovo without the right to break away , as the President-in-Office said .
There is one thing we must all realise : there is no military solution to the problems faced by the Balkans and Kosovo , the only chances lie in the direction of a peaceful political solution .
Whom is the European Union supporting with that attitude ?
There is an initiative by Mr Hill who , according to the press , has brought the Milosevic and Rugova sides very close together , and we should support him .
What was done after the Dayton agreement should happen again .
There is a precedent .
Mr President , I must say that the President-in-Office quite disarmed me with her answer , with which I do not at all agree .
The latest Eurostat figures show that unemployment affects women more , with an average throughout the European Union of 12.3 % compared with 8.9 % for men .
Mrs Marinucci 's proposals provide answers to these very complex issues , since new initiatives must clearly be adopted to reduce the inequality which continues to exist between women and men , even in here .
It is right to condemn violence , whatever its source , but we cannot pursue a policy of keeping our distance equally from both sides , because we are then doing nothing to help the development of the democratic institutions , and the problem in Albania is that one party - Mr Berisha 's party - does not accept the election results , a thing which we would consider totally undemocratic if it happened in one of our countries .
That government has achieved some important steps .
That is the opportunistic and irresponsible way in which Mr Berisha is behaving , with his inflammatory statements and actions .
We cannot undermine the legitimacy of the elected Albanian government by keeping equal distance from it and from the armed factions which dispute it , calling for new governments in which the armed groups too participate .
Mr President , the facts and results of the forest fires in Greece are well known , and are mentioned in the resolution we are debating , which I of course support .
It is not acting as it should .
I would also like to thank all those who , from Italy , Germany , France and Russia , by sending pilots and aircraft , helped us this summer to keep the vast damage due to forest fires in our country down to the minimum possible .
It merely gave the green light to enable disciplinary proceedings to take place , and that is when it will be ascertained whether or not he is guilty of the injustice for which he is being denounced .
Mr President , the action of which he is accused is rather similar to money laundering .
The vast worldwide economic crisis , which is still very much alive and shows no sign of coming to an end , is most evident in the stock markets and the financial credit system , but it will soon have a direct impact on working people , with higher unemployment , lower disposable incomes , drastic cut-backs of consumption and international trade , and a significant fall in production all over the world .
At a time when the world 's economic leaders , under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund , are debating how to deal with the impact of the crisis , even to some extent , the European Parliament and the European Union persist in applying old and outdated prescriptions .
Who is to impose political and democratic control on the uncontrolled European Central Bank ?
I gather that the Commission feels the same , in other words that there is an element of deceit in relation to the management of the Community 's budget and the Union 's Member States , while on the other hand there is an internal issue regarding what is going on in the Community 's various institutions and whether those Community institutions and their services are functioning as they should do .
We are obliged to respond to and verify what the Court of Auditors says .
At this point , I should also like to say that in our cooperation with UCLAF over the past two years , there were occasions when UCLAF came along , we asked for information , and we were told that the information could not be given because the upper echelons of UCLAF would not allow UCLAF to give us information .
I quite agree with you , Mrs McNally , that this is a particularly important and topical objective , especially since we are operating in the context of negotiations based on the commitments we entered into in Kyoto .
The difference of opinion between the Commission and the Spanish companies concerns the fact that the Commission , with a view to ensuring transparency , took into account the true level of production , while Spain took account of a theoretical approach to production .
We did not call for additional cut-backs , and I repeat that we will continue to deal with this issue with the greatest possible degree of social sensitivity , recognising the special problems which exist in the Asturias region .
From then on
