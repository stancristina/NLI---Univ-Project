While recognising the importance of this aspect of legal immigration in quantitative terms , it is also important to stress the fundamental role played by family reunification as a necessary means for achieving the integration of third-country nationals legally residing in the European Union .
The proposal as presented today for the approval of this Parliament , includes as members of the family the partner of the person in question , as well as the unmarried partner recognised in the Member State , regardless of the sex ; the minor children of the person in question and of their partner , including adopted children ; the minor children , also including adopted children of the person in question and their partner when one of them has the right to custody and is caring for them ; but we have not accepted the exception relating to children of over 12 years old according to which the Member State could examine whether or not they comply with integration criteria before authorising their entry and residence in accordance with the directive .
With regard to the entry and residence of family members , we propose bringing the right to access to education , employment and professional training into line with that of members of the family of the person in question and not to that of the citizens of the Union .
Mr President , before beginning my speech , I would propose the following exercise , both to the people who are present and to those who are absent , because there is nobody here from the Council , although there should be .
We therefore accept many of the new proposals presented to us , we accept the basis on which they are founded , we accept the idea of having to demonstrate the capacity to maintain the family , we are prepared to wait for an agreement on a new proposal on subsidiary protection , but there are certain things which , despite everything , we cannot accept .
Is it reasonable to create so much disquiet amongst people who we want to live within our society ?
It focuses on the contribution economic policies can make to the Union 's strategic objective established in Lisbon .
This approach , however , does not represent a radical break with the past , since the basic strategy implemented over recent years , particularly since Lisbon , is still valid .
These guiding principles respond to the agreement on the strengthening of the coordination of budgetary policies laid down in the Commission 's Communication last November .
Naturally , these measures must be supplemented with active labour market measures in order to assist in job-finding .
It is therefore necessary to combine the legislative instruments with others based on the market .
Mr President , today 's debate relates to the broad economic policy guidelines for generating more employment in Europe .
The Commissioner has spoken about setting objectives in an area in which those objectives should be of a national nature .
And finally , what does the Commission intend to do when the Drugs system of generalised preferences expires in 2004 ?
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Commission , because I have the impression - from its answers to various questions - that in relation to the Spanish national hydrological plan , it has so far been able to distinguish between the technical and the legal problems .
With regard to the content , I will focus on just two points .
The time has not yet come to create a legal basis for the drawing up of the programmes , but the Convention and the future Intergovernmental Conference provide the opportunity to support the idea that the future Constitution should include - within the democratic life of the European Union - a reference to the citizens ' right to information , so that they may be genuine citizens .
That is why I believe that this report on the European Union 's information strategies and subsequent implementation of the programmes are so important and vital to the citizens of the Union .
In the Andreasen report this Parliament has already defined , together with the Commission , an information strategy intended to reach all the citizens .
The priority tasks for the Commission , for the European media and for opinion-formers in general - including us in this Parliament - must be empowering the European political area , the development of a European image and identity , strengthening - as the Commissioner has said - a core of common values , the debate on the future of Europe and the European approach in all types of information .
Another point which I believe to be extremely important , and which I believe must also be revised , and in relation to which this document introduces a very clear request , is the issue of languages .
And in view of the new technologies and the current capacity for communication , the citizens will not feel connected with these institutions unless they can participate in dialogue .
But we also appeal to the responsibility of the workers of Parliament 's administration to in turn respect the event taking place today .
We therefore believe , Mr President , that we must continue with our agenda at this historic moment .
There were two equally valid alternatives : to consider the presence of Annex XV as an implicit violation of the interinstitutional agreement and act accordingly , pursuant to Article 172 - and this will explain the final vote of certain Members - or to negotiate with the Council .
Furthermore , we have achieved a new situation for Turkey , in heading 7 , which
