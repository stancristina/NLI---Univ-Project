The winner is selfish interest and the loser is solidarity , and without the latter there cannot be a sense of belonging and a notion of a European entity .
I therefore address my last words to the Council .
There is one issue that I should like to bring to the fore : that of development aid in the context of the Millennium Goals .
Around 25 000 human beings die every die of starvation or thirst .
Parliament will then have established a clear vision for the Union and its financing for the coming years .
Rather , we should show that the Union remains a dynamic political force , strong enough to continue its work in the face of difficulties .
I would hope that we can resist , or at least minimise , that temptation .
The Luxembourg presidency has led discussions into their final phase .
I hope an agreement will be reached that shows that Europe is maintaining its ambition and solidarity .
For a democrat , that is a positive element in itself .
We must reconnect the EU with the citizens and the citizens with the EU.
Twenty-five governments signed the Constitutional Treaty .
That is why I asked them to wait for next week’s European Council to adopt a position .
The first inappropriate solution would be to say that nothing has happened , that everything can continue – business as usual – as if these two negative votes in such important countries had never happened .
There is no administrative , bureaucratic or technocratic solution .
It has never existed .
Admittedly , the results of the two referenda last week constitute a serious problem , but it is not the first time that Europe has encountered problems and it will certainly not be the last .
In the coming days and weeks , we will have to join together to manage a complex situation .
That is why we have launched the initiative ‘Better regulation’ .
Europe is created in compromise and by compromise , and it is above all the responsibility of the representatives of the Member States to explain that and to argue in favour of Europe instead of exploiting national egotism in a way that is negative to our Europe .
Neither of the two , neither the god of the market nor the god of the State , will solve Europe’s problems .
That is why I think it is vital to transform this period of crisis into a period favourable to opportunities and to take advantage of it to forge a new political consensus .
I call for unity around European values , around , we could say , the European culture , around our European spirit , so that , together , we can build a new political consensus , both dynamic and constructive , a consensus that will make it possible to avoid Europe becoming the first victim of globalisation , but , on the contrary , will enable Europe to win this battle of globalisation .
The Commission , and more importantly Parliament , must take action to ensure , once and for all , that subsidiarity is properly implemented across the board .
In other words , nobody wants this hot potato , until such time as a magic formula has been discovered to save the ‘European Constitution’ , be it revamped or otherwise .
Consequently , the purpose of this attack on him , which is devoid of any ethical basis , is simply to undermine a Community institution .
We say no because what we need is to make a clean break from the EU’s neoliberal policies and , on the basis of cooperation between equal sovereign States , to foster sustainable economic development , create jobs and combat persistently high levels of unemployment , poverty , social exclusion and income inequality .
My vote should therefore be seen as a vote in favour of continuing talks so that the EU’s obligations on cohesion and solidarity can be met , and so that the financial needs arising from the enlargement and from a broader range of powers can be met , without that resulting in directing losses for the other budget headings , such as the Structural Funds allocations .     .
This is especially true inasmuch as the issue at stake here is consumer activities rather than business activities , as has been clearly stated .     .
Parliament must be genuinely involved in drawing up legislation . - effectiveness : Objectives , priorities and responsibilities must be clearly set out , whilst ensuring that efforts are not duplicated and not spread too thinly .
It is crucial that we adopt an integrated and consistent approach to the fight against discrimination and xenophobia and that we derive maximum benefit from exchanging experiences and best practice .
All forms of discrimination are unacceptable , but we cannot force any Member State to change its legislation to accept situations that run counter to their moral and cultural traditions .
I feel that on issues such as these , I repeat , both shortfall and surplus are detrimental .
The theatres of strategic operations have changed , but the real difference is in the perception of threats on both sides of the Atlantic ; and if the perception of threats has changed , then so too must the strategies and operating methods .
It is appalling that social dumping and environmental dumping , which jeopardise jobs in Europe and are at the heart of unfair competition , can be allowed to continue unchecked in the world and to continue to act to our detriment .
Current economic and social reality bears out our stance .
The Council therefore reaffirms the aims of the Stability Pact and its benchmarks , and prevents any expenditure from being excluded from the deficit calculation .
The Council and the Commission recently took steps to tackle this dilemma , including the relaunch of the Pact and the regulations that we are discussing
