I would ask the Commissioner whether such a suggestion has been discussed .
We must be able to locate criminal material , which should not have to be a job for the police .
When a third party sends information , that party can obviously be made liable for the bill , and liability should extend also to cases where a crime has been committed .
It is quite correct , as my colleagues have stated here , that resolve on the part of the European Parliament has had its effect on this outcome .
However , today , it has to be said , the situation is perhaps more explosive than it has been for a long time , as paramilitary activity has jeopardised the forthcoming referendum .
For this to happen , the European Union should participate in an international effort to guarantee an international presence in East Timor .
The other important issue is that there are soon to be parliamentary elections in Indonesia , and preparations for the East Timor referendum are under way .
Finally , I would like to say that there has been a seamless bond of cooperation among the Members of the European Parliament on the question of East Timor .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the delegation to the Conciliation Committee for a very successfully drafted report .
It is a most pleasurable opportunity to say this on a day like today , the penultimate day of this parliamentary term .
The directive which went to conciliation is important for small companies , and , hence , the issue of employment .
By reducing the amount of data that has to be provided on statistics on trade , we are making an important difference to those SMEs which do not have the resources to produce and maintain complicated sets of statistics .
If we can continue to simplify matters for them in the areas of thresholds and obstacles , that will be a good thing .
This being the case , the single currency will be of great benefit to SMEs , lowering , as it will , the degree of risk they encounter in the single market .
During the conciliation process Parliament also had the opportunity to send a political message to the Commission on another matter that was being dealt with .
Now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has been in force for just under a week and the role of the codecision procedure is growing in importance , perhaps we have reason to congratulate ourselves , Parliament , and the triumph of democracy .
We would especially like to thank you , Mr President , for the fact that you were always happy to welcome us Finns in the Finnish language , which you pronounce so elegantly , and for the fact too that you were always ready to guide and encourage us , as we were new to the procedure of this House .
Thank you .
Madam President , I would like to warmly congratulate you on behalf of the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance in the European Parliament .
The question of rules for Members , for example , is a very important issue .
It is now our mutual task to represent the nations of Europe here , so that they too can have a say in the affairs of the European Union .
Madam President , I would like to congratulate you on your being elected to your challenging post .
Madam President , I can assure you here and now , and I shall say it again this evening when , in this same Chamber I officially present the programme that Finland intends to adopt while it holds the presidency , that our goal is a closer system of co-operation between Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
Madam President , I have come here today in token of my respect for the power bestowed on Parliament by the citizens of Europe and to offer my sincerest co-operation in building a better future for our citizens , bearing in mind all the while that we are part of a common world .
Applause
Ladies and gentlemen , the challenges of the German Presidency showed very clearly just how difficult and complex the world we live in is .
The situation in the Western Balkans clearly shows that Europe needs a more effective course of action to ensure stability in this continent .
It is important during the Finnish presidential term to get a clear indication of just how determined the EU is to make headway in the enlargement process .
For that reason we must make a serious effort to introduce inter alia much-needed institutional reforms .
We all certainly hope the crisis is a prelude to a genuine series of reforms in respect of the way things are done , not only in the Commission , but in the Council and in Parliament also .
We must be particularly careful that national political passions do not predominate over the common European interest .
A healthy rate of employment is also essential for the equitable development of our societies .
That will be vital in ensuring that the employment rate rises .
I believe it is morally wrong that the representative of the Greens/European Free Alliance was not selected , and I hope that the Group of the Party of European Socialists will consider this matter among themselves .
In addition , I would like to congratulate you once more , Madam President , on being elected .
As requested by yourselves , I shall deal in particular with the situation in the Western Balkans and the death sentence passed on the Kurdish leader Öçalan .
I completely agree with him .
Not just the Commission , but the whole European Union , must
