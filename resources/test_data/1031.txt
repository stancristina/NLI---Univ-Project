My question to the Commission is therefore : how can we ensure that we are not fighting a rearguard action today ?
Secondly , protecting small private investors .

Mr President , I am speaking here on behalf of those who dream of a truly united Europe of regions and peoples , a Europe that the proposed constitution will not bring about .
At least a certain balance has been achieved in these texts .
No, but perfection is not in any case within the grasp of human beings .
We can , however , establish that the Convention has achieved more than the amendments to the Treaties of Maastricht , Amsterdam and Nice together .
As I have already said , the result is good , but it is not perfect .
First of all , I should like to express my surprise at the fact that some , including the Dutch Government , argue in favour of including God - Christianity - in the European constitution .
That does nothing to help our citizens ; on the contrary , it puts them at a distance .
( NL ) The Vlaams Blok ( 'Flemish Block ' ) opposes the patentability of computer-implemented inventions , it having been found in practice that software patents stifle the innovation capacity of small and medium-size enterprises in the IT industry .
They build in technical restrictions , tie buyers to restricting contracts , try to collect enormous damages and demand legal protection by the authorities .

In many cases , employers do not want to employ people over the age of 55 .
It is not only about defending each other 's territory against outside attackers together , but also about being able to intervene in defence of our own interests outside of NATO 's and the EU 's territories .
The European Union can protest as much as it wants against Sharon 's adopted policy ; the real change has to happen in Israel itself , where gradually , people are realising that they are heading the wrong way .
Is it not time to win respect in the Arab world , now that the situation in Iraq is continually deteriorating ?
Officially , the President of the Palestinian Authority is very much the relevant political interlocutor for the European institutions .
For what is left of it ?
I see it as Europe 's responsibility to sit down with both parties to find out their real intentions and to stop collaborating with a regime that is using military means to eradicate part of a powerless nation and is trying to kill its elected president .
On the contrary , we must use our joint goodwill and energy much more to help establish reconciliation and lasting peace .
We are increasingly questioning the functioning of multilateral organisations and in the final analysis , it is the least developed countries that are the victim in this .
We have met plenty of people in the corridors , including MEPs and Ministers , of whom we had the feeling that they were insufficiently informed of the EU position on agriculture .
Furthermore , my group has expressed some surprise at the behaviour of some NGOs - sadly also funded by the EU - in connection with what we see as their not very constructive role concerning the WTO .
Bilateral relations only lead to the suffering of the weakest .
This is why global rules for protection are necessary .
We cannot afford to wait and see , for the US is on a unilateral mission .
Furthermore , reinforced financial support for the transfer of knowledge and the development of production capacity in the developing countries is needed , as well as priorities in political contacts and the debate with the new alliance .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the general disappointment at the failure of the WTO negotiations in Cancún is evident , and the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party too is of the opinion that this negative outcome is a missed opportunity .
This appears to me to be a serious misconception , and , on behalf of my group , I concur with what was said by Mr van Velzen , who also spoke highly of the work of our Commissioners .
They , at least some of them , once again demonstrated their dubious role in Cancún by cheering on the sidelines when the negotiations had failed .
We talk so often about the re-use of public sector information , saying 'it was agreed in Lisbon that the European Union should become 'the most competitive ? knowledge-based ? society in the world ' .
Nevertheless , we have to accept the fact that reality is far more difficult than we should like .
We have managed to achieve this at the second reading , and I am extremely happy about that .
We wanted a situation in which information follows promptly after submission of a request .
We are going to carry out an evaluation in three years ' time , and I hope that the Council will then have progressed slightly , and that we are really going to take the Lisbon objectives very seriously .
There is enormous unexplored potential , which could create a large number of jobs if exploited commercially , particularly via SMEs : small and medium-sized enterprises .
That is undesirable , as it creates unlimited possibilities for the authorities to make a profit : after all , who decides what is 'reasonable ' ?
Mr Cashman and I have worked together on openness a great deal in recent years .
That would be a good thing for the citizens of those Member States , and also for the citizens who call on EU documents , because it would mean that they had equal
