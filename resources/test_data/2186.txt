creating better drugs with the help of biotechnology , naturally taking moral and ethical dimensions into account .
We want to develop eEurope and combat the digital divide so that IT benefits everyone .
Fifthly in Stockholm , we must include the ecological point of view which was lacking in the Lisbon strategy and build a bridge to the summit in Gothenburg .
In its presidency , Sweden will actively work to ensure that the introduction of euro notes and coins , which is to take place in the currency union in early 2002 , is an unqualified success .
As usual , the European Council will also discuss current issues in foreign policy , such as the Middle East , the western Balkans and the Korean peninsula .
The European Parliament has constantly been a driving force in all these issues and , through its combination of a popular mandate and Europe-wide responsibility , will also play a central role in the work for the future .
On the one hand , they were characterised by a clearly right-wing financial policy of deregulation and privatisation and , on the other hand , by a left-wing policy of full employment , which thus , for the first time , became an official goal for the EU.
Now , the picture has become clearer , and I see that disagreement on financial policy remains .
The Stockholm Summit was to have employment as its main issue , but there are no proposals for meaningful action to combat the major unemployment which currently affects 14 - 15 million people .
However , the proposals are primarily aimed at increasing the level of employment , not at lowering unemployment .
The Swedish Government should naturally also be concerned but , unlike France and Portugal , it has chosen not to create its own profile but instead to implement what the Commission and the large Member States want as loyally as possible .
This is taking place despite the fact that the economy is sound , despite a majority of left-wing governments in the Council and despite a left-wing majority in the Swedish Parliament .
To conclude , I wonder whether there really is nothing which the Swedish Government could prioritise ahead of the coming employment summit for those who are unemployed here and now .
Sweden has taken part in a number of summits and processes .
Instead , the tax burden is increased and entrepreneurs continue to be hampered .
At the same time , real unemployment is hidden by labour market policy and temporary mass training initiatives which do not lead to quality jobs .
Despite all the talk of lifelong learning , in terms of knowledge , Sweden risks meltdown as we are failing right from the start . 34 % of young people in upper secondary schools lack satisfactory qualifications in mathematics , Swedish and English .
Therefore , the socialists are lowering taxes for rich specialists that have been flown in and raising taxes for permanently resident , poorly-educated Swedes .
However , it is clear that the Council ' s compromise ceiling will not reduce emissions sufficiently for us to be able to achieve the interim environmental objectives by 2010 at the latest .
Consequently , the Council ' s compromise ceiling is , in a few cases , also lower than the Commission ' s proposal and can be seen as anything but ambitious .
Recommendation for Second Reading Miller ( A5-0055/2001 )
The summit linked together a number of policy areas - economic policy , employment and social policy - making them mutually dependent .
We know that both employment and welfare depend on economic growth .
A year ago the Commission submitted an excellent document ahead of Lisbon .
I would have liked to see more attention paid to employment and social policy .
It is particularly important to incorporate the ecological issues .
Firstly , I would like to say that I agree with Mr Suominen that it is important not only to have words , but also to have action .
I agree that it is important for us to combine economic and social measures .
Herman Schmid addressed the problem of there being a "right-wing policy " when we talk about economic goals and economic reforms .
I agree with what Mr Andersson , Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs O' Toole said .
We have already talked about the participation of older people in the labour market .
Mr Harbour complained that I did not address the issue of deregulation .
I agree with this , although we do not perhaps agree entirely on the Swedish social model , but we will no doubt continue to discuss this .
Particularly when we talk about quality of work and the importance of establishing social targets , I believe we have the opportunity to take up this issue of temporary agency work within the framework of the European Council in Stockholm .
I would like to conclude by thanking you for an excellent debate .
This is the opening of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights - the cornerstone of our work for individual freedom , safety and dignity .
Each time alarm bells rang , but the international community often reacted too late .
Let me quote what Mr Hume said in Parliament when he was awarded the Nobel peace prize : " Let us not forget that European Union is the best example , as we have learned , in the history of the world of conflict resolution . "
At the same time , prevention is different to military and civil crisis management in that it is not about reacting to a crisis that has already flared up , but about promoting in good time the fundamental values on which we all agree : that children should be able to go to school instead of to war and that democracy must be established at all levels .
