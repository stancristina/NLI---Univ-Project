Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the group which has put the question and in particular Mr Mayer , since it is very timely .
So far the Commission - we await these reports which it has requested - has mentioned the Nera Report , which guaranteed that the recognition of international exhaustion would not affect prices beyond 2 % .
Firstly , on a very practical level , I believe we should strengthen the services of the Ombudsman , the services of our own secretariat and the services of the European Commission which work closely with us , Commissioner , because sometimes they have difficulties providing us with information on the petitions we send them .
I will end by insisting also that we should investigate procedures aimed at effectively remedying the national authorities ' lack of willingness to cooperate with the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament .
This issue of legitimacy , or the need for the legitimacy of a ratification by the United Nations Security Council , for taking military action , is precisely one of the issues we debated yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs when we voted on a resolution on terrorism .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking the Council and the Commissioner for their words and , of course , congratulating the rapporteurs , Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mrs Bastos .
This impact must also be felt in specific material areas and areas of competence , such as the service economy and the environment and of course , with the participation of social agents , in a fluid and easy communication between the professional and educational sectors , taking particular account of the importance of training and education systems in relation to the development of a culture of mobility , creating horizontal policies , such as policies on equality and others , because the different options are not exclusive and self-contained compartments , but part of a whole , a series of actions intended to develop the European social model and realise the principles that certain visionaries - I say this with respect - perceived more than 50 years ago .
Europe needs Algeria for its creation of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership that turns our southern flank into an area of stability , peace and shared progress in which there is convergence between the economic and social situations of the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean .
Firstly , I would like to express my positive view of the adoption of the qualitative criterion by the committee , and therefore by Parliament , and I hope this will be recognised by the Commission and the Council .
However , what was voted for in the Committee on Regional Policy was not taken up , despite the fact that it appears in the justification .
In this way , the European Union will have dealt with one of its outstanding duties towards those who are suffering , or who may suffer in the future , situations which leave them literally devastated socially , economically and morally .
This directive , which is now happily to see the light , represents a significant qualitative change in relation to previous attempts to achieve the same objectives based exclusively on coordination and voluntary application .
This was not therefore acceptable to Parliament : either in terms of energy saving or in symbolic terms .
In this respect , all of us , Parliament , the Council and the Commission , believe that this is one of the key proposals in terms of trying to comply with our international commitments , and in particular our Kyoto commitments on greenhouse gas emissions .
I believe that the compromise which has finally been achieved , three years for transposition into national legislations , plus another three to make its full application obligatory , is reasonable .
One of them is undoubtedly the trading of emissions allowances .
In accordance with this objective , and for the sake of the future credibility of the system , I would argue that during the first stage the participation of companies should be promoted as much as possible , as well as flexibility in the adaptation of the States , which , as I have said , have transaction costs that differ considerably from one country to another .
The Council , under the Swedish Presidency , even addressed its concerns to Korea .
By acting in this way , it will be easier to prevent expansive fiscal policies when the economy 's growth is strong and therefore we will be able to implement non-restrictive fiscal policies in periods of low growth .
Consequently , this year the budgetary deficits in the zone will be equivalent to more than 2 % of GDP , instead of the 0.9 % forecast .
I am aware that an adjustment is required in these countries in order to achieve a situation of substantial budgetary balance , but I also believe that carrying out this adjustment is crucial so that each country can create sufficient room for manoeuvre for the automatic stabilisers to operate fully .
We have a strategy , the Lisbon Strategy , and it must be applied , and to this end our economic policy must be intelligent .
Well , now we have promises of fiscal reforms , as if they were a lottery for everybody , on the part of the parties of the Right in Europe , and not only in the small countries , Mr Poettering .
The broad guidelines for economic policy must also have a dimension which allows Parliament to participate .
Mr President , this is an attack on the credibility of this Parliament and on the competences of the Committee on Petitions .
As Mrs Almeida Garrett has said , all human work is perfectible and of all human works , legal texts are
