Mr President , I am not the spokesman of the G7 , but I am a member of the G7 .
At that meeting , we agreed upon a programme and strategy intended to lead to the shutting-down of the two reactors at Chernobyl , which do not comply with the safety standards in force in our own countries .
Now I am going to answer your questions , because I have no desire to descend to your level .
I am concerned , perhaps more concerned than you , with our citizens ' concerns and preoccupations .
However , the Blair House agreements have set ceilings on the areas which we may plant with protein plants , so that increasing demand would mean increasing our deficit .
Unemployment cannot be reduced by legislation ; but it can be reduced by a joint effort by all the Member States at different levels , mobilizing all the economic and social actors .
We also need to realize that in the rich countries , in the most prosperous countries in the European Union , there are many people who are excluded or marginalized , and that again is something we have to fight against .
A recent opinion poll in Belgium - one of the founding nations of Europe , like yours , Prime Minister - discloses that state of mind .
Yet , at the same time , if the matter of employment is exclusively one for the Member States , the figures show where that leads .
Within this framework , the structural funds must be allocated differently .
Thousands of jobs .
Back in 1990 , in this very House , I denounced contamination of feeds .
Because we can see the results , everyone says to us , ' Hands off my acquis communautaire , hands off my legislation ' .
At Istanbul , in June 1996 , the world community readopted as a priority objective the strengthening of women 's power to act in all areas and at all levels .
A few days ago , in Lyons , the G7 disclosed a disastrous reduction in public aid to development .
I will however take the liberty of saying , Mrs Fouque , that I am aware of a certain inconsistency between that statement and the continuation of your report .
This is a profoundly shocking finding in terms of that selfdetermination for women to which we are committed .
In 1994 , the Ecofin Council held that , in certain circumstances , the loans granted could be the subject of interest-rate subsidies financed from the Community budget .
Its subject is nothing less than the future of the planet and the satisfaction of ever increasing energy needs .
All of us here know that the road we are currently following in order to meet those needs is a dead-end .
Our colleague Antoinette Fouque is presenting to us here a report following up the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in September 1994 .
The Union has already entered into commitments along these lines , and it would be well for all the Member States to do the same , following the example of our German and Dutch friends .
Ewing report Madam President , I also wish to say that our group is in favour of the Nordmann report being debated during this part-session .
We hope that this report secures the 314 votes required and is adopted during the current part-session .
However , this provision for referral to the Bureau must not seem to negate immediately what has just been adopted .
Consequently , if we wish to ensure an adequate degree of transparency , the GPA must be transposed by means of a supplementary directive which will both contain the exceptions and special arrangements and refer to the existing EU directives on public tendering .
The other amendments essentially concern the Italian version of Article 2( 2 ) and ( 5 ) of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1601/91 , synonyms being added for some descriptions and indications .
I should therefore like to pay tribute to our rapporteur , Mr Martin , for securing such a successful outcome for this draft regulation .
We must weigh up the implications of such action .
In Parliament 's debate on this subject in November 1995 , I stressed the gravity of the likely economic and social repercussions of the directive , which have not been assessed at all by the Commission , and which concern the issues of employment , flexibility , the increase of job insecurity , the jeopardization of public services , the dismantling of staff regulations , the growth of subcontracting and the encouragement of social dumping .
At the present time this type of journey is governed by divergent national provisions , most of which require third country nationals legally present in the territory of another Member State to obtain visas .
Madam President , the three proposals for directives now before us are the Commission 's response to the proceedings brought against it by Parliament in the European Court of Justice for its failure to act in the field of the free movement of persons within the European Union .
The need to safeguard the Union 's security is put forward as an argument for restricting freedom of movement .
The proposals for directives which the Commission is presenting to us today are therefore totally inappropriate .
It is because we respect the Commission 's work , and because the Commission must be above all suspicion , that we wish things to be that way .
The Socialist Group will examine very carefully and calmly the explanation which the President of the Commission has just given to Parliament .
However , as far as I am aware , you did not give a hearing to the author of the note , Mr Castille , who is now in retirement , but
