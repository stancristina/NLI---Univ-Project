Mr President , I therefore wonder whether the European Union is opting for a shipbuilding industry which is strong , dynamic and competitive .
The example not to follow would be that of Buridan' s ass which , while trying to decide whether to eat rye or barley , ended up dying as a result of its doubts .
The plan should include the evacuation and the possibility of an accident which contaminates another Member State , a possible cross-border contamination .
Ladies and gentlemen , your initial jeers , when I condemned this case on 5 July , and your laughter , have simply increased the desire of the Andalusian people to be respected and not to be humiliated with shameful explanations and to be obliged to endure an unnecessary situation of risk .
Those in charge of the submarine tried to have it admitted into a hospital , classified as suitable for providing treatment , of which they were coproprietors , at that time a NATO base .
Then the lies and manoeuvrings began : the lies - or silences - of the person who had admitted it and the lies and silences of the person in charge of health in the area .
I am not being alarmist .
Of course , we await the Commission ' s reply with great interest , in order to see whether the objective has been fulfilled .
In both , we ask the Commission to examine the possibilities contained in the current Treaties to ascertain what opportunities it has to contribute to this issue .
And I would humbly like to advise my Spanish Socialist compatriots to be guided by the general interest .
The evasive response that I received from the Commission on that occasion forced me to ask a second question , on 21 September , urging the Commission to ask the British Government to remove the Tireless to a British port , and also to monitor this issue .
For all these reasons , I believe the Commission must be aware of what an anomalous situation we are dealing with and that , firstly , it must demand an immediate halt to any repairs taking place in Gibraltar .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your reply which contains new and very important information for us .
Until now , despite the information provided by Mr Patten , the citizens have not been aware of the risks in scientific terms , the date of repair or what the repairs are going to consist of .
A debate is taking place there , but the citizens , on the basis of their knowledge or intuition , are turning their attention to the European institutions .
It is considered even more grave that it is being kept there .
The Spanish Government , from the outset , has held a position based on two points : the need for transparent information , based on technical and scientific criteria , in order to assess the scope of the repairs and their potential risk ; and also , the view that any decision , either on its repair in Gibraltar or on its removal to a naval base in the British Isles , be taken in accordance with rigorous technical principles .
Mr President , I would firstly like to express my support for this joint motion for a resolution for the European Union to favour the recuperation and promotion of democracy in the Balkans , specifically in Yugoslavia .
In order to do this , Mr President , and I am particularly addressing the Commission , in my opinion we need to modify the current negotiation directives and overcome a blatant discrimination compared with other geographical areas , which links the conclusion of this agreement with the completion of the negotiations of the new round of the World Trade Organisation .
Here we cannot replace the judicial authority once it has legal power over the case of General Pinochet , and we welcome the fact that the Chilean Government has also decided to allow the judicial authorities to operate .
Going on to the subject of Chile , I would like to express the confidence , the approval and the satisfaction , on the part of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , that the resolution contains some important points , such as respect for the power of Chilean justice , for the Government , for allocating responsibility and , above all , being able to provide support from the European Union for the democratic process with real and positive agreements .
Having said this , I would like to talk very briefly about a delicate situation , because in this debate we can be carried away by our emotions and talk forever about the little respect that there is for human rights in Turkey .
This concern is behind the fact that , in recent weeks , I have met twice with the chairman of the Tunisian human rights league .
That turbulent situation surprised many because it was taking place in a calm and relatively prosperous country , with institutions that functioned reasonably well and with a society living in a satisfactory degree of harmony .
After a more than dubious presidential election , the European Parliament was determined to call for the legislative elections of 10 December to be free , fair and pluralist .
Mr President , Commissioner , please accept my apologies for the attitude that I have shown during the debate .
Since it no longer appears possible for events to take place in this way , because the political groups have already distributed Members ' speaking times , I would ask that , in this case , the Commission statement should be the first item so that Members may speak in the debate and so that the Commission statement is not made in the middle of the debate , which would prevent all Members from being in an equal position to respond to this statement by the Commission .
Madam President ,
