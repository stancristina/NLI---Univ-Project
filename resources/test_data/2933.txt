relations and cooperation with the Russian Federation .
And of course there is an extremely serious social crisis , which manifests itself , for example , as poverty , public servants being unable to draw their salaries , and even - though it is hard to believe - a decrease in people 's standard of living and life expectancy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to express the support of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party for the Randzio-Plath report , which addresses a matter which will be of particular importance when EMU and the single European currency come into force .
For democratic control demands , firstly , dialogue with the parliamentary institution - with this Parliament and the national parliaments - and also transparency of information .
I am not going to question that , but I am glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath 's report also talks of other objectives , particularly that of job-creation .
It was a joint ceremony involving all the countries and had a certain solemnity , which is especially important at times of historical significance .
While on the subject , I should also like to point out the concern which can be observed in some of those countries that they may be relegated to a sort of " second division ' .
Nevertheless , I completely agree that we should do all we can to progress and unblock this bilateral problem .
You must realize that because of its nature , the association agreement is a long term measure , although negotiations have begun .
The Commission 's communication is appropriate and positive since methane gas is the largest contributor to the "greenhouse effect ' after carbon dioxide .
In general , the initiative is positive since it sets out all the undertakings given under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , the Kyoto Conference , the Fifth framework action programme on the environment " Towards Sustainability ' , as well as the Environment Council of 1994 and the demands of the Council 's Ad Hoc Group on Climate , in accordance with the Berlin Mandate .
There is another aspect which is worth mentioning briefly : the improvement of research .
Therefore , this proposal contributes by giving more security to the entire process .
Maybe I should explain in this Parliament that the Community institutions all agree that every policy should be directed towards achieving full employment .
Madam President , I would like to state that I agree with the budgetary guidelines contained in Mrs Dührkop Dührkop 's report .
Many things must be improved in order to achieve truly free movement of persons in the Union , and the report by the High Level Panel , chaired by Mrs Simone Veil , recognizes this in its conclusions and recommendations .
Finally , we must support a Europe which believes that its convergence with other cultures and civilizations is socially and culturally enriching and is not a danger for public order or internal security .
Mr President , I agree with many of the points raised so far , so allow me to look at two more general points which I believe are relevant .
That is our challenge and there is no doubt that it will present many problems .
As regards the Commission , we must point out that in the proceedings brought before the Court , the Commission has maintained this theory of direct effect .
This single market also involves new freedoms and opportunities for citizens in their roles as employees , consumers or members of a family .
Or to give another example , the costs of transferring money abroad are a serious difficulty for those people - such as pensioners - who live outside their own country for a considerable period of time .
However , when putting these declarations into practice , we continue to get lost in a sea of regulations - regulations among which , in many cases , even the most experienced , knowledgable lawyers have difficulty finding their way .
We cannot consider a convention which from the very start has been incomplete to be a draft convention .
But we do not know what significance there is in asking for Parliament 's opinion on those sentences included in the " square brackets ' .
Mr President , less than three weeks ago an important peace agreement was reached in Northern Ireland , which we should all be very happy about .
We are very pleased to see Mrs Mowlam and Mr Andrews here together today , sharing the same philosophy and the same commitment .
We want to encourage the Commission and the Council to develop all these programmes and plans for solidarity because we want to share the fruits of peace .
Mr President , today , as all the speakers have said , is a solemn occasion ; somebody said it is almost religious .
I am glad about that and I will conclude by saying that as a Spaniard I believe in what we are doing and I hope and I pray .
Eleven Member States , comprising about 300 million people , will participate in the single currency from 1 January next year .
And as a Spanish Socialist , I would like to add how pleased I am with the Socialist Party 's contribution to Spain 's incorporation into the third stage of union , first in government and then in opposition .
Thirdly , I want to emphasize that the resolution we are voting on today is a balanced text , which sums up the fundamental reasons behind Parliament 's support for the introduction of the single currency .
It is also true that the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Luxembourg Summit marked a "before ' and "after ' in the employment policies of each Member State .
