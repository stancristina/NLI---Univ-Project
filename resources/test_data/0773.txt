The speeches of the President of the eurogroup are agreed speeches , which include elements of common agreement between all the countries of the euro zone and we would like this to be the seed for something which may have more content and precision in the future .
Has it taken account of the phenomenon of post-escape mortality which is common for other species of gadidae and also affects hake ?
That is the heart of the matter .
Neither do we have great hopes for an improvement in the mid-term review , since the Protocol makes it clear that , if one party does not wish to deal with an issue , that issue will be left out of the review .
This is fundamentally a development cooperation agreement dressed up as a fishing agreement .
Given the high financial figures involved , second only to Mauritania , the Community must make a real assessment and not a fictitious one .
If we add the fact that , in the agreements with the South , shipowners have to contribute increasing amounts of tariffs for the funding of these agreements , while in Greenland they are exempt from these payments , we have another good reason to describe this as a discriminatory agreement .
These are figures that still shock us even though are they well known .
I also regret the points in the draft resolution of the report we are discussing which were highlighted by the representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler , which show a desire either to protect the interests of the Member States or to safeguard the advantages of the ACP countries .
Other machinery could have been set up to protect Community production of these foodstuffs without diminishing the value of the initiative we are debating through this move .
This really could become dangerous , and it would also be cheating the generous intentions behind the measure , which if defrauded would turn against the interests of those whom we are trying to help today .
I do not believe that we in the European institutions are responding adequately to citizens ' demands .
I believe this matter is also important , because we are going to monitor classification societies that are based in our countries but not those possibly recognised ones that have their headquarters outside our countries .
Therefore the Commission and especially the Commissioner Mrs De Palacio must be congratulated on the excellent work they have done over this period .
Finally , I should like to keep up this sense of urgency in our work without resting on our laurels .
They have reacted well .
We have to face the facts , but of course the Commission will carry on working so that in conciliation we can reach this agreement between the three institutions as soon as possible .
Let us move on to the proposals .
The Commission also feels that the proposed amendment should not be included in Article 7 , since it refers to penalties for prolonged lack of compliance by vessels that do not meet minimum standards or that fly flags of convenience , and here we are talking about penalties against a vessel for a specific omission .
In relation to the second item in the package , the Directive on classification societies , I should like to point out that I fully agree with the rapporteur , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , and all the other Members of Parliament who think that it is all too easy for the Member States to simply place the whole burden of liability on the classification societies and thus exclude their own liability as regards genuine control by the port authorities .
I hope you can reconsider this amendment , because I really think it would be better for everyone .
I think this House has made a very constructive suggestion in this respect , and I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr van Dam and the rest of the Committee for this .
I cannot , however , accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 since they have no effect on the achievement of the objective of this Regulation .
Nonetheless , this is a disturbing incident , coming as it does just a few days after elections in the Basque country .
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Vice-President of the Commission , ever since the end of the Second World War the transatlantic relationship has been of crucial importance .
There have been other more recent moves such as the threat made by the United States to withdraw from the OECDs common actions regarding tax have ns .
The creation of a missile defence shield will only lead to an increase in the number of missiles .
We feel we need to make direct contact , regardless of what we are told .
There is much more to unite us than to divide us .
I think it is incumbent upon the United States and Europe to ensure that the outcome of these discussions proves positive rather than negative .
Mr President , Commissioner , this House will tomorrow put forward its position , ideas , hopes and also its concerns regarding the future evolution of pensions from a long-term point of view on our continent .
This is not just a form of words , I am genuinely grateful to them .
We are also conscious that it is our right and our duty not to remain silent in the face of this major problem .
Unless there is a dramatic upswing in the birth rate , this will have serious repercussions .
The crux of the issue is that if Europe grows , it will create employment , it will create firms capable of ensuring that that rate of economic dependence
