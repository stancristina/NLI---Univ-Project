line with the excellent principle of cohesion , and we ask the Commission to adhere to that and to assist the poorest regions in the European Union .
Mr President , I had not expected to speak today because I represent the south-east of England which is one of the more prosperous regions of England and of Europe .
We pay the taxes that make up the grants that other areas receive .
We have no Objective 1 funding .
What Objective 2 funding we had has been reduced by the present government and the Conver Fund that used to be very helpful is now being phased out .
So , why do I speak ?
Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation .
In particular I want to speak of the Isle of Wight , a beautiful island with 130 000 good people but 68 % GDP per head of the European average - a very poor region .
It gets no support from Europe .
Why not ?
It does not get the grant from Europe because at NUTS II it is classified with Hampshire .
Hampshire is a prosperous county - 100 % of European average so , no money for the Isle of Wight .
Yet , it has a population of 130 000 , a bigger population than the Ã…land Islands which are NUTS II and do get grants from the European Union .
The island has taken its case against the British Government that it feels is treating it unfairly , to the High Court in London .
I think they might win that case .
As far as Europe is concerned , on my advice , they took their case to the Ombudsman because we believed that EUROSTAT , by refusing to define the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region , was treating the island unfairly .
This week , in what I would say is a landmark ruling by the European Ombudsman , he has said that constitutes maladministration by EUROSTAT and by the European Commission .
Let me read out his ruling : " In the present case the Commission has not provided the Ombudsman with elements which show that EUROSTAT , when deciding not to classify the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region , has taken into account all relevant factors including Article 158 of the Treaty and the Viola report of the European Parliament " .
He has recommended that the Commission and EUROSTAT should look again at this particular problem .
I would ask the Commission to consider fairly this recommendation that has come from the Ombudsman so that I can go back to the people of the Isle of Wight and say that this issue will be looked at again , that they can expect the Commission to treat fairly the particular problems and concerns of the island .
Then we can get in on this act of additionality and take up our fight with the British Government to make sure that we get support from Europe and from the British Government to treat fairly an island which to date has not been fairly treated either by the British Government or by the European Union .
- Mr President , Tony Blair and Donald Dewar will not have slept well last night !
Their worst nightmares have turned out to be reality .
The Labour Party heartlands of Scotland have sent them an unmistakable message .
The Scottish Labour voter - for so long taken for granted - has spoken .
The Scottish Conservative Party candidate in Ayr , John Scott , has humiliated Labour into third place - 5 000 or more votes behind .
This will only get worse for Labour when the truth about their incompetent and cynical administration of the European Union 's Structural Funds becomes better known and better understood .
Because of the Labour Government 's tardiness in submitting its proposed maps nine months late in December instead of March last year , it is still struggling to come up with acceptable specific projects .
Scottish local authorities are left not knowing whether or not the projects which they are having to underwrite will indeed obtain Structural Fund support .
Commissioner : three questions : When do you expect to be able to provide certainty for the Scottish regions and the badly needed projects which are looking for EU support ?
Are you satisfied with the preparedness of the Scottish Executive to provide the necessary matching funding and to assure you that it is truly additional ?
Or is it all just the usual Labour/Liberal coalition hot air , all mouth , while feet drag along the cobbled streets of Edinburgh and European money is hijacked by the Treasury in London ?
We will hear statements by the Commission and Council presidency tomorrow on the interception of communications .
It is a sensitive subject .
It is one where the powers of the Union are strictly circumscribed and the major political groups have not wished to take a position until they have heard the Council and the Commission .
So we are asking that the vote be postponed to the April part-session and that the deadline for putting down motions under Rule 37 of our Rules be re-opened to allow the committee eventually to table a motion on this issue .
The item is on the agenda of our next committee meeting .
Could I , on behalf of my group , assure the Commissioner that these proposals are welcome and just ask him a couple of questions about them : firstly , could he say more about the consultation programme regarding the candidate countries ?
It is urgent that those countries which aspire to join the European Union should be perfectly clear about the changing nature of the acquis communautaire and the regulations that they will have to follow .
