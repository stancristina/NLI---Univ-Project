Even if representatives of the Council were here , which they do not appear to be , even if they were prepared to make statements , which they do not appear to be , we would not be able to leave them to do it on their own .
We need some kind of watchdog to monitor and ensure the implementation of legislation .
Sadly our own Environment Agency does not appear to be up to the job yet .
We can but hope .
So what solutions do we have ?
What can Parliamentarians do ?
Well , these three reports before Parliament today are a start .
They name and shame .
They call for fines .
They make proposals for further improvement .
But , they also make a point which we must take on board here in Parliament .
They say essentially that bad legislation should never have been put on the statute book .
And that is a lesson that we have to take to heart .
Perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better .
We have talked about doing it but seemingly not done so yet .
When we put better legislation on the agenda in future , it has to be respected .
Because of the failure of Member States to put into place legislation , typically the PCBs and PCTs legislation , we now have the extremely serious problem of a long-term contamination of our food chain by a persistent toxic chemical .
That toxic chemical is slowly but surely accumulating in the human food chain , reaching levels which are already beyond World Health Organisation levels in certain fatty substances , typically butter , and in some cases fatty fish , such as salmon .
They are now creeping up the food chain to the point where our children are now starting to ingest amounts of these toxins that are beyond those that are recommended by the World Health Organisation .
If we are not prepared to take serious action promptly in future we will see further problems of this kind affecting future generations .
We owe it to those future generations to pursue this issue .
Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to be able to present to you today the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ' s own-initiative report on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union .
Twenty years ago , I , myself , was a member of my local young farmers ' organisation in the county of Somerset in England .
Even in those days it was not easy for young farmers to carry on the family farm or get started in the industry .
Today the situation has become even more difficult , and we are witnessing a big drop in the number of young farmers coming into the industry .
We have reached a point where it has become vital to take action in order to stop this decline .
Not only for the sake of agriculture itself , but also to safeguard existing structures in our countryside .
The last thing that we want to see is a depopulated countryside where the green and pleasant landscape which we take for granted will not be looked after properly any longer .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European organisation CEJA for its help and cooperation in enabling me to produce this report .
I was given the opportunity to visit young farmers in five Member States which gave me a better and wider understanding of the practical ways in which young farmers could be helped in the industry .
I would further like to thank Commissioner Fischler for his backing and I would also welcome the draft opinion on the report produced by the Committee of the Regions because it is going to do a report on young farmers .
Last but not least , I would like to express my thanks to Ross Gordon Consultants who produced an excellent study on the situation of young farmers in the European Union last year and whose publication has been of great help in producing today 's report .
The report puts forward a series of ideas and ways of assisting young farmers starting up or carrying on in their businesses .
I have , however , tried not to reinvent the wheel .
Basically I would like to see the introduction of a guaranteed standard level of assistance for young farmers throughout the European Union .
I am fully aware that it is not an easy task to come up with one solution covering all the different conditions facing young farmers in their respective countries in a Community of 15 Member States .
To name just two examples : land values can vary from EUR 12 000 per hectare to EUR 15 000 per hectare .
Levels of taxation vary greatly with some Member States imposing considerable inheritance tax which renders the survival of young farmers very difficult , especially where land values are very high .
I do not have the time to go through all the recommendations made in the report , but I will list some of the measures which should be given priority : the continuation of start-up grants of up to EUR 40 000 , in combination with subsidised interest rates for start-up capital of up to EUR 120 000 for eight years .
Two of the major difficulties encountered by young farmers are the raising of start-up capital and subsequently the danger of overstretching their financial abilities by providing regular interest payments .
We are living in a computer age .
Access to education and training needs to be further encouraged in order to allow young farmers to take full advantage of the potential advantages offered by modern communication technology and business operation techniques .
