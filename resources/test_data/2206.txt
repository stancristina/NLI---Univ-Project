The opening of a building which was not finished , in the middle of an election campaign , which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied , makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous .
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified .
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature , Mrs Lienemann , has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions , and has succeeded to a large extent .
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which , at the same time , safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development .
Firstly , I believe that this directive is excessively tough , simplistic and reductionist .
In the same way , this damage and these tragedies which are happening , as in Romania , are not the problem of the legislative , but of the executive and of the governments .
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector .
We are not doing a bad job of management .
Furthermore , it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent .
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million , but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million .
Mr President , I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection , which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe .
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs , for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity , because sometimes , as the title of the film states , the postman always rings twice .
In considering whether we are in favour of the ratification of these treaties , we may wonder whether they meet the most current needs in that field .
I must finally point out that the legislative amendments introduced in a number of countries , such as Spain , have resolved some conflicts but have led to others which are commonly found when it comes to putting a price on rights and material .
The result of this absurd game is not zero , but rather a minus number , as a consequence of the material , financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise .
With regard to policy , this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another .
The Commission is addressing a very important area , that is , commercial policy .
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water .
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission , I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see .
In order to make our actions effective , we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present .
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00 ) : Subject : Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast , which produced a large oil slick , what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards ?
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port .
I thank the Minister for his response , but I would also like to point out that , statistically , there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing .
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago , partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here .
Secondly , we must bear in mind that Cuba ' s application has the support of all the ACP countries .
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners .
In my opinion , the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process .
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in .
We think there are other positive advances too .
To date , the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79 .
This is important , since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government .
( ES ) Mr President , many thanks , first of all , to the rapporteur for his splendid work .
Obviously , the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria .
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital .
It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed .
This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court .
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons .
