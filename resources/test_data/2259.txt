left any meeting at which questions concerning the Council 's budget were asked .
It had , in fact , been going on for many years .
I think that in April , most Members asked themselves a simple question : how can I , as a Member of the European Parliament , be responsible to my voters for the Council 's budget if the Council will not even answer the questions put to it by Parliament ?
Perhaps some people thought that Parliament would become more amenable after the elections in June , or that Parliament 's demands for openness and transparency smacked of election promises rather than a real change of attitude .
If so , they will have been disappointed .
Even after the election , we on the Committee on Budgetary Control have been united in our very simple stance : if the Council wishes us to grant discharge for its budget , then it must meet with us and answer our questions .
On 24 September , a meeting was held between the Council and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control , the committee 's rapporteurs and the coordinators .
Let me make myself clear : that was a smart move by the Council - a very smart move .
However , let me also clearly state that we both expect and require that this step expresses a change of attitude on the part of the Council with respect to Parliament .
On the contrary , we assume that we will be starting from the point that we have finally reached .
We expect a willingness on the part of the Council to meet with the competent committees and to answer questions .
In granting discharge for the Council 's budget for 2007 , we have demonstrated our positive attitude .
The ball is now in the Council 's court .
Mr President , I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate .
When we began this process , we got no response when we put questions to the Commission and requested written answers .
That was the position we started from .
The question is not whether we have achieved everything we wanted to .
You only have to read my report , and now the committee 's report , to see that we are still unhappy .
We have come a step closer , however .
We will be starting from the point we have reached this year .
I therefore believe it is right to defend what we have achieved by voting in favour , thereby continuing this struggle - which is , after all , what it is .
Time will tell - when we see how things go this year and next year and the year after that - whether we made the right decision .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the secretariat , the shadow rapporteurs and the entire committee , including its chairman , for enabling us to show a united front .
Then we will be in a position to achieve what we all want to achieve .
Violence against women is a major social issue that cannot simply be reduced to a women 's issue .
The UN estimates that seven in ten women will experience violence from men during their lifetime .
We cannot simply remain passive spectators .
The Commission must submit a plan as soon as possible for an EU policy to combat all forms of violence against women .
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States , it is quite clear that some countries take the problem more seriously than others .
Spain , which takes over the presidency of the Council on 1 January , has put combating violence against women at the top of the agenda for its presidency .
Let us support the forthcoming Spanish Presidency 's initiative to get an observatory on violence established in the EU for the benefit of all European women .
Why ?
Firstly , the EU should take the lead in fighting for decent work .
Secondly , as has been mentioned here today , a gap is opening up between what we say and what we do , in other words , a gap between the EU 's internal and external responses .
It is also a very bad signal to send to countries outside the EU that we are demanding should ratify the very same conventions .
It is crucial that the EU takes the lead at a global level , that we show that we are a region that succeeds in combining good working conditions with a high level of competitiveness .
The ILO is our global player when it comes to regulation at international level .
It is essential that the EU supports the ILO as an institution and that we take the ILO 's conventions seriously .
Madam President , we have an internal market in the EU in which we are able to sell goods to each other in a free market .
However , other areas need to be included .
EU Member States must not compete on poor working conditions , and the workforce in all the Member States must secure equal pay for equal work .
It is therefore important that there is close cooperation between the EU and the International Labour Organisation , the ILO .
Unfortunately that is not possible at present , since the Commission only considers the conventions binding if they have been ratified by more than half the Member States .
We do not need more talk ; what we need is action .
How else can we ask other countries of the world to ratify and implement the ILO conventions and ask the WTO to include fundamental workers ' rights in all trade agreements ?
The EU must take the lead
