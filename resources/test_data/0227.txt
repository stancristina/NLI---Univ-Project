Specifically , I am delighted that Parliament is united in recommending that the arms embargo against China not be lifted .
Alongside the input we have received from the Council concerning Tony Blair’s Africa Commission and the UN Summit , the Commission ’s proposal contains a good many constructive features relating to the environment , good governance and the fight against poverty .
We have also noted that women and equality have been included as part of the picture and that importance is attached to women’s importance as driving forces in the development of society .
I must , however , use the short period I have in which to speak in order to highlight an alarming aspect of the proposal , namely the unduly centralised way in which EU aid to Africa is planned , using for example a Donor Atlas , as if we in Europe could sit and plan how aid is to be coordinated in the individual African countries .
It is the African countries that should have the crucial role in coordinating aid , proceeding on the basis of their own strategies for combating poverty .
We must stand by what we have said so far .
These are the two main points of departure .
The proposal rapidly to phase out the industrialised countries ’ agricultural subsidies is particularly constructive .
Agriculture is the weak point in this resolution , however .
Finally , it is crucial that the industrialised countries agree to pay a higher price than the developing countries for a WTO agreement .
Moreover , China and Brazil must , of course , also be counted as developing countries .
It is in these countries that half of the world’s poorest people live , and it is unacceptable to say that these countries do not belong to the poor part of the world .     Mr President , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports a more consistent application of the EU’s competition rules .
There is no free competition .
If prices are to be regulated at all , it must be in order to take due account of the environment or of employees .
What we have here are some of the richest people in the EU , including Greek and Danish ship owners .
That they are doing this is obvious , and we can also see who is involved .
If Amendments 3 and 12 are adopted , the Verts/ALE Group will be able to support the report .
I think it good that we were able to reach a conclusion concerning the 2006 Budget , even though there is no clarification of the financial perspective for 2007-2013 .
It does show that , despite everything , the Council’s and Parliament’s positions on the 2006 Budget were not so far removed from each other , even though the negotiations were quite tough .
My group does not , then , wish to support the proposal to reject the 2006 Budget in protest against the British Presidency’s proposals concerning the financial perspective .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is particularly pleased that increased appropriations to development and research programmes – over and above what has been agreed in the past , moreover – were successfully obtained .
Regarding the size of the payments in 2006 , which in fact remained at 1.01 % of gross national income , it will of course be the actual level in 2006 that will determine the budget over the next few years , if it should turn out that we do not obtain an agreement on the financial perspective .
We should then approve annual budgets with only the Treaty as a framework , and we should then see how things went .
The Prodi Commission also promised us a comprehensive annual programme , stating the legal basis for every individual piece of draft legislation .
Moreover , a public debate on the annual programme would then take place in each individual parliament .
This was almost too good to be true , but then , true to form , the officious centralisers in the Commission made it impossible to read the programme .
No national parliaments can assess what is to happen next year .
The legal basis has been removed , so it is impossible to see whether the EU is planning a harmless resolution or a binding regulation .
The chapters now invented are called prosperity , solidarity and security .
Every year , between 2 000 and 4 000 pieces of draft legislation are adopted , but the annual programme has only included 32 such pieces and 64 other proposals in the annual programme .
Why may we not see everything the Commission intends to propose for the coming year ?
Let us see it set out on the Internet and get the debate under way on what we cannot decide on effectively ourselves and are therefore trying to resolve through the EU or other international fora .
A common consolidated tax base and minimum tax rates for companies will make the internal market more efficient and , at the same time , combat the trend towards tax competition , which threatens our social models in Europe .
Consumer protection and consumer policy in general are important issues , and I am also pleased that the European Parliament is involved in putting them high on the political agenda .
A large proportion of the work that goes on in the EU at the moment is of course about getting the internal market to operate more smoothly when it comes to both goods and services .
It is ultimately for consumers that companies produce goods and services , so it is quite crucial to competition in the internal market that consumers make demands of such goods and services .
Secondly , it is important for consumers to have
