threatened with up to three years ’ imprisonment , due to the continued existence of an unjust and iniquitous law that is tantamount to an attack on the dignity of women .
On average in the EU , only one in three permanent full-time jobs is held by a woman , and it is women who continue to suffer from direct and indirect wage discrimination , with wage differences ranging from 16 % to 30 % on average , and even higher in some countries .
Furthermore , 20 % of the population with the highest income was almost five times better off than the 20 % with the lowest income , although this indicator varied from 3 % in Denmark to 6.5 % in Portugal and the situation has worsened in recent years .
The Commission must therefore withdraw its proposal for a directive on the completion of the internal market in services and must not push through new regulations on the organisation of working time .
I therefore feel it is an unbalanced report .
Symptomatic of the ideological influence pervading the report , moreover , is the fact that nowhere does it mention the proven superiority of the social market economy over planned economic models .     . – I should like to begin by greeting Mr Mandelson .
The present amendment to the rules of origin will further open up the European market to textile exports from developing countries .
Accordingly , I ask the Bureau to use the French version on point 5 , and the Portuguese version on point 8 and on Recital M.     .
Conditions of access to the network must not distinguish between network users of different sizes , given that this could lead to unfair competition and would in any case prevent gas consumers from deriving equitable benefit from the internal natural gas market .
Regulation 1408/71 plays an important role in meeting this objective .
As Portugal has been advocating , and bearing in mind the European Court’s position , it is crucial that Annex IIA of Regulation 1408/71 should be deleted , in order to ensure the exportability of certain benefits .
The Court of Justice must therefore issue a ruling on this matter , in accordance with the Commission ’s statement .
Can a controller work without being employed by an air navigation service provider ?
Once the common standards of skills and training , based on international criteria , have been adopted , these professionals will be able to move around the European market , the recruitment pool available to employers will expand and identical safety standards across the EU area can be achieved .
For both of these reasons , and given that voting this way will not compromise a single one of the EIB’s activities , I voted in favour of the report .     .
I voted in favour .     I should like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo on her report on the social situation in Europe .
As it did not manage this in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , it did so in plenary .
The crux of the matter is the economy .
I also do not agree that the fight against poverty and social exclusion can be pursued solely in the social economy .
Five years on , ahead of the Treaty Review Conference , the outlook is starkly different .
Countries such as Israel , India and Pakistan , which also have nuclear weapons , remain outside the Treaty and feel neither encouraged , nor under any pressure whatsoever , to sign up to it .
The forthcoming NPT review is an opportunity that must not be wasted .
Firstly there is the Syria question .
There is no organisation that I could feel further removed from , but demonising the so-called ‘Party of God ’ and classifying it as being wholly dependent on Syria is neither wise nor true .
Is the Commission prepared to table a framework-law , in time , which could be taken into account when we look into the directive ?
We have to realise that appropriate environmental policies can result in twin benefits , in terms of employment and ensuring lasting growth ; and , in the context of economic stability , we have to improve the ability of our businesses – from the very largest to our small and medium-sized enterprises – to create more and better jobs .
Later today we will debate the forthcoming European Council .
They are about people and the issues that matter most to them : the chance to work , a decent start for their children , security in retirement or ill-health , and quality public services .
These are broad economic , social and environmental objectives .
There has been insufficient delivery , little ownership at national level and even less among society at large .
A dynamic and innovative Europe offers us the best chance to do this .
I know a variety of concerns have been raised about the new focus on actions to promote growth and jobs .
They are key factors for a successful society .
Having said that , however , a certain number of innovations have been suggested by the Commission and – let us not forget – by Parliament too .
In response to this situation , we have made the following proposals , which you seem to approve of , if your motions for resolutions are to be believed .
Thirdly , we are proposing the simplification of the compulsory provision of information , at both Community and national level , so that Member States can devote more time to implementing the reforms and less time to writing reports about them which most people will ignore .
If it wants to succeed , it will also have to mobilise resources to match its ambitions .
