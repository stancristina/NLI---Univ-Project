world may perhaps come about .
Our proposals are reflected in what are now sixteen workable compromises , including on the use of educational and training methods to create workplaces of high quality , on increasing the level of investment in enterprises , on strategies for lifelong learning in accordance with the requirements and abilities of those involved , on the abolition of subsidies to industries which have no viable future , and on job creation in regions with a high level of unemployment .
What I would like to tell the honourable lady Member from Sweden is that the German labour market might well be in need of reform , but there is not one Member State of the European Union in which the removal of protection against dismissal has helped to create jobs .
Now , by way of an actual explanation of how I voted , let me say that I have always been in favour of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament , but the reasons why I voted against the Rothley Report were as follows : I cannot understand why , today , we have not managed to make the actual costs of travel transparent and take them into account .
In future , the reimbursement of expenses - of whatever kind - must relate only to those actually incurred , and it must no longer be possible to draw additional expenses under any circumstances .
For years now , we have been wrestling with a solution to the issue of MEPs ' salaries , and this is something on which opinions can differ .
In order to make dairy farming in the EU more competitive and more efficient , the Commission is frustrating , by means of its proposals , its own structural and rural development policies .
The Agriculture Committee proposes that this be reconsidered in 2008 , when experience will have been gained of decoupling , re-coupling , or simplification in other sectors .
We want to make direct payments that are compatible with the market and with our international trading obligations .
I agree entirely with Mr Olsson that we should all make the effort to avoid the proposals being watered down .
As I see it , there is no alternative to abolishing intervention for rye .
This brings me to the last two reports - Mrs Jeggle 's - on market regulation .
This is a more than adequate reward for agriculture 's multifunctional nature .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I can assure Mr Martinez that I am very proud of Austrian agricultural policy and of what has been achieved in Austrian agriculture and by the farmers and others who live in rural areas .
For example , an Austrian farmer safeguards three jobs both up - and downstream , and we know too that , as enlargement progresses , agriculture will not exhaust the EU 's budget resources ; on the contrary , regional policy has need of many more of them .
These offer farmers in many regions great potential for viable alternative crops while , at the same time , having a positive effect on the environment .
The reason why these raw materials will no longer be available should have been discussed more thoroughly and questioned more aggressively .
Ten years of continuous intervention price reductions have left it almost at the level of the world market price .
With this in mind I would like to say that Mrs Kinnock 's comments with regard to the evaluation of the agricultural policy are an evaluation of the Agricultural Policy from 20 years ago .
Many other price interventions have to be readjusted as well - rye is one of them - because everything cannot be ploughed up in one go or from one day to the next .
I cannot imagine what interest you could have in initiating something unsuitable .
This has been demonstrated again recently by the OECD.
Not taking steps however , would again result in a market imbalance and that means none other than downward pressure on price .
I am therefore at a complete loss to explain the origin of this discussion because if a Member State wants to help out another Member State or a third country in some way and wants to carry out cultural projects in this Member State , then this is a matter for the Member State and the Union should not interfere .
Mr President , Commissioner , I found out today that France has banned rugby .
This makes it all the more important to transpose the Protocol swiftly into Community law now , thus sending out a clear political signal of our continued commitment .
The Council has also made it clear that the so-called Advanced Informed Agreement procedure set out in the Cartagena Protocol should only apply to first movements .
We face a major political challenge , that of convincing our counterparts in the United States of the need for such regulation .
We need to agree on the level of reduction we must achieve .
However , as experience in the Baltic bears out , low-sulphur fuel oil has the advantage of resulting in less maintenance work and better fuel efficiency , so the additional cost of using low-sulphur fuel oil is to some extent compensated by cost savings .
Thirdly , we want to amend the provisions on grading the catches in order to reduce discards .
It is therefore inappropriate to act as if the Spanish fishing boats were fishing the waters dry .
However , I should remind you in this context that in this fisheries sector , a maximum of 5 % by-catch is permitted , and controls carried out primarily by ICES have revealed that in practice , the by-catch falls well below this 5 % limit
