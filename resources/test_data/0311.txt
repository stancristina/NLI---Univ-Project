neo-capitalist farming models which marginalise the agricultural sector and alter its social and environmental role ( paragraph 24 of the report speaks for itself here ) .
Child labour and the inhumane working conditions which adults making footballs also work under are , unfortunately , still standard practice , despite the agreements concluded by the International Football Federation with companies which make sporting goods .
Despite the efforts of both international organisations and the sports companies themselves to introduce programmes and control systems to combat this awful practice , production has shifted to small villages where either there is no policing or the children work at home rather than in factories .
We need to send out a message today that adults should be given work and children should be sent to school .
Pictures of malnourished third world children forced to work day in day out occasionally make the headlines .
In Asia , Africa and South America , western multinationals use small children for various types of hard work , such as picking tobacco , bananas and cotton , making rugs or stitching footballs and sports clothing in intolerable conditions , often working for more than twelve hours at a time .
Children , Mr President , are the most important members of society and they need special protection because the future belongs to them .
Mr President , every day brings fresh evidence of the barbaric behaviour on the part of the state of Israel .
We categorically condemn the attacks on the Palestinian Authority and defend the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to select their own leaders .
We all love the cinema , which has had the best possible advocate in the European Parliament in the person of Mr Vander Taelen .
So far , Parliament and the European Union have taken political decisions to support cinematographic and audiovisual works , but more needs to be done and the Vander Taelen report quite rightly proposes legislative and fiscal measures in this direction , as well as looking at research and archives .
However , we are coming up to three crucial milestones : 2004 , when decisions will be taken on state aid , 2005 for negotiations within the World Trade Organisation and an undetermined date , which keeps receding ever further into the future , for revising the Television without Frontiers directive .
We should not leave his initiative hanging in mid air and we therefore hope that the Commission will respond to it as specifically as possible .
Aid for the production and distribution of cinematographic and other audiovisual works in the European Union is of tremendous cultural and political importance , especially as America has a 66 % hold on the market .
The report is far more concerned with the country of origin than the standard of works and its hopes are vested in making ( even ) this sector subject to the laws of the internal market , i .e . greater commercialisation .
This , combined with the fact that the report contained a number of positive points , is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from voting .
Unfortunately , however , neither the Commission proposal nor the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment offer any guarantee that these objectives will be achieved .
This fact does not ensure legal certainty and is a shortcoming , possibly even an obstacle to adopting rules within the Community , not only for domestic Community products but , principally , for imported products .
At the same time , instead of promoting biotechnology as a technology of the future which is recognised worldwide and promises a great deal for human society in the twenty-first century , the proposal deals this technology a mortal blow .
In addition , methods currently available enable even traces of genetically modified DNA or genetically modified protein to be traced .
This sort of approach therefore leads to distortion on the market , confuses consumers and , basically results in fraud because labelling cannot be verified and the truth of what is stated on the label cannot be checked scientifically .
The proposal is totally impracticable .
Mr President , today 's debate is not about whether genetically modified food is good or bad or dangerous to our health , despite the fact that there is of course good reason to suspect that it may be .
So I am against any amendments designed to restrict the traceability of genetically modified organisms and to restrict it to the final form of the product , whereas with the Commission 's proposals we could have a system which gives us more information at all stages of production and hence a more accurate , more complex picture of the origin of the final product .
I have learned and heard that 0.1 % is possible and I see no reason why we too should not adopt this .
Finally , I should like to ask the Commission this : it has introduced a concentrated control system , mainly under the principle of food safety .
Mr President , the Communist Party of Greece is radically opposed to the directive on the release of genetically modified organisms because we believe that , instead of safeguarding public health and the environment , it safeguards the profits of a few multinationals which , apart from anything else , will gain a stranglehold on the production of foodstuffs .
What really frightens us is that this attempt focuses on reassuring public opinion , glossing over the risks and fostering a climate of acceptance of modified organisms .
None of them ?
Be that as it may , will you be evaluating the answers given to you ?
What I want to know is if anyone is actually taking an interest in whether the fish they catch are large or small
