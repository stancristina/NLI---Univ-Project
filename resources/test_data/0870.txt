Council resolutions .
I am appalled by the Council’s silence and inaction on this matter .
Our efforts to increase security at our external borders , not least by means of the adoption of the second generation of the Schengen Information System ( SIS) , sends out a positive political message .
Furthermore , the method of calculating the reduction in support in the event of this quantity being exceeded needs to be amended .
We abstained from the vote because the Commission and the Council gave way to pressure from the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the liberals and excluded solar radiation from the scope of this directive .
This is a classic example of the often painfully slow nature of the European decision-making process .
I feel that assessments of this nature should be carried out at national level , commensurate with the situation in each country .
We therefore advocate an extended deadline to allow for a trial period and subsequent adaptation to a system that does not exist in Portugal .
The rapporteur supports the Commission ’s proposals for reform , which are aimed at giving greater prominence to competition over State aid , at providing incentives for reducing State aid and at restricting it to horizontal policies related to the Lisbon Strategy , such as issues concerning innovation and research and development .     .
As such , they may be compatible with the common market of aid earmarked for promoting the economic development of regions in which the standard of living is unusually low , and may also continue to enjoy operating aid .     .
I should like to congratulate Mrs  Herczog on her important report on the effects of globalisation on the internal market , which has my full backing .
With 1 % or 2 % increases , there is no room for manoeuvre .
That being said , if this simply becomes a mantra repeated in all our agreements , and fails to make a genuine difference , especially when its terms are violated , it will of course be worthless .
The EU has succeeded in incorporating a ‘human rights and democracy clause ’ in international agreements with third countries .
Rather , it accepts and supports all of the ideas put forward .
Rejection of this proposal is therefore crucial if we are to avoid letting this legislation in through the back door .
Ladies and gentlemen , whilst it is necessary to press ahead with building the internal market , it is no less important to guarantee fair competition in all Member States , not by fomenting social inequality , and certainly not by distorting labour markets or by dismantling labour relations , but by cutting through red tape and by breaking down unjustifiable technical barriers .
What is being proposed is the total liberalisation of services , including public services , which will have detrimental consequences for the workers and for the sovereignty of individual Member States .
That being said , I feel that the resolution as a whole is unbalanced , because it focuses primarily on freedom of expression and not on the islamophobic intentions behind the cartoons published by an extreme right-wing , racist and xenophobic newspaper in Denmark .
Let us be absolutely clear : Europe must do everything , short of waging war , to prevent Tehran from having nuclear weapons .
The Council takes the view that the Union has yet to do all it can , so it is time for Chirac , Blair and Merkel to offer the world a sign of good faith .     – Mr President , in spite of the international efforts , it is becoming increasingly clear that either Iran is raising the diplomatic stakes , or it really is not interested in ending the uranium enrichment programme and the subsequent use thereof for military purposes .
Mr President , simply referring the case to the United Nations and the Security Council is not , to my mind , sufficient .
This is the key question to which we must respond .
The same is true of other proposed amendments , calling upon ‘all countries to avoid any threat to Iran’s territorial integrity and to condemn unequivocally any pre-emptive action’ .
What is more , quite apart from urging the cofinancing of insurance premiums against natural disasters paid by farmers , the Commission is proposing to finance this from just 1 % of funds from modulation , which is clearly inadequate .
In 2005 , at the same time as thousands of hectares of forest were being destroyed by fire , with the loss of human life , and when a number of parts of southern European were stricken by drought , a number of countries of Central Europe were afflicted by devastating floods .
I also feel that this report is an important tool in a broader approach that the issue merits , not least as part of the ongoing debate on the solidarity fund , the forestry strategy that we will certainly discuss , along with the own-initiative reports on natural disasters being drawn up by various committees .
In a particularly complex international context , the Union urgently needs a fresh approach to the energy question , whereby biomass is duly brought to the fore , and this is borne out by the priority that the Commission and the Austrian Presidency have been attaching to the issue .
In this way , the contributions of the various instruments now on the political agenda can help to improve the situation for Europe’s forests .     . – The undoubted need to maintain forests and to preserve their multifunctional nature requires effective management and support measures that take account of the range of forests and their specific problems
