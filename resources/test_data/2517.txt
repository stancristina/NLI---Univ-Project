One had heart arteries which were 90 % blocked .
You , of course , are sounding its death knell at the moment .
Are you thinking about giving Olympic Airways a chance , Commissioner ?
This is where you really need to check with your colleagues , especially as you have received a letter to this effect from the parties directly involved and interested , the mechanics responsible for pre-flight checks on aircraft , that the directive of the European Union – the number of which escapes me at the moment – allows for checks to be carried out by employees ...     – I thank you , Commissioner , for your reply , but I want to ask you a specific question : on 5 October 2001 , the Commissioner responsible at the time , Mr Barnier , announced the conditional continuation of cofinancing for the entire national land register in Greece .
The Commissioner is being called on to answer , to clarify why there is no provision for further funding for the land registry project , to clarify the negative aspects of this entire dossier from 2001 onwards .
The question is straightforward .
There is a letter from the Minister of Economic Affairs to the prime minister of Greece in which there is talk of such an extensive loss .
Have you investigated why Greece is behind ?
What is the reason ?
Have you received them ?
We consider that the date of 2008 proposed in the report is premature , which is why we consider the date of 2010 proposed by the Commission to be more realistic .
Despite any differences we may have , we shall vote in favour of the proposal , because we believe that liberalisation may help upgrade passenger rail transport .
However , I would expect Mrs Bonino to also explain the reasons why the Greek Cypriots rejected this plan and , also , to clarify that 35 % of the Turkish Cypriots said 'no ' and , also , that the settlers who are committing a war crime under international law also had the right to vote in the occupied territories in Cyprus .
Within this framework , Turkey has to apply fully and without discrimination the provisions of the protocol , including the chapter on transport .
Tell me , which other country in the world prohibits the Pontiff from visiting it ?
This ban is racism .
It does not recognise Cyprus and some people are talking about the Annan plan .
It is a straightforward matter ; it just needs logic , not the intervention of the Americans which , unfortunately , also directs the steps of Europe here in this Chamber .     – Mr President , the PASOK delegation supports the joint motion for a resolution on Turkey , even if it is not perfect .
On the other hand , Turkey 's obligation to apply the protocol in full is non-negotiable and Turkey 's obligation to recognise Cyprus is non-negotiable .
We owe it equally to the European citizens , in order to combat easy and dangerous Turko-scepticism .
Thirdly , respect for minority rights , especially of Greeks in Istanbul , Imvro and Tenedos .
Fourthly , respect for religious rights , especially respect for the role of the Ecumenical Patriarch .
Only an honest strategy of clear objectives and clear messages on the part of the European Union can be effective towards Turkey .
All these issues , Mr President , are issues relating to respect for the European legal order and the very credibility of the European Union .     – Mr President , I should like to request an addendum to Amendment 5 , the correct amendment tabled by Mr Lambrinidis .
This motion for a resolution comes within the more general philosophy of the European Council 's so-called counter-declaration .
This is also being proven now .
The question is how , starting from the 'fillet' , private companies will exploit the workers , the travelling public and the areas in question by bringing a basic lever of transport under their absolute control .
This shows a lack of perspicacity .
However , in order to achieve this , we need money and , unfortunately , both the Council and the Commission refuse the idea of a special fuel tax to finance this investment in the future .     – Thank you for your reply , Minister , but when I went down to Greece from Brussels I got the opposite impression from the one you have given and I ask the Council if it has evaluated the direct and indirect damage to date and the damage which will be caused in all the Member States from their failure to comply with the directives .     – Mr President-in-Office , the European Parliament considered , in a resolution passed just today , that the specific legal arrangements are inadequate .
While we are on the subject of religious freedoms , does the British Presidency have any comments on the unacceptable and disparaging treatment of the Pope by the Turkish Government , following his invitation from the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch to visit Istanbul ?     . – Mr President , strategic relations between the European Union and India , especially the recent joint action plan , mark a shift in cooperation to higher and more stable levels .
As draftsman of the opinion and focusing on the pillar of the economic dimension , especially trade , I wish to observe that the challenge is to further strengthen trade and investment flows .
My warm congratulations to the rapporteur .     . – Mr President , I should like , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , to thank the rapporteur and to congratulate him on his important report .
Firstly , we need to create a more favourable political environment for renewable sources of energy .
A framework which will go beyond
