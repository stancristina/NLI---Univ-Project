Once the medicine is developed , it must be delivered to all patients who need it .
In order to achieve this , we must support the implementation of the Doha Declaration on the link between the TRIPS Agreement and public health .
There have been major discussions as to whether efforts should be concentrated mostly upon prevention or health .
If there is no possibility of treatment , there will be no incentive to be tested .
Generic production and competition have brought about remarkable falls in the prices of antiretroviral drugs , and , now , a number of the world’s poorest countries have the opportunity to offer treatment for less than a dollar a day .
In sub-Saharan Africa , treatment is offered to only one per cent of the four million people who need it .
The slow progress in the health sphere is particularly worrying because many of the technologies needed to improve health are in actual fact available at reasonable prices .
In partnership with the ACP countries , it is very relevant to focus upon the unused resources from the European Development Fund in order to try to help vulnerable countries combat these diseases which have very negative effects on the countries ’ economic opportunities and destroy their social cohesion .
I should also like to emphasise the huge significance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for children .
There are now more than 13 million children who have lost at least one of their parents because of AIDS .
I am therefore pleased about the Irish Presidency’s assurances that African issues are high on the EU’s agenda and that the EU wishes to cooperate with African partners in a coherent , serious and consistent way and to support initiatives to meet the enormous challenges faced by Africa .
We spent some useful hours with Bertie and Dick and were able to welcome them .
I am certain that , as a small country , Ireland will deliver an outstanding Presidency .
My friends in Dublin sometimes meet Bertie Ahern at the local pub .
How do we put the people at the centre of the debates concerning the Treaty ?
Do not get involved in the present fight concerning the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers .
Do not breach an agreement entered into with Poland .
Look at the minority statement from the Convention which , in actual fact , contains the key to the future .
The 75 % must also represent half of the voters .
We accept that majority decisions are the point of departure .
This is a sustainable compromise which combines the democratic principle that the voters always have the last word with efficient international decision-making .
There are merely permanent battles and confusion where the Member States do not administer the common decisions .
That is the reality .
Without majority decisions , however , the result is permanent discussions of practical issues too , in relation to which all the countries have a common interest in its being possible , as a general rule , for them to vote their way to solutions .
We need to take both considerations equally seriously .
The draft Convention has neglected to satisfy parliamentary democracy in our Member States , and it will , therefore , scarcely be possible to agree to such democracy in the form of fair referendums , with full information supplied .
Instead of organising a second referendum in Ireland if the electorate votes no , you should involve the other countries in the demand that the draft Constitution be voted on in referendums in all the countries and , preferably , on the same day throughout the EU.
I have high hopes of you and would make a special proposal to which I believe that many European women , and not a few men , will attach importance .
Equality between men and women is not merely a principle .
At the extraordinary meeting for previous Convention members , the Italian Foreign Ministers promised to take the following proposal further : after ‘equality ’ in the first clause are to be added the words ‘including equality between men and women’ .
In this connection , it must be made clear that we only want a framework directive that respects the principle of subsidiarity and that is confined to regulating services of a general economic character and does not therefore seek to regulate areas such as education , public health and services of general social interest .     Mr President , I would thank the Commission for using its communications constantly to provoke discussion of immigration as part of the EU’s response to the ageing population and the ever shrinking workforce , over and above the other aspects of Europe’s encounter with other cultures .
I should next like to congratulate Mr Moraes on the report .
It is a particularly relevant and necessary report right now .
I am grateful for Mr Moraes ’ having integrated the opinions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities on the need to apply a gender perspective to immigration and integration policy .
If we are to succeed in creating a successful immigration and integration policy at European level too , it is absolutely necessary for a gender perspective to be applied at all levels .
I am aware that Mrs Diamantopoulou and her Directorate-General are working hard on this , but it is necessary for you , Mr Vitorino , as her colleague , to do so too .
The headscarf debate is in full swing in many places in Europe at the moment .
It might then be that the headscarf debate would solve itself .
If the women are not integrated , there is a danger of their sons or daughters not being so either and of their , in that way , being stuck in outdated gender roles which , in the Europe
