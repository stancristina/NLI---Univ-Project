This demand has been made because they believe that our country , which is home to six million Muslims , should subjugate its laws to those of the Sharia .
No, the question is never asked .
It is , as they say , business as usual .
Mr Prodi , if the Commission acts in this way , no amount of communication strategies will prevent your and our efforts on the ground from being in vain .
On behalf of the European people that we represent in this House , I wish quite simply to thank you .     Mr President , President of the Commission , I remember the state of mind that prevailed in this House five years ago when you assumed your responsibilities .
Since the second intifada , there have been 4 350 deaths , including the deaths of 3 500 Palestinians ; 33 600 houses have been destroyed ; and , since the ‘Day of Penitence ’ operation orchestrated by the Sharon government , 120 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed .
We condemned such strikes in Iraq , and we condemn them in this case .
I should like to emphasise three points that , in my opinion , are significant and important .
I believe that relations between the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and yourself have indeed been exemplary and very satisfying .
If , then , both the option and the political will are available to you , allow me to say that you have a duty to implement the extension , unless – most untypically for you , Mr President-in-Office – you are to give way to heaven knows what schizophrenic tendencies that are apparently causing worry within the Council .
Given Europeans ’ growing expectations in this area , it is essential for us to be ambitious in defining our new priorities .
Unfortunately , the last ‘Justice and Home Affairs ’ Council does not augur well .
I do not genuinely think that our desire to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy could survive our silence – and , in my view , a culpable silence – regarding what is happening .
I would like to give two or three examples of remarks which he has recently made ; ‘there is not a serious historian alive today who adheres completely to the conclusions of the Nuremberg trial’ , ‘as to the existence of the gas chambers , that is up to the historians to determine’ , and ‘ I question the number of victims of the Holocaust’ .
Similarly , the GSP utilisation rate , or the ratio of trade flows which are theoretically eligible for GSP to imports which actually benefit from GSP , has regularly increased over the past few years , and currently stands at nearly 55 % .
We expect there to be a two-fold evaluation in this area , the first being carried out when applications are assessed , as access to GSP Plus will be refused to beneficiary countries which make no commitments in this field .
For example , in the context of globalisation and international division , as a result of which production processes have been splintered among different countries , renewed attention must be paid to the issue of whether there should be a cumulation of origin between the country from which the goods originate and certain countries from which other inputs used in the manufacture of the same goods may come .
The last point upon which I wish to speak , Mr President , is in response to the oral questions .
My feelings are therefore that they will need at least nine to ten months , and this is the message I would like to convey to this House .
Since its signature nearly ten years ago , the Marrakesh Agreement has resulted in fundamental changes to the nature of the relations entered into by the European Union , and by France in particular , with their developing country partners .
I also fear that , as in a great many other cases , the Commission proposal is not based on any impact study or evaluation of the system as a whole .
To give you an example , the inquiry that we are currently undertaking into respect for union rights in Belarus , which may lead the EU to remove the benefit of those preferences from that country , was triggered by a complaint from the European Trade Union Confederation .
Furthermore , I did not hear that from the mouths of other Members of this House during this debate .
The breakdown is as follows : I feel that , in five years , we have done as much as we possibly could within the existing legal framework , and bearing in mind the reluctance on the part of several Member States and sections of the sporting world to consider Community level to be an essential level in the fight against drug use .
We were calling , in particular , for the concern over drug use to be incorporated into all Community policies .
I should also like to mention the European Year of Education through Sport , during which we set up an information and warning system for our young people ; in other words , an entire prevention system .
I have effectively been trying to demonstrate , for five years , that the Commission is not solely interested in sport as an economic phenomenon , but that sport is , above all , a social activity with educational and ethical aspects .
I would like to express my gratitude and my warmest wishes to Parliament for having considered me worthy of the Sakharov Prize .
Violence must be consigned to the past .
They respect all the values symbolising the Republic of Turkey , but the government appears to be inflexible , and unwilling to appreciate the sincere
