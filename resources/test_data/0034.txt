This is no solution for Europe because over the long term , over generations - as history shows - it will become incredibly expensive .
Anyone who does not agree does not deserve to hear the laughter of children . rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for the good and constructive cooperation .
This strengthens Parliament 's weight through shared competence and the codecision procedure .
