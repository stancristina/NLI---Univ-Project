We need a single strategy and common objectives , although naturally we shall use national recommendations to differentiate our message and accommodate the peculiarities of each country .
Again , one question which arises when we talk of updating is the scope of future guidelines .
As far as the management model , the method used to manage and administer the employment strategy is concerned , I totally agree that we need to incorporate the employment strategy at all levels of national planning .
And as far as the involvement of civil society is concerned , it is still early days as regards any decisive involvement of civil society in employment policies .
We hope that , in adopting this proposal , which I presented to Parliament the day it was adopted , we will achieve greater cohesion between the two strategies , without calling the independence of the employment strategy in question .
In the interim , there is time enough for everyone to take part in this procedure and express their opinion .
I should like to focus in my speech on a number of issues which other honourable Members have also raised this evening .
I should like to mention something that has happened in my country , which has made me sit up and think .
Another issue is unemployment among women , which the spokesman for the Committee on Women 's Rights , Mr Mann , highlighted .
This is a question of social policy , for which the Member States are responsible ; but it is also a question of social responsibility , an issue of concern to the European Parliament and for which the social partners are responsible .
Serious account will be taken of Parliament 's proposals and opinions and I should like to touch on four points which were raised several times this evening .
The doubt expressed by a number of honourable Members as to the extent to which it fosters competitiveness is , I think , somewhat exaggerated , given that , if nothing else , the employment strategy has resulted in what are also business-friendly job market reforms .
The need to achieve competitiveness and cohesion at one and the same time means , as several honourable Members have pointed out , that we need to couple employment strategies and policies and social policy ; in other words , they cannot be segregated and we need to take account of social policy issues every step of the way .
I would point out , as several honourable Members have said , that the employment strategy needs to be discriminating , its scope needs to be clear and it should not be incorporated into the economic guidelines .
The open method of coordination has no separate entry in the Treaty ; however , it has been a very successful method , which is why we have used it in another two procedures , exclusion and pensions , and we believe that the Intergovernmental Conference will perhaps give us the chance to finalise it and use it more efficiently in other policies .
The number of women on the job market has risen but there has hardly been a commensurate increase in the number of women in trade union organisations , where fewer than 25 % hold executive positions , even though over 40 % belong to a trade union .
Clearly this is not an issue which can be resolved through legislation or binding measures .
The social partners , who are due to present their common agenda at Christmas , intend , as far as I am aware , to include the question of equality as one of the common issues which they will endeavour to resolve over the next few years .
We really do believe that , with the employment strategy and social dialogue , we can make progress , but Europe cannot push ahead alone if the social partners themselves fail to assume a large part of the responsibility , which is why we also need their initiative here .
It is also true that this deficit , this problem , is not acknowledged in political circles .
So we need a broad information and awareness-raising campaign in every direction and to motivate working women themselves , because they too must take their share of the responsibility .
I shall not reiterate them , just as I shall refrain from reiterating the negative points , the specifics , aid , renewable sources of energy etc. , issues which my honourable friends have already raised .
The Johannesburg text is full of references , reservations and provisos , just to make sure we keep our hands off trade .
A second point we made was that we needed to incorporate the cost of environmental protection into our production and our consumption in the most practical way possible .
To me , it is totally incomprehensible , as it is to my first year economics students .
What does this bode for the future ?
For the policy which we , the United States and others will apply ?
Instead , nothing was done .
Which is the very essence of governance .
I suggest and request that we think hard .
I just wanted to say this : the Commissioner referred to the presence of MEPs in Johannesburg and said , I think somewhat condescendingly , that we left before the work was finished and would have done well to have stayed until the end .
.
Three : the Commission needs to submit a communication on quantitative environmental targets in the transport sector by the end of 2002 , so that transport also contributes to the 8 % Kyoto reduction target in the gas emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect , stressing the need for all motor vehicles to be included in the strategy to reduce CO2 emissions .
Five : a proposal
