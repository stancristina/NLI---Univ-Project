act correctly and effectively in emergency situations .
We must ensure that the Union’s research efforts in the area of internal and external security are sufficiently in dialogue with one another .
At that time I was a civil servant in the Finnish delegation .
Firstly , there is a very close balance between individual liberty and security and we have to be very careful when we deal with it in relation to terrorism .
That is why I reject the initiative on retention of data and support the position of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
My third point is that it is also an area where action is demanded .
That is why I call upon the Commission to push very hard both for the Tampere Agenda and now The Hague Agenda and get the Member States to implement measures to continue the fight against terrorism .
It is the one that deals with solidarity .
I would really like the Member States and the Commission to stick to that principle .     Mr President , I want to express my enthusiastic support for Mr Alvaro 's report .
It would be an act of folly if the proposed data retention scheme went through in its current form .
It needs to be targeted with meaningful controls .
In any case , given the volume of data that would have to be retained , particularly Internet data , it is unlikely that the comprehensive analysis of the data would ever be carried out in time to be of any use .
Either way it is a waste of money .
The proposed blanket scheme does not give any proper criteria that would meet the Convention on Human Rights .
I call upon my colleagues to follow Mr Alvaro in bringing this proposal to a swift and complete end .
Terrorists finance their activity by traditional means , and with conventional crimes .
Europol has not become an authority that operates throughout the entire membership area , which its name implies .
Exchange of information and increased levels of trust would also boost transparency , which is what has been called for in this debate .
Mr President , I have had the opportunity to observe at close quarters the enormous amount of work Mr Böge has put into this report .
It is not his fault that our group will not adopt this report by a provisional committee , but has allied itself to the minority opinion and is , instead , proposing its own resolution .
We would have liked there to be greater focus on economic , social and environmental issues , the prevention of unemployment and the fight against poverty , and solidarity with the developing countries .
On the other hand , structural and cohesion funds and agricultural programmes should not be subordinated to mere budgetary frameworks and procedures .
Parliament had no inclination to reach a consensus on how future budgets should be financed .
That is not how things are at present .
Others pay almost EUR 5 billion to cover the United Kingdom’s contributions , and that country ’s rebate is unjustified .
On the one side there is the 1 % proposed in the letter drafted by six Member States , and , on the other , Member States worried about structural and cohesion funds are demanding that Union’s internal cohesion and convergence are safeguarded .
There is a lot of sympathy in our group for those countries that decry the deflationary pressures of the Stability and Growth Pact .
Regarding agriculture , not everyone understands why we should be making room in the EU budget for other expenditure with joint financing of agricultural expenditure .
Tomorrow Parliament must send a strong and positive message to the citizens of Europe .
We need to have as large a majority as possible back this report .
Unity in the matter of financial frameworks is still achievable during Luxembourg’s presidential term , if there is the political will and leadership .
We have to prepare ourselves properly for this .
I also wish to turn your attention to the amendment that concerns the Baltic Sea strategy .
Today the Baltic Sea has immense problems .
When conditions are at their worst you cannot bathe or fish in the sea , and we need effective measures to restore the Baltic to its natural state .     Mr President , Rainer Böge’s report before us concerns the future financing of the EU.
At the same time I wish to thank all the committee members for their constructive cooperation .
The intention is to increase structural policy financing and rural development funds , to guarantee that there is balanced development .
This money would be increased to three times the sum in seven years .
The aim is to use additional funds to strengthen the European dimension in research and development .
I would like to make a strong appeal to the Member States to lose no time in adopting the new financial perspective and the interinstitutional Agreement as proposed by Parliament .     .
We voted against Amendment 26 because its wording implies that the EU 's Northern Dimension should be reformulated as the Baltic Strategy .
This is an illustration of the central position this agreement has in EU economic policy-making .
Especially now , in their watered-down format , the Commission will have to enforce a clear and strict line with regard to the rules of the pact .
However , let us not fool ourselves : even with the improved institutional feedback mechanisms that this report suggests , it is not the Stability Pact alone that will lift Europe out of its economic slumber .
Helpful as they are , it is not a set of rules that will help us to put public finances in Europe on a strong footing
