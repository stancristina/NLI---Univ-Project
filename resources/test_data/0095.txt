In both cases , unless we are careful , we shall see a lowering of standards .
This is a valid question , but we are surprised that the Commission is raising it with regard to Europe , but does not raise it more often where it is a hundred times more glaring : with regard to international trade relations .
That applies equally to top-up schemes .
Our German colleagues , or more precisely Germany , has always been very supportive of Chiquita 's position , probably because all the German political parties were receiving backhanders from this multinational company .
Is there any reason why the Council has not deigned to attend this extremely important debate this afternoon ?
Political responsibility must be assumed !
If that resolution is forward-looking and explicit , I shall vote in favour of it , because it will form the terms of reference , the manifesto basis , for the Commission that will succeed your own .
After listening to Mr Santer , I feel they have achieved a miracle : the Commission was suffering from blindness , but suddenly it can see clearly what is going on in its departments .
Over and above this , however , I believe that the report of the Committee of Inquiry should be forwarded to the Intergovernmental Conference , so that the representatives of the Member States can draw the necessary conclusions from it as regards the structure and functioning of the European institutions .
Only the victims or their families can do that .
We believe that the Commission is not so fragile that it is in danger of being shattered by a political crisis .
And now compensation will be provided on the basis of solidarity , rather than responsibility .
The explanation is the belief in a Messiah !
The same mistakes are still being made .
It should be made very clear to the general public that the European Parliament 's right of inquiry , and the way in which it has exercised that right , represent a step forward for democracy in Europe .
As regards the Member States ' governments , it is of course up to the national parliaments to assume their responsibilities .
There is no point in shilly-shallying with a delayed-action motion .
It also discredited the breeders , who were justifiably proud of their stock , and condemned European taxpayers to spending considerable sums of money which could have been better used in other , job-creating , sectors .
Because the only way to compensate those suffering from the disease , Mr President , is to ensure that they can be treated in the future .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , the main part of my speech will take the form of a letter - I hesitate to say a satirical address - to Mr Santer and his team , but firstly I should like to say something to the President of Parliament .
Mr Santer , this is a damning report .
That proposal was rejected by the Council .
This epidemic was only able to reach the proportions that it did because the necessary measures were not taken in full .
I was listening to what you said earlier , Mr Santer .
Tax-free sales could therefore be regarded as operating subsidies in the transport sector .
I am therefore absolutely convinced , as you say , that in the context of the Commission 's procedures and the overall objectives of the texts to which I referred a moment ago , we shall be able to make significant and satisfactory progress towards increasing the involvement of the handicapped in information networks and knowledge systems .
Yes , Mr Vallv√© , I can definitely promise that the next handbook will indeed refer to the various languages I have just mentioned - Catalan in particular , but others too .
The Leonardo programme is helping to improve the conditions for greater transparency and the recognition of diplomas , in that transnational placements and exchanges organized under this programme must be validated and certified .
I think that an international conference of this kind , which will undoubtedly attract a large audience , will - if successful - enable organizations like the very active one you have mentioned to persuade the Member States ' governments that harmonization is absolutely vital , if adequate exchanges of information are to take place .
The Council will now decide on the basis of the report - and I should like to emphasize this too - whether an electronic identification system can be introduced after a test phase , known as the IDEA programme , involving around a million animals .
Mr Olsson , as you know , stressed this point .
Eleven months have already passed and we are talking seriously about regulations , cattle registration , labelling and monitoring .
Madam President , there are at least two lessons we must learn from the BSE crisis : the first is that with regard to livestock production , two checks are better than no checks at all , and secondly we can no longer rely on only the actions and decisions of the Member States to give a Community guarantee to any food product .
For example , to impose on each farm ear marking , a computerized data base , a register and passport for the animals , risks not only increasing bureaucratic provisions , but could also lead to fraud , because of lack of sufficient financial means or the complexity of the legislation .
So what is the advantage ?
In the end , nothing .
Four hundred pharmaceutical products were awaiting this authorization , which should have been issued before the 1st January 1997 .
These provisional limits are in fact proposed by the pharmaceutical industry and are currently studied by the drug agency and the
