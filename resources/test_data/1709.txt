report because , instead of protecting consumers , the proposed measures strengthen the profits of the automobile industry ; instead of protecting the environment , they will put a greater burden on it , with increased numbers of cars , and instead of protecting grassroots income , they will help to fleece it in the name of the stability pact .     – Mr President , we must admit that we really have messed up on the question of the welfare state .
As a result , Chinese products are flooding Europe , our companies are closing and tomorrow we shall be unable to offer this welfare state .
The truth is that either we shall go bankrupt or we shall not be as secure as citizens .
We are pulling the wool over people 's eyes .
Technology should show us the way .
How , therefore , can we secure this standard of living today ?
We need to tell European citizens the truth : that we will be unable to make the Chinese into Europeans and that , unfortunately , we shall have to make the Europeans into Chinese .     Mr President , climate change is the most important environmental problem that our planet faces .
Many of these measures are provided for in the first and second European programme on climate change .
It covers approximately 11 500 000 undertakings and industrial and other installations and today constitutes the biggest gas trading scheme in the world .
You will have all read in the newspapers about what has been happening recently in California , with the initiative taken there for a scheme similar to the European trading scheme for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to start operating there in 2009 .
Actual emissions were lower than many expected .
Secondly , market-based mechanisms are a success and the Community emission allowance trading scheme appears to already be bearing fruit .
These countries are Germany , Estonia , Lithuania , Ireland , Latvia , Luxembourg , Poland , Slovakia , the United Kingdom and , yesterday , Greece .
The national allocation plans notified are currently being evaluated by the Commission .
More importantly for those Member States which are not close to achieving the targets based on the Kyoto Protocol , the national plans must be used in order to help achieve the required reductions .
If the Member States fail to send the information requested of them , the Commission will examine the possibility of taking further action .
I trust that this will not be necessary and that , within the next few days , within the next month , the Member States will send in their greenhouse gas allowance trading allocation plans .     – Mr President , I should like to welcome the Commission statement on the greenhouse gas allowance trading schemes .
One point which strengthens the credibility of the overall scheme is that of the declaration of emissions submitted by every undertaking to the competent national authority .
I also call on the Commission to supervise the strict application of the methodology provided for , so that emission factors are applied not to combustion installations as a whole but to each combustion unit .     – Madam President , thank you very much for the full reply and for the details of the action being taken by the Commission and the Council .
The reason why hunting is banned in the spring period is because wild birds are migrating to their reproduction sites .
The Maltese authorities have sent us the relevant data for the 2004 spring hunting period .
I must say that similar infringement proceedings have also been set in motion against other Member States on the basis of the desired derogation for which the necessary preconditions are not met and that judgments have been returned , for example against Spain and Finland recently , on precisely these grounds .     I shall try to answer the two related questions relating both to the study and to the ban on birds and the data provided by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
This expert opinion is expected in October 2006 .
The competent scientific committee of the European Union with which all the scientific authorities of the Member States of the European Union cooperate is responsible for examining imports of wild species of flora and fauna .
Account will , of course , be taken during the preparation of this study of the conclusions of the report published by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the European Group for the Animal Survival Conventions .     I think that the answer is very straightforward .
Have you done anything in this direction for the Halki Seminary to reopen ?
Thus public consultation is being set in motion in the Union about the introduction of a strategy for mental health .
I also consider it necessary to apply individualised methods for promoting mental health , taking account of the particular needs of target groups , such as people with disabilities .
Consequently , support for them by professionals in order to meet their obvious needs , together with information and a systematic fight against the stigma are necessary components when addressing mental illnesses .
Consequently , if the objective of prevention and cure of human illness is a very serious priority , then the corresponding objective relating to neuro-psychological illnesses is the top priority if we wish to prevent the quintessence of European society from being eroded and breaking up , especially as this society includes in its composition many elderly people who , as we know , are vulnerable to neuro-degenerative illnesses .
