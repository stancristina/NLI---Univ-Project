if in an inadequate manner .
Thank you , Mr President .
The delicate situation in this African region means that European institutions must take a decisive stance .
Let us take note of this and quickly work towards a shared process to improve relations with this country , which is so close to our borders .
It is , however , necessary for Belarus to closely observe international safety standards and requirements in constructing a new nuclear power station and to conform to the Convention on Nuclear Safety .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution that would establish 11 July as a day of commemoration for the victims of the Srebrenica massacre .
This decision , as well as being an affront to the institutions and to Italian justice , is an insult to the memory of the victims and to their families , and has outraged public opinion .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt that we are facing an extremely serious industrial crisis , and the European textile industry cannot escape this crisis , which is also a product of the financial crisis .
They have rules on traceability , which they impose on our products as well , but which we do not have .
Firstly , I feel that the predicted trend in gas demand is restrictive .
Access to other countries will occur in the second phase , therefore making the market more complicated in political , regulatory and infrastructure terms .
We set out with two key objectives , the first being to check carefully to what extent the 2003 framework decision is being implemented within the 27 Member States , and the second being to propose improvements as necessary .
This system has already been trialled and implemented , although by only a small number of Member States and so only at trial level , but has given excellent results .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank my fellow Members once again for their thoughts and the support shown during the debate and , in conclusion , I would like to extend a special thank you to the European Commission for its active collaboration .
To Mr Barrot I owe a particular debt of gratitude , since even this morning he demonstrated extremely strong political and legislative will in terms of child protection .
I would like to stress that I am very aware of data protection and I do not believe that there is a conflict between privacy and children 's rights , if , of course , the institutions play their part and if everyone , from the providers to the police , respects the rules .
I believe we have succeeded in changing the philosophy behind this directive , which had been confined solely to fighting illegal immigration .
For the first time , it provides for criminal sanctions to be imposed in the worst cases , including those where the regular workers are minors .
We have successfully asked for the trade unions to be able to represent immigrants in administrative and civil cases .
It is clearly a problem that has been over-exaggerated .
Instead we have a directive that carries on where the Return Directive left off .
Yesterday , the Italian Minister for Home Affairs said specifically , ' We have to be hard on illegal immigrants ' ; in other words , we have to be hard on the vulnerable .
It is not surprising , then , that illegal immigration is increasing enormously , and this afternoon and tomorrow , we will be dealing in this House with the problems of Lampedusa and other border countries .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the Commissioner 's remarks and hopes .
These , I believe , are all reasons why we can talk of recovered rights , a step forward and not back , and a directive that tackles a difficult and sensitive subject , but with a sense of balance to which this Parliament is particularly alert .
Cooperation between the European Union and Russia has produced excellent results , due to the fact that they have joined forces to achieve the sole objective of improving general wellbeing .
At the same time , these areas are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change caused by humans outside their boundaries .
We European citizens have a moral obligation to ensure that future generations can benefit from the protected wilderness areas in Europe .
Thank you , Mr President .
It is extremely important for the European Union to confront social challenges in an appropriate fashion , so as to guarantee considerable improvements in the provision of public services .
Precommercial procurement , from this perspective , can help to bridge the gap between supply and demand in the public services sector .
If energy efficiency and energy saving continue to be a priority , in line with the continuing development of renewable energy sources , I agree that it should be possible to meet our energy requirements using low emission sources by 2050 .
I hope that the mechanisms of solidarity will not permit market distortions or give rise to excessively onerous procedures .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur when she affirms the essential need to make the concept of work sustainable and to acknowledge the unpaid work carried out by women and men towards inter-generational solidarity .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting in favour of the report by Mrs Angelilli on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography .
It seems clear to me that inherent in this policy is a profound contempt for what we are discussing here and for the rules that the European Union gives us .
Of those who managed to survive , many went through the torments of Lampedusa .
