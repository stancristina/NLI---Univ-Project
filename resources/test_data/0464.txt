be taken , but excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States .
The proposal in question provides for a particularly intensive harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States and is therefore contrary to Article 152 .
I searched the Commission ' s proposal and Mrs MÃ¼ller ' s report in vain for a discussion of this question of where authority lies .
If there is the slightest suspicion that Parliament is not complying with the basis of the Treaty , then negotiations should be suspended until the matter has been clarified .
Mr President , in connection with Parliament ' s debate on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws relating to food supplements , I have received hundreds of approaches in the form of approximately 500 signatures by way of protest and a long list of detailed e-mails and letters from ordinary , concerned Danes and from professionals who are nervous that their access to food supplements might be limited .
Those who have approached me have all pointed out that a number of experts have placed many question marks over those investigations showing that vitamins C , E and A in particular may be dangerous in too high doses , and that alternative investigations seem specifically to show that high doses of these vitamins have had positive effects free from side effects .
Because the need for vitamins depends upon a long list of factors which differ from one Member State to another , such as climate and which vitamins are present in the traditional food , the question arises of whether this area is at all suited to EU harmonisation .
When these differences are taken into account and the major interest of consumers taken seriously , my conclusion is that a vote against the proposal for a directive is called for .
Laws governing food supplements ought to be established at national level where both the individual consumer and the non-governmental organisations have a much greater opportunity to have their views heard and considered and where , therefore , the legislators also have a better opportunity to assess the different positions .
I think it is to be welcomed that we can muster a broad majority for a proposal that extends Parliament ' s earlier decisions .
Employment policy is based , of course , upon what we call open coordination which , most recently at the Lisbon Summit , has been highlighted as a method that may be used within many other areas of policy .
And the common goal in this case is higher employment .
Countries must report on what they are doing to make the unemployed better able to meet the demands of the labour market .
This reporting , carried out by the Member States every year , therefore forms the point of departure for the Commission ' s annual report on employment in the EU which , together with the Commission ' s analyses and statistics concerning development , forms the basis for the Council ' s recommendation to the individual countries .
There is a free choice of policy , and if a country goes down a markedly different path than the one recommended , it can be criticised , but nothing more .
Is the process too informal , then ?
A whole lot of reports , meetings and conferences and a whole lot of words , but no certainty that the objectives will be achieved .
However , this policy whereby countries measure their efforts against each other and exchange experiences - benchmarking and employment of best practices , to use the modern terminology - means that a broader public gets to see which countries are doing well and which less well .
In those countries where youth unemployment is high , the public is bound to ask how it can be that their politicians are not achieving the same good results as politicians in other countries .
Transparency , understood as openness to the public , is in actual fact a very important agent in this process .
Article 129 provides , of course , for the possibility of introducing pilot projects .
This could be a pilot project .
It is about developing analyses , knowledge and information about the whys and wherefores of local and regional involvement in employment policy .
By means of its communication concerning the role of local and regional authorities , the Commission has already made a start upon work of this kind .
In this year ' s Budget , Parliament too has introduced a new budget line for preparative initiatives to promote local participation in employment policy .
By including in this proposal the role of local and regional authorities in employment policy , we ensure that there is a legal basis for this initiative .
To put it briefly , the open coordination method must be open in two senses .
However , it must also be open in the sense that the general public is involved far more than it is at present .
Back to the report , however .
There is reason for doing so , for this is Mrs Jensen' s first report , and it is also a very good piece of work she has done .
As we all know , the report was , of course , adopted by a very large majority of the committee .
That is gratifying , for this is a very important piece of work .
Nor must there be any doubt that we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists support open coordination whenever this is the most effective tool for achieving the desired objectives .
Employment policy will simply be a model for many of the other areas - which are already part of the ambitious plan adopted in Lisbon last spring - in which we should also like to use the open coordination method .
