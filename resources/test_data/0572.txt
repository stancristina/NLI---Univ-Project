EuropeAid would be a very important attribute of the European Union as far as our external relations are concerned .
It has been extremely embarrassing so far that some of our promises have not been kept .
Not keeping promises to the poorest people in the world is not the nicest way to go about - as a rich part of the world - trying to help them .
Consolidating the RELEX Commissioners and increasing the management support staff and resources have my fullest support .
I am also delighted to hear that they are planning to create a board very much like the World Bank .
But I should like to ask Commissioner Nielson if he has thought about something which is very important to this side of the House - the IFC in the World Bank has the ability to help in the private sector with funding .
Micro-credits and various other mechanisms are key to helping people to help themselves .
Have they considered extending , in EuropeAid , some element of helping people to help themselves through an investment arm where the European Union becomes a partner in venture and enterprise ?
The Commission is aware of the recent trial referred to by the honourable Member in his question and of the sentence imposed on Mr Liu , who assisted Xu Wenli in setting up a branch of the banned China Democracy Party .
Xu Wenli , one of the founders of the CDP , was sentenced to 13 years in jail in December 1998 , along with two other prominent democracy campaigners .
As the honourable Member will know , the longstanding policy of the Union is to raise the individual cases of Chinese citizens who have been in prison for political offences with the Chinese authorities , particularly in the context of the human rights dialogue , the last meeting of which took place on 25 February this year .
The Union has therefore raised with the Chinese Government the cases of Xu Wenli and others who have been trying to exercise basic rights that are specified by the United Nation 's Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , which was actually signed by China in October 1998 .
To date , the Commission knows that at least 23 CDP members have been jailed for subversion as a result of their efforts to exercise those rights to which China is committed .
In relation to these and other cases , the Commission consistently calls upon the People 's Republic of China to comply with the letter and spirit of the United Nation 's human rights conventions which it has signed ; to do so even before China 's ratification of those conventions and actively to pursue ratification .
These efforts by the Commission will continue .
I should like to tell the honourable Member that in respect to Mr Xu , I will convey what he said about the apparently grave condition of that political prisoner to my colleagues in the external relations area .
I am certain that they will follow previous practice in making enquiries of the Chinese authorities as to the quality and consistency of the treatment of Mr Xu for hepatitis .
I know that my colleagues will be happy to respond to the honourable Member in order to keep him informed with any information they are able to obtain .
So far as Miss Kadeer is concerned , obviously I did not have notice of that question and am not in a position to respond .
The question will , however , have been recorded .
I will bring it to the attention of my colleagues and they will provide the honourable Member with the response he is seeking .
Obviously , it would be a matter of great concern if someone , whose only offence is to be antagonistic towards an existing regime , were to be the victim of insufferable treatment .
I know that my colleagues elsewhere in the Commission share this view , which I share with the honourable Member .
The Commission 's reform strategy White Paper fulfils the undertakings readily given to Parliament and to the Council last year to give immediate attention to addressing the way in which the Institution , as an organisation , currently undertakes its duties .
Delay in designing a practical strategy and in pursuing necessary modernisation would not have been acceptable to the Commission , to the Council , to this Parliament or to the public , as I am sure the honourable Member understands .
One of the specifically stated purposes of comprehensive reform is the development of strengthened administrative performance which will , amongst other things , enable the Commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future Union and in the wider world .
Clearly the challenges posed by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those presented by any previous enlargement .
The Commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development .
As the College of Commissioners made clear in our introduction to the White Paper , and elsewhere in that document , and I quote what we said : " the challenges of globalisation and future enlargement require better governance at all levels including the European Union " .
All political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the Commission .
Reform is therefore an essential precondition - a precondition for realising our vision of Europe .
The current administrative reform is not a limited exercise - it is an evolutionary process as we have made very clear - it will be continuously monitored and the results achieved will be assessed in order to provide for any relevant adjustments .
Proper account will be taken of any specific requirements
