How is the European dimension in the common history and cultural heritage of Europe to be defined , however ?
These matters must not be regulated at EU level .
This has cost EU taxpayers large amounts of money , and Parliament should , in this case , take a strong line to ensure that the excess rent is repaid .
That is how it works for ordinary citizens throughout the EU , and MEPs ought not to be given a special luxury perk in this respect .     We have today chosen to vote in favour of Mr Ferber’s report on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 .
Despite this , we believe that , given the current situation , it would be desirable to delay such a decision , especially in the light of the fact that Parliament’s twin seats are a much-debated topic .
We have chosen not to join the pension scheme .
Under this system , European taxpayers have to pay for two thirds of all contributions ( currently EUR 2 088 per month per MEP who has chosen to join this scheme ) .
Moreover , I have voted in favour of those amendments that will prevent Parliament from buying the parliament building in Strasbourg .
We are voting in favour of the compromise , but we object to Amendment 47 .
Paragraph 25 calls on the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council to strike an interinstitutional agreement in which they express their dedication to the air quality targets .
The June List clearly also wishes to see better legislation , but we believe that this will be difficult to achieve if the legislature and the executive power have agreed in advance which regulations are going to apply in the future .
That being said , the content of the report ought to remain advisory in nature and not give rise to comprehensive legislation .     The June List’s representatives in the European Parliament voted against the proposal to begin accession negotiations with Turkey .
This has proven to be the case .
It is up to Turkey to choose how to meet the EU’s requirements .
We should not set higher requirements for Turkey or subject it to special treatment , as has been suggested in this debate today .
I support democratisation in Turkey and problems such as this one need to be solved .
Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra has drafted a fine report , as I am keen to point out , as I myself was the rapporteur on this matter when it was one of the topics of the day during the last election campaign .
I am pleased to see that Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra is in favour of the idea of careful monitoring also in countries where the euro has not yet been introduced .
This is another example of something good that the EU has done .
Work must become the rule and benefits the exception .
We must also join together in defending the humane values on which the EU is based .
The focus should now be on legal certainty and fundamental rights .
In the long term , this should help us combat crime more effectively .
That applies to the migratory flows to the Canary Islands and Malta , information updates for everyone waiting for permission to stay in the EU and better support for those fighting to be accepted as new EU citizens .
They talk about that , but not about the responsibility we all share and the solidarity we all need to show .
It is only by means of a common EU policy in this area that we can achieve results for EU citizens .     The report is clearly a further step towards total harmonisation of the Member States’ criminal justice systems .
It is true that Parliament’s amendments contain certain guarantees of legal certainty for individuals , but the proposal as a whole entails a major step towards supranational control of what is at the heart of the right to self-determination of a state governed by the rule of law , namely criminal law .     I am abstaining in the vote on this report because I believe that the EU should invest as many resources in protecting the Swedish krona and other EU currencies as in protecting the euro .
The proposal is in danger of undermining the Hague convention governing the international scope of criminal courts , which was signed back in 1972 and has operated successfully since then .
We find it unfair and antiquated that a Member State should have been placed in this kind of unique position and we wish , in this connection , to emphasise the importance of reviewing the EU budget planned for 2008/2009 .
While these developments are naturally very worrying , Turkey’s democratic forces and forces sympathetic to reform must not be forgotten .
It is important for Turkey to come to terms with its history , including in relation to Armenia .
We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of paragraph 50 and the amendments that promote a constructive approach to Turkey .     The report is a survey of the progress made so far by Turkey regarding its future accession to the EU.
We believe that the same accession requirements should be laid down as were laid down in the case of earlier enlargements – neither more nor fewer .
A possible future Treaty is another issue that must be discussed before further enlargements of the EU can be carried out , with particular attention being given to the voting strength of each Member State so as to prevent a situation in which a small number of large Member States become able to dominate the whole of the EU.
Both Turkey and the EU have a very long road to travel , politically and economically , before Turkish membership can be an imminent
