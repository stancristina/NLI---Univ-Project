safeguard clause ; the authorities ' voting system , etc .
The 'Omnibus ' Directive , for which I am rapporteur , introduces the new supervision architecture into 11 sectoral Union legislation directives relating to banking and securities markets .
She also bore a curse : that of not being listened to .
Now what ?
The first is that the crisis will only be overcome when confidence recovers and transparency is re-established within markets , institutions and products .
An elementary truth about capitalism is that when it is done well , money is made , and when it is done badly , money is lost .
What cannot happen is for the taxpayer to have to carry the can again .
The Council and the Commission , which is doing a magnificent job , needs to make use of this time to forge a parliamentary consensus on the European direction , in the direction of Europe .
As old Castilians say , if the Council does this , God will reward it , and if not , God will demand it .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union has a special responsibility within the area of financial services , as it is the world leader with regard to banking and insurance , and the world 's second largest securities market .
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , those who put forward amendments , all those who made contributions , the secretarial staff , the group administrators and my assistants .
We have the advantage that we incorporated proposals that had been rejected ; proposals that were in the de Larosière report , such as the resolution mechanisms to which Mrs Ferreira has referred .
We also know that elected individuals must not come directly from companies within which they have seats on the board of directors .
I believe that it was a sensible move on the part of Parliament to remove the issue of meat from cloned animals from this proposal , as it is not really possible to dedicate just a few paragraphs to such a novel and new technique as the cloning of animals , even though it is normal in some countries .
Any authorisation of nanomaterials must be preceded by exhaustive scientific tests , as these are new materials that are to be incorporated into food , and the question of food safety needs to be a priority .
If what is to be put to the vote is whether or not to vote for the draft legislative resolution , I will request a 'no ' vote , but if what is to be put to the vote is the postponement of voting , I would recommend a 'yes ' vote .
Cloned animals present high percentages of malformations .
To date , there has not been an explicit ban on the sale of this raw material within the EU , and so it has been possible for timber originating from illegal logging to be sold legally on the European market .
I am very satisfied that the European Parliament has adopted our proposal that Iceland 's membership of the EU should involve the ending of whaling .
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , Mr Šefčovič , regrettably , my group will not be voting in favour of the report on the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) tomorrow .
We also believe that , given the substantial military orientation that the EEAS has - that is how we see it - the main civilian component of European policy with regard to foreign affairs can , and should , remain under the umbrella of European security and defence policy , specifically , everything relating to development cooperation and conflict resolution .
I voted against the report on the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) because I believe that this body will institutionalise the militarisation of the European Union .
By contrast , we remain committed to dialogue being resumed in a manner that is satisfactory to both parties , on the basis of United Nations Security Council resolution 1244/99 , in accordance with international law , as the only possible way of achieving peace and stability in the region .
The current common agricultural policy ( CAP ) provides assistance to a delocalised and speculative industrial system of production , which benefits large agricultural operations and not small producers .
Perhaps in the form of a letter that different Members could sign , demonstrating our concern and detailing the request that we are making - or rather , that we should be making and have yet to make - for the legal guarantees relating to all trials , including the case of Judge Afiuni , to be observed .
The resolution on cases of human rights violations , democracy and the rule of law has a very specific mandate and a very specific purpose , and you have spent a great deal of time using this space to do other things that have nothing to do with individual and specific reports of human rights violations .
They are now a fact , however , and soon they will be an essential tool .
That is the only way that we can be competitive in a global market that waits for no one .
We have an obligation to offer mechanisms to the market that make our businesses more competitive and strengthen our economies .
We must bear in mind that , in the supply crises that we have experienced , national market rules and the lack of interconnections prevented fully satisfactory aid being provided to the Member States affected .
I would also like to thank the European Commission for the valuable support given to the colegislators and to acknowledge the generous collaboration of the Spanish Presidency of the Council , which kept us fully updated on the progress of the work it was doing
