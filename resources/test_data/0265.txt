Perhaps the coordinators could do something about this .
This is urgently needed as well .
No action at the present time will have any quick effect .
We have to think about a basic approach to saving energy .
People no longer know what the dark and gloom are when there is always light everywhere .
At the same time , moreover , we would produce energy-saving technology and use renewable energy sources .     Mr President , I should like to make three points .
We are living in a mood of economic nationalism right now , and being the Competition Commissioner is not necessarily the easiest job in town .
To my mind , competition and the internal market are married ; they go hand in hand .
Therefore , keep the four freedoms in mind ; they are under attack , much like competition policy in general .
That brings me to my final point about the four key areas dealt with in the report itself .
Secondly , on state aid : continue your vigorous control , kill all the national champions you can – they are bad for consumers and taxpayers .
They are all over the place ; they try to hide ; tease them out ; keep the consumers happy .
One can perhaps see both sides , but it is important to keep at it and , much like Mr Evans said , if we want a transatlantic market , let us keep it and let us watch out for American protectionism in the meantime .     Mr President , according to the EU Treaties , decisions must be taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the people .
I can just imagine what would happen if the national parliament of a Member State closed its doors when starting to make laws – the parliament would be bound to disapprove of that .
In the EU , however , it is still possible to make laws undemocratically .
Today it is very difficult for national parliaments and the public to follow and monitor the decisions made by their own ministers in the Council .
I in fact regard it as a lot more important for the EU to promote transparency and for all the EU institutions to do their utmost concerning this , and first and foremost , obviously , the Council .
My first point is that we are dealing here with two separate but interlinked issues : access to documentation and openness in the Council .
We are much more open than national parliaments , so we must bear that in mind .
My second point concerns the opening-up of Council meetings .
It is an ongoing story , but we are not getting it .
First , they tap each other on the shoulder in the Council meeting and say : ‘Good compromise ’ ; five minutes after that they go in front of their national media and say : ‘We could not do anything’ .
Openness would liven up the debate in the Council , because people often come and read prepared documents .
Let us be honest : I do not think that Coreper is ever going to open up and I do not necessarily think that is a bad thing .
I would like to finish with an unrealistic proposal , which is rather like Mr Voggenhuber’s proposal .
That would be a truly open and transparent Council , and that is what we need .     Mr President , before I start , I find it quite amazing that first an Irishwoman says that Ireland has got absolutely nothing out of the European Union , and then someone from Northern Ireland said that trade policy has nothing to do with democracy .
And yes , trade is an exclusive competence of the European Communities , but basically Member States sit around a table , make a decision by qualified majority , and give the Commission a mandate to negotiate .
I have several points .
I also think that globalisation is the best thing that has happened to us over the past 150 years .
It has raised global welfare ; hundreds of millions of people have improved their living conditions .
Secondly , if Doha failed , we would probably survive in the short term ; after all , we are a global trading power – over 20 % of world trade comes from us , over 20 % comes from the United States .
In the long term protectionism works like an ostrich ; you are trying to hide from reality in many ways .
Finally , I believe that we need to finish these negotiations in 2006 , because after that we are not going to have the United States on board .     Mr President , I would like to say a few words about Hammerstein Mintz’s report and voting behaviour .
We can certainly insist on this , but one would assume that the Council also has the right to insist that all our group meetings , preparatory meetings and all meetings of the Conference of Presidents should be open .
I therefore support openness , but I do not think that it is realistic to insist on openness on the part of COREPER .     Madam President , I cannot help it , but when I see the name Winkler up there , I immediately think about Henry Winkler : remember the guy who was Fonzie in Happy Days ?
We have three linked issues in this plenary session .
Having said that and given that we are talking about better regulation , when I started going through the reports , I got a bit uneasy .
Mrs  Frassoni drew up a great report , but paragraph 18 , ‘Notes that the SOLVIT network has proved its effectiveness in the internal market as a complementary
