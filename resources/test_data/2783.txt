We are awarding ourselves a 20 % increase to the budget heading for funding for our assistants because we are more than anything afraid that the rules will stipulate that this contract will have to be accompanied by a statute which would specifically require welfare contributions to be paid , and so , as insurance against the worst case scenario , we are increasing this line by 20 % .
