The problem is , of course , simply that so many issues are still unresolved .
Everyone wants enlargement , he says , but no one wants to pay for it .
This is one problem .
Another problem , which has been completely overlooked , and which is under the extremely roomy carpet under which problems are swept , is the question of the reliability of the progress reports .
I cannot find a single instance in these analyses of a sober attitude to the decisive question of the last and crucial Copenhagen criterion , according to which the candidate countries not only have to comply with the acquis communautaire but must also have the administrative , legal and political structure which is a prerequisite for its effective implementation .
Simple mathematics demonstrate that the legal and administrative personnel simply do not have the training .
These problems have not been dealt with , and the question to my Danish friend and former colleague , the Danish Minister for European Affairs , is : what do you intend to do about this badly neglected problem ?
Mr President , I wish to thank the Danish Presidency , which has guided the process from Copenhagen to Copenhagen not as a national , but as a European goal .
It is the European goal which is being pursued , and , as usual , it is the small , eager , competent countries which are pursuing it .
It has been said time and time again , and our political group obviously shares this view of the matter .
It is clear that a debate on agricultural and funding reform will follow , but , as so many have said here in the House , these must not get in the way of enlargement .
This is something that must be solved in stages .
We have been discussing the provision of information to our citizens on enlargement .
In my opinion , it is all very well for the Commission to supply factual information , but in actual fact it is us , the politicians - our governments and the parties in our countries - who have to solve the problem of information .
Some things are more important in the north , other things in the south , but the common thread must be that we are carrying out enlargement because we wish to have peace in our territory ; peace for when our children and children 's children grow up .
Many issues have been raised along the way , and one which is raised in at least some of the countries is the question of whether widespread corruption exists , which will undermine the fair distribution of EU subsidies .
We must of course invite the applicant countries to participate in the existing system of subsidies on an equal footing with the present members .
They are equal members , but if it should be established that there is any corruption or fraud involving EU funds , the Commission should , in a transitional period , step in and take over the administration of subsidies , so that the money is paid out to those for whom it is intended .
They bring with them a wide range of highly educated , extremely interesting people , who will enrich immeasurably the territory we are shaping together , and it is precisely their contribution to the creation of a new treaty which is absolutely crucial in ensuring that this takes into account the many cultural and national aspects which should go into building the new Europe .
- ( DA ) Mr President , I would like to extend my warmest thanks for the presence of history which can be sensed in many of the speeches made by my former colleagues and also for the commitment evident in the speeches by Mr Prodi , as President of the Commission , and Commissioner Verheugen .
The week before last there came the Commission 's recommendation , which won the support of a substantial majority yesterday in Luxembourg .
Yesterday , we achieved common positions on Kaliningrad , on the institutions , on certain calculation methods and , of course , also on the choice of countries .
The economic position of the present Member States should be laid down in order to make time for negotiations with the new Member States .
I would also like to thank Mr Watson and many others for supporting the view that there must be no new conditions imposed .
Mr Barón Crespo was quite right in saying that , just as a marriage must be built on love , so enlargement must be built on popular support .
On the other hand , I have to say that I was not impressed by the extremely unclear speeches made by Mr Sjöstedt , Mr Bonde and Mr Modrow .
It was a good thing that the Irish voters did not pay any attention to this unholy alliance of old EU opponents , who have taken advantage of every single opportunity in their attempt to stall the European project .
For that I thank the Irish voters .
Yesterday , the Council gave us a mandate to negotiate with Russia ; and this is a mandate which fully respects both Lithuania 's sovereignty and its right to join cooperation on Schengen at the same time as its neighbours .
We will be sleeping with our clothes on so that we do not miss a single opportunity to reach a compromise .
We must not now let the process be taken over by cold financial calculations of microscopic significance compared with the gains to be had by us all from enlargement .
Perhaps we , the parliamentarians and governments , should try a little harder to explain to our citizens how little it costs per head .
