powers of control conferred by patents .
I have been listening to much talk of morals and rights , morals and politics , and I totally support these views , but this has nothing to do with the directive .
Nor do we have to succumb to slogans .
Well , then , I reject the empty rhetoric we have had to listen to today in this House , I reject the value judgements and totally gratuitous attempts which have been made simply to bring discredit - I would almost describe this as personal discredit - and I support the significant contributions we have also heard .
I am doing so because the darkest , deepest and most atavistic convictions come together in this Aleph which is current biotechnological research , an industry which , in 2000 , will have a turnover estimated at ecu 83 , 000 million .
We should also remember that we have to face up to the criticism that the edifice did not actually begin at the level of the foundations .
The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights highlights , from the general standpoint , the simultaneity of legitimate interests to be protected - the interests of the industries involved - but , above all , the interests of consumers and also aspects which are not purely economic : for example , aspects relating to the rapid development of technology , or sociological aspects , such as the degree to which each of us identifies with a particular telephone number , the disruption involved for all users - individuals or companies - when a telephone number has to be changed , since this involves an enormous cost which we have to avoid , hence the need for a measure such as the portability or transportability of numbers to be effective .
What is needed is for us to make full use of the legal instruments which already exist , namely the voice telephony directive and the interconnection directive .
In my opinion , there was absolutely no need for any discussion within the College of Commissioners because there was no new interpretation , nor did anything new arise .
The Single Market offers advantages to all countries and each one uses it as it sees fit .
Criteria may be set up with a view to assessing the economic link which certain vessels have with a country , but discriminatory measures may not be imposed .
Mrs Bonino , I will not refer at present to the Commission 's lack of caution or its haste - we discussed that issue sufficiently yesterday within the follow-up committee - and I am not concerned with potential breaches because the perpetrators will be prosecuted and will feel the full force of the law .
In any case , there is a rule to be applied and I believe that things can always be altered .
I am aware that Agenda 2000 is to be presented tomorrow , but I wanted your opinion on whether such restructuring operations are going to continue , moreover , owing to Community prerequisites , owing to the powers the European Union has under the ECSC Treaty , something which will continue to affect countries such as Germany , Spain and even France .
Mr Commissioner , the Intergovernmental Conference was disappointing in this respect , and remains so .
I assume that the Commissioner will experience a great deal of frustration upon hearing that his good intentions of settling the matter during the recent Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference , when he proposed that sanctions should be automatic , have come to nought .
In early 1988 , the Commission presented its draft directive to the Council on the introduction of charging road infrastructure costs to HGVs .
It is , therefore , precisely in order to prevent this happening that we continue to stress the strengthening of relations in step with enlargement .
We can unreservedly support the proposals which refer to guaranteeing the effectiveness of reasonable enlargement of the Union , organized over the briefest possible of time periods .
Enlargement is going ahead and payment appropriations are being reduced .
In addition , a ceiling of 0.46 % of the Community GDP continues to be set on the total amount channelled towards regional policy , which , in relative terms , means a freeze on growth under this heading at 1999 levels .
I would like to offer her my very special thanks for this .
The ten richest regions continue to differ from the ten poorest in much the same way .
Secondly , it is needed because the legal security offered by a Directive will genuinely promote research , thereby guaranteeing that the European Union does not lose current impetus in this field of science and will ensure that we play a full part in the field in the XXI century .
Despite the ambiguous wording , we feel that there is still potential for an impact on the embryo line and also a possibility of the cloning of human beings and the patenting of aspects or elements of human life , these being passed off as belonging to the category of gene therapy or the like .
We had a long debate about this subject this morning , the Commission 's criteria have been presented to us , and all this is a good basis for the Council , with the Luxembourg presidency , to be able to make significant progress regarding this essential enlargement .
It will also receive a visit from our Group in Luxembourg so that we can submit our own proposals .
I believe that it would be desirable , Mr President , for the presidency-in-Office , as guarantor of the general interest , to create and mobilize every resource in order for it to be possible to guarantee that these agreements , arrived at during the Amsterdam European Council , are complied with
