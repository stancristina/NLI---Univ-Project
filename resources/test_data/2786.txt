Europe will appear stronger and more united .
I hope I have not interrupted too many of your conversations .     Mr President , I would ask you in future to intervene should such a situation arise as that which occurred while Mr Andreasen was speaking .
In my view , these Members are behaving outrageously and downright stupidly and unintelligently when they show no respect for others when they are speaking .
They are no longer relevant .     If the principle of ‘one share – one vote’ is introduced into all legislation there is a risk of legislation having retroactive effect , with the present ownership being changed and thus expropriation taking place .
For these reasons we have been unable to support the introduction through legislation of the principle of ‘one share – one vote’ as a general principle .     The June Movement has today decided to vote in favour of the report on improving safety at sea , since we naturally support all sensible comments on environmental considerations and the combating of oil pollution .
It must be emphasised , however , that the June Movement cannot support the ideas concerning a European coastguard service .
The Member States themselves should determine control of their own waters and coasts .
Moreover , the June Movement decided to vote neither in favour of , nor against , Amendment No 5 , since we are unable to support a desire for greater harmonisation .
In our opinion , no one believes they are to blame for anything at all .
The same can be said of the Eurostat scandal .
Commissioner Solbes is not to blame because he does not read newspapers .
Commissioner Schreyer was not to blame because she does not read audit reports , and Mr Prodi , the President of the Commission , is not at all to blame because he obviously ensured that no information got through to him either from the European Parliament or the press , and if you do not know about something you cannot be to blame for it , as Mr Prodi says .
The truth is , of course , that they had known what was going on at Eurostat for at least a year , but they kept under wraps something that should not have been kept under wraps .
You could call it misplaced loyalty to a corrupt system .
You could call it nepotism .
That is why we want to establish who is to blame , but the system is designed to prevent us from doing so .
This occasionally happens in our Member States .
A government that wins a vote of censure generally comes out of the vote stronger .
Nonetheless , those loyal to the Commission have been busy preventing us from holding this debate and the subsequent vote at all .
That is not true parliamentarianism .
I recommend that Members vote in favour of our motion of censure .     – Mr President , I should like to start with a question for Mrs Grossetête , Mr Kuhne and Mrs Reding : who is politically responsible for the Eurostat scandal ?
Over 100 Members of the European Parliament signed a motion of censure against the Commission , but one in three was pressurised into withdrawing his or her signature .
The die-hards now include some Members who may lose their places on important committees or in delegations .
Parliament’s highly politicised administration is no longer there solely to serve its Members .
It has even refused to accept confirmation sent by fax and quite obviously genuine signatures in order to stifle or stave off the debate on censure .
Imagine if all the group chairmen were as keen to penalise the people in the Commission who have had their hands in the till , or those covering up for the thieves .
The compromise text on Eurostat contains the fiercest criticism to date of the Commission ’s financial management .
We are backing up those who say that approving the accounts is just parliamentary chit-chat , that it does not mean anything and that we can carry on swindling people .
It is taxpayers ’ money , and we have been elected to this Parliament in order to represent taxpayers .
Consequently , we must call upon the Commission to apportion the blame itself by 12 noon on Tuesday 4 May .
Otherwise , we shall vote on the motion of censure .
There may be more of us watchdogs after the elections .
The members of the Venstre , or Liberal , group present in the European Parliament voted against Amendments Nos 17 and 18 .
It is too early , however , to tie ourselves to a percentage limit at a time when we do not know more about the political content of the future financial perspectives .     Mr President .
You are arriving in the nick of time and , with your hard-earned experience , you can help rescue our democracy .
It is characterised by our being able to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and , subsequently , new laws and a new government .
It can effect change and perform a monitoring function , and it can reward and punish .
It counts .
As a voter , I have some significance .
This simple idea unites us , but it is unfortunately well hidden and not at all up front in the draft Constitution .
We can take part in EU elections every five years but , here too , we cannot vote ourselves new laws or a new government .
The most important posts will presumably go to those who can no longer get elected in their own countries .
The EU Prime Minister and the President of the Commission are to constitute their government through talks with the prime ministers .
We
