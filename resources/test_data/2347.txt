specific aspect of the European Union ' s external actions .
This concern has arisen mainly as a result of the successive budgetary cuts in the field of cooperation which , to a certain extent , illustrate and endorse the fears I have just mentioned , which I feel we must lay to rest once and for all .
We see from this that , apart from the importance of fisheries agreements for the European Union , they can also be used as instruments for development in these countries .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is the first time since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force that the European Parliament has been consulted on a Commission proposal for a Council directive on the matter of the lawful immigration of persons originating from third countries .
I do not believe anybody can deny that family reunification is also an important instrument for the integration of immigrants from third countries into their host societies .
That is why the Commission decided that family reunification should be given priority treatment over other forms of lawful immigration .
They also stressed that a more dynamic integration policy needs to be developed in parallel , and that this policy should aim at offering third-country nationals rights and duties comparable to those held by the citizens of the Union .
For our part , we are also willing to introduce an amended proposal as quickly as possible so that we can achieve a positive outcome during the French Presidency .
It is therefore natural that it should be a lively , even passionate debate , and one in which there are divergent views .
This is not a matter of going back on a question of principle .
This proposal does not say that all the Member States will be obliged to recognise unmarried partnerships and accept unmarried partners under all circumstances .
But how could you explain treating the children of a second polygamous marriage differently from the children of a first marriage or the children of an unmarried partnership ?
I respect the opinions of all Members .
We might say that this right contributes towards a practical and concrete expression of the concept of European citizenship , in that the great challenge facing us at the moment is to turn this legally recognised right into a practical reality that is implemented in citizens ' everyday lives .
Finally , Mr President , I should like to express my agreement with my colleague Hernández Mollar when he gave his support to the proposal from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to try to integrate the various texts into a single regulation .
EU external action priorities
Hence the need for measures to help achieve its initial objective of enabling 10 % of all Community students to spend part of their degree course in another Member State , and not just 1 % as happened in 1997/1998 , making it accessible to students from economically less well-off groups .
Workers in 'atypical ' employment - part-time , short-term , etc . face residence problems in the host country .
In his letter the President made absolutely clear the Commission 's commitment to all measures which safeguard children 's rights and mention a number of areas both external and internal where the Commission was active on these highly important matters .
The draft article concerning the protection of children incorporates the main principles of the New York Convention as the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being and consideration .
It has already made it clear , that it will be making children 's rights a top priority .
I will consider your suggestions with an open mind .
A number of Member States are in favour of creating the European police college as a permanent network of national training institutes .
After that period a decision will be taken on the form in which to continue with the European police college .
The Commission will not drop that idea .
This means , of course , that special measures must be put in place to protect a commodity that is publicly owned , whilst safeguarding the interests of the population , in particular , domestic water supply and agricultural activity , especially small farms and family-based holdings .
The European Parliament must denounce this barbarous and despicable act , which according to some eyewitness reports took place with the complicity or connivance of the Indonesian military authorities .
On various occasions throughout this year I have emphasised the potentially premature nature of the new policy being adopted by the European Union towards Indonesia , given that it is particularly clear that there is a degree of uncertainty .
Your predecessor in the chair has just apologised to Commissioner Reding and I think that the whole House would wish to endorse that verbal apology .
Mr President , Portugal has also been affected by these tragic forest fires which have been the result either of natural causes or of criminal acts motivated by base economic interests .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the traditional concept of education was that students would cease learning when they left school .
It is said , and rightly so , that we are becoming a society of information and knowledge .
Holding the European Year of Lifelong Learning and Training was an important step and a symbolic moment in raising the awareness of the European people with regard to this new state of affairs .
For these reasons , this initiative was valuable , timely and fruitful .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Hernández Mollar on the excellent report he has presented to us , which the Group of the European People 's Party endorses and which gained the almost unanimous support of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
