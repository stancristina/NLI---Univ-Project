security systems have all been on the Council ' s table for years , untouched .
Could the Commission tell me what progress is being made with regard to introducing a regulation on anti-personnel mines , which would provide a legal base for these activities and bring them together within a single transparent framework ?
I would also like to thank the European Commission for providing the information and technical advice , which was extremely helpful .
In a civilised society , it is to be expected that waste should be processed in an effective and environmentally responsible manner .
Compliance requires adequate control which , in turn , requires proper monitoring .
Regarding the definition of coincineration plant , it is unfortunate that we were unable to reach agreement on this beforehand .
As far as the continuous sampling of dioxins is concerned , this appears to be quite feasible .
I strongly urge MEPs to meet these expectations .
This is why it is important that incineration should cost the same across the board and meet the same high environmental requirements .
I would also like to thank the European Commission for its sound green proposals .
There are no safe ozone levels , despite what the World Health Organisation claims .
The Dutch Government makes so many concessions to the transport lobby that it fails to realise this .
The most important - and you have heard so yourself just now - and most talked about component of the proposal is , of course , the table which specifies the permitted annual emission levels for each country .
The Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats would like to see the present ceiling adjusted .
Could we be informed on the progress made ?
This model is sound and the results are well founded .
The Member States are given a clearer brief .
That is eight times less .
We have not received a reply from Mrs Fontaine yet , but you will understand - and your presidency will feel the same - that this letter has caused a great deal of consternation , to put it mildly .
I would also like to congratulate the Portuguese presidency because once again , it appears that it attended virtually all important debates this week .
And this is how European cooperation and the Geneva Convention came about .
Sudan , where the southern population has been on the run from the northern rulers for years and where martial law is ignored .
Prominent politicians , some of whom , in fact most of whom , come from within our circles , have helped to bring this about .
This , I deeply regret .
There are reports of torture .
Racism , xenophobia and antisemitism are realities in Eastern and Western Europe alike .
In fact , extreme-right movements from Western Europe are looking to establish contact with like-minded people in Central and Eastern Europe and are fanning the fire of doom there , the fire which was once kindled by the secret services of the former communist regimes no less .
The enormity of the issues affecting the Roma people in Central and Eastern Europe stands out for two reasons .
Or does the Western expert ' s razor-sharp criticism levelled at the European Union for its dismissive attitude towards Roma asylum-seekers cut ice after all ?
In this light , Jews and Hungarians are seen as traitors of the mother country in Romania .
Millions of women throughout the world are still being circumcised or married off .
We must take a firm stance against this , which also involves prosecution .
Too much attention has gone into developing European powers in the field of human rights , of which , by all accounts , there are high expectations .
I fully share this view , which is expressed in the Ludford report .
This means , for example , that we should not respect female circumcision as an old tradition but should fight it with all civilised means .
This should make it impossible to see one ' s fellow man as a threat or to harm his dignity .
We need to help the candidate Member States in a critical , yet constructive , way and not be afraid to call a spade a spade .
Governments do well to give ethnic minorities a visible presence in police forces , for example .
The commotion is justified , given the nature of the topic , but the confusion is not .
It is wise to remain vigilant when it comes to observing human rights of the extensive minorities in Europe .
After all , human rights are there for everybody .
We regret that the standardisation we have achieved is to the detriment of the consumer and the cocoa producer , and was dictated by the pursuit of profit .
Under the communist regime , they were subjected to an assimilation policy .
We should not just aim to combat discrimination and change people ' s mentality .
Only at a local level can the negative cycle of disadvantage and discrimination be broken .
I also advocate sound cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe .
In fact , we should do this as soon as possible in order to avoid this problem becoming our problem in six years or so .
Subsidies to develop filters , so as to be able to offer a clean Internet , should form part of these ethics .
Mr President , Commissioners , if every possible attempt is made - and rightly so - to establish ways of creating an information society for everyone , we should make just as great an effort to ensure that we do not end up recreating a dual society with IT literates on one side and IT illiterates on the other .
