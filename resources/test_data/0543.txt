First , there will be an initial flood risk assessment to identify areas at risk , followed by flood mapping and , thirdly , by the drawing-up of flood risk management plans for river basins .

It proposes an increase from EUR 15 to 17 million in financial resources , which will fund the compensation scheme every year during the period 2007-2013 .
