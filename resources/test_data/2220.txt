for which Mr Cabrol is rapporteur and which is likewise to be put to the vote tomorrow , forms part of the Community 's activities in the public health sector : a sector in need of expansion - as we have been stressing for some time - bearing in mind that we are not targeting major health scourges here but the few sufferers who are dying because no one pays them any attention .
I believe that we are facing a very difficult future ; only if all 15 countries sing in harmony can we safeguard health , which is the prime asset of each and every one of us .
And the lack of ideas on the part of the mainly left-wing governments in Europe is proven by the fact that their leaders , meeting in Milan recently , decided to take up Clinton 's proposals on jobs and the economy , thereby demonstrating a worrying degree of scientific , ideological and cultural subservience .
NATO 's intervention was long overdue and I congratulate our colleagues from the EPP Group for clearly rejecting this statement , which I cannot imagine represents the opinion of our colleagues .
This is the reason why the ELDR Group would have preferred the European Parliament to have considered the utilisation of ground troops if needed .
I agree that it is unfortunate , but that is how it is .
This is the danger that we are facing .
Applause
But things carried on as they did because of the choices made by certain governments and political forces : European union does not exist and all we can do is wait for NATO to represent what we ourselves are not in a position to represent .
The fact that the heads of government of the Member States are meeting with the UN Secretary General , Kofi Annan , seems to be a prelude to a European initiative - as was moreover announced here by the Council - which might , if there are positive signs from the Yugoslav side , enable a return to be made to the negotiating table .
In order to outline a solution to the complex problem of the Balkans it is furthermore vital for the Union to work out a strategy , a plan , to build up a long-term political and economic stabilisation process for the region , including through stronger relations with the Union itself .
Mr President , there is no question here of our determination in the struggle against Milosevic , which of course must remain undiminished - since we know that any weakness may be exploited by the Serbian dictator - but the problem facing us is how to deal with a situation of military intervention which seems to have no way out , as the bombing cannot go on for ever , nor can it be the last word in an action that is intended to lead to peace .
What also interests us , and this was accepted by the Council , by the current presidency in fact , is the request made in the other Assembly for a stability pact .
So much for setting a civilised example , Chancellor Schr√∂der !
Ethical war is born of the ethical State .
And this is something we should keep in mind : if there is anyone who has pursued an ultra-nationalistic plan for ten years , which history shows to be a losing battle but which is bloody and cruel and has cost the lives of millions of Croats and Bosnians , that person is Milosevic , who has pursued , caused and used war for ten years .
Is it possible that names such as Osiev , Vukovar , Srebrenica , Bihac or Sarajevo no longer mean anything to anyone ?
I hope that we can end up with a serious conference , a situation in which commitments entered into will not just be taken seriously but be verified and verifiable as well .
Let me repeat that at present there is no aid agency which could deal with 500 000 people in just a few days .
Fair enough , but for the moment it seems to me that the WEU is more of a virtual organisation than anything else , so I understand why Mrs Ogata wrote to NATO asking for technical resources at least to help with transport and setting up the camps and so on .
Lastly , I would like to thank the Member States , starting with Italy which reacted swiftly and immediately , but not forgetting the other Member States which are making absolutely tremendous efforts to help .
We have separated out the sectors and made major progress .
They are two heavyweights who have stood firm even when the issue in question was no longer quite so topical and it would have been easier to let it drop rather than carry on attending countless meetings .
The families affected by new variant Creutzfeld-Jacob 's disease have received some compensation , but we should not forget the dire prediction of one professor , who said , ' Take care , the incubation period lasts for 15 years ! '
First of all , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , and then I would point out that this is sort of our last debate , the last debate for this Parliament and perhaps also for this Commission , and in a way I shall miss it .
If we succeed I think this will not just be an important milestone for the Union but will help in asserting this principle at international level .
I know that peace negotiations on the internal situation in Sudan should be getting under way in Nairobi in the next few days , and I am wondering , Mr President- in-Office , if this issue could not be raised at these negotiations as well , so that Sudan feels the pressure brought to bear by the international community .
