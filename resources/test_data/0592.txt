of the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats on parental leave is a poor position .
We have had enough indications and warnings , spelling out that a humanitarian catastrophe is imminent , as winter in Afghanistan is approaching , which is usually extremely harsh .
In what ways did the Fifteen analyse these events ?
No one is better placed than Europe to give fresh hope to the forces of peace in the region .
At a time when we are changing over to the euro , we know that these cheques are used primarily by vulnerable sectors of society .
So , ladies and gentlemen , what is Article 2( 2 ) of the Schengen Convention ?
One of the dysfunctions that I must emphasise particularly is institutional digression , which has primarily been at the expense of Community procedures , along with the Commission .
They concern the presence of Council ministers at our important debates as well as speeding up the legislative procedure from the first-reading stage .
There was also a call to improve coordination of European policy within Member States .
This list is drawn up so as to allow the General Affairs Council to carry out fully its horizontal coordination role pertaining to all activities of the different formations of the Council .
Personally , I am not surprised by the quality of this analysis , given the experience and expertise that Mr Poos has gained over many long years and which he is now putting to use at the European Parliament .
The Commission wanted to do this by adopting the White Paper and proposing the administrative reform drawn up by my colleague , Neil Kinnock .
You are also quite right , Mr Poos , when you point out in the report that the crux of the debate is , essentially , how the General Affairs Council functions .
The day after one of the worst spectacles that the European Union and , in particular , its Council of Ministers has ever provided to the citizens of Europe , the excellent report by Mr Poos , the former chairman of the Council of Ministers , appears , which not only shows us the way forward - it gives an outline that should be displayed on all the churches or public buildings in the European Union , just like the theses used to be posted on the Wittemburg church .
I would also like to tell you , so that you know , that the image some of you have painted here today , that is , of a Council whose ministers turn up when the cameras appear and who leave when the cameras go away , that this is not , in fact , what actually takes place .
The exchanges of views that we have had here or in committee have given us food for thought as to which strategy should be applied .
Faced with the instability caused by the attacks , we must further strengthen the importance of the multilateral dimension , which we believe to be the best way to give today ' s de facto globalisation a legal status .
Of course , no one was fully satisfied , which , if you are familiar with the culture at the WTO , is more or less a good sign prior to negotiations .
In our opinion , working programmes cannot replace negotiations , even if it does make sense that there should be a connection between a working programme and a negotiation , provided , of course , that this is agreed in advance .
As supporters of the multilateral approach , we must fulfil this commitment .
The concerns of northern societies as of those of the South must lead to a change in trade rules and to break their monopoly that favours one group .
Custom dictates that I should answer those who expressed more critical views and who , in tomorrow ' s vote will not be adopting the position that the majority groups have stated they will .
In all honesty , I really cannot envisage a more effective method of ensuring that the negotiator ' s political responsibility is maintained throughout .
At least 24 developing countries that are members of the WTO have no permanent representation in Geneva , and numerous others have only very small delegations that do not allow them to follow all of the proceedings that concern them .
We propose supporting regional representations , which is already being done , specifically for the ACP countries , but we feel that we need to go further ; we need to establish internal transparency ; until all members have a representation , we must allow non-resident countries to have rapid access to records of meetings and draft agreements ; we must establish clear rules on so-called 'informal ' consultations to allow all countries that wish to take part to do so , by publishing agendas in advance and by ensuring that reports of prior decisions , which are sometimes prepared , are provided to the competent bodies in good time .
For this reason , the EU' s priorities must be the establishment of fair and equitable trade , a democratic multilateral system , and a reformed WTO .
The WTO perpetuates the imbalance in world trade and the establishment of rules that are unfavourable to the developing countries .
There is a danger that , in the near future , they may ban small farmers from sowing the seeds that they have themselves produced .
The WTO has explicitly recognised the right in this affair of each member to set its own level of protection .
With regard to dispute settlement , an issue you have also addressed , I would make three comments .
