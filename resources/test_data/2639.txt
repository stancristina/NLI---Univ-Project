This will ensure that other species are protected .
We must put safety first and make sure that GMOs do not enter the food chain unseen by the back door .
Furthermore , those responsible for the release of GMOs should bear full financial liability for any damage to human health and the environment .
Industry should pay and face the consequences of its actions , not the man-on-the-street .
Europe should stand up for the rights of the citizen and force industry to take responsibility .
Of course , the health and well-being of our citizens is of paramount importance .
I say no to the release of GMOs resistant to antibiotics .
We must not put our people or our animals at unnecessary risk .
Labour Euro MPs have been at the forefront of protecting our citizens and our environment .
We have consistently backed proposals to ensure that the use of GMOs and products derived from GMOs are strictly controlled within the EU.
David Bowe ' s report is yet further proof of Europe greening up its act and putting the safety of our citizens first .
Papayannakis report ( A5-0088/2000 )
- I welcome Mr Papayannakis ' report on proposals for an EU-wide compulsory identification system for cows and the labelling of beef and beef products .
The main aim of the new regulation is to enable consumers to trace the source of the meat they buy right back to the animal .
This system should enable any potential threats to human health to be tackled early and effectively .
I support the rapporteur in stressing that the same rules must be applied to imported beef from non-EU countries and , in cases where not all information is available , a clear indication to that effect should be provided .
Mr Papayannakis is right to insist that labels mention antibiotics and stimulants that have been administered and to oppose derogation from the regulation for minced beef , beef trimmings or cut beef .
Properly applied this regulation will go a long way to enhance the reputation , quality and safety of EU beef - good news for consumers and producers !
- May I support the efforts of Mr Papayannakis to endorse proposals for an EU-wide compulsory identification system for cows and the labelling of beef and beef products .
Following the hullabaloo of food scares in recent times , most notably Mad Cow Disease , it is vital that we take measures to ensure that this type of food hazard does not happen again .
Food safety is a top priority and we must work hard towards alleviating the fears of consumers .
These new proposals enable consumers to trace the source of the meat they buy right back to the animal .
This should allow for any possible health threats to be tackled early and effectively .
From September 2000 , beef labelling must show the point of slaughter of the animal , and from 2003 , the origin of the animal including where it was born , reared and slaughtered must be added .
Public confidence in food safety has fallen tremendously in the past .
We must , of course , put safety first , and also make moves towards rebuilding public confidence .
British farmers particularly recognise that clear labelling is the best way of reassuring worried consumers that the beef they buy is safe .
This House should do its utmost to ensure that public health and safety is high on the agenda .
Pushing for clear labelling is the only way to convince our customers that food safety is top of our list .
Lisbon European Council
- The Portuguese presidency is to be congratulated for calling a summit to agree new strategic goals for the Union in tackling unemployment , economic reform and social cohesion in light of the new knowledge-based economy .
The Council is right to say that the shift to a digital , knowledge-based economy , prompted by new goals and services , will be a powerful engine for growth , competitiveness and jobs .
In addition , it will be capable of improving citizens ' quality of life and the environment .
However , it is equally true that without active intervention this shift will widen the gap between the haves and have-nots .
The Council is therefore to be applauded for acknowledging the importance of promoting social inclusion , for emphasising the role of education and training for living and working in the knowledge society ; for highlighting the need for more and better jobs ; and for stating that social protection must underpin the transformation of the knowledge economy .
I understand the presidency ' s conclusions as confirming the goal that every section of society should have the opportunity to benefit from new technology .
Madam President , I wish to begin by welcoming Commissioner Patten' s statement , which sets out the truth about our European assistance .
Once again , we see the scenes on our TV screens of starving children in Ethiopia and we remember the horrors of the last famine in the Horn of Africa .
Once again , we have pop stars and celebrities criticising the institutions of Europe and national governments for doing too little too late .
It is amazing how quickly some people become experts when a situation like this arises and they can see some publicity , without knowing more of the background to the overall position .
Somalia is war-torn into small fiefdoms , which makes it extremely difficult for anyone - institutions or NGOs - to deliver food aid to the starving people .
Who does one negotiate with in such a situation ?
Ethiopia is engaged in a border dispute with Eritrea , which means most of the manpower is tied up on a war front and much-needed food is being diverted in both
