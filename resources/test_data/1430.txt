The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement , but with a view to joining in future .
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability .
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country .
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met ?
This , of course , does not mean that , if the economic climate is less than favourable , the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly .
We are of the opinion that the Member States ' budget policy should be strictly supervised , to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times .
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds , the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned .
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 13 , 19 and 21 for the first proposal , and 23 , 28 and 32 for the second proposal , since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements .
However , I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands .
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because , if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive ' concerning lending , borrowing , selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian , this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds , for example Swiss funds , would be eligible for investment .
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed , in theory , to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market .
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility , provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds , but may only carry out part of the management per delegation .
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne , his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations .
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but , as is well-known , must also deal with the Council .
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree .
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved , however , we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance .
Mr President , my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs .
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope .
This , however , does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously .
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the second time within the space of four months , we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe .
Surely this cannot be the role of your , my and the citizens ' tax money ?
All this , of course , does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned .
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9 .
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission ' s policy from these different vantage points , unlike my predecessor , who holds the belief that there is no need for rules .
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot , as nothing is actually done with them .
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners .
Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen , not more than 37 , in the crisis region .
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights .
This is Angola' s reality .
But what do these sanctions mean ?
On 24 December , the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper , Expresso , to a year ' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000 .
But , at the same time , we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government .
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect .
It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic , ecological and social terms .
It is important to point this out .
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable .
With the discovery and , certainly , the exploitation of black gold - and , later on , uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty , hardship and contamination .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I endorse the many comments which
