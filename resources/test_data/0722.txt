alone .
We know what it means for a family if the mother is sick or dies .
If there is no access to reproductive health facilities , there are consequences for the whole family , not least the children who , in the worst case , also die when the mother dies or else stop going to school and become malnourished .
Reproductive health is cheap , costing EUR 2 or 3 per woman per year .
It is also cost-effective when one considers the consequences for the whole family .
By far the majority of these fatalities could be avoided .
A lot has been said about Kosovo .
Over-budgeting is an unsound budgeting practice , and it is important that it should disappear completely from the EU' s budget .
These I support , even though they only constitute a small beginning when it comes to the required changes to the EU' s financial arrangements .
Overall , the EU has no need for more money but , rather , a need to use the existing money more sensibly .
I want to emphasise that a more professional and accountable administration of the EU' s financial resources will provide rich opportunities to get more out of the same amount of money .
Everywhere , there is a need for activity-based budgeting .
One can talk about what is apparent , that is to say the surface details ; or one can talk about what is real .
It is a question of regulations and rules of procedure .
There is no basis for this .
So we can talk , then , and come up with comments about openness , as my excellent Swedish colleague has done , and I concur fully with the criticism of the culture of secrecy .
It is not !
It is a success , writes the rapporteur at the start of the report .
Success according to what criteria ?
And , if one considers social criteria such as unemployment , it hits you right in the eye that the three North European countries which are outside the single currency ( namely Denmark , Sweden and Great Britain ) have significantly lower unemployment than certain areas in the EU , where it is catastrophically high .
The next step consists of referenda in the Scandinavian countries , and these will perhaps introduce a different agenda .
Mr President , the Commission has today accepted a report to Parliament and the Council , assessing ECHO .
This report has been prepared by professional people .
When , in the future , the Commission assesses activities in my own area , this ought to be done on the basis of such modern , professional and open methods .
However , we are alert to the fact that there are a number of things which can be improved .
First of all , cooperation needs to be improved .
We need to improve our cooperation with the multinational organisations , the UN bodies and the Red Cross organisations .
The fact that ECHO is such a big aid organisation means that we also share a more general responsibility for its effectiveness .
We need to establish a broader and more activity-based approach to individual humanitarian crises .
Secondly , there is the question of our management strategy .
We should invest more highly in a concerted handling of the whole project cycle , which includes ensuring effective feedback .
There are also points on which we have disagreed with the consultants ' proposals .
European taxpayers are entitled to know where the aid is going to , and there is no reason , either , to conceal from the recipients where the same aid is coming from .
But ECHO ' s visibility and its logo must not be permitted to hamper cooperation with our partners .
Thirdly , there are the policy considerations .
At present , a lively international debate , in which the Commission is also to be an active participant , is taking place about this so-called transition gap .
The objective is to give ECHO the opportunity to define a meaningful exit strategy in connection with different crises .
The plan is to present a report on this subject in June 2000 .
Special groups include women (especially victims of rape ) , child soldiers , refugees and internally displaced persons .
The plan is to report on these areas in July 2001 .
ECHO is to continue to retain its non-partisan character in all conflicts .
This is important for the purpose of securing access to the victims of crises .
ECHO ' s presence in a wide range of countries , each with its own workers who have been sent out , is an important link in an effective policy of humanitarian aid .
In the midst of all discussion about changes , it is important to state that ECHO ' s committed and loyal staff are the most important asset we have to build upon .
It is my intention to visit East Timor in the very near future .
I should very much like to see open debate and open procedure .
The fact that we are involved as active partners in these different conflicts and crisis situations is also a demonstration to our own citizens in Europe that Europe has a role to play in these places .
Mr President , involving the NGOs is something which the machinery both of the United Nations and of Europe is intensely concerned with , and this is doubtless something which is necessary .
But when it is a question of constructing democracies in a number of countries , I also think we ought to be looking at how we can involve the members of the parliaments in these countries .
We still scarcely have any such tradition through the European machinery
