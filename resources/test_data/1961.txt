moved to see the terrific turnout , what has happened since is frightening .
The government’s attitude and actions are dramatically exacerbating the situation .
Other speakers have gone over what has happened .
Once the opposition had accepted the outcome of the election , they were denied the opportunity of working in Parliament .
I think , of course , that it is our task to do our utmost to prevent violence from taking over , but I am not entirely certain that we best achieve political solutions merely by being discreet in our method of working .
Political solutions are also needed , but all that these more discreet efforts of ours have involved so far is further humiliation and destruction of the opposition .
When you consider what we are up against and the way in which the fluorinated gas industry is lobbying us at the moment , it is simply hair-raising .
The fact is , just about all energy-efficient refrigerators , that is to say those rated AA+ and A++ , use natural coolants rather than these gases .
By virtue of tough legislation and industry that is up-to-date and well disposed towards the environment , we in Denmark have in actual fact developed alternatives , and we can say that , in general , we are in a position to comply with the most stringent requirements .
Let me just say a word , finally , about mobile gases .
It is ludicrous that we cannot get something done about this too .     Mr President , fluorinated gases can destroy the ozone layer , and it is therefore important for all countries to be called on to make an extra effort to get rid of them .
A direct ban , as has been implemented in Denmark , would be best .
As Mrs Auken said , Danish industry has got used to the ban and is developing environmentally friendly alternatives .
Mrs Doyle deserves praise for using the minimum provisions of Article 175 instead of the internal market’s total harmonisation .
Together with Mr Blokland , I have therefore tabled Amendment 45 , which specifies that all countries should be permitted to go further in protecting the ozone layer against fluorinated gases .
We know that the Commission administers Article 175 very strictly and always wants to see uniform rules instead of supporting those countries that wish to lead the way .
I would therefore call on all my fellow Members to support Amendment 45 .
Employees and employers enter into voluntary agreements on wages and working conditions .
We have also developed a Nordic welfare model with social rights for all citizens , financed by high taxes .
It has given us a flexible labour market in which it is easy to fire , and still easier to hire , people .
Moreover , we are creating more jobs than we are losing through globalisation .
That is what we all need .
Moreover , I would ask Mr Barosso to withdraw his support for the Latvian firm in the Vaxholm case .
I also wish to say a big thank you to Mr Pittella for his major efforts in bringing about a compromise and for his readiness to listen and his considerable patience .
Precisely by investing in this area , we shall be achieving very considerable results with very few resources .
Those points in the compromise that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would particularly emphasise involve increased appropriations to the Lisbon Process , especially to research and to the programme for developing credit facilities for small enterprises in the new Member States .
That is , of course , quite unacceptable , and that is why it is right to do what we are going to do , namely use the flexibility instrument .
When it comes to the Structural Funds , adequate payment appropriations are of course required , and we can see how , in recent years , there has been better implementation of our projects .
For two years , the payment appropriations in the budget have in actual fact been too low , and that is the situation we are remedying .
It is a small thing , but a very important one .
We have been reluctant to go below the 20 % , but we support the compromise .
The overall budget we now have is larger than that offered by the Council , but not so large that we cannot defend it .
My group comes out , then , in clear support of the proposal before us .
If you offer the whole of the British rebate , you will not get a budget compromise by December .
For them , you are too modern .
For us , you are not modern enough .
What we miss hearing is a declaration on your part that the Constitution is dead and buried and a statement calling on us to start afresh and to allow supporters and opponents of the Constitution to draw up a common discussion paper .
In that way , the voters would decide our common future , and we should obtain that distribution of power between Member States and the EU that the voters want to see .
You could also compel the Commission to publish the names of the members of the 3 000 secret working parties that prepare our laws .
Two hundred out of a possible 220 members of the European Convention endorsed making everything open unless it was closed , in contrast to the present situation in which everything is closed unless it is opened up .
He was unable to do so on behalf of Mr Blair’s Foreign Ministry .
Only a simple majority is required to change the Rules of Procedure in the Council so that , in the future , everything is open unless a qualified majority decides on an exemption .
