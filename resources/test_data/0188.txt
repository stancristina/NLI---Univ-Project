The undemocratic Constitution is , then , to be sold through an undemocratic distribution of funds for the purpose of providing information , so that people do not manage to discover that , crucially , they are losing what is at the very heart of democracy : the right to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and , subsequently , a new policy .
We rightly demand that Ukraine hold free and fair elections .
It could , of course , be transferred to health and consumer protection because it would then be Commissioner Kyprianou who would be responsible for the matter , which sounds more reassuring .
We regard animal protection as legal protection , but Article 37 is exclusively about increasing production and earnings .
It is actually grotesque that export subsidies are paid when horses , cows and sheep have to be sent out of the EU.
Animals that are to be slaughtered should only be driven to the nearest abattoir and for a maximum of eight hours .
We have a majority in favour of this view in Denmark .
That is also something favoured by a majority in Denmark .
When we obtain the new Constitution , Parliament will have the right of codecision and , if animal protection had no longer been subject to Article 37 , Parliament would now already have had this right .
What has happened is that a strategy has been chosen whereby a decision has been hurried through , almost as if it were a question of keeping both people and Parliament remote from the decision-making concerned over the next six years .
Last year alone , one animal protection organisation collected 500 000 signatures in Denmark , that is to say half a million signatures in a country with only just over five million inhabitants .
As a Member of the European Parliament , I could not obtain access to the proposal until a few hours before it was in actual fact adopted .
I actually think you should be serious about the statements you have made in this House today .
I think you should have the matter put on the agenda again as quickly as possible so that we can have a public debate and so that the politicians and ministers can be put under pressure .
The big problem in this case is that we think too much about the internal market .
We are now treating animals as if they were commodities .
Animals are living beings and must , of course , be treated as such .
In purely legal terms , can there be any defence of Parliament’s being deprived of influence , as it has been ?
As I see it , that alone is a good enough reason for investigating whether this decision is at all sustainable in legal terms .     We chose to vote in favour of Mr Garriga Polledo’s and Mrs Jensen’s report in spite of paragraph 2 , which regrets the Council’s reduction in payments to agriculture .
The Liberal Party is in favour of reforming the payment of travel expenses in such a way that all reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded .
A cheque of this kind can be issued in an emergency , if the signatory knows the recipient very well .
Why , however , recommend to the electorate that it endorse an agreement that is to be given substance by leaders we cannot possibly know at present ?
We do not know whether the most important and most sensitive issues are to be decided unanimously or by qualified majority voting .
Nor do we know the content of important articles in which decisions are left to the Court of Justice .
In one place , the status of the national church is maintained ; elsewhere , the precedence taken by the Danish Constitution in matters relating to the national church is removed .
In Article III-375 , the Danish Supreme Court loses the right to decide the limits placed upon the EU authorities .
Thus , we do not know what we are supposed to endorse .
In that way , we shall at least know what we are voting on and how we can overturn a decision .
Between states , agreements are made , that is to say treaties .
I want to see a Europe of democracies that solves practical problems by focusing upon cross-border issues , or matters that we cannot solve ourselves .
In that way , we should not be losing anything in terms of democracy , but should have everything to gain in terms of cooperation .
As the well-known poet Ebbe Kløverdal Reich pointed out , democracy without a is simply the exercise of power .
Europe deserves better , and that is the title of the alternative statement that I recommend be adopted instead of Mr Corbett’s and Mr Méndez De Vigo’s report .     Mr President , I must again point out the wisdom contained in the Norwegian Mountaineers ’ Handbook .
Otherwise , we end up in tragedy or farce , something we are well on the way towards .
The Constitution involves a huge concentration and centralisation of the EU elites ’ political power , especially over the judiciary and police .
The only hope in this process lies in the forthcoming referendums .
Democracy is now so deeply compromised that it is openly practised as the power of the elite to govern the people .
The fight against the EU Constitution is a fight for democracy , and one that we intend to win outside this House .     Mr President , since the first six countries joined forces , the European Communities have developed a form of cooperation that is not perfect but that is nonetheless a form of cooperation between states of equal value whose governments have the last word concerning the states ’ cooperative participation .
What is more , the adherents of this Constitution
