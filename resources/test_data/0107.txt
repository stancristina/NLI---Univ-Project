The second point that strikes me about the diagnosis relates to job creation .
I could say a lot more , but three minutes is such a short time for such a broad subject .     Mr President , in this magical world of the European Union , we never let reality intrude on our dreams , and from one summit to the next we go on regaling each other with fascinating fairy tales , such as the Lisbon Strategy or the European Constitution .
For all that , balanced public expenditure would be much easier to achieve if the European economy started growing again .
The European Union has just produced a 62-billion-euro plan to revitalise the trans-European networks between now and 2010 .
If we take the case of the labour market , positive mobility is essential , yet at the same time the Member States are taking decisions designed to prevent workers from the new Member States from exercising freedom of movement within the European labour market .
The large countries of the euro area are ailing , but their cure can only come from themselves .
After all , it is a good method to try to begin with those projects which have been around the longest , thereby avoiding a situation in which , as a result of trying to take on too much , we end up by not achieving very much at all .
I look to the rapporteurs and the Commission to explain how it is possible to increase the European budget without increasing the tax burden on taxpayers except by reducing the national budgets .
I believe , Mr President , that the parliamentary initiatives which have been launched for and with young people provide an excellent response to what we frequently hear at grass-roots level , where the refrain is constantly repeated that Europe does not pay enough attention to youth policy .
Our education programmes are therefore trying to respond to the desire of both the rapporteur and the Committee on Culture , and to the need which lies behind that desire , i .e . that our young people should learn about the real world in which they live .
Finally , Mr President , I should like to say a big thank you to Parliament and to its rapporteur , for this important contribution towards the future of our young citizens .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think we need to emphasise what Mr Brie has already said to us .
When 20 % of a population of a million people have been wiped out , is that a human rights violation , genocide or a disaster of biblical proportions ?
The second aspect I wanted to mention is also a lack of consistency , but this time between the Union’s different actions with regard to Russia .
The desire for a partnership between the European Union and Russia must follow a plan that includes peace and security for all peoples .
This is all too rare an opportunity , ladies and gentlemen , and the European Union has been absent for too long to miss its appointment this time .     – Mr President , our rapporteur Mr Gahrton is without doubt one of the most knowledgeable people in Europe about the situation in the South Caucasus .
This applies to the Adzharians , the Abkhazians , the Ossetians and to the Azeris of Nagorno-Karabakh .
The report simply proposes to return the Chinese to their homeland , with no thought for their motives or the fate that awaits them on their return .
All the EU’s partners , even – especially – the USA , must sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , the CTBT , which could then enter into force .
The Members of this House from the CPNT will oppose this if it should see the light of day , just as they are opposing it today in the context of this report .     .
They are so globalised that it is imperative that , from now on , they be at the centre of an exhaustive management of Community policies , radically overhauling the specific economic , financial or social dimensions that are now obsolete .
The Stability and Growth Pact criteria , which are not economically justifiable , must be abolished to allow Member States to conduct budgetary policies that encourage growth .
Instead , each government , which is answerable to its people , must be given greater freedom to evaluate the policy that is in the best interests of society .
Finally , it clearly indicates the responsibility of the Russian state for the acts of violence in this dirty war .
At that time I was the youngest Member of Parliament and , including me , there were only two women Members .
I should therefore like to request your support , Mr President , in compelling the Commission to comply with the right to information , as provided for in the interinstitutional accords .     – Mr President , I am sorry to trouble you and the Members of this House again with an issue with which they are all too familiar – that of Chechnya .
Given that the Commission determinedly supports this proposal , we are thus forced to accept further discrimination .
These are three subjects that genuinely make us angry and that prove that not everything in Europe’s garden is coming up roses .
I refer , inter alia , to those based on Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , which could prohibit for the first time any act of discrimination based on gender outside the job market , such as access to goods and services or the supply of these .
Yes , some progress has been made , but further resources must be put in
