not related to heat-treated products .
It is slightly absurd that I am Parliament 's rapporteur in the case of a directive aimed at creating salmonella controls across the whole of the EU which look very much like the Scandinavian controls .
As such , it is a little odd that a quick decision cannot be taken on having a salmonella guarantee for preparations which are not heat treated .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for the responses we have received so far .
The problem is that these rules are clearly not being followed , with as much as one third of the products checked actually carrying salmonella .
Common legislation on the rules for citizens ' access to documents was an important step towards increasing scrutiny of , and confidence in , the European institutions .
We were not entirely satisfied with a number of sections of the legislation , and we believe that there was an exaggerated fear of releasing documents .
Such documents must be kept confidential .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reform Party believes , however , that it is necessary to make sure that it does not become too common for documents to be automatically referred to this small committee .
We could have this in conjunction with a general review of the transparency regulations .
The text is very clear .
I believe we should speak more plainly in this context .
The cutbacks have to be made somewhere .
We should recognise this in some way if we want better health and safety at work .
Legislative and non-legislative methods work where there are employee organisations able to use the laws , recommendations and guidelines which we draw up .
It may be that the opportunities for legal assistance in disputes should be increased .
We should perhaps make it clearer to the candidate countries that the right to strike is part of the body of law , or acquis communautaire , which they are expected to introduce .
The new Financial Regulation should not only lead to efficient handling but also better supervision than was previously the case .
The accounting officer must be able to demand and receive more information , stop payments in cases of doubt and report directly to the highest level .
My political group has also proposed an amendment limiting the Commission 's ability to write off and write down liabilities .
Our group does not share the opinion that the Treaty of Nice was an absolute condition for enlargement .
The Czech Republic and Hungary are in actual fact discriminated against in terms of the number of seats in the European Parliament allocated to them .
The important thing now is that they will not only take it over in theory but also in practice , and then not only as regards the internal market but also as regards the environment and social rights for workers .
This is unacceptable .
On the subject of the Kaliningrad area , we wish to see a solution whereby Russian citizens are able to travel between different parts of their country without needing a visa .
On the subject of the labour market , it is our opinion that everyone should be treated equally .
The important thing now is to avoid enlargement giving rise to an ' A team ' and a ' B team ' in the European Union .
To listen to Mr Bonde , one wonders if he is not dreaming that he is back in the 'good old days ' of the GDR.
I would like to say to Mrs Maij-Weggen that there are actually many Dutch liberals who share your opinion , as Mr Cox also quite rightly said .
As Commissioner Verheugen emphasises , there is nothing today to show that there are any problems in any of the ten countries which cannot be solved .
The EU honours its agreements .
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the Irish people , as well as the Danish Presidency , which has done a tremendously good job , and the Commission , which has been working on the issue for a long time .
It is a question of our children and children 's children .
If we wish to tackle the problems of the Baltic region for the future , we can simply do it together .
Of course we do , but this is first and foremost a political responsibility .
It is not the candidate countries ' responsibility , but our responsibility - the responsibility of all of us - to make a change in agricultural and structural policy .
A brief word about Kaliningrad .
This could potentially lead to tensions in the border regions .
This is the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , the wall which symbolised the division of Europe , the hostility and the distance between East and West .
The Commission 's report confirms that ten countries can become members in just over a year .
Support for the candidate countries is waning , and several Member States , leading politicians and parties are speaking of waiting or postponing on the grounds that ' we are not ready ' .
After all , who believed that it would be easy to unify Europe ?
We must also become much better at bringing the results of the Convention 's discussions out of the conference rooms in Brussels .
Forked tongues arouse distrust in our countries and the candidate countries .
The rapporteur proposes a long list of measures , including better application of the existing legislation in the area .
Existing directives on the working environment are not working well , principally because employers oppose them and because trade unions are too weak , and often set minimum levels that tend to commit the social partners to agreements affording levels of protection which are far too low
