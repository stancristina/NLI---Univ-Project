main partners among developed and developing countries .
The Bali Conference will undoubtedly be a milestone in the international endeavour to combat climate change .
A month ago , the first meeting of its kind , called by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York , sent out a very powerful message : climate change is now recognised by all leaders throughout the world as an issue requiring urgent and decisive action by the international community .
It is nevertheless true that the EU has to large extent managed to set the agenda for the Bali Conference .
It is up to our partners in the developed countries to respond to and cooperate on the targets set by the EU , acting at all times on the basis of scientific data .
Nevertheless , the forecasts for emission increases worldwide leave no doubt that the developing countries must contribute .
This is the only way we can keep the increase in the average temperature of the planet within the limit of 2Â°C.
The Commission will approve the package of measures on climate and energy at the beginning of next year and will plan the necessary measures for achieving our targets , namely a unilateral reduction in emissions of 20 % , or 30 % if an international agreement is achieved .
The Commission will propose a legislative framework for achieving the Community target of 120 g/km by 2012 .
The EU will intensify bilateral contacts with major partners and will take full advantage of the forthcoming summits as well as all the important international meetings .
Targets of this kind are of fundamental importance if we wish to ensure the effectiveness of our agreement and the strengthening of the global CO2 market .
We shall continue to cooperate with all those in the United States who can help towards bringing about a change of attitude at federal level .
Through your various contacts with colleagues in other parliaments around the world , with representatives of industry and with civil society , we are counting on the support of the European Parliament in promoting the EU 's ambitious aims regarding the issue of climate change .
It also called on the Commission to make it clear that the 2005 recommendation in this area applies exclusively to online sales of music recordings .
The 13 March resolution reflects the European Parliament 's clear position on cross-border collective management of copyright .
The situation today , as regards online services is not considered to be effective enough , either for rights users , or for right-holders .
Three of the reasons for the spread of piracy internationally are the technological facilities for low-cost illegal copying , unfavourable economic conditions and the expansion of the Internet .
The fight against piracy must therefore be included among the Commission 's initial aims in the possible legislative proposal on collective management of copyright .
The report on the European Neighbourhood Policy summarises the ways and means of imperialistic intervention in neighbouring countries .
The European Parliament calls upon the neighbouring countries to participate in the EU 's anti-migration policy by intensifying repressive measures against migrants .
Consumer and housing loans in Greece have reached 95 billion euros : consumer credit is growing at the highest rate of any country in the Euro area , and is approaching the EU 's annual budget total .
The same is also true for small and medium-sized enterprises , which are forced to resort to borrowing .
It strengthens financial capital by transferring responsibility to the consumer .
One thing is clear : we have tonight heard views representing the arguments of those such as the United States and Australia who did not want to move towards ratifying the Kyoto Protocol .
T here is therefore a wide gap between the EU 's achievements and what the United States is failing to achieve , and it should be noted that the United States was due to reduce its emissions by 7 % under the Kyoto Protocol , which it signed but did not ratify .
Instead of the -7 % target , emissions were +16.4 % in 2005 , while the EU is on its way to meeting its target of -8 % .
In recent years we have seen a 160 % increase in greenhouse gas emissions .
Our fundamental achievement was to have already begun formal negotiations ; there are now clear indications that the requisite target in the fight against climate change is being reached , with regard to the agreement on climate covering the post-2012 period .
We must find ways to speed up funding , channel investments and make these ways even more environmentally friendly : this will encourage clean technology and efforts to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change , thus attracting investment both from the public sector and also to a large extent from the private sector .
Further mobilisation of the private sector is also vitally import and must be exploited even more .
This is therefore a vital area for us to tackle .
We must , however , always bear in mind that our leading role depends on and is influenced by the policies and measures we adopt within the EU.
The directive offers no long-term solution , and the postponement of its entry into force simply postpones its negative effects by two years .
The demand for forced liberalisation of the postal services creates more problems than it solves .
We are radically opposed to the liberalisation of the market in the dairy sector .
If it is to succeed , the review of the common agricultural policy demands different priorities and , of course , greater resources .
The rural population , diversity , environmental protection and public health must be maintained .
The proposals for a 'health check ' of the CAP constitute a new attack on small and medium-sized farmers .
