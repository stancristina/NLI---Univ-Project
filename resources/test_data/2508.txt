are an integral part of the framework on which the European Union and the euro are based and from which they will develop .
I too would have welcomed a joint debate on the broad economic guidelines and the employment guidelines today .
In my view , a study of the operation of macroeconomic policy during this period suggests it is helping to handle the crisis .
This is not the case .
A further mistaken assumption was made , namely that discretionary fiscal policies are right for any economic situation .
I remain convinced that the Stability and Growth Pact is the best instrument at our disposal .
Wages are always set in relation to productivity .
I am surprised at the emphasis on drawing up new action plans and new lists of things to be done .
Our main problem does not therefore involve understanding the situation we are in , but in trying to change it .
I would however like to take this opportunity of thanking you all for your contributions to this morning 's debate .
We were particularly impressed with her pertinent responses to questions on three key issues .
I would remind you that we have been discussing the broad economic guidelines and that all the speakers emphasised the willingness and ability of Parliament to work loyally towards strengthening an economy that is currently in poor shape .
This should be a policy of collective negotiation , keeping nominal wages in line with inflation and not allowing them to rise above it .
These assess stability and convergence programmes , on which we have made recommendations .
This should be time enough to see the programme through .
We denounce the problems concerning access to humanitarian aid and the presence of foreign troops on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
The peace agreement timetable provided for the formation of the government of national unity on 28 May .
The MONUC mandate needs to be extended to allow UN troops to intervene between the warring parties .
I therefore believe the House must continue to insist on this .
I feel that we should debate this on Thursday rather than take a decision at this precise moment .
I believe that this does indeed fall within the competence of the European Parliament and that you , who are as concerned as I am for there to be no financial irregularities affecting the Community budget , will also support this proposal .
The imprisonment of Mr García has already led to a general strike by the Andalusian fishing community and I believe that Portugal is trying to make an example of Mr García , making a simple fisherman , who has only committed this one offence , carry the can for a lack of political will .
Apparently , it makes no sense in this House to mention the outlawing of Batasuna .
.
Our objective is to cooperate actively so that , ultimately , we achieve an agreement that might be accepted by the Council , because otherwise we all know that it will serve little purpose .
As the rapporteur has said , the aim here is essentially to create a Statute that allows Members of the European Parliament to be recognised , not as an extension of the various national parliaments , but as representatives of the peoples of the European Union as a whole .
It goes without saying that the text proposed by the rapporteur , Mr Rothley , whom I congratulate most sincerely , is a balanced text and naturally we are going to give it our full support .
The compromise we are reaching does not differ substantially from the Commission 's initial proposals .
Everybody now knows what the rules are going to be and I would therefore insist that this is a very important step forward .
Firstly , as I said on the occasion of the debate on these texts at first reading , the Commission fully shares Parliament 's concern that the funds reserved for decommissioning and waste management should be spent as they were intended to be .
In particular it will stress the need to guarantee the full application of the relevant provisions of Community law .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to thank the three main rapporteurs , Mr Turmes , Mr Mombaur and Mr Rapkay , most sincerely once again for their superb work and their speeches .
Furthermore , Mr Herzog spoke of the problem of networks .
I believe that in this regard the regulation we are adopting today represents a model for something we have been discussing for some time , which is the public service aspect of certain issues .
All this means that the new Regulation aims to change the current situation radically , making it obligatory to transport fuels with the highest pollution risk in safer vessels .
The definition is based on technical parameters that are well known to the sector and the authorities will have no difficulty in applying it .
So far nobody has explained to us the percentage reduction in maritime accidents depending on whether the vessel is single or double hulled .
We still think , however , that , although age affects the general condition of a vessel , all the experts emphasise that maintenance is a better determining factor than age .
What is a dirty vessel ?
In this regard , I would like once again to thank the rapporteur .
We are in agreement with Amendment No 3 , although there will have to be some modification of the wording .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to take up some of the issues raised here today .
The implementation of the Erika I and II packages and the Regulation we are discussing today is simply going to guarantee us a level of safety equivalent to that of the United States .
