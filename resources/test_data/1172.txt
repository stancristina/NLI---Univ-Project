.
Secondly , I hope that countries outside the EU will follow our lead in cutting limits on nicotine , tar and carbon monoxide .
It seems absurd that we insist on exporting jobs from the EU to applicant countries and others to produce cigarettes that will be legal to import for personal consumption within the European Union .
Thirdly , I accept that the latest research indicates that smokers compensate for lower tar levels by smoking light cigarettes differently .
Nevertheless , banning such terms as "mild " , "light " and "low " threatens to make illegal long-established extra-European brands like " Mild Seven " with all the consequences for the WTO rules and it will merely increase sales of thesauruses to the tobacco industry .
If I were to be mischievous , I would recommend " Organic Green " or " One " as appropriate substitutes .
Despite these reservations , I hope the general thrust of the report will receive strong support from Parliament .
Mr President , 500 000 EU citizens die each year from smoking - that is 1 400 a day .
Even if a small number of people stop , it will have huge health implications , not only for smokers but for passive smokers as well .
It is important that we fight delaying tactics today .
The EU already regulates health warnings and tar yields .
Smokers also have a right to know that there are more than 600 additives licensed for use in tobacco products .
They have a right to know that "light " and "mild " branding is misleading .
People inhale more if they have a light cigarette than any other cigarette .
The health warning should be large and explicit .
We must warn of the dangers of smoking , the dangers of lung cancer and also the danger of bronchitis and asthma .
People must know that it is not just lung cancer but other lung diseases and other diseases as well .
We must warn of the dangers of passive smoking .
I know the dangers of smoking and the dangers of passive smoking .
I started smoking when I was 11 years old .
I ended up smoking 40 a day .
I had chronic bronchitis and I was told by the doctor that I had to give up as otherwise my life would be in danger .
My health has been damaged by smoking .
There was no warning when I took up smoking .
Maybe I would not have taken it up if there had been .
Now I am the victim of passive smoking .
I just have to pass a cigarette and I have an asthma attack , especially in this building .
I have asthma attack after asthma attack .
I am a good example of why we should adopt this report now .
Even if one person stops smoking as a result of this , or does not take it up ; even if one person is not inconsiderate any more ; even if it stops one person being hospitalised because of other people 's smoke , it is worth it .
Mr President , tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of ill health and premature death throughout most of the world .
In Scotland , which I represent , one in five people will die of smoking-related diseases .
We have an opportunity of doing something about that this week .
We must pass this report into law and thus save lives .
The reality that smoking kills is not getting across at the moment .
We need a bigger , bolder and clearer health message to make smokers more aware .
If the size of the health warning directly reflected the risk to health , the label would cover the whole cigarette packet .
Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these half will die during middle age , losing 20 to 25 years of their lives .
This directive will save lives because it is going to alter the content of cigarettes by reducing tar , nicotine and carbon monoxide yields and do away with misleading descriptions , such as "light " and mild " .
Consumers , especially young women , are being sold the idea that so-called "light " or "mild " cigarettes are better for them , as if they were the tobacco equivalent of low-fat yoghurt .
However , low-fat yoghurt does not rot your teeth , blacken your lungs or put you on a ventilator .
Yet smokers of mild cigarettes smoke more deeply to get the same nicotine hit as smokers of other products and receive the same level of damage .
I want to make health warnings bigger , better and bolder : 40 % on the front , 50 % on the back .
Health Canada recently carried out research on the effects of increasing the size of the area occupied by health warnings on cigarette packets .
The result proved that larger warning messages better encouraged smokers to stop .
Adoption of the directive would open the possibility for the improvement of health for millions .
We have the opportunity and responsibility to act positively on this today .
Mr President , may I start by declaring an interest in this debate : I am a passionate non-smoker and I wish to share my passion with other Members of the House .
But I am also passionate about something else , that is , deregulation in the field of employment and the opportunity for Member States to become increasingly competitive in the global market place .
The idea that we should ban not only the marketing of certain types of cigarette and tobacco products , but also their manufacture , in other words , that we ban the possibility to export , is wrong in principle and absurd in practice , given that those markets exist and flourish elsewhere .
