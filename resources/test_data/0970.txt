Refusing to pay such costs would lead to the work of the agencies discontinuing .
Under no circumstances should we make conditions worse for them .
I have , it is true , been astonished at the levels of bureaucracy that exist between the Bank , the Commission and the Council , evident from the financing of environmental protection investment in Russia 's Baltic basin .
The European Union guarantees a large portion of what the EIB lends and its loans in this respect do not carry any risk .
We have to promote aims that work for the common good .
With that purpose in mind , the Bank must listen very attentively to the totally justified opinions of the NGO , Bankwatch Network .
Unfortunately , this practice still does not apply to the applicant countries , and this ship had picked up its cargo at a port in the Baltic Sea .
Obviously , making ports responsible for the condition of vessels to be loaded is not enough .
Insurance law must be based on the notion that rescuing the ship must be possible and the cheapest option for the policyholder .
We have to switch to these practices swiftly and without making any exceptions .
When , however , the accident has faded in people 's memories no wise or urgent measures are taken to avoid accidents in the future .
We cannot approve of a statute that contains possible elements in the form of concealed pay .
As my colleague , Mr Lehne , attacked the Chairmen of the three groups here , I might remark that both the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have themselves provided the reason why the three groups have had to form an alliance .
The means the two largest groups have employed to prevent you , Mr President , from holding discussions with the Council have been totally unacceptable .
In the letter you sent us you have stated that , given certain preconditions , we really do have the chance now to achieve a solution and we must accept that matters regarding Members ' immunity , for example , will have to be resolved in another context .
Madam President , I would like to thank our rapporteur Mr Karas .
I do not want to be the black sheep of the House today , but I think that we should also be critical when it comes to expanding methods of open coordination to different areas .
This is a text from the report and it shows that , for Parliament , implementation of present coordination mechanisms is really important .
We have not seen enough concrete results from the coordination mechanisms and we need concrete results .
In the working group of economic governors in the Convention of which I was a member , we had a majority of members who thought that the European Parliament and the European Commission should have a role to play and that the methods of open coordination and processes should be included in the Constitutional Treaty .
If you swear by the Community method you are not supposed to suggest that the Council has a right to dismiss the Commission .
If there are abuses they must be penalised just like other civil servants .
The Commission wants to increase its power at the expense of political decision-makers .
If it is , it means the EU would have its own ' Politburo' , consisting , one assumes , of representatives of the big countries .
The right of veto is the last defence against supranational , unequal systems of decision-making under the Community method .
We must not allow the last vestiges of Member State independence to be crushed .
The federal army will commence operations next year .
Federal law and order are being got ready .
Member States should not approve draft proposals for a federation drawn up by the Commission or the Convention simply as they are .
You are a servant , who has now adopted a position on matters that are the business of your masters .
I also want to thank Denmark 's chairmen in the Council for their cooperation , which was excellent , and Commissioner Michaele Schreyer for her excellent input .
This represents an outstanding gesture of support by the European Parliament to help Member States balance their national budgets .
It also demonstrates responsibility on the part of the EU , while Member States try to meet the requirements of its Stability and Growth Pact .
At present these stand at EUR 103 billion , which is to say , more than the entire budget for one year .
The most difficult situation , relatively speaking , however , is in the area of pre-accession aid , where EUR 8.5 billion in outstanding commitments has accrued in three years , with just under EUR 2 billion being paid out in actual aid .
That is why Commission reform is extremely important .
Enlargement is the hallmark of next year 's budget .
This budget is the last to be drafted for an EU consisting of 15 Member States .
In this way we were able to meet next year 's expenditure in advance and fit administrative expenditure into the tight framework in place for heading 5 .
Agricultural expenditure is under control , so there is no need for significant reforms for budgetary reasons .
It is feared they do not correspond to the commitments made earlier and that there will be new RALs as a result , which is to say , unpaid appropriations will pile up .
It is feared that , on account of a new rule , a 'sunset clause ' , Member States will lose the payments they are due .
If next
