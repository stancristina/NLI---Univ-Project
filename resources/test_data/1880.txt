agenda .
This protocol was renewed for a period of two months to avoid a break in fishing activities .
Mesh sizes have been increased , especially for cephalopods , from 65 mm to 70 mm .
We are now about to enter what might be called a third generation agreement .
Our Group notes with satisfaction that this agreement places greater emphasis on traditional fishing which , in line with commitments made by the Senegalese government , should benefit until 2001 from a significant share of the financial compensation paid by the European Union .
I am truly sorry that Mr Faur√© is not with us today , champion of human rights that he is .
I am convinced that European fishermen have lost an excellent representative within the European Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries .
Mr President , may I draw attention to the fact that yesterday one of our National Front colleagues was encouraging us to celebrate the 14th of July and to dance the carmagnole , while at the same time the mayor of Toulon was banning the festival arranged by the anti-racist organization SOS Racisme , on this French day of freedom ?
As if the directive 's opponents had a monopoly on protecting life and its supporters were messengers of death !
We respect your convictions , which derive from your history , your culture and your religion .
As has already been said , the directive states plainly that the human body is not patentable , that human cloning is banned and as is altering the human gene line .
One or two questions come to mind .
It is inept and misleading to try to present an ethical principle as being common to animals , plants and human beings .
Have they been taken sufficiently into account ?
It is true that some of Parliament 's proposals have been taken on board , but once again the ethical requirements that the patenting of human tissue makes indispensable have not been adequately taken into account .
One could be cynical and choose , for economic reasons , to side with the strong , but that would not be my personal choice in this matter .
We do of course need to take into account those patients who are hoping for advances that would enable them to be treated more effectively thanks to these new technologies .
It makes it possible to treat not only those major genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and myopathy , but also certain rare diseases , the so-called orphan diseases .
The Rothley report undoubtedly gives pre-eminence to the economic and technical aspects of the debate .
Two years ago we were seduced and panicked by the horror stories of those opposed to biotechnological research .
It is indeed wrong for the Commission to seek to claim rights that it does not actually possess in order to avoid all controls on the manner in which it negotiates .
With regard to the Commission 's communication on biotechnology , our Group believes that a measure of development in this industry of tomorrow should be allowed to go ahead , while keeping a very careful watch to prevent any possible abuses .
The intention is political , purely and simply political .
Mr President , in presenting his proposals within the framework of the ad hoc procedure for agricultural expenditure in the 1998 budget Mr Tillich embarked on a difficult , not to say perilous , exercise .
Mr President , although the proposals of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development make good sense on the whole , are realistic and at any rate sympathetic to farmers , the ultimate objective seems to be - does it not ? - to finance policies other than European agriculture , to prove to all that the policy that works the least badly since the signing of the Treaty of Rome is no longer working , and in that way to take its financing away from it .
I am convinced that the adoption of these texts and that of the application regulations are going to give a fresh boost to the transport of persons , offering a greater choice of services at more attractive prices .
Madam President , air transport has become considerably more democratic .
We are in Europe , in democratic countries , but there is no reason to reject legal objections in a political majority - especially since we are at the first stage of the ratification of the Amsterdam decisions .
It therefore appears as a vote without debate .
Have we learned the lessons of the failure of Amsterdam , in terms of institutional reform , by arbitrarily limiting to twenty - in the secret hope that one of the six selected will give up along the way - the number of future members of the Union so that we can continue to function without having to reform the institutions ?
But there is a difference between being clear and giving the impression of unfairness .
It is a pipedream to think that a few structural funds could keep down unemployment or immigration .
Our Group is opposed to the inter-institutional agreement .
We did have some debates in committee but we should not make this report into something more important than it is .
Madam President , I should like to second Mr Fabre-Aubrespy 's motion for the interinstitutional agreement to be referred back to committee .
This is all proof that we are not doing things seriously , especially concerning important matters .
Strange legal objects , then , these inter-institutional agreements , by means of which the European institutions grant themselves the right to interpret the treaties !
The text before us now is far more protective on the most vital point , concerning human life , human dignity , from the very beginning of life .
