are reflected in the quality of its analysis tools .
It is obvious , however , that classifying sites as world heritage sites is not enough .
For example , the approach adopted in its reflects exclusively budgetary concerns , for example , when the report expresses satisfaction at the reform reducing institutional prices and surplus produce , and insists on a greater reduction of compensation payments , without even mentioning the consequences this will have for farmers ' incomes .
What is needed is an improvement in the situation of small producers , differentiating support according to the size of the farm .
The problem lies , on the one hand , in the slowness with which directives are transposed into national law and , on the other , in shortcomings in their implementation .
We also have a situation , however , in which a degree of impunity reigns .
It is 32 years since Sicco Mansholt , the Commissioner responsible for agriculture from the time the Commission was formed until 1972 , presented his draft reform of the common agricultural policy , the Mansholt Plan .
The bold study drawn up on this issue by Parliament confirms that land is still the major investment for European farmers .
It will require an agricultural policy that is defined in regional rather than sectoral terms and will require priority for the environment , rural development , vocational training and early retirement .
In the mid-1980s , the CAP began changing in order to improve measures for direct control of production with the aim of preventing surpluses and guaranteeing the stability of prices and incomes .
These are , specifically , to create special reserves for quotas and production rights solely for young farmers , to increase support for setting up a first farm and investment in farm properties , to establish a special scheme for low-interest loans to supplement other investment aid , to establish conditions for the proper functioning of an early retirement scheme for older farmers , which will speed up the process of renewal and , of course , to adopt training and information measures .
At the last Justice and Home Affairs Council , held on 30 November 2000 , I expressed the Commission ' s sympathy with Member States who face the problem of terrorism and , in particular , with Spain , and I was delighted to welcome the bilateral agreement concluded between Spain and Italy .
I wish to reiterate the Commission ' s commitment , using all its powers under the Treaties , to encourage tougher European action against terrorism , an issue that will be given great prominence in the Commission ' s work programme for 2001 , which will shortly be discussed in this House .
With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the Union now has , following Tampere , a mandate to adopt common minimum rules in the field of asylum and refugee protection , with a view , in the medium term , to adopting a common European asylum system .
By the same token , the Commission ' s proposal on minimum standards to apply to the process of granting and withdrawing refugee status , which the Commission adopted on 20 September 2000 , contains various provisions addressing the specific needs of women , such as Article 4( 4 ) , which lays down that women have the right to present a request for asylum separately from their husband , or Article 3(8 ) , which enshrines the principle of an independent and separate interview for women when presenting a request for asylum .
We must understand this .
Mr President , Commissioner , I simply wish to ask for your understanding so that before I embark on the subject of my report , I may take a minute to speak about Morocco .
It is incomprehensible , given that the European Union is home to so many millions of Moroccans and that we have provided that country with so many trade concessions to ensure its products access to our market , that they should have reciprocated our openness and cooperation so little .
The protocol governing fishing arrangements between the European Union and the Republic of GuineaÂ­Bissau was signed in June 1997 and came into force in December of that year , remaining valid until June this year .
On the basis of a programme of actions proposed by the Government of Guinea-Bissau , the Commission will pay over 50 % of the compensation that has been provided for and will pay the balance when the government of that country has submitted a detailed report on the progress of the actions it has proposed and the results that have been achieved .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to draw your attention to a point that I believe constitutes an omission in the common fisheries policy .
The situation in Portugal is that 40 boats have remained inactive since December 1999 and if the agreement is concluded one day , many of these businesses may by then have become unviable .
Lastly , as Mr Gallagher has pointed out , we would like to see an exclusion zone of 24 miles for coastal fishing .
My second point relates to the principle of relative stability and the full use of fishing rights obtained outside Community waters .
They are thus exposing themselves to the risk that their share will be reduced once a review of quotas allocated to the parties involved takes place .
Nevertheless , as has been confirmed at regional conferences , there is profound criticism of the common fisheries policy , both with regard to the TAC system and quotas and with regard to the system of Multiannual Guidance Programmes , which have led to discrimination and have not brought any major benefits to the industry .
