This was unfortunately not the case .
The whole assessment of the report will , however , be such that I have chosen to abstain in the final vote .     I have abstained in the final vote .
EU Member States do not occupy one another .
Turkey has everything to learn from this .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I was present at the meeting in Johannesburg .
The impending meeting in Bonn will , of course , be of great significance .
We have discussed some of the most important tools .
The situation is not as a number of people think , that is that we have a complete stalemate .
Important work has therefore already been got under way .
On the contrary , it will become cheaper .
This is especially true if we also take the fossil fuel subsidies out of the equation .
This development will continue .
Wind energy alone has increased from 5GW ( gigawatts ) in 1997 to 27GW in 2003 .
An enormous amount is happening , and the potential is fantastic .
I understand that the Conference of Presidents has decided to remove this report , previously considered by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
If Parliament does not discuss the report and place that aspect in context , I do not see the reason for discussing sexual exploitation at all .
That has been truly depressing , but I welcome this proposal , and hope that a large majority in Parliament will support the compromise proposal drawn up by Mrs Gebhardt .
The right to earlier repayment must also be improved .
I also think that better information on credit cards is needed , and that the exclusions in some amendments are not really desirable .
This also goes to show that this aspect is necessary for consumers when markets are developed .     .
The share of voting power for different types of share is another example of what should not be decided at EU level , as this would cause problems for small - and medium-sized enterprises , or future companies , in some EU countries .
The aim of eco-design is to integrate technical possibilities when they are at their greatest .
We have rules on waste management with quantitative targets for recovery and reuse .
New tools for saving energy are important , therefore .
Latest reports in my home country indicate that it is set to exceed the CO2 emissions quota for the 2005-2007 period by 14 % .
We want the leading and best technology as a yardstick for future implementing measures .
It is said that we have given priority to the environment at the expense of social and economic issues .
It has become apparent that we obtain very little value for money from subsidies at the intervention stage .
The scope is broad , but in actual fact what we have here is an organised regulatory framework for how to proceed , how to choose what is important and how to set requirements in the future : the prototype for good governance , in other words .
Self-regulation also has a role to play , in Parliament’s view , but only if it produces better , faster results than would the regulated procedure .
I wish to thank my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation on the preparation of this report .
Our views still differ on a number of small points , for instance with regard to the legal basis and conformity assessment , but we shall not let the details obscure the fact that we have been united .
The problem we face is that total pollution in society , especially due to our habits of consumption , is increasing all the time .
The Integrated Product Policy we are debating in this House today offers excellent opportunities for creating a framework of incentives to get us to move away from production and consumption models characterised by a consumerist approach to linear resource flows and , instead , to embrace resource efficiency , waste minimisation , controlled use of hazardous substances and expansion of the stocks of natural capital .
The advantage of an Integrated Product Policy is that it involves a comprehensive approach , that is to say it tackles the whole product chain from the extraction of natural resources via product design and the production phase itself to the stage at which the product’s useful life is over .
We need the thematic strategies , but we also need a framework for the Integrated Product Policy in order to hold the policy together and to be a driving force in its actual implementation .
In general , environmental policy and also energy policy must become far more coherent and consistent .
EMAS and ISO are obviously constructive , but research shows that they are not enough .
That is rarely the case at present , in which case how is the market supposed to be able to help ?
As I see it , we need to place the Integrated Product Policy within a dynamic framework that supplies guidelines for policy in general and provides support for the thematic strategies .
Thirdly , the optimisation of the product design process by the selection of materials that have as little environmental impact as possible .
I do not have time to go into this now , but there are a number of examples where companies now make use of these principles , bring about perfectly clean solutions and , moreover , earn money from doing so .
We have put a lot of effort into finding a better name that will tell the uninitiated something of what this is about , if only that it is an important task .
Secondly , we are in the process of drawing up a European inventory of those products that have the
