I regret , however , that the Council again rejected our offer to carry out an informal conciliation procedure so that the Erika I package could be concluded with regard to these two directives in the next few days .
We clearly ought to enter into the conciliation procedure with the Council .
Can anyone possibly understand the Council ' s blockade any more ?
Let us not forget that many hauliers from adjacent third countries exploit the situation and certain authorisations - be it CEMT licences or bilateral authorisations - to operate with poor social conditions and low wages .
Here we are talking about a very few people , but their behaviour has devastating consequences .
One of the biggest obstacles preventing EU representatives from assuming an active role in the peace process is what are , at times , incomprehensible and intolerable unilateral accusations and intrepid judgements .
This is not just a task for the Commission and the US Administration .
The Council was in favour of a regulation which allowed the Member States to set the maximum amounts payable , with the amounts set by Parliament here as minimum , not maximum amounts .
Apart from reducing beef production , I am also in favour of safeguarding a minimum wage for small holdings and increasing animal premiums .
We must call on Turkey today to ensure that the new regulation is implemented as quickly as possible , so that the conditions of detention in the prisons actually improve .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , as the Commissioner and President-in-Office have pointed out , we are dealing here not with a country which is far flung from Europe , but with a candidate country with a whole host of serious problems .
I call on Turkey to give us , the European Parliament , and Europe a chance to help it overcome this problem , but Turkey must also show willing .
Isolation cells to be opened at once , new arrangements to be made for visits by relatives and lawyers at once , medical attention from doctors of their choice , these are more or less their immediate demands in order to call off the hunger strike .
All prisoners must be treated equally .
In these circumstances it is , of course , very difficult to make people in Turkey understand why we debate these problems here in the European Parliament .
Mr President , could you please find out how these three people even got in here ?
The European Union is already doing its best to facilitate this dialogue .
If the truth be told , this problem was criminally neglected for years .
We must just hope that the elections can still be brought forward .
With all due respect for what Mrs Pack said - and I nearly always agree with her - I do not see the connection with Kosovo in the same light .
But I think we should go one stage further and say to the region loud and clear : if you are willing to resolve all your economic , social and political problems , then you have a real chance of obtaining candidate status for the European Union .
I am also sorry to have to say as much to my friend and colleague Mr Dupuis .
As far as the future is concerned , the concept of open coordination is on the table .
We have countries today in which 80 % of people in employment have a company pension .
Mr President , this Chamber was illegally stormed this afternoon during the debate on Turkey .
There was no obligation to keep records or ledgers of accounts payable .
First to Mr Casaca 's report .
The first part deals with postponing the decision on the reform in the olive oil sector for two years , until we have more accurate data and a more reliable control system , and the second part deals with the introduction of a new regulation on classifying olive oil and the quality strategy for olive oil .
The relevant Commission Regulation (EC ) No 2366/98 already provides a legal basis for priority monitoring of mills .
The Commission is unable to accept this at the moment because it prefers to find terms which correspond more closely to the perceptions of the sector as a whole .
However , I can confirm that the Commission does appreciate almost half the proposed amendments , even if it can only directly accept a few of them .
The supplementary budget , in terms of numbers , totals EUR 9.846 million .
In the past , it is true , we had a situation in which several Commissioners had to agree between themselves as to who was to look after and deal with which part of the world .
In this respect , we have to know what the common foreign and security policy should look like in the future and who is to be responsible for it .
Nonetheless , we take the view that one voice here in Parliament must give a clear warning because a development is being introduced here which should give us all cause for concern .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , just two brief comments .
The explanation is that this is the third year in which the reforms decided under Agenda 2000 need to be funded .
Commitment appropriations have been increased by a total of 4.1 % for internal policies .
This should ensure that pre-accession aid is taken up to a greater extent in order to carry out the reforms needed with a view to enlarging the European Union .
We shall have to check that the Union 's revenue is going to be used efficiently and for its intended purpose within the framework of
