which , in common with the previous report , enjoyed the support of all committee members .
I voted in favour of the package of amendments , which have given substance to the common position .     .
The Commission ’s proposal for decoupling production aid , which has now also been approved by Parliament , is unacceptable and does not augur well for the discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers .
Yet the most worrying consequence of this proposal would be the number of producers leaving the sector in Portugal , which would happen , according to various studies .
We deplore the rejection of our group ’s proposal , which would , at least , have protected some production-based aid – linked to the quantity of olive oil actually produced , and not to the hectare .
It is also proposed that the term ‘operators ’ should be replaced with the more correct name ‘olive producers’ , and that producers ’ organisations should not be assigned market supervision and monitoring duties , which should remain the responsibility of the existing national supervisory bodies in the olive and agricultural sectors .
The tone of the report seeks to fuel not only the rifts that occurred in Europe at the time of the Iraq war but also animosity against the US.
It is also true , however , that the step to be taken in May 2004 is of the greatest political significance , in that it powerfully demonstrates the vitality of all the countries of Europe involved in enlargement when they are faced with the challenge that history has set for them .
Mr President , Commissioner , Hungary is one of those countries whose performance in preparing to join the European Union has been outstanding .
It is a strategic report , even though it conceals or disguises its class nature , which the so-called Lisbon strategy reveals clearly .
A speculative one ? !
The fact that the majority of the elderly in the European Union are women – over 63 % of people aged between 75 and 84 , and 72 % of those over 85 are women – means that they in particular will be the ones most affected by problems in health care systems and long-term care , either as carers themselves or as people in receipt of care .
What is needed is greater public investment in facilities and equipment and in the training of the technical and specialist workers needed , better provision of quality care and assistance for the elderly , specifically in the health services , and the setting-up of home care services , ensuring that all citizens have access to these services in all the countries of the European Union .
It is an attack in the middle of an electoral process ; it is a direct attack on democracy and freedom .
Secondly , again as the author of the motion , I wish to recall that , even though 11 September was the favourite date in the vote in committee , not everyone in the committee voted for it .
It should be noted that direct payments to farmers in the enlargement countries were already going to be phased in over time , starting at only 25 % of the current Member States’ direct payments in the first year .
It is well known that the observer members are dissatisfied with the proposal because the farmers in their Member States will be given different treatment at first , with direct payments for certain products only being made gradually over 10 years .
The European airlines ’ scepticism as to the effectiveness of this instrument , due to the difficulty in proving that carriers from other , non-Community countries are operating unfairly by setting their ticket prices too low , will depend only on the Commission ’s ability to put this instrument into practice .     . – I supported this report because I consider Mr Nicholson’s proposal very well balanced in suggesting very few changes , which should not prevent this important dossier from being brought to a swift conclusion .
Finally , I must emphasise the importance of indeed extending the benefits of this information interchange to businesses and citizens , thus fulfilling both the goals of the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2005 Action Plan , approved at the Seville European Council in June 2002 .     . – I congratulate Mr Bradbourn on the report he has submitted to us , which I support .
Many TGV projects included in this package by the Council are due for completion roughly at the time proposed by the Commission for the liberalisation of international passenger transport .
In view of the many doubts that have been raised recently regarding the Quick Start communication , which shortlists priority projects that are in a position for the work to be carried out more rapidly , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism is prudent in highlighting the fact that this communication is not binding .     . – I agree with this report , which seeks approval for a proposal to exclude those parts of airports reserved exclusively for small aircraft from the scope of Regulation (EC ) No 2320/2002 .
This is an attempt to remove the remaining obstacles to the mobility of workers in the EU.     .
The concept of real cohesion and social inclusion makes this necessary .
The rapporteur tabled various compromise amendments to the directive but , although they were intended to soften its impact , they sought to ensure its adoption without calling into question the logic of the VAT system or of the directive on liberalisation .     .
In my view , the proposal represents a significant improvement on the previous one , and therefore warranted my vote .     .
