The Commission 's Green Paper on the future of relations between the European Union and the countries of Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP ) is an initiative with wide political implications , in terms of both strategic options and operations .
Now , they are resolved by a discussion here in Parliament .
If in fact Members of Parliament wish to gain credibility , if they want to acquire some prestige from the ethical point of view - which they do not have - if they want to win the consideration of the press - and I know that there are a large number of not very honourable journalists , as we have seen in the case we discussed earlier - the Members themselves will have to fight for that cause .
Since the court cannot pass judgment unless his parliamentary immunity is waived , the Public Prosecutor of the Portuguese Republic has made a request to the European Parliament accordingly .
Finally , I wish to inform Parliament that I abstained in the vote . van Velzen report ( A4-0307/97 ) , draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy .
It was Parliament , through the rapporteur of the Committee on Regional Policy , Mr Tillich , which reinstated the ECU 1 , 000 million .
It was this Parliament , particularly through the rapporteur , Mr Tillich , which set up the mechanism of obtaining an ECU 150 million package , which the Council was unable to achieve by the wholesale direct cuts it made in the European Communities Budget .
This is also an extremely important programme in terms of aid and for the image of the European Union .
Nevertheless , any agreement and vote of approval we may give to the inclusion of a fund for that purpose does not mean that we have any great illusions as to the practical reality of that declaration of priority .
But we cannot in any event fail to note the drastic limits of this action , particularly evidenced by the cuts made particularly in important areas of our social , education and youth , cultural , environmental , consumer protection and research policies , to mention only a few of the most important .
Meanwhile , and following the same line of thought , we cannot understand and do not accept allocation of the Committee on Budget of ECU 100 million in class II to the Prince initiative ; similarly , we do not agree that the additional allocation of ECU 60 million to the Retex and Rechar programmes should also be at the cost of normal structural actions .
Thank you nevertheless for your brief intervention .
Since you did so very briefly , I did not stop you .
It is also an urgent matter for us to adopt appropriate means of self-regulation , the most efficient and certainly the most realistic , to do away with the savage competition which produces serious attacks on the right of the individual to credible information and personal privacy .
In this way we shall have citizens in Europe who think and are not the playthings of interests which pass over their heads .
That unequivocal point is the importance that animals should be treated well , and hygienically , while they are being transported .
This is a very useful and positive proposal .
In conclusion , Madam President , I would like to say one thing : not long ago , an English colleague asked Members to declare whether or not they had any interest in this matter .
Madam President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it seems there is a production surplus of pears , apples , peaches and nectarines in the European Union .
Nevertheless , in proposing these guidelines and figures the Commission omits from its analysis consideration of certain points which we think are essential .
Sadly , 29 people lost their lives in the floods and landslides caused by the torrential rain .
I am sure , Madam President , that you will fulfil this request without delay .
The text submitted for adoption by the House includes many of the amendments which our group tabled , and takes account of a large number of other ideas which we upheld throughout the long months of debate .
Nevertheless , we must not celebrate too soon : it is only a first step .
It represents an initial contribution , and the European Parliament has done well to get down to work , to take a lead in this debate , and to endeavour to set out a position in the future discussion of the common fisheries policy after 2002 .
My second point concerns structural policy - and it is not possible to disconnect this issue from the question of Agenda 2000 .
Finally , our group supports the attachment of increased importance to environmental aspects , notably as regards the adoption of a precautionary approach , referred to in the draft report , and the upholding of the principle of relative stability .
The first concerns the application of the single market rules .
Thirdly , I should like to stress the importance of sound medium-term programming in the framework of the multi-annual guidance programmes , or MGPs , for the fishing industry .
Indeed , this new law , which guarantees the right to equal treatment between men and women in the workplace , enshrines the concept , not of shifting , but of reversing the burden of proof .
We therefore hope , Commissioner Flynn , that the amendments tabled today at second reading - especially Amendment No 5 on indirect discrimination , Amendment No 8 on the benefit of the doubt , and Amendment No 12 - will be adopted by the necessary majority and forcefully upheld by the Commission , since these are essential to defending women 's rights in the fields of employment and social security .
