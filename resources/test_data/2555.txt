report , although of course they are far less extensive than his .
There will be time to modify , if need be , the opinions which Mr Izquierdo Collado is expressing today in the current report .
In this sense , I agree with the rapporteur when he calls for more coordination in implementing these policies .
In discussing and voting on this report , we need to think about certain points which have not only been vitally important in the recent past , but will continue to be so in the immediate future , because of enlargement .
That is what the European Commission said in Agenda 2000 because , among other things , its legal department has set out the basis for applying the cohesion fund , and this is absolutely independent of whether or not the convergence criteria have been met and whether monetary union has been accomplished .
The fact that it is possible for these differences to become more pronounced shows that the application of the cohesion fund has been relatively unsuccessful .
I should like to draw attention to two statements which appear in the report : firstly , the inequalities within the European Union have hardly been reduced in the last ten years , despite the progress which has been made and the effectiveness of structural policies ; secondly , nearly all Community policies have effects which are clearly counterproductive to cohesion .
I end by expressing once more my sincere congratulations to our rapporteur for his excellent work .
We must not forget that this benefits everybody , not just those to whom it is specifically directed .
Reports do not always contain everything we would like them to , of course , but in this area we need consensus .
How did cohesion perform during the period we are considering ?
Thirdly - and this is an aspect the report does not take into account - once we no longer have exchange rates and monetary policy as a way of dealing with crises of asymmetry , funds to address the principle of cohesion will be needed more than ever .
Then I remember , in the spring of 1995 we finally received the text of the Commission 's proposal , and when discussions on it started in the Committee on Legal Affairs , in October or November of that same year , I said to my colleagues in the General Council for European Lawyers , " I think it is going to happen ; it will be approved within two years ' .
For I do not subscribe to the opinion , Mrs Fontaine , that this matter should be seen as a confrontation between a liberal view and a protectionist view .
Madam President , I wish to pay tribute to the good job done by the two excellent rapporteurs , Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos .
Objectively , we believe that the Amsterdam Treaty is a failure .
Lastly , it recommends that the Member States ratify the Amsterdam Treaty .
Indeed , for some Members , the Amsterdam Treaty is a resounding failure , but for others it represents the triumph of pragmatism over idealism .
On the contrary , we must also recognize our new point of departure .
No.
Whatever form is given to the treaties - by means of a system of revision which clearly cannot be the present system of an Intergovernmental Conference alone - as long as Europe does not have a socioeconomic model or an international political vision , the Community , the Union , will continue to function , for better or for worse , with highly competent institutions , but it will not be integrated into the world .
European reform , European action , the European position must be viewed in relation to the need to enhance Europe 's image on the world stage as a socioeconomic and international political model .
I believe that the European Union must adopt a vigorous stance vis-à-vis the United States , and must not enter into negotiations on the Helms-Burton Act , but affirm that act is illegal .
What implications does this have for the new transatlantic agenda ?
It is essential to take forward the process of halting the violence ; and we must provide the maximum possible political and parliamentary support for this process , the initiative for which must come from Algeria itself .
The conclusion is that we must establish that the Member State in question is responsible by means of Community law .
Mr President , given that , as an eminent lawyer and a Member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , this is a subject with which you are familiar , I hope that you at least will be able to follow me .
As rapporteur , it was difficult for me to explain what I was doing , because nobody knew what that was .
Thus , in the framework of a new and different procedure , progress was made , the dossier was taken forward .
Consequently , I believe that we have struck a good balance .
You would think that a person should have to pay to appear in a telephone directory , and should be entitled to be omitted free-of-charge .
Of the thirteen amendments debated at second reading , eleven were the subject of the final stage of the codecision procedure , and the Conciliation Committee agreed a satisfactory joint text on them all .
That was secured .
As the rapporteur said , a result was also obtained for Parliament 's Amendment No 9 concerning the possibility of not appearing in a telephone directory ; and , at this late hour , I shall simply conclude by welcoming the collaboration between the institutions which enabled us to achieve a solution to this undoubtedly thorny problem
