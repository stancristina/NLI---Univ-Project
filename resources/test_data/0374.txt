on Budgets .
In a question I put to the European Commission , I estimated on the basis of what I had read in the newspapers that each such SME needed approximately ECU 100 000 in order to carry out its conversion procedure .
Madam President , the issue of the mandatory vote is much too serious to degenerate into a dispute between the Presidency and Mr Falconer .
Therefore I wish to announce that I am present and that I will not vote .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate my colleague on his very serious attempt to achieve the necessary convergence of opinion between Parliament and the Council on the institution of directives which aim in good faith to ensure ferry safety .
I would like to believe that neither the Council nor the Commission , nor indeed Parliament , wishes to take measures simply to satisfy public opinion while essentially having very little to offer to improve the level of ferry safety .
Measures should be taken , but they should be taken calmly and coolly and should tackle the problem as a whole .
Madam President , I would like to say that I too share the concern that has been expressed over the multilateral agreement on investments .
European cultural policy was threatened during the GATT negotiations , when we achieved , in part , cultural exception .
But we must not forget that other areas are also at issue , as has already been mentioned , such as transport , fishing and agriculture .
Of course , no-one can be opposed to the laying down of regulations to stimulate and safeguard foreign investments in order to prevent conditions which would distort international competition .
Finally , I believe that the European Parliament must defend and protect its own rights and powers and those of the European Union from all attempts at curtailment through this agreement on investments .
It is a multi-faceted ideological assault by large multinational corporations and , as has already been said , the first step in the formation of a global government of multinationals .
I repeat , the European Parliament makes only one demand - the rejection of the agreement .
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for continuing to resist the pressures of the Council and the Commission , which may have endorsed some amendments , ladies and gentlemen , but which endorsed the insignificant amendments .
It is also , under certain conditions , a question of certain nuclear waste , after it has been enriched with plutonium , being used for other purposes , Mr Commissioner , for military purposes .
So the Commission and the Council should not only have accepted the rapporteur 's original amendments , which imposed strict conditions for the control and safety of such loads , but the Council should have proposed even stricter conditions .
And you all know very well that this nuclear waste goes to certain countries which , as we discovered , are a danger to their neighbours , and in which we decided to intervene either in the guise of NATO or in I do not know what other guise .
The Council publishes directives and regulations which are not implemented by the Member States .
We must , however , protest against this state of affairs , at least within the European Union .
For that reason , we all need to show sensitivity to each other at all times .
Indeed , it is not unrelated to the astonishing ignorance shown by the West with regard to the complex historical reality of an extremely difficult region , nor to the ineptness and partiality with which it reacted to much of the tragedy in Yugoslavia .
The Yugoslavia of Tito granted them an autonomy which , unfortunately , has since been dispensed with .
Therefore any initiative aimed at avoiding new conflicts and at coming to an understanding with the moderate leaders of the Albanians of Kosovo is more than welcome .
Belgrade must understand that closer ties with the European Union cannot come about through violence and that an internal dispute which places the peace of a wider region in danger is much less internal than it claims .
At some point we must draw our conclusions from the policy of the large powers in the Balkans , and we must assume the responsibilities which are appropriate to the dramatic developments taking place against the peoples of the former Yugoslavia .
It must totally oppose the use of violence , or the threat of the use of violence , and it must denounce the threatened new embargo against Serbia - the people have suffered enough from the various embargos .
If you are present , you vote or you do not vote .
You will get an allowance if you vote for or if you vote against .
If you do neither one nor the other , you do not get an allowance .
It is unacceptable , Mr President .
This is taking place in the interests of multinational companies , in order to penetrate into these areas by means of neocolonialist methods , to exploit their natural wealth and human resources and to create further imperialistic zones for further domination and expansion throughout the region .
Madam President , it is rather pointless continuing a debate which seems to have already ended , but let us carry on .
The terrorists of the so-called Freedom Army of Kosovo , with their violence and murder , are not helping the Albanians of Kosovo .
I think that we must regard the actions of the Presidency and the initiatives of Mr Cook as very constructive .
Destabilization throughout the region would then be a fact with unforeseeable consequences for peace in the Balkans .
It is necessary to begin immediate dialogue in order to find a solution .
