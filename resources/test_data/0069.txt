now nonetheless to be heading towards a compromise , I think that what you have accomplished so far is commendable .
In conclusion , I want to say that it is incredibly unfortunate that we have ended up in this position .
Madam President , freedom of movement is the core of EC law .
In order to encourage increased movement within the EU , we must begin by simplifying the rules .
People who do not live in what , from a legal point of view , are traditional family structures must have the same right as married couples to live together in the countries of the EU.
Ultimately , we are concerned here with respect and the equal value of every person .
It is an extremely important debate that Commissioner Patten is drawing to our attention here .
Mr Patten intimates what might be the shape of that dialogue .
As the European Parliament , it is our task to demand that a structured dialogue of this kind be brought about .
I believe that the European Union ought in actual fact to give priority to Belarus in the present situation .
Belarus suffers from huge problems , of course .
Belarus has itself chosen the isolation to which it has been exposed .
We hope that the country can introduce democracy , human rights and principles characteristic of a state governed by law .
His latest professions of friendship for his fellow dictator , Saddam Hussein are no doubt in keeping with what we know about the Belorusian leader .
Even though I value the idea of a structured dialogue , I wonder how it will be possible for this to take place with the regime in question .
There is cause for taking a gloomy view of developments in Belarus , but let us not for that reason betray the Belorusian people , who have had to put up with a great deal , and let us never stop putting pressure on the regime and the authorities .
Mr President , there should be no problem at all in banning E 425 konjac.
I can recommend our voting against Amendments Nos 1 and 3 if the Commission now sincerely pledges to change these lists of additives and make a point of examining them within a reasonable period .
The conditions governing freedom of movement and residence within the EU for persons without EU citizenship must be clear and simple to apply legally .
Today 's adoption of Amendments Nos 14 to 16 ( 262 votes in favour , 238 against and 30 abstentions ) shows that a majority wishes to move in the opposite direction .
I would thank the Commissioner for that answer .
I would ask you to confirm that this is a correct interpretation of what you have just said .
I believe we must do everything to express the positive attitude merited by the birth of children and the advent of a new generation here in Europe , signalling the vigour of our countries .
Mr President , we must back a transport system in Europe that makes high demands in terms of the environment and safety .
I also appreciate , and completely support , the proposals to transfer freight from roads to railways and the sea .
It is a great challenge to create a transport system in the EU because Europe does not constitute a homogeneous geographical area .
There are advantages to backing trans-European networks .
I agree that we have great investment needs and that we must use trans-European networks .
We are now awaiting the Commission 's third road safety programme and have been doing so for a long time .
I also think it right that it should be examined critically .
At the same time , we must not underestimate the fact that it has done quite a bit of good .
Might it be that economic coordination and monetary policy are playing a role ?
It needs to hang together properly , and more focus on implementation is required .
We are in favour of an open economy , competition and structural reforms , but we are also in favour of a high social standard , that is to say social systems that provide security and the target of full employment .
This affects the whole area .
In the end , almost nothing is given priority and , instead , there is just a long repetition of politically correct words and phrases , while Europe all but stands still .
Confidence in the European business climate is undermined by short-sighted financial aid that is hostile to development , causes distortion and hampers competition .
They are nice to listen to , but it is action that is now required .
Furthermore , we believe that authorities are never better placed than employers themselves to know who is best suited for a particular post .
There is a lot of money in already existing funds that is not used to the full .
We are in favour , however , of the proposal to set up an inquiry into the development of new methods for funding major infrastructure projects of common European interest .
Every year , many thousands of lives are claimed on European roads .
National authorities now already exist with the task of promoting road safety - in Sweden 's case , the National Road Administration in Borl√§nge .
A European transport fund could easily lead to countries ' deliberately according less priority to their national investment in roads in order , instead , to request funds from the common European budget .
We are quarrelling with the United States .
The rift may have incredibly serious consequences , and the different initiatives now coming out of the various capital cities will be of no use if they are not coordinated .
The net is closing in on Saddam Hussein .
