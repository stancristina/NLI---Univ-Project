of the country for which I am currently responsible , Lithuania , which plays a key role as a transit country for trade with Russia and Belarus .
If the country has its competition policy in order and has harmonised its standards and rules in this area , then it is qualified to increase its trade and take on whatever competitors there may be .
But we should not look at competition policy in isolation .
As far as I am aware , it is the case that if a Dane wishes to go hunting in the UK he has to submit his application a month in advance .
My question is therefore : how many countries have still not implemented the directive ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , simply trying to reach a common position with regard to the ports in Europe is a brave thing .
They will immediately begin to compare and compete with each other .
The message from Parliament this evening will be that by modernising , by giving the ports some opportunities and by being united , we can change transport habits .
Go home to your own ports and tell them that it is not the neighbouring port which is the competition , but the roads , and then let us ensure that we make some progress .
I know that there are very large differences between ports as far as public-private partnership financing and harbour costs are concerned , but let us remember that we cannot change transport habits through market forces alone .
May I say to Mr Wijsenbeek that I regard him very highly , but his contribution this evening shows that he does not know very much about ports and ships .
May I also express my unreserved support for the project concerning a strategy for global navigation systems .
It is a great pleasure for me to see that the Commission and the Council have succeeded in reaching agreement on a strategy .
The development of increasingly accurate systems with accompanying communications possibilities will lead to a strengthening and a much better and safer use of European airspace .
I expect the ESA - the European Space Agency - to continue to act as the EU 's technological arm in this area .
Even if substantial public financing could prove necessary , there is no doubt in my mind that the savings on new infrastructure projects will easily be able to pay for much of the establishment of GNSS.
The question is whether we can agree on a reform which has the right balance , so that the agricultural sector does not end up carrying the heaviest load , and so that the burden in connection with the reform which will take place because of enlargement and the WTO negotiations is evenly distributed .
The first concerns the Fantuzzi report on cereals .
I would like to bring the attention of both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner to the fact that cereals are the most important element in controlling agricultural production .
I therefore think the price of cereals is set too low and the Commission is not sufficiently interested in using set-aside .
The USA has shown this for many years .
That is cheaper than putting cereals into storage .
Finally , Commissioner , a comment on the calculation showing that EUR 3-4 billion is being saved on the budget and that consumers are saving EUR 10-15 billion .
This means that agriculture will transfer EUR 15 billion to consumers and agriculture will lose out in the reform , because compensation will not be available through the market , and that is no solution for supplying the market with agricultural produce .
I agree that it should happen before March , and we will do our best .
Mr President , the common agricultural policy , which was set up in the 1950s when there were only six Member States , is now facing change .
We are therefore obliged to make some changes , whether we want to or not .
We know the main ideas : general support schemes are to be abolished and European farmers will have to compete on the world market .
I also believe that , in the slightly longer term , this will make it necessary for us to abolish the whole milk quota system .
But I have no regrets .
I think it will be a good idea to do this in the longer term .
I believe in fact that people should be aware that the process which will be started by Agenda 2000 will lead to more and more liberalisation in the agricultural sector .
We have tabled amendments to a number of the proposals which have been put forward in Parliament .
We feel that in many ways the Commission 's proposal is more realistic than what Parliament has been able to agree on , and I hope that Parliament will understand that it is in fact necessary to fall in line with the approach set out by the Commission .
We therefore have to find a solution which can be implemented , and we also have to respect the time factor .
I therefore wish both the President-in-Office and the Agriculture Commissioner good luck , and hope that things will be in place in March .
I should like to welcome the new President-in-Office and say that I was extremely pleased with his reply , in which he said that it would be sensible for us to decide to postpone the matter .
I have received an answer from the Commission in which the Commission denies any responsibility and says it is not its job , so I would like to ask you as President-in-Office of the Council to kick the Commission up the backside and ask it to start carrying out the study , which should be ready in March 1999 .
