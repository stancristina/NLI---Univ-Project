and peace .
Madam President , Afghanistan is currently going through a time of uncertainty that will prove crucial for the future .
Yet I believe we also have a second duty towards Afghanistan , an urgent duty .
So these are a few facts about the context of this meeting in London .
Neither I nor the Presidency of the Council would find it comprehensible if Afghan women , who were the first victims of the Taliban regime and who suffered a great many deprivations , especially of their rights , while taking on huge responsibilities , were excluded from the formation of this government and its future activities .
Finally , at diplomatic level , Mr Prodi and Mr Patten , in particular , are quite ready to respond to the requests the Presidency of the European Union will no doubt be making to them in the next few days .
The Council will continue to emphasise the importance it attaches to the work that must lead to a legally binding instrument and , in particular , to maintaining the special group .
Nevertheless , it also wishes to add others that are intended to improve the Convention and to encourage the development in the longer term of an instrument that is truly binding under law , but that is the very nub of the problem .
To this end , we call on the Commission to set up , under its own control , a specialist agency , that could rapidly intervene whenever breaches of the Convention are suspected .
I am pleased that this case has now been supplemented with a proposal for a defensive mechanism .
Whilst continuing to function independently , the Cardiff process has been assessed and monitored since its launch in 1998 , with results which are now integrated into the enlarged framework of the Lisbon process .
Admittedly , as we saw at Doha , it is difficult , but interesting nonetheless , to integrate environmental policies into a much more multi-lateral context .
As I have just said , I can only refer to the competence of Member States regarding decisions taken at Community level .
The main objectives on which progress was made during 2001 include the strengthening of border checks , the harmonisation of legislation and practices concerning visas with the European Union acquis , and , lastly , the adoption of the acquis in the area of immigration in order to prevent illegal immigration .
I would like to point out that , under the Belgian Presidency , we have in fact organised , for the first time , a conference , held in Brussels some weeks ago , on the issue of migration .
As a follow-up to this debate , the Commission recently asked the Council to submit a proposal for a regulation to enhance the security of this category of visas , by including a digital photograph on these , so that we can ensure that the passport holder really is the person to whom the document was issued .
Lastly , you drew attention to the fact that the process to undertake administrative reform and strengthen inter-institutional cooperation that is underway intends to establish an inter-institutional recruitment office .
Current events confirm the need for us to work towards this .
It is also from this perspective that we requested the statistical data to be provided to Eurostat on a regular basis , in order to be able to consider the early application of the directive due to the situation , which , at the time , could not be predicted .
The Council refers you to the answer that it has already given to the same question asked at the September session of Question Time .
As laid down in the Treaty on European Union , common positions are an instrument of the EU' s common , foreign and security policy ( see Article 12 ) and the decisions concerning the common foreign and security policy are taken unanimously ( see Article 23 ) .
I can only confirm therefore the benefits of these bilateral relations and hope that they are able to be of use to the future positions of the Council .
The Euratom Safeguards Office has the specific task of verifying , by deploying inspectors if necessary , that the operators of nuclear power plants respect the security control obligations enshrined in the treaty , as well as those stipulated in Regulation No 3227/76 .
It would , however , be of secondary importance in relation to the question that is of concern to you , but it is difficult for me to respond to this question at the moment , as it will relate to both the nature of the recommendations which will be made and also to finding the best possible compromise from an economic or any other point of view .
There , then , are many more reasons than are needed for rejecting this regulation .
Then there is the fact that insurance companies have decided to raise insurance premiums for both passengers and aeroplanes in the case of accidents due to a state of war or to acts of terrorism .
Our companies are suffering from the unfair competition practised by the American airlines .
As my contribution to today ' s debate , I propose to share with you my personal analysis of the prospects that exist for this sector and the measures that should be taken .
This movement needs to cover all areas of aviation , whether safety , security , the fight against noise pollution or more general environmental protection .
The problem lies in encouraging people to be adaptable .
( Applause )
I would ask those who would seek to use this specific issue in order to criticise public enterprises to measure well the responsibilities of all those concerned .
