time responding to such accusations - it seems to me they fit the people who make them more than me , and damage their credibility .
I no longer believe it .
( Applause ) Mr President , I should first like to express my deepest and most sincere admiration for Commissioner Bonino .
And , as we have said more than once , there is also a need for a commission of inquiry to be set up to shed light on the appalling abuses perpetrated by the rebels ; and , finally , as a matter of urgency , the humanitarian aid really must reach those who need it , to try to put an end to a tragedy that is truly unworthy of humanity .
Or , more accurately , it is another demonstration of the absence of any European foreign policy , and I hope that the Council will finally take advantage of the opportunity provided by the revision of the Treaty to arm itself with a common foreign and security policy which will avoid any future repetition of Europe 's recent humiliation in the Great Lakes region of Africa .
But the basic problem is that we are wondering what this Europe , with a free hand , thinks it is doing in being absent from the scene at such an important time , when human beings - women and children - are being slaughtered and murdered , and yet we are trying to unload the responsibility onto other people .
I want to thank you for your support , but I do not think I have done any more than my duty as Commissioner responsible for Humanitarian Aid .
Also we still had humanitarian personnel on the ground .
So we were forced to keep quiet for several weeks , for fear of reprisals .
Now it would seem that aid workers losing their lives , whether they are MÃ©decins du Monde , Red Cross or human rights observers , does not present a problem .
Mr President-in-Office , there is something I should like to ask you : do n't you feel that the application of this agreement is very tricky , in view of the difficulties and even ambiguities that it contains ?
These agreements are also important because they are designed to eliminate the pirate vessels which , as you all know , are looting fish stocks from international waters .
From this point of view , then , we must be very vigilant , remembering that we cannot withdraw but that , on the other hand , an excessively liberal view , such as Mr Teverson would like to see , would not work .
I thank the rapporteur , and I also believe that the amendments that will be adopted will prove their value .
As far as the amendments are concerned , the Commission 's position is as follows : Amendments Nos 1 and 3 relate to various concerns regarding the provisions on the distribution of powers between the Community and the Member States and regarding the need for the agreement to be interpreted in accordance with the Convention of the Law of the Sea , but the Commission considers that these concerns have already been taken into account in the declarations annexed to the proposal or in the agreement itself .
With regard to the other amendments , the Commission has always believed that the fisheries agreements concluded with the ACP States are eminently commercial in nature even though , as emphasized in the subsequent report by Mr Crampton , those agreements do very often contain development aspects , which also apply to third countries , for example with regard to the signing-on of crews or the landing of catches for on-board processing .
This simply proves that we are trying to take your concern into account .
Let us face the real problem and not some stereotype .
As regards the final report , by Mr Souchet , the Commission has to say frankly that , having examined the European Parliament 's report on the modification of this fundamental system , it cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
Let me take this occasion to say that you cannot simply transfer the overcapacity to third countries .
Everybody has his own responsibility .
As far as compensation , not only to owners but to workers , is concerned , that was the proposal of the Commission but several Member States - I will not name them but you know very well which - did not accept that proposal .
If we are referring to all agreements can we just have a look to the Greenland Agreement which is ECU 50 million for no fish .
Thirdly , you have to take account of the 20 , 000 people working on this agreement when we talk about employment .
This relates to the provision of resources for which we are 50 % dependent and if we simply had to buy 50 % of the fish which is needed for our consumption , we would pay anyway .
The fisheries agreements are of commercial value .
I received no recognition from this House for the progress and changes we have made in the fisheries agreement .
It has the fish but it does not have the boats .
So more in-depth knowledge of the countries with which we have international fisheries agreements could be of some value and give us a better understanding of what is going on .
It is therefore a matter of importance that the European Parliament should give its own opinion on this sector , which is covered by the EURATOM Treaty , partly because of the consequences which this debate may have on public opinion , doing something to remedy the existing democratic shortfall .
A study on this is under way at STOA .
