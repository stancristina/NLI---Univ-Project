It would clearly be wrong to speak of European cultural integration .
The purpose of this is to make common cultural policy a reality .
In any event , let us hope that the new system leads to a more proactive contribution to culture .
Lastly , Mr President , I must refer to a most worrying point , namely the budget .
The Lisbon agenda will be no more than empty words if European cultural policy collapses without achieving its objectives on common cultural heritage and linguistic and cultural diversity within the Member States .
The first plus point of the Graça Moura report is that it distances itself from this view that cultural creations can be used for the purposes of political promotion .
It supports projects up to two years , simplifies procedures for obtaining financial support , makes a commitment to transparency in application processes and places value on heritage and linguistic diversity in the programme’s objectives .
In July , Azerbaijan began operating flights between its capital and Northern Cyprus , which is under Turkish military occupation .
I voted in favour of the Blokland recommendation for a second reading on ‘Shipments of waste’ .
In this way , Parliament is seeking to ensure that the transfer of such waste is conducted in a sound and responsible manner .
That being said , we still have a number of objections to the content of the Commission ’s proposal , and although the report seeks to alleviate the problems , it fails to provide an effective response .
These will mainly be extensions of current actions and programmes .
The Community’s measures in this area have helped to define quality indicators in education and has encouraged the spread of good practice .
The financial framework proposed by the Commission , however , is extremely limited .
The ‘Youth in Action ’ programme will be a substantially simplified successor to the current ‘Youth ’ programme .
When taken as a whole , this document , like others in the field of culture , is highly ambivalent and could produce inconsistent results .
The Culture programme is primarily aimed at promoting the transnational mobility of cultural players , the transnational circulation of artistic and cultural works and products , and intercultural dialogue .
I should therefore like to stress the importance of exchanging good practice in the area of Europe’s cultural heritage , the mobility of artists and new forms of cultural expression .
This will help to reduce the imbalance between countries with high and low production capacities and will contribute towards the increased circulation of European audiovisual works both within and outside the EU.
It is therefore of pressing importance that the broadest possible cooperation , based on common procedures and minimum harmonisation of legal standards , be introduced as soon as possible .
It should be borne in mind , however , that , in addition to legislative standards and activity , this must be reflected in practical instruments for the judicial and police authorities , which need more effective measures to pursue their activities .
As Mrs Klamt notes , in the last 25 years the number of migrants in the world has more than doubled ; there are more than 200 million of them today and they are moving in increasing numbers to the EU , rather than the previous typical emigration destinations such as the United States and Canada .
To this end , we must , firstly , open up new legal ways of entering the EU , whilst taking into account each Member State’s actual capacity and without losing sight of the Lisbon agenda and the European employment strategy ; secondly , step up the fight against illegal entry and trafficking of human beings ; thirdly , promote the effective integration of immigrants , because successful immigration is commensurate with the effectiveness of integration , as Mr Frattini noted ; and fourthly , set out a policy of safe , dignified and humane return to the country of origin in full respect of human rights .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to thank Mr Pittella for his outstanding work throughout the 2006 budgetary procedure .
Lastly , I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pitella’s efforts on behalf of the European Year of Workers ’ Mobility ; firstly in including it as a special annual event , given that it could not be envisaged as a pilot project ; and secondly given its importance and , objectively speaking , its effectiveness in meeting the aims of making the European economy competitive .     – Although Parliament’s proposal improves on the Council’s proposal in terms of volume of payments , it fails to meet the economic , social and environmental needs and challenges presented by an enlarged EU.
Environmentally-friendly technologies must be used if we are to prevent climate change and the increasing numbers of natural disasters .     .
It would appear that the technical know-how available five years ago and the progress made since have brought new data to light that will enable us to make fresh changes to the limit values .
This report concerns Community cofinancing for planned transport and energy networks , as part of the ‘Lisbon Strategy ’ objectives , or , in other words , the completion of the internal market – with priority given to the internal market’s eastward enlargement – in which privatisation and competition are encouraged in the fields of transport and energy .
I especially welcome the establishment of provisions promoting the investment required for the Lisbon goals to be achieved .
Lastly , nobody is in any doubt that this report will help us to implement measures aimed at promoting the investments required to achieve the Lisbon objectives .
International organised crime is a huge , and growing , phenomenon .
