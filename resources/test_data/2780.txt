Temporary Committee on the Echelon Interception System .
The report drew attention to a number of arrangements for protecting private individuals and enterprises in the EU.
In my view , this is a very comprehensive and commendable piece of work .
As a Member of the European Parliament , I had the pleasure of participating in one of the hearings held by the Committee .
In connection with Parliament 's reading of the report , the then Belgian Presidency 's contribution dealt with the basic principles that ought to apply to any interception system .
I should like to refer to what the then Belgian Presidency said about the matter .
In my capacity as representative of the Presidency of the Council , I want to focus on the protection of our communications .
Unlawful interception of private communications or the surveillance of companies for the purpose of distorting competition is naturally unacceptable and a serious offence , and it is therefore important for the Member States , both individually and in a European context , to be aware of the possibility of this form of surveillance and to go on working to achieve the best possible protection of people 's and companies ' communications .
This has most recently found expression in the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector .
It is the Presidency 's view that , over and above this , efforts should be made to obtain an increased use of encryption , just as there should be a focus upon IT security , both in the EU institutions and in the nation states .
IT security is a top priority in the common European action plan , 'eEurope 2005' , which covers , for example , the development of secure communications used for the secure exchange of qualified public information within the Community .
Finally , the action plan also includes the establishment of a Cyber Security Task Force which , in cooperation with the Member States and the private sector , is to operate as a catalyst for initiatives in the security area .
Allow me to note in conclusion that the Presidency would also like to work towards a Council resolution 's being adopted , aimed at establishing a common strategy for network and information security with a view to establishing a common European security culture .
Finally , the proposal calls upon the Member States to encourage partnership between the university world and companies , with a view to bringing about secure technology and maintenance .
Madam President , intelligence work is important if the open society is to be defended .
I am , however , obliged to say , ladies and gentlemen , that , as things are at the moment , this is a national concern , and the cooperation that takes place between the countries ' respective services is therefore an intergovernmental concern and not a matter for the Council .
I neither wish nor am able , therefore , to enter into a more detailed discussion of the individual requests in Parliament 's decision from last year .
Like the Belgian Presidency , I am obliged to bear in mind the fact that I am a representative of the Presidency of the Council , and I must focus my contribution and what I say upon those states of affairs that affect the Council or the EU institutions .
The Council is able , and would like , to help strengthen cooperation on the protection of our communications .
I have naturally listened with great interest to the debate , just as I listened when , as a Member of this Parliament , I attended a hearing on Echelon , chaired by Mr Gerhard Schmid .
Now , I am a Member of , and spokesman for , the Council , and I am obliged to stick to what , for the time being , is the Council 's , and therefore my own , role .
It is something I naturally take on board , but I am not in a position in which I can tell my esteemed colleagues that , yes , we shall do this or that .
Apart from these two documents , the Council has not tabled formal proposals for changing the current rules governing the various common organisations of the market or , therefore , those governing the common organisation of the market in dairy products .
The Council has taken note of the various reports accompanying the Commission 's communication on the Mid-term Review and , as recently as this month , held a thorough debate on , for example , dairy products .
That debate took , as its starting point , a number of questions put to the Presidency and was aimed at clarifying the key issues .
That is why it is the Commission that must come up with a proposal .
The fact that Mr Nogueira has raised the matter today may therefore , in fact , have been very useful .
Mr President , this is a matter I remember very clearly , for it was first raised at the same time that Denmark took up the Presidency .
There was no doubt about the current status of the island , which had been agreed .
When Morocco infringed this understanding and this status , the Danish Presidency issued a statement expressing its concern about the situation , as well as solidarity with Spain .
The Council was delighted at the fact that the new Spanish Foreign Minister , Mrs Palacio , who had just come to the Council from Parliament , had met her Moroccan opposite number in Rabat immediately after the episode and that they had confirmed the desire to return to the earlier status quo .
