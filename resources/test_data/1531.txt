Mr President , first of all , I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report , Mrs Stenzel , very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us .
I would , therefore , ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups .
I would just like to underline this - the situation is , of course , a little precarious - Parliament has , for the sake of convenience and safety , placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being , so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed .
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace , democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe , no less ?
The document mentions common values on different occasions .
Areas such as security , the World Trade Conference , food safety , but also the new economy , require more action , therefore , from the European Commission .
And where implementation is concerned , the Commission needs to ensure that our political wishes are also implemented in practice .
It raises expectations , but it can also lead to disappointment .
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners , rather than competitors when it comes to policy .
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President , Mr Kinnock , on behalf of the Commission .
This gives the citizen a sense of recognition , here in Europe and elsewhere .
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as long as nearly thirty years ago , the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy .
This is unusual , but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes .
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission ' s list : mercury and tributyl , abbreviated to TBT.
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea , the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value , to wit , ten and one thousand times , respectively .
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework .
I would first of all like to focus on quality .
In 1953 , we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology .
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability .
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision .
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up .
It should , therefore , not surprise us that water is the cause of wars .
By then , my children will be older than I am now .
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware .
I have two questions .
However , I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO , among others , are often of inferior quality .
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time .
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible .
Once again , the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned .
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years , as this would be necessary to protect public health .
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm , the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions .
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period .
But in that case , not only Sweden , but all EU countries , should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol .
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which , I believe , Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him : I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant , and perhaps Mr Posselt , Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit .
The Commission ' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence .
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue .
There are , however , one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific .
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like my fellow MEP , Bartho Pronk , please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and , in particular , to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report .
Needless to say , it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level .
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support .
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found .
All in all , both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole .
Cross-border workers , employees on secondment and migrating employees
