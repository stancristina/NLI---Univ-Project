example , the institution of voluntary fire brigades is taken for granted .
We all share a common commitment to the MEDIA programme and its twin aims of strengthening the European film industry and creating sustainable jobs through the audiovisual growth engine .
The first is linkage with other EU programmes , and the second is scope to inject venture capital into the private market ; this is done as a matter of course in the United States , and we appeal to the Council and the Commission to work with us to ensure that it finally becomes reality in Europe too .
What is on offer here is therefore insufficient .
A film will not normally start to yield a return on the initial investment until a million cinemagoers have paid to watch it .
That is why , back in 1995 , the Green Paper on strategy options to strengthen the European programme industry in the context of the audiovisual policy of the European Union proposed the establishment of a European guarantee fund , which the Council stubbornly rejected - the German Government , sad to say , being the foremost opponent of the scheme - without offering an alternative solution .
Finally , I should like to mention that many of the roots of our European culture lie in Central and Eastern Europe .
In recent days we have heard that Mrs Sanders has been trying to make the first reading suffice .
Comparison creates competition , and competition promotes individuality among schools and hence a variety of models for guidance .
And I am quite happy to support it .
The citizens have a basic right to an open and responsible administration geared to providing services , since after all it is paid for out of their taxes .
Of course we have to distinguish between possibly having several or many service providers in the operational field , but the regulatory function must remain with , or more to the point go to the European Union .
No matter whether the regulatory and control bodies are separated or not , whether you liberalise or privatise , so long as there is no political will to accept that European airspace issues can only be approached on a pan-European basis , another ten reports will not help either !
Safety standards must on no account be endangered .
The question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified .
That would be something else !
The Commission merely has a few reservations about the legal wording and the order of the compromise amendments in the text .
Let me also say that our group is disappointed , not just I personally but the entire group .
No rapporteur for a discharge procedure , in which the groups are involved , can have this discharge taken from him by an agreement between group chairmen , whether or not such an agreement exists .
Yet I would point out , on behalf of the Commission , that it is possible even now to indicate the date of the minced meat production under the simplified , voluntary procedure .
But the Commissioner for budgets does not have the right to refuse to tell us how many millions the Commission has paid to this firm over the past years .
We were against ; the majority of the House - had they known of it - the rapporteurs - Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez and Mr Arvidsson and others - would no doubt also have been against it .
In fact , in 1988 Parliament directly indebted itself to a banking consortium headed by WestLB , for amounts of ECU 472 million and BEF 7 billion , without first publishing an invitation to tender for the contract in the Official Journal .
So it is too early , at this point in time , to contemplate further measures or sanctions .
But that also implies an obligation to act more responsibly than before and , for instance , to apply the concept of "one China - many systems " .
With regard to cooperation , the European Union takes the view that it is in the interest of the Tibetan people that we support aid projects in Tibet , provided the group of ethnic Tibetans benefits directly from them and is given priority in the management of the projects .
On the question of human rights let me therefore sum up by saying that the Commission ' s foreign policy remains , as ever , directed at helping to prevent conflicts , prevent infringements of human rights and promote democracy and human rights .
The Commission welcomes the importance Parliament attaches to combating football hooliganism , as reflected in the various motions for resolution .
Secondly , let me point out that in the case of the disaster in Venezuela , it is still worth considering cause and effect as well as responsibility .
After all , we cannot print it ourselves , as you know .
It is a fact - and I noted that in my first statement today ; the ladies and gentlemen who talk so big were not even there on Monday - that things have , thank God , improved because Dr Winkler , the head of the Centre , has endeavoured , as has the new Austrian Government representative , to straighten it all out .
Who has actually seen Mr Pelinka ' s letter of resignation ?
Moreover , the Commission cannot express any views on the reasons that led Professor Pelinka to resign from the Monitoring Centre ' s Management Board .
For the rest , we support this resolution because we helped draft it .
Meanwhile we have the activity of the round tables .
Mr President , the Commission has received some 40 different comments on its discussion paper entitled " The Commission and Non-Governmental Organisations
