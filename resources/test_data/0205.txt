policy is one of the most pressing problems we have in the EU and , even if Commissioner Fischler looks a little tired , the proposal for a new fisheries reform deserves high praise .
We need the multiannual management plans proposed by the Commissioner , based upon scientific advice and to be applied to all the stocks .
The collapse of cod stocks in the North Sea , Irish Sea and Skagerrak is , in reality , a judgment upon fisheries policy so far .
It is the lack of political responsibility and monitoring on the part of the governments that is now giving rise to a range of serious social , environmental and economic consequences in the region concerned .
We must not , however , use the subsidies for renewing and converting the fishing fleet .
Moreover , we need to establish much more efficient common supervision of fisheries .
On that point , the Commissioner should know that aid will be required .
I think that they are both on the wrong track .
I am delighted , moreover , that the Commission has consistently placed the issue high on its agenda .
It is an area which has been fully explained in terms of science .
We also know that damage to hearing can lead to a reduction in people 's capacity to work or to their possibly not being able to obtain jobs in the labour market ever again .
I am therefore extremely pleased at our being able , tomorrow , to adopt a directive that gives workers better protection than that which they have at present .
It is , then , a better directive with which we are concerned here , first of all because we are now at long last obtaining a proper upper limit on the noise to which workers may be exposed .
I should like to have seen a lower limit , which is something I also proposed .
The other very positive factor is that the directive systematically attaches importance to the prevention made so much of in the framework directive .
There are , however , a number of other provisions that are to be avoided .
We must examine the work tools used in enterprises .
The directive provides protection and , in addition , it naturally makes clear the responsibility of employers in individual work situations .
This is a much discussed subject .
It is not that I wish to provoke anyone with whom we have been debating this matter , but I should very much like to repeat that noise is , and remains , purely and simply noise .
Irrespective of whether it sounds pleasant or unpleasant , noise can cause very serious damage to hearing .
We have only to look to our own experience .
It is , in point of fact , people who have lived with pleasant noise or who have been affected by very pleasant noise , namely music .
I am pleased that the directive recognises this so clearly .
It has therefore extended the deadline for implementing the directive .
We have established a transitional period , but this is also to be used for preparing standards governing the behaviour of the whole of the music and entertainment sectors .
It is also worth pointing out that those standards of behaviour , or ideas for standards of behaviour , arose in the course of the actual work done by the trialogue , and this is therefore a good example of the way in which cooperation through the trialogue can lead to constructive and positive results .
Good ideas emerge too , which can lead to constructive compromises , and that is something many of us are pleased about .
In that connection , gratitude must also of course be expressed to the Commission for the role it has played and to the Council for its constructive cooperation .
Finally , I just want to say how pleased I am that we have achieved such a broad compromise and such considerable support here in the Chamber .
That is a view I hope the ELDR Group will comply with tomorrow .
I think we were right to highlight the Member States 's poor implementation of the 1986 directive .
I can fully support the Commission 's being obliged , by no later than next year , to table a proposal regarding the way in which animal experiments are to be regulated in future .
I think it important that animal experiments should also cover the use of animals for educational purposes , and we must look at the conditions under which transgenic and genetically modified animals are used in experiments .
I also believe it is very important for us to obtain a central database for approved animal experiments , both current and completed and both successful and manifestly unsuccessful .
I think it important that we obtain a combined database of this kind so that we avoid repeating experiments that have already been carried out .
Finally , I want to support Mrs Evans 's idea of obtaining better supervision of the circumstances in which animals are kept , possibly through a common EU inspectorate that can help ensure that the rules are observed .
On the other hand , we are unable to support Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
The European Parliament and the EU 's prime ministers are also agitating to be given more power .
The prime ministers scarcely wish to relinquish foreign and security policy , so they will choose someone from the European Council to represent the EU to the outside world .
Instead of concerning itself with foreign and security policy , the Commission would be given power over the developed cooperation on juridico-political and police matters for which , of course , Mr Aznar has a special predilection .
Yes , but to whom ?
