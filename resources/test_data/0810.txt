conflicting interests .
In particular , we believe it is right that the directive and regulation line up to provide as seamless as possible a regime for the protection of industrial design across the Union as a whole .
I would also like to record our support for Mrs Grossetête 's report and to emphasise that in our view it is of supreme importance that EU law is implemented consistently , properly and in a timely manner .
Madam President , on a point of order , I have here a report which appeared in the British newspaper The Independent concerning a meeting which appears to have taken place between yourself and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II .
According to this report , you left the meeting and then briefed the press on Her Majesty 's political opinions .
This has caused a certain amount of concern and distress in political circles in the UK, because as , I am sure you know , the protocol of such meetings is that they are private and should not be commented on .
I would like to give you this opportunity to let us know what you understood the protocol of that meeting to be , and perhaps also to clarify what you said to the press afterwards .
Madam President , I did not see the incident with regard to the handicapped or disabled people going into the stadium yesterday , or the supposed fracas with the Italian journalists .
However , I was in Rotterdam all day yesterday , from early morning until late last night and I was at the final .
I pass on my praise to the French , Italian , Dutch and many other fans who travelled from all over Europe to watch that final .
I also pass on my praise to the Dutch police for the way they conducted themselves , and to the people of Rotterdam .
It was an excellent day out in Rotterdam .
It was one of the best football matches I have ever attended .
The atmosphere was anything but hostile .
It was one of the best atmospheres I have experienced at a cup final .
On the point that Mr Helmer raised , can he join with me in congratulating Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on supporting the euro ?
Madam President , it is clearly true that there have been developments this weekend but it is too soon to tell what they will amount to .
There is considerable doubt as to whether these developments will result in the restoration of full constitutional government in Fiji , so this issue still remains highly important and of topical interest .
The Indo-Fijians , the Indian population of Fiji , are in considerable danger .
There has been lawlessness , damage to property , and cases of assault and rape without any intervention by the security forces in recent weeks .
I have had representations to the effect that people are looking to the European Union for some kind of effective action , possibly - and this could be debated in the context of the resolution - some kind of sanctions under the Lomé Convention .
I do not want to debate the content now but I do want to ask that this be maintained on the agenda , because after what has happened over the weekend , there is still a risk of considerable discrimination against one ethnic group in Fiji .
There is no confidence that the constitution will be applied properly and will be observed .
I do not agree that what has happened reduces the topical importance of the issue .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
I now come to another request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists , this time to remove the following item , " Tibet " .
Madam President , Tibet is an issue which is on our agenda year after year after year , and to that extent I understand the point that the honourable Member has made .
We have adopted resolutions on this subject time and time again .
It is a country that is illegally occupied by China and its people are oppressed by that regime .
It is an urgent issue because in recent months we have seen various measures being taken by the Chinese government to move people into the area of Tibet and to exploit the natural resources there .
These measures were initially supported by the World Bank , Germany , the United States and the United Kingdom .
Now that the pressure has been put on , Germany and the United States have withdrawn their support .
The World Bank is withdrawing support but it has not yet said so publicly .
It is urgent that we put pressure on them to withdraw support for these measures so that this Parliament can stand up for the people of Tibet , stand up for democracy , stand up for the stopping of what is an illegal act in international law .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
Still on the subject of topical and urgent debate , regarding the " Human rights " section , I have received three requests to replace the sub-item on " Hooliganism " : a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to replace this item with a new sub-item entitled " Outbreaks of racism in Germany and the killing of Alberto Adriano " , a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to replace this sub-item by one entitled " Incidents at the Rotterdam football stadium " , and a request from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party to replace this sub-item by one entitled " Desecration of Prague ' s oldest Jewish cemetery " .
We shall examine each of these requests in turn
