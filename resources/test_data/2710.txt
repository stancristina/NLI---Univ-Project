for the Minutes .
A large part of the funds allocated are either spent too late or not at all .
I believe this is a very regrettable situation .
I can foresee this development and understand that there is a certain logic in it , but that is specifically why I want extra investments and extra attention to be paid to those countries which may well be joining in the second round .
Finally - and I believe this is the last important point - when we look at the future and the investment of European Union resources in the candidate Member States , which is very important in enabling these countries to earn more , much greater attention must be paid to cofinancing , also within the PHARE programme , so that the countries themselves are also encouraged to commit resources to joint projects .
The money is there , but not enough is being spent .
This would be a genuine bottom-up approach .
I therefore hope that the Commission - although Mr Van den Broek is not here to represent it - will take note of all the criticisms it contains .
The Commission must make its procedures simpler and more transparent .
Through support for democratization PHARE will also promote the integration of these religious minorities .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Kok and his colleagues most warmly on the excellent work they have done .
There has been a real breakthrough in the protection of human rights , with the establishment of equal treatment for men and women , the fight against social exclusion and a ban on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , for example .
However , it has again proved impossible to integrate the WEU into the European Union or to expand our trade policy further .
The Council will be required to approve the statute unanimously , so we shall see then whether it intends to give Parliament the means to do its job in a credible way .
Despite the very laudable results which this presidency has achieved , we cannot ignore the fact that there is one crucial question that remains to be answered .
( Applause ) Mr President , the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communism marked a turningpoint in the history of Europe and the start of a new phase of development for the European Union .
Ireland and the Netherlands have shown that reducing government deficits and increasing employment can go hand in hand : Germany , France and Italy ought to follow their example .
Such a Union is neither convincing nor inspiring .
Those should now be our objectives .
As well as EMU, we also need a political union to counterbalance the one-sided monetarist approach that has led millions of Europeans to associate the euro , even before it is introduced , with social disintegration and job losses .
If only we could begin to take ourselves seriously , starting with what we said yesterday , which we are already beginning to retract .
Mr President , the Dutch presidency has managed under very difficult circumstances to conclude the IGC negotiations at the Amsterdam summit , for which it is to be congratulated .
That is why we need to have fundamental talks on the current form and substance of the Union and on the role of the European Parliament .
Can they feel democratically represented by a Parliament which could grow to have 700 Members with 24 nationalities and a large number of languages , and where national political diversity will scarcely be reflected ?
You may have seen that an enormous complex is under construction to secure our seat here in Brussels , even after enlargement , so it is with mixed feelings that we view the Council 's decision that we should meet twelve times a year in Strasbourg .
Why does the Council feel it necessary to take a decision on this for us ?
But a European law on open government could be very salutary for Brussels bureaucracy , and some of the army of lobbyists here in Brussels could work to much better effect if they did not have to charge a great deal of money to obtain information for people which they should now obtain for themselves .
The main problem lies with internal security , foreign policy and immigration and refugee policy , where little progress has been made , and yet they are all extremely important to our citizens .
However , I would recommend that the areas of internal security , foreign policy , asylum and refugee policy , vote weighting and decision-making should all be reviewed over the next three to four years , to ensure that all the groundwork is done before accession .
Those of us who have read the various non-papers and treaty texts produced over the last six months have watched the IGC teetering on the brink of yawning democratic abysses , and if we have not fallen in , then ironically enough it is not because the Heads of Government realize that European integration needs to be more democratic , but because of their belief in the fiction of national sovereignty .
The national parliaments are no longer to deal with these issues , and the European Parliament merely has the power to make recommendations .
The same is true of the very necessary changes in cooperation on justice and home affairs , where important decisions have been postponed .
Madam President , after two years of discussions , Parliament produced an ambitious list of desiderata which have by no means been satisfied .
The President-in-Office announced a package of measures , but unfortunately what he himself does in practice is exactly the opposite .
