innovations .
As rapporteur , I believe the basic principle here is that merely sufficient demand will give rise to innovation and create a sustainable market .
The basic principle should be that environmental costs are fully included in the price of the product .
It can be applied through eco-taxes , for example , or with other charges .
Europe needs to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
The entire European Union budget is approximately 1 % of the Gross Domestic Product of the Member States .
This imposes restrictions on direct financing by the EU.
This should be visible as a clear area of emphasis in the Framework Programme for Research and the EU’s future Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation .
Many Member States have good systems .
The goal of the Lisbon Strategy of sustainable growth , improved competitiveness and quality jobs linked to high standards of environmental protection is attainable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it would seem that there is literally a dirty war being waged against the health of the public and the environment , as the Commission has postponed its proposal for a thematic strategy on air quality .
This delay goes against what we jointly agreed when we drew up the Sixth Environmental Action Programme .
Air pollution causes illness and kills .
It will tend to weaken the people’s confidence in the EU even further .
If they and the President of the European Commission , Mr Barroso , believe environmental protection weakens competitiveness , I would ask them to show us the proof .
Studies of what the environmental protection reforms implemented thus far have cost show that they have all been cheaper than expected .
The costs have been four times , and even ten times less than the estimates made beforehand .
Merely in terms of medical expenses it costs between 200 and 600 billion euros per annum .
We would like to know when the thematic strategies are to be proposed .
We have become so dependent on electricity now that we even switch on lights during daylight , such as now .
That is why the Member States and the Union should stress the importance of the security of supply , even though we still have no viable internal electricity market .
This is just what is being emphasised in this proposal .
This way the internal market can be developed for the benefit of the consumer .
We have to ensure that the same is also true of cross-border networks .
Member States should ensure that competition is opened up and that existing legislation is implemented .
I would like to remind you all that the Barcelona European Council asked for an assessment at the European Council next spring of the extent to which the internal market for energy has been implemented , and thus the extent to which this proposal has been made part of national legislation .
Of course , we also need investment in infrastructure and interconnections .
Ecologically speaking , the primary focus should obviously be on energy efficiency and the latest environmental technology .
We are left with just one task , which is to secure the reliability of this , our common resolve .     .
It is the rapporteur’s opinion that the Commission has been too preoccupied with market mechanisms , instead of which it should have proposed some concrete action .
Electric power passes freely between the Nordic countries : Finland , Sweden , Norway and Denmark .
Its price in the Nordic network is determined in their common electricity exchanges .
This market mechanism is very unfavourable for consumers .
For consumers a price mechanism of this nature is totally unsatisfactory .
We need government measures to safeguard different areas of investment .     .
The Commission and the Council have taken no account whatsoever of the amendments to the proposal for a directive that a majority in Parliament tabled at first reading .
The most glaring example of this can be found on the Commission ’s Scadplus website .
Parliament was therefore bypassed with a shrug of the shoulders .
It is most important to prevent the granting of what are purely software and business designs in Europe .
On the other hand , the majority of present-day technological products make use of software and patents granted for a technological product should not be rejected simply because the software forms a component of it .
The directive should support European innovative research and product development in the software sector .
This means that unnecessary barriers to open source software development should not be erected , nevertheless taking into account the fact that patents are crucially important to many European companies .
Businesses should carry out software development where the best environment for innovation is available , regardless of the extent of patent protection in a geographical region .
For that reason , I am in favour of the directive becoming law .
I think it is likely that the amendments that Parliament adopts tomorrow will lead us to conciliation .
You all saw the demonstrators outside today .
Some of them were a little aggressive .
This has been an ongoing story .
Secondly , our position is totally rejected in the Council .
I am afraid this piece of legislation is going to be rejected tomorrow , as Mr Wuermeling said .
This would not have been such a bad thing after all , had we worked it through .
It would not have prevented the Open Source from going on .
To Goliath , or the bigger companies , I say ‘get your act together’ .
The question then is what does this mean institutionally ?
You should take it seriously .
Just yesterday on the train to Strasbourg petitions were being pushed into the hands of travellers , and there has been an excessive volume of emails on this subject
