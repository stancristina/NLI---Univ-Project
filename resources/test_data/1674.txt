He and his accomplices know what I am talking about .
Because without the cooperation of the consumer , this Directive will not be complied with in any country .
Our proposal - in Amendment No 45 - is a minimum of 25 % for all materials , along the same lines as the Directive in force , although we know that for the plastics sector 25 % will be a very difficult target to reach .
On the other hand , I do support differentiated targets and time limits for certain Member States such as Ireland , Greece and Portugal , for whom it is very difficult to keep up with the proposed pace .
We in the European Union must therefore implement rules which set minimums which everybody can achieve and which can be raised for anybody who is in a position to meet them .
I believe that in the end it may be necessary to deal with the strictest aspects of these two issues , in order to be able to achieve a possible conciliation with a high level in the Directive .
On the one hand , Mr Deva has defended this own-initiative report which he has worked on for a long time with great dedication and taking up many interesting contributions .
The problem of poverty throughout the world - including Europe - is not economic ; it is a political problem , which requires political and global solutions .
We only need think about Mercosur or the Andean Pact .
Also , and above all , in the developing countries .
As a consequence of all of this , wills have been united and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of this report with an extremely broad consensus , and it today comes before the plenary without a single amendment .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Stevenson , the European Commission rejected the proposal by the Spanish Presidency of the Council to adopt actions to promote protein crops of which there is a shortfall in the European Union , and which are being replaced with soya imports , mainly from the United States and often genetically modified .
As some of my fellow Members have said , it has increased by 23 % .
Lastly , a comment : Mr Commissioner , if we do not maintain our production and supply capacity , what will become of our ability to negotiate and defend our interests in international forums ?
Turning now to the actual reports , I am firstly going to mention those by the rapporteurs , Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte , which recognise the strategic importance and maturity of the initiative on the Single Sky .
It is not therefore necessary to specify in the Regulation the methods for technical assistance for this organisation , since we are going to be part of it .
I would also like to add the following considerations on certain amendments in the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte .
The rapporteur , Mrs Maes , whom I would like to thank , has agreed to this new proposal and the Commission is satisfied with the report adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
Once again , I would like to thank the competent committee in general for its work and the rapporteurs , Mr Fava , Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mrs Maes , in particular , because they have done some very commendable work on issues which are very technical and complex .
I therefore urge the Vice-President , with the support of this Parliament - because she knows that we support her - to take on , following the approval of the reports we are currently debating , the difficult task of trying to convince the Council to come to an agreement quickly .
I do not want to indulge in demagoguery or take advantage of tragedies , but I would like to say one thing to you : in the case of the terrible accident that took place this summer , the German air traffic controllers realised what was going to happen , but they were not on the network , nor were they integrated with the Swiss air traffic controllers , and they had to resort to a telephone to call Swiss air traffic control and could not connect .
Eurocontrol .
Privatisation .
What we are not going to do is change the Treaty by means of a Directive .
I would therefore like Members to be aware that all of this will be carefully safeguarded and that , furthermore , the Council 's report provides a basis for clearly resolving this problem .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Blokland , once again for the magnificent report he is presenting us with today .
I would like to thank Parliament for its support on this issue and at the end of the debate I will comment in more detail on some of the amendments , I will say in advance once again they we will accept the majority of them .
While we are saying that these amendments would increase the differences and therefore reduce the harmonising effect sought by the Commission 's proposal , I must say that nevertheless , we must reject Amendment No 9 , which establishes a minimum noise charge , because airports without noise problems should not in principle be obliged to impose noise charges .
Mr President , I will be brief .
While repeating to the Commission that we need that information for the purposes of the mid-term reform of Agenda 2000 , I would like the Commission to answer a simple question : on what date will the database in question begin to operate , and when will the indicative figures be presented ?
This demonstrates that there is a common spirit amongst us .
