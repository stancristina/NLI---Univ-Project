We are also pretending to believe that democracy can be built by force on a site littered with mines and bombs .
Secondly , I welcome the decision of the Council and the Commission to also view the North Korean problem from a humanitarian perspective .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , knowing how important and irreplaceable this 59th session of the Commission on Human Rights is , we must not allow its work , its functions and its presidency to be weakened .
That is the important thing about the United Nations report .
We should not delude ourselves any longer .
It is a veritable holocaust .
It goes against the fundamental right to food , which gives all human beings the freedom to choose what they eat .

Firstly , the agricultural development programmes that it is financing in the developing countries will all have to include a section that provides aid for the marketing of food products .
