left in the lurch .
And that is not what the Convention on Refugees is about .
In Denmark alone , the level of aid is EUR 2 billion per year so that the present little fund is of absolutely no effect .
And all in order to disguise the products ' natural characteristics .
Nowadays , we use several thousands of additives and , where the majority of these are concerned , the fact is that we are not even aware of their consequences for health .
To top it all , we are in fact aware that a large number of them are harmful , and yet we still allow them to be used .
I think that Community policy in relation to the use of additives has developed in a quite irresponsible way .
I think a splendid piece of work has been carried out .
Instead , I think the Commission needs seriously to rationalise the number of additives .
I should like to point out a further problem .
In my opinion , the quantities of these compounds that are permitted are way too excessive .
Nitrosamine is a carcinogenic substance which is derived from , and produced by , nitrates and nitrites .
I think that the quantity of nitrates and nitrites added to meat products ought to be considerably reduced and that there should be compulsory monitoring of the quantity of nitrosamine which , as I said , is of course a powerfully carcinogenic substance , the presence of which in our foodstuffs is not presently measured at all .
I hope that Commissioner Byrne , who has assumed responsibility for this area , will examine the question of added amounts of nitrates and nitrites .
I think we have a serious problem in this regard and I hope he will confirm that this will be done .
As is well known , there are three prior conditions which must be fulfilled if additives are to be included on the positive list .
Paul Lannoye rightly points out that none of the prerequisites are present in the case of sodium alginate .
On the contrary , it directly misleads the consumer by making sliced carrots look fresh , even if they are not .
It is , on principle , very alarming that the Commission should be able to extend the list of additives just because the substances are permitted in parts of the EU.
It is ironic to be having to deal with this proposal such a short time after the publication of the Commission ' s White Paper on Foodstuffs .
In the white paper , the Commission itself attaches importance to limiting the consumption of additives in order - as the Commission puts it - to thereby avoid negative effects on health .
The Commission also states that it wishes to guide consumers as best it can so that they themselves can make a choice .
I seem to remember that the original intention in drafting a positive list was partly that it should be possible to decide to remove additives from the list .
Let us , therefore , have the list shortened as soon as possible rather than extended .
The answer was unfortunately 'no ' and , in common with Mr Lund , I should like to see that 'no ' justified here today .
Postponement of the granting of discharge is in itself the result of a quite incredible situation .
These extraordinary results from a seedy administrative culture go back to 1998 and are not this Commission ' s direct responsibility , but it is the present Commission ' s responsibility to show that the misconduct , fraud and betrayal of mandates which have taken place really do belong to the past .
We have heard excuses , often in a dismissive tone , from the Commission , as if it were the Commission which was to be giving us discharge , rather than the other way round .
We have seen an express reluctance to hold those officials to account who are responsible for the circumstances open to criticism .
It is not that there are no rules .
As Mr Kuhne rightly pointed out , it is important that we should also direct criticism against Parliament ' s own economic administration .
The impression cannot be avoided of systematic nepotism of precisely the kind which the competitive tendering procedure should prevent .
If there are no dramatic improvements in the financial administration , European taxpayers will know how to react against this irresponsible misuse of their money .
I should like to emphasise that there is broad agreement within the Committee on Budgetary Control about postponing the discharge for the most important accounts , and I would thank the rapporteurs for the splendid and painstaking work they have carried out .
Mrs Theato should know that we value her desire to call a spade a spade .
Mr President , the Committee on Budgetary Control is doing sterling work under Mrs Theato ' s , Mrs Van der Laan' s , Mr BÃ¶sch ' s and Mr Blak ' s expert leadership .
I should also like to complement Mrs Stauner on a good report .
My group will not grant discharge in connection with an account which conceals more than it reveals and has been submitted by a Commission which despises openness , subsidiarity and democracy .
Are our rapporteurs now getting complete information and full answers in response to their questions ?
Have administrative procedures been instigated against those who had their hands in the till or covered up for those who had their hands in the till ?
Has Mr Paul van Buitenen been rewarded for his courageous efforts to turn the Commission into a responsible organisation ?
He has moved to Luxembourg and has had to agree to keep quiet
