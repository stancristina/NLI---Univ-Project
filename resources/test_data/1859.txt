Community resources the principle of dealing at national level with the consequences of policies decided at Community level and we are against calling on the peoples to foot the bill twice .
With enlargement , due to the purely statistical approach , numerous areas in the existing Member States risk being excluded from funding .
At the same time , while there is a great deal of talk about supporting remote areas , the ΕU continues without justification – and despite our repeated proposals – to exempt the Aegean islands from special treatment for remote areas , despite the very serious problems they face .
At a time when the aggression of the USA has exceeded all precedents , the resolution comes to silence all those , including in Greece , who insist on seeing the ΕU as a worthy opponent of the USA and ΝΑΤΟ , stressing that 'ΝΑΤΟ remains a fundamental guarantee of transatlantic stability and security ' and that the ESDP will be developed 'to complement ΝΑΤΟ' and will be its 'substantial reinforcement ' .
Human rights are trampled over on a daily basis , while poverty and misery in both the third world and the developed countries grow worse .
For these reasons , we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece did not vote for the report .
We expect the Commission , in view of the report on Turkey to be issued towards the end of the year , to multiply its efforts to bring about the release of Leyla Zana and a general amnesty for prisoners being detained for 'crimes ' of opinion .     . – Mr President , as you know , following the fall of the Berlin wall , the area of south-east Europe was shaken by ethnic quarrels and armed violence , resulting in deep political , economic and social changes .
The report focuses mainly on the following sectors : education and economic activity , participation in democratic institutions , violence against women and sexual exploitation , health and reproductive rights and trafficking in women and children .
Armed conflicts , the perceptions of the regimes , traditional social prejudices , outdated practices and attitudes and ethnic quarrels have marginalised women .
Demographic trends today demonstrate that family life is no longer a primary life objective for women , who are more interested in their economic independence and professional achievement and are therefore investing more time and energy in education .
In the sectors in which women are mainly employed , pay is generally low and there are few prospects .
However , I must point out that , in comparison with other regions of Europe , such as central Europe , the Balkan countries have the highest level of exclusion of women from political decision-making positions .
Nonetheless , in the entire area , there is a lack of serious and systematic statistics on the problem , a lack of adequate legislative regulation , monitoring and guidance and a lack of economic and psychological support for victims .
The industry in question has political support and economic resources in the countries of origin , transit and destination , in the form of corrupt officers , and I should like to quote as a typical example the scandal of sexual slavery in Montenegro .
A woman from Moldavia , the victim of trafficking , recognised key political figures as clients and/or as those involved in the white slave trade .
Europe cannot be secure and at peace while violence , ethnic hatred and violations of fundamental rights are a daily occurrence within its borders .
That is why I wish to welcome the initiative by Mrs Karamanou in drafting a report on the rights of women in the Balkans .
Finally , I wish to say that , in the face of this challenge , we are responsible on both sides .
I should like to take this opportunity to point out that my country , which remained outside this Treaty several years ago , also recently agreed with and ratified the Treaty under the then Minister for Foreign Affairs , Georgos Papandreou , and has applied it in connection with its border with Turkey where , for reasons which we all understand , there was a cold front of confrontation .
Of course , in Asia , Africa and Latin America , where hundreds of millions of mines undermine health and economic development every day , the issue is even bigger .
However , our greatest contribution has been in implementing these programmes in a great many countries of the world ; in Afghanistan , in Iraq , in the Balkans , in dozens of countries in which both non-governmental and governmental organisations are involved in removing anti-personnel mines .
However loud you attack socialist Cuba , my dear fellow Members , you cannot deny the fact that Cuba is the only free country on the American continent , the only country where the people take authority into their own hands .
I can accept any political argument in response to the political arguments which I put forward .
We also call on the International Olympic Committee to demand that contracts concluded with sponsors and commercial companies include compliance with internationally recognised employment standards and fundamental rights .
It would appear , Commissioner , that the Nigerian Government either does not have the power or the political will to impose the 1999 Constitution and the laws on the country .
I was a member of the drafting Convention and I know that this Constitution is the fruit of agreement between the representatives of states , parliaments and civil society .
Those who oppose approval of the Constitution are , I think , doing the European question a disservice because , in seeking something better , they are undermining something good
