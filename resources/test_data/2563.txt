Now the tender little shoots of peace have started to grow , and Europe is looking to us again .
Perhaps you accept only six of these proposals , but then at least allow us to talk about these six , or five , or ten , or however many you like .
You have read out to us some very fine-sounding statements , containing demands that human rights should finally be respected .
We really ought to take preventive measures , because otherwise violence will flare up again there , and will spread like wildfire .
Our unanimity within the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment certainly sends a positive signal to workers , and also to the Commission and the Council .
Criminal elements appear again and again , there are constant attempts by dubious business people to procure plutonium , uranium or some other nuclear material and to sell it to whoever is interested in order to make themselves money .
I only wonder what would induce a country that is setting up an illegal nuclear weapons programme to instruct a bunch of criminals to procure plutonium in the Central and Eastern European countries or the CIS states and then actually to smuggle it through a country like the Federal German Republic which has high-level technical precautions at the airports , the ports and the borders , where there are authorities , where there are institutions that have the necessary technical equipment for checking whether someone has radioactive material , when at the same time a human life is only worth a few paltry dollars at the border between Afghanistan and Russia .
Since 1991 the police has seized radioactive material in 34 cases and then handed it over to the Institute for Transuranium for analysis .
Plutonium is an extremely dangerous material and I cannot understand why a government that did not inform Euratom about this incident at the right time , although it should have done so , and then actually asserts it had informed Euratom , should not be asked by the Commission : ' What did you do about it ?
The United Nations is assuming that Russia and many former CIS states are not in a position legally or in terms of staffing to combat the spread of this crime .
So Euratom Safeguards must at last be put in a staffing and financial position that enables it finally to carry out proper controls .
That is of course totally unworldly and does not take account of the fact that in the view of most of the countries in the world , without nuclear energy it is simply not possible to satisfy the energy requirements of a world that is growing by 260 000 inhabitants a day .
Nor do we understand why the report postulates the abolition of nuclear energy while at the same time emphasizing the usefulness of plutonium for peaceful purposes in the European Union .
By its attitude the Council is showing that it does not want these improvements in terms of content either , which is why it is hiding behind the arguments of the compromise package .
That would legitimize cheating and be a threat to democracy .
Let me remind you , for instance , of the Helsinki Human Rights Group .
We too found it difficult to achieve our democratic standards .
So I believe that we should do our utmost to ensure that Albania gets what it deserves , namely that it is accepted into the community of European democracies , even if that will still take a while .
But we did guarantee him freedom of expression .
There were resolutions and discussions .
They must not fail to refer to the need for democracy !
Mr Moorhouse has already spoken for the majority .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in this joint resolution we call for three things : creating an international force , abiding fully by the Carcassonne action plan and providing assistance for the restoration of an effective system of justice .
There is a very close link between money laundering and organized crime which - as we all know - is constantly growing in Europe too and threatens to take on huge dimensions .
A final aspect that emerged is the problem that most of the money laundering no longer occurs in Western Europe now but mainly in Eastern Europe .
In particular , national legal provisions on money laundering should expand the list of activities that constitute criminal offences .
So it is worth considering whether occupational groups such as jewellers , casino owners , lawyers and notaries should not be involved more closely in helping to combat organized crime .
Only then will it be possible to detect and prosecute criminal money launderers successfully , for instance by making it easier to monitor telecommunications traffic or temporarily confiscating assets .
Mr President , the rapporteur Mr Lehne rightly said that the fight against money laundering must not be confined to drugs money but must of course also include the proceeds of all criminal offences committed by organized crime .
This cultural heritage must be preserved .
Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Mouskouri on this report on the promotion of the linguistic diversity of the Community in the information society .
Europe has the scientific and technological know-how and the economic strength , but it must also have the political will to maintain its linguistic diversity in the information age , which is what the people of Europe want .
Anyone who , like the rapporteur , is at home in nearly all the cultures of Europe , is aware of the inestimable value of cultural diversity and therefore able to sweep away the widely prevalent trend towards centralism .
