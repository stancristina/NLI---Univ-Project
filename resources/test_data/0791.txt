Our political deficit is not just a deficit in the way our institutions are organised , it goes deeper , and concerns the very sociological make-up of our societies .
There is , however , also a strategic deficit as regards the major economic and social issues .
We need to implement the economic reforms needed to make us competitive and innovative , whilst at the same time strengthening social cohesion .
It must rather be a real agent of equality of opportunity and of citizenship .
Our vision is to incorporate the information society into what we might call a genuinely educational society as a European response to the knowledge-based economy .
There must be a European commitment to establishing conditions for a genuine venture capital market which can in particular support small businesses which have come into existence as a result of the technologies of the future .
The third pillar also concerns the modernisation of our social protection systems in order to guarantee their sustainability .
Finally , there is the sustainability of our welfare system : we need to look not only at how it is funded , and at what methods are used , but also at the root of the problem .
To achieve this , it is absolutely essential today for us to develop support services in our societies for the family , and particularly support services for children .
I would like to say , on this subject , that it would be extremely desirable for Europe to achieve , on an ongoing basis , an average level of economic growth of more than 3 % , whilst of course respecting natural differences in performance between countries .
What we do want to do is to establish new conditions so that we can first of all coordinate , simplify and strengthen the three existing processes , and bring them together to achieve a common goal .
These techniques will provide a healthy rivalry and at the same time will enable us to compare our achievements in economic and social terms with other particularly dynamic parts of the world around us .
We definitely want to be at least as competitive if not more competitive than the most competitive and modern economies in the world .

On the eve of the Special Council dedicated to this problem , the basic question being asked is whether there is the political will to change this situation or whether , on the other hand , what we have is merely another ineffective initiative to add to the list of plans , strategies and summits in the past that have already been devoted to this issue and none of which has resulted in real change .
Today , they are no longer so much being promoted in line with much vaunted conservative principles , as on the grounds of so-called globalising pragmatism and in the name of competitiveness , which has been elevated to godlike status .
We reached joint conclusions on 14 points , of which we will officially inform the Presidency .
As time passed , the Heads of State and Government , who were aware that the single currency alone would not create more jobs , were forced to state their position .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have carefully read the Portuguese Presidency ' s document for the Lisbon Summit , which goes far beyond employment issues and which trumpets an information society and social cohesion .
On the other hand , I would also like to say quite clearly that we support the European social model as opposed to certain other social models from around the world , but we support it on the assumption that it remains to be perfected and implemented in a participatory way .
Until we launch a head-on attack on the EU' s demographic problem , which will bring our social systems to crisis point as well as create a "fourth age " of the very elderly who need special care , the real Europe has not yet been built .
Nevertheless , and with this I will conclude , we do not want the Lisbon Summit to restrict itself to being the kind of summit where the emphasis is on the analysis and diagnosis of social problems and where conclusions are not followed up with action .
From this point of view , we must also think about one of the objectives for the Lisbon Summit that you mentioned , namely combating the political deficit in Europe .
From this point of view , this question is perfectly sensible and requires the clearest possible answer .
I firmly believed , particularly because I attended the discussions on including the employment problem on the Council agenda , and on the European Union agenda , that the original idea of the Employment Summit was to combat the problems , not of the new knowledge-based economy , but of the old European economy , the problems of unemployment in factories , dockyards , iron and steelworks , and that these were the employment problems which were originally due to be on the Employment Summit agenda .
Furthermore , the way in which this European Council is being prepared is a good illustration of this .
We do so because for the first time , it is not only putting the issue of employment and social issues at the centre of the European debate but is once again suggesting that "achieving the objective of full employment " is in the realm of the possible .
I congratulate you , Mr President-in-Office .
The fact is that Europe needs to have 32 million more people in work if it is to match the United States ' employment rate .
If I may refer to the Austrian situation , I would very much like that country to be one of the states which will be putting your proposal into practice .
If we
