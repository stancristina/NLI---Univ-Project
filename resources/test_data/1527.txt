The Presidency believes that this method is based on scientific research and consultation .
Rest assured that , when it comes to continuing the work in the Council and my exchanges with the Commission , I will bear all this in mind , in the full knowledge that reaching agreement within the institutions is one of the best ways of dealing with a problem as complex and universal as that of food safety .
Growth will take place under conditions inherited from the crisis : a lot of jobs are being created , but there have never been so many insecure jobs , temporary jobs and imposed part-time work .
I believe that a strong policy on renewable energies is a symbol of the Europe of tomorrow .
Mr President , I have a point of order .
I would like someone to find out what variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has infected our computers .
I am one of those Members who attends sittings quite faithfully .
The first step we need to take is to start again from scratch , to review the labelling rules , to restore certain national controls , to create others and always to set out carefully , and in a clear and practicable manner , minimum European rules , while giving each State the essential right either to go further or to take safeguard measures .
Despite all that is happening today , the Commission has the audacity to uphold its complaint , thereby showing the extent to which it regards the free movement of products as the ultimate dogma .
The Union as a whole must be involved , for it is unacceptable to have one country taking draconian measures and putting its economy at risk while others carry on business as usual .
We must tighten up our health and safety controls , impose a procedure for systematic BSE testing , and ban the use of proteins derived from animals .
( FR ) Yesterday ' s debate on mad cow disease was an exemplary one in many respects .
The Commission is clearly envisaging no more than half-way measures , which will take away from and not add to the countries with the most stringent safety , whereas , in line with the principle of subsidiarity , it should be giving Member States back the freedom of action they need to protect their people effectively , to ensure their safety , taking account of public opinion in their country , the political resolve there , the scale of the epidemic in their country and the place of the sectors involved in that country ' s economy and their society .
On co-incineration , for example , which is generally carried out in cement kilns , the limit values for emissions are specified in an annex .
This figure of 65 million poor is not the effect of some misfortune that has come out of the blue ; it is the result of the greed of a privileged capitalist class intent on boosting company profits and stock exchange rates , which therefore makes people redundant , closes down factories , reducing 15 million women and men to unemployment , and puts such pressure on all wages that the lowest wages are not enough to live on .
Too many of our fellow-citizens are left by the wayside .
Finally , the report goes back to the open method of coordination , calling for dialogue between the players involved ( social partners , NGOs , local and regional authorities ) and networking .
The Commission proposal establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion ( 2001-2005 ) consists of promoting a better understanding of social exclusion , mainstreaming the promotion of inclusion and developing priority actions addressed to specific target groups .
- ( FR ) During last night 's plenary debate , many of us spoke of the need to promote renewable energy sources at a time when the Conference on Climate Change is being held in The Hague .
Now this process needs to be confirmed rapidly by the organisation of free , transparent and pluralist legislative elections in which all the political forces can take part .
The Greens firmly condemn all the acts of violence committed following the elections and lament the victims .
But above all , we must , in my view , insist much more firmly on this racist constitution being declared null and void .
Why did the French Government support the election rigging by Gue√Ø , which the European Parliament resolution is set to condemn after the event ?
So the European Union must begin to take a firm stance towards Vietnam and raise the issue of the rule of law and not just - I repeat - the issue of human rights , where there have been some signs of improvement .
Moreover , the text we will be voting on calls on the European Commission to draw up a Green Paper specifically on this question .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is difficult to argue with the general substance of Mrs Villiers ' report .
Mrs Villiers is aware of the concerns of the small and medium-sized businesses , which to a large extent depend on bank financing , and she has sensibly asked the Commission to carry out an internal assessment of the central component of its new rules , so as not to raise the cost of loan finance granted to these enterprises .
Our group was very satisfied with the vote in the Committee on Petitions .
Welcome Madam President , I share the honourable Members ' intense disappointment at the outcome of the Conference in The Hague , which is effectively an outright failure .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am here to tell the House about the Presidency
