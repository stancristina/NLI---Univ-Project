Many thanks too to Mrs Hoff for her report .
The accident at Chernobyl was the world 's largest single catastrophe of the decade .
The big question on the agenda is how to improve nuclear safety .
Ukraine sorely needs all her energy supplies , whatever the means of production .
This , which was mentioned both by the Commission and Mr Titley , should be done immediately .
Mr President , I would like to thank Nicole Fontaine for the work she has done in preparing her report and also as an active supporter of the European youth movement .
One solution is to combine the youth programmes planned for the years 2000-2006 .
In that way we would gain considerable benefits .
It would be well worth discussing the possibilities of combination very soon .
As voluntary work projects tend to be in the no-man 's-land between training and employment , their large-scale operation in some countries clash with the Inland Revenue and matters to do with social security .
The idea of coupling voluntary service schemes with the civil services that young people can opt for in lieu of military conscription is in itself an interesting one , but it seems unlikely to come about , especially in EU countries where there is national service .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Voluntary Service action programme has already aroused , in its pilot stage , much interest and great expectations , which we must now try to satisfy .
Mrs Fontaine 's report cleverly focuses on key defects the Council now has to put right if it wants a workable and successful programme .
I should also like to appeal to the Council to take seriously the demands of the rapporteur and the Committee on Culture , which are all basic preconditions for a viable youth programme .
With a budget any smaller we simply will not be able to meet the targets of the programme even modestly .
Otherwise they will be prevented from participating .
That is why it is also important to set up a tracking scheme so as to document the experience we gain from voluntary work and employ it usefully in future youth programmes .
We should also exploit the expertise that the various current youth organizations already have , when developing EU policy on youth .
We know that this question of taxation of newspapers is not solved .
The question and the message I want to give to the Slovakian people is that they must understand that the Union is a political union where you respect certain rules : the rule of law , the independence of the judiciary and also free and fair elections .
It is not only a question of one person .
We also know that in the Slovak National Party very many people hold the same opinion as Meciar ; we know that people have also been expressing anti-semitic opinions in the government parties , and we cannot accept that .
In this respect , Commissioner , I think that the standpoint of the Commission has been more honest , more straightforward during the whole process than that of this Parliament , which believes in vague promises and does not give a clear message that we support Slovakia 's entry into to the European Union by free and fair means .
Some are being selfish when it comes to exploiting common fish stocks .
I would like to thank him for a bold , impartial and unbiased account .
The methods used in the Common Fisheries Policy are thus mainly of a restrictive nature , and they cannot do anything to add to the resources we already have .
As fishing activity is concentrated at sea , in scattered locations , it is difficult to supervise .
The EU 's resources in this area are limited .
There is mistrust between the major fishing nations .
The Common Fisheries Policy can succeed in the future only if it has the genuine support of Member States .
Fish is an important and nutritious food source .
Stocks must therefore be protected against overfishing and be kept at a good level , for future generations as well as our own .
Madam President , the basic aim of the Common Fisheries Policy is a system of sustainable fish stocks .
It is about salmon fishing .
They are classed as an endangered species by the EU.
The Finnish government is asking the Commission to make an exception of the Baltic in its general ban on drift nets .
That way they are seeking to steer the Finnish salmon prey towards the thirty or forty mainly Ã…land Island crews at the cost of losing the natural salmon gene stock and effectively destroying salmon fishing in rivers .
The UK, which now has the presidency , must set in motion a determined policy to ban drift-net fishing once and for all , at the conference of Fisheries Ministries at the end of the month .
But , as Mrs Bonino says , it is the Member States that are largely responsible for surveillance .
And , in this way , it could be believed that modern fishing technology is a threat to fish stocks in all our waters .
The problem in the Mediterranean is tuna .
The EU should be tackling the fishing problems of the northern regions as well as those in the Mediterranean .
The dumping price of Norwegian salmon is also forcing fishermen in other countries to make ends meet by overfishing .
Mr President , the number of tuna fished in the last few years has risen dramatically .
The problem has not so much been with the measures , but in neglecting them .
Drift-net fishing is also responsible for an ongoing diaster in the eco-system , for example , with dolphins and seals .
