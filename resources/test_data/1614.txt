of our societies and it is only logical to wonder why these young people are being abandoned .
It has spread throughout Europe .
They were not allowed to be named on television .
We protect them under the banner of individual rights .
A paedophile is arrested and is protected by the principle of the protection of individual rights .
I should like to ask anyone in Europe – the tradesman in Cologne , the artisan in Marseille , the farmer in Greece : are they happy with the results of globalisation ?
Countries with a strong economy , such as Germany , are now in deficit .
Everything comes from China .
The third countries took our factories and we get their inhabitants .
We took our currency and revalued it against the dollar by 50 % .
Do you know what the average pension is in Greece ?
Can we safeguard work for all Europeans ?
What globalisation are we talking about ?
We have played the game of the United States of America so that big business can reap the benefits .
I bought the same things in my own country three times more expensive .
That is why we are moving towards a shrinking economy , towards a problem which we will have to face .
The communication by the European Commission on the social dimension of globalisation analyses the phenomena from the point of view of the interests of big business and tries to obscure the real reasons for modern problems .
At the same time , for the new economic and social reality which is being shaped , it proposes as a strategy at regional and international level the alleged need to accept and reform the imperialist unions .
An evaluation of all the data shows that the term 'globalisation ' is a misnomer .
Congratulations to the Commission because it contributed to the setting up and the work of the committee which drafted the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation and because it expressed the intention of making an efficient contribution to the monitoring of its work .
This broad wish list , both in the communication and in the Commission 's report , must be incorporated by the Member States on a daily basis , both in their legislative and in their executive work .
The global area has a familiar name in Greek ; it is called 'ecumene ' , a word from which the term ecology , care of the environment , is derived in numerous languages .
The Commission proposal for a common target date has precisely this objective .
The second dimension is the geographical dimension .
My final question is : can we justify subsidising specific technologies , such as set-top boxes , rather than other available technologies ?
However , apart from this , the switchover to digital television and the concomitant cessation of analogue broadcasting will also result in the freeing of analogue frequencies , which can then be used for new , innovative services .
The president of the USA is today threatening to veto the bill adopted by the American Senate in order to impose what was – until a few years ago at least – the obvious ; in other words , the fact that international law must be applied to persons arrested by the United States anywhere in the world .
Shall we allow them to do so ?
Where do they supposedly wash their hands , while using this network for their detainees ?
Let us Europeans not create a European-inspired Frankenstein which we cannot control and let us not allow any other country to do the same .     – Mr President , some time ago , information led to the discovery of the huge barbarity of torture chambers at the Abu Graib prison in Iraq and at Guantanamo prison in Cuba .
I wish to highlight in particular the direct reaction of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe .
Unfortunately , we did not see this direct reaction by the Council of Europe on the part of the European Commission .
The European Union has a political and moral obligation to cooperate with the American Congress .
This is a message which needs to be sent clearly to the American leadership .     – Mr President , Commissioner , first the operating framework and the advantages of occupational pension funds must be clarified .
However , I clearly support the fact that these funds are useful as credit institutions which undertake to guarantee auxiliary pensions , insofar as they are decided within the framework of collective agreements .
What we want is to integrate the directive into national law and , most importantly , for it to be accepted by the social partners , by employers and employees .
Despite the objections voiced in the Council , an agreement is being promoted with sweeping changes for the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 at the expense of farmers and workers in general .
More liberalisation of the markets , with electricity and natural gas in their sights .
I should like to congratulate in particular the chairman of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and the committee itself and , of course , the rapporteur Mr Sacconi , whose untiring and consistently constructive efforts have made a decisive contribution towards promoting this proposal .
In addition , it will give impetus to innovation and will encourage the substitution of products by safer products .
The compromise package constitutes a balanced proposal .
The Commission supports this package within the framework of efforts to find a compromise .
There are numerous important aspects in the REACH initiative but , due to lack of time , I should like to refer to two of them : the scope of the proposal and the provisions on authorisation
