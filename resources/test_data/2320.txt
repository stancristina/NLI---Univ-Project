to rescue the 13 .
We are using diplomatic channels to try and ensure that the death penalty is not imposed or , more to the point , is not carried out .
The starting point for the proposed objectives are what are typically referred to as the 'enormous benefits ' of the internal market .
Unfortunately , the same does not apply to small - or medium-sized businesses in small Member States , where much stiffer competition has resulted in an increase in the number of bankruptcies , shrinking business and job cuts .
In other words , even less accountable capital transactions and even fewer legislative specifications .
The report under discussion is fully in line with the anti-grass roots economic and social policy exercised within the framework of the single internal market and EMU and we shall , of course , be voting against it .
If , however , a right is somehow abused , I am not sure if that abuse has anything to do with democratic ethics .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , the resolution of the 1994 Essen European Council on trans-European networks , together with the joint European Parliament and Council decision of 23 July 1996 laying down Community guidelines for trans-European networks , was , at the time , - and I want to stress this - considered to be one of the most important steps towards real European integration .
As I have stated in my report , what is particularly disconcerting is the fact that seven out of a total of fourteen Essen specific projects have still not secured adequate funding , nor has a definitive timetable been drawn up for their implementation .
The main aim of Community funding is to finance feasibility and technical studies , as well as interest subsidies and loan guarantees .
And we must admit that , without funding , there can be no trans-European networks .
I would like to stress how important a role the European Investment Bank plays in this regard , too .
The fifth proposal is that the Commission should accord greater importance to the forthcoming revision of the TEN guidelines in order to improve access from Europe ' s island and remote regions to the central regions .
I trust you will forgive my sensitivity in this matter , given that I come from both an island and a remote region .
Since it is the responsibility of the Member States and the regions to provide such information , we also call upon them , Member States and regions alike , to provide the Commission with the necessary data .
One can therefore quite easily understand the great interest this country and its representatives have in trans-European networks , which I wish to talk about today .
We should ensure that the financial resources spent on TENs are increased .
And , of course , we should attach importance during the revision of the TEN guidelines to access to island regions and to regions which have difficulty obtaining access to the sea .
It is also proposed that the sovereign right of each country to control air traffic in its air space should be surrendered to the European Union , on the pretext of establishing a uniform system of air safety .
And maybe it will .
This , however , will prove disastrous for air connections to and from disadvantaged areas .
Secondly , eroding or even abolishing the intervention system will leave farmers at the mercy of traders , who buy from producers at derisory prices and then often resell at substantially higher prices .
Will they step up their fight ?
Despite declarations that the 1998-1999 subsidy would be GRD 460 , producers were only paid GRD 330 , one year later .
We also disagree with the monthly increment being paid in November , since harvest time in Greece is in June .
And similarly with rice , we recommend that intervention commence on 1 October or November and not on 1 April because otherwise , our producers are at the mercy of greedy profiteering traders for six months ....
Mr President , if the BSE crisis taught us anything , it is that health takes top priority over all other policies .
It is therefore essential that action be taken throughout the Community so that firstly : we can effectively guarantee public health protection and , secondly , we can restore consumer confidence which , in turn , will help the internal market to develop and operate properly .
A second key measure is to establish an ongoing epidemiological study based partly on laboratory tests using an established protocol .
I should like to stress at this point , that in my view , we will in fact only eradicate the disease effectively if we destroy the whole herd , regardless of how much this would cost both in economic and sentimental terms .
" Prevention is better than cure " , as Hippocrates said all those years ago , thereby paving the way for preventive medicine .
It would have made provision for the necessary procedures and penalties .
That is the direction in which things are heading with the classification of countries , which , rather than taking into account the most basic factor , which is the existence or non-existence of cases of encephalopathy in their raised cattle , takes account of other factors when allocating countries to a particular category .
At the same time , the proposal to remove the aforementioned organs and tissues is a recipe for disaster for sheep- and goatmeat , which will be impossible to market ; in other words , this measure will indirectly oust sheep and goat meat from the market , demand will be met by other types of meat from larger animals and traditional recipes using offal such as intestines and spleen will be banned
