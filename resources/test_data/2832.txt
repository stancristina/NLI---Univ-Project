solutions that are necessary if we are to obtain a more open , more democratic and more efficient Europe .     Mr President , Chechnya is a running sore on our continent , with hundreds of thousands of dead and maimed and with thousands of children traumatised and orphaned .
This means that the international community and we in the EU have an obligation , indeed a duty , to intervene .
In a way , the election was a success , in spite of everything .
With such negotiations in prospect , developments in Russia are very worrying .
It is gratifying that the President-in-Office of the Council is so clear in his criticism of Russia .
That is something we owe both the Chechen and Russian peoples , and it is something we owe ourselves if we are to remain credible .     Mr President , as has been pointed out in this Chamber , the elections in Chechnya did have significant deficiencies and shortcomings .
What is quite obvious after all these years of atrocities and war is that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Chechnya .
It is also important to see that Russia has , in actual fact , also conducted a policy of terrorism against parts of the Chechen population .
I am delighted that you have an established contact of that kind .
What kind of relations are we to have with neighbouring countries ?
How are we to step up cooperation on issues in respect of which we have to cooperate , such as the fight against terrorism , environmental problems , security and energy ?
Those European countries that are able and willing to fulfil all the criteria should be given clear prospects of membership .
My view is , therefore , that we should give Ukraine the prospect of membership .
We need further to specify and define what we are to do with the policy .
Furthermore , the cooperation agreements must be tailored to individual needs because , as has been pointed out , there are incredible differences from one country to the next .
His report shows that he is very familiar with European history and the current lie of the land .
Countries that are European and that wish to accede to membership should not be regarded as neighbours but as potential EU Member States and should be given clear prospects of joining the EU.
Does this mean that opinion both within and outside Parliament has changed , or do we lack political courage ?
Today , the situation is different .
In spite of this , I believe that , alongside our calls for democratisation , we should send out clear signals that , when it one day becomes democratic , Belarus too will have its place in the European family .
On the contrary , each Member State must decide for itself how it wishes to design its small enterprises policy .
The Member States must do more to make things simpler for small enterprises , and concerns are expressed about there being big differences in respect of education in entrepreneurship and the cultivation of the spirit of enterprise in schools .
It also states that the Charter should have the force of law and be binding because the Member States’ involvement would then be greater .
It is absurd to prop up an uncompetitive market through extensive protectionism and significant financial aid .
Overall , the Commission ’s proposals for reform are more far-reaching .
Public opinion does not need to be reassured .
There must be clear requirements for following up the results .
Firstly , they succeeded in surviving and fleeing from a war , and now they are persecuted in Egypt when they try peacefully to contact the UN.
I wish finally to remind you that , for example , my own country has , with the help of the CIA , sent so-called terrorist suspects off to Egypt to be tortured .
In the spring of 2003 , a wave of oppression swept over the island .
When , immediately before Christmas , the European Parliament awarded its Sakharov Prize to the Ladies in White – the wives and daughters of the imprisoned dissidents – representatives of the movement were not allowed to leave the island in order to travel to Strasbourg .
My friend Héctor Palacios , who was given a 25-year prison sentence , is very ill , and the doctors fear for his life .
It is , of course , completely unacceptable that people should still be kept imprisoned in Cuba because of their views .
It was a wrong decision , and it should be reviewed .
What does the Council intend to do now in order to support the dissidents in Cuba ?
Why is it so difficult to support the forces of democracy in Cuba when it is possible to do so in Belarus ?
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believe that men’s violence against women is linked to the unequal power relations between men and women , and the problem will increase if the Member States do not use legislation in order strongly and clearly to oppose such violence .
We often also forget the children in these contexts .
This form of violence and serious violation of human beings is absolutely unacceptable .
More often than not , the focus is , quite naturally , on the victims , but there is also a need for active preventative strategies aimed at the perpetrators of violence and at those in danger of becoming perpetrators .
I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament points out that the Commission should devote special attention to the consequences that liberalisation of the postal market will have for the inhabitants of sparsely inhabited regions ( paragraph 9 ) .
