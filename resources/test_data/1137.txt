estimated GDP for 2004 .
Adjustment of the common agricultural policy must include , for example , investments in higher food quality and the combating of animal diseases , which is a view shared by Parliament .
Parliament has adopted this position , as well as wordings in the aid budget aimed at making development policy more results-oriented .     I wish to express my satisfaction at the fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists ’ Amendment No 5 was voted down ( by 229 votes , with 209 in favour and 22 abstentions ) .
The Italian Presidency’s efforts in the Council regarding this point cannot therefore be criticised in the way that the PSE Group tried to criticise them .
The principle of subsidiarity must be fully respected .
This way of guaranteeing the patient optimum care and treatment is diametrically opposed to interference by the European Parliament in individual health care issues .     Mr President , Commissioner , as a Christian Democrat and Swedish Member of the European Parliament , I am very pleased that the issue of Moldova has been addressed again .
We European and Swedish Christian Democrats wish to express our support for the opposition in Moldova , which is led by the Christian Democratic Party under Iurie Rosca .
I believe that the Commission and the European Council should take action to strengthen cultural development in Moldova , so that the country might acquire an independence in which its own language , Moldovan , is given its rightful place .
The Commission deserves all credit for its fight to defend privacy in the negotiations with the United States concerning the air passenger lists .
The United States has , however , made major concessions .
In the light of this , it is very important to find a solution that does not put a complete stop to these contacts at the very moment when the economy is in the process of improving .
I wish , however , to warn against contagion .
That protection is something of which we should be proud .
The agreement must fall if the United States does not comply with the protection of human rights .
I also wish to thank the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have contributed through many discussions and many sound amendments so that , in the end , we have obtained a result from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that I think is very good .
The process of gradual deregulation of the EU markets has been the most important component for improving services of general economic interest during the last decade .
If we go with the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , we stimulate competition and product development and provide opportunities to offer consumers both cheaper and better alternatives .     Mr President , Mr  Herzog really has had a thankless task .
It is said that it is mainly a question of services of economic interest .
Are not all the social services of great economic interest ?
I am a little unsure .
In that case , such a directive would be a step in the wrong direction and might instead become a trap .
Above all , however , we need time for research and discussion as a counterweight to the giant battle we face over the next few years .     With regard to Amendment No 22 , we believe it is extremely important to take measures against environmental offences at sea .
The need for common legislation within this environmental area is therefore indisputable .
It has not , however , been demonstrated , and still less proved , that the most suitable and effective method of coping with these breaches of the law is to set up a further European agency or common EU coastguard .
We believe that the Swedish safety organisation , in conjunction with the work done by the IAEA , WENRA and other existing organisations properly fulfil the requirements for devising safety regulations and monitoring compliance with these .
This amendment emphasises that inhabitants of potentially affected areas in neighbouring countries must have the same rights as people in the country in which the installation is situated , for example in the event of public consultation when loans are to be given from the Community budget .
Naturally , the EU should continue its work with the Iranian authorities to help those affected obtain care , roofs over their heads and other necessities .
There is still a lot to be done , because the Iranian regime is anything but democratic .
Classifying the rejects as a bunch of criminals in view of the fact that they have had contacts with , for example , a number of groups disliked by the Council of Guardians rings hollow .
We in the ELDR Group would call upon the Iranian leaders not to interfere in the election but to allow the candidates to stand so that the election is as fair and open as possible .
I hope that you , Commissioner Nielson , together with Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana , will be able to act in such a way as to inject new life into these discussions , partly in the light of the work on getting Iran to ratify and implement the Non-Proliferation Agreement .     Mr President , Commissioner , I share your view that the issue addressed by Mr Paasilinna is an important one .
I also hope that we shall together be able to develop tools for revealing the false identities .
Proposals to enable individual Member States to retain and introduce stricter rules in this area , as quite a few Member States have already done , are particularly important to us .
In the marine environment , for example , they give rise to major environmental problems .
