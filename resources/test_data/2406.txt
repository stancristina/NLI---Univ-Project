Firstly , a proposal for political dialogue .
The Council wants a maximum of 1 million tonnes without a connection to other trans-European networks .
I would specifically like to acknowledge the French Presidency 's efforts to establish a common approach at this early stage .
This report is quite clear on that point .
We want to promote short sea shipping , but that means we also need smaller ports , which have a valuable role to play here .
And of course local and regional authorities remain at liberty to impose restrictions on 15-metre buses in places where there are traffic management problems , such as narrow streets in historical town centres .
German unity was only possible because of Solidarnosc in Poland , because of the desire for freedom of the Czechs , Slovaks , Hungarians and other peoples in central Europe .
We can support what you said .
The greatest achievement of the European Union is our shared law , and we must obey this law .
Can you proclaim rights in earnest , but at the same time refuse to declare them part of your own law ?
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is indeed an important political project for the future of the European Union .
Mr President , personally I am pleased that following the lifting of the sanctions within the Union normal relations have been resumed , apart perhaps from a few minor exceptions which are not worth bothering with .
The completion of this work is an important milestone in the history of the European Union , particularly for the people who live there .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with the approval of the courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg , the Convention has put together a draft Charter of Fundamental Rights which is remarkably balanced , and has delivered it into the hands of the Council .
Last week in the Council of Europe there was a big discussion with the Russian delegation , the vote on the basis of a report by Lord Hewitt was not able to go ahead and the matter was postponed .
I voted against this report .
That is why a facility to carry forward losses and enter them in the accounts would have a significant impact .
Contrary to the majority of the European Parliament , since Helsinki I have been of the opinion that the Intergovernmental Conference would have more than enough to do resolving the issues left over in Amsterdam .
This does not amount to discrimination against anybody .
Although we need to discuss and resolve the issues relating to internal reform within the European Union in Nice , we will certainly not be able to avoid discussing Europe 's borders either .
We will also be able to fashion an order in which war between us becomes impossible , in which people are able to discover each other in their common humanity and in which we can combine our strengths to represent our interests in the world , that is to fight for our common cause as Europeans in the world .
A specific outcome is needed from the Intergovernmental Conference if we are to do justice to the tremendous pressure for adaptation .
But not just any old stability .
The candidate countries of central and eastern Europe used to be on the fringe of the world economy .
There will be no political discounts .
There has been progress on a wide front in securing the political criteria .
I should like to mention a problem in this respect which requires particular attention and is a matter of great concern to me .
Our intention now , during the French Presidency , is to start with negotiations in the stricter sense of the word , by which I mean decisions on applications , transitional periods and derogations .
We are therefore looking to coordinate as closely as possible with the programmes of national governments , Parliament and other institutions .
We must help border regions to make use of the new opportunities and meet the new challenges .
There are risks .
Transitional periods will therefore have to be agreed .
I am convinced that we can manage this and also that we should manage it .
This implies that we shall not be setting any more conditions .
I would advise great composure when faced with candidates pressing for deadlines .
But just to be sure that there is no misunderstanding between us : you said that these nuclear power stations must be shut down before accession takes place .
We have already done this to the widest extent .
It is just that , as things stand , I cannot guarantee that they will be ready .
As you all know , I have been calling for pre-accession aid to be correlated more closely with the mechanisms of the European Structural Funds for a long time now .
Accession negotiations commenced in February 2000 .
As I said , despite a number of shortcomings and weaknesses , Lithuania has made good progress in the economic area and is only a short way away from a working market economic .
And also in the interests of cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation .
It also calls for the judiciary to be improved in order to address the problem of corruption , which the Commissioner has already discussed , and to achieve more secure rule of law .
Allow me now to jump across to Poland , which is without doubt a key country in the enlargement process , not just because it is the most expansive of all the central European economies but because of its size and geopolitical position .
In its own initiative report , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market therefore calls for the instrument of transitional arrangements to be used in
