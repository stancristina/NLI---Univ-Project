to make declarations and quite another to take decisions which affect thousands of millions of citizens .
It is also because success at Cancún would have sent out a very positive signal , one that would have helped revitalise the global economy .
By this I mean more than the need to increase the budget allocation for the purpose , though that is certainly required also .
This would benefit sustainable development too .
I also agree with Mr Cashman that there is scope for further improvements and that such improvements must be effected .
Nonetheless , if what we are about is making it easier for the citizens to search for and identify documents , the crucial factor is not the choice between one or several registers .
Further , the practice regarding access to documents concerning infringement procedures has been updated .
It was therefore impossible to be specific .
Mr Cashman 's suggestions concerning the evaluation report , due to be presented by the Commission early in 2004 will also be borne in mind .
The rapporteur indicated as much .
This needs to be borne in mind .
She has striven to ensure transparency and to improve the quality of the information available to our citizens .
A few minutes ago she was taking her leave of us outside the Chamber .
In my view , facilitating access to documents is the best way to bring Europe closer to its citizens and enable those citizens to understand us better .
It is also true that our group endorses many of the complaints referred to by Mr Cashman in his report .
It relates to access to Member States ' documents when the latter are acting as individual Member States and not in their capacity as Council members .
Today , we are debating the Cashman report .
If the Commission recorded all direct consultation of information available to citizens where recourse to Regulation EC No 1049/2001 is not required , the percentage of requests refused would be minimal .
Clearly , the process needs to be improved .
It even happens in countries boasting of maximum transparency .
I do not know if Mr Cashman or Mrs Cederschiöld will be present when the next report on the subject is presented .
Amongst other things , this text does not recognise the specific needs of regions with legislative competence , or the right of those regions to participate in the decision-making process on issues which concern them .
When the previous act is that hard to follow , one has to pull out all the stops ; I am sure , though , that Mr Diamandouros 's performance will be a triumph .
It is true , however , that there are differences of opinion at times .
The second follow-through dossier is being prepared .
If it is to exert that power , it must be allowed all the room for man ?uvre it needs .
I cannot , however , conclude my speech without giving credit where credit is due .
From this point of view , the Committee on Petitions is irreplaceable , being the ideal forum for establishing direct relationships between citizens and Parliament .
I want to recognise the role played by the new petitions in providing information on services linked to the implementation of Community law .
We are making progress , and we are moving towards the scenario Mr Gemelli described : an increasingly complex , globalised world , in which the citizen does not diminish in stature , but rather grows in self-respect , in accomplishments and as a human being .
As I said a little while ago , I would insist on the need to postpone discussion of this issue for the moment .
Particularly regrettable was the behaviour of our former President , Mrs Fontaine , firstly in January 2001 , when I asked for a statement against the pardon of 15 police torturers who had already been sentenced in Spain .
We ought not to pretend that we are doing something serious to oppose torture so long as we do not set up a more ambitious compromise , particularly denouncing by name those responsible for torture .
The Spanish Government has pardoned them , so they can torture with impunity in Spain .
Mr President , the overwhelming majority of Aragonese people do not want to be plundered .
And many of us are aware of examples in all the liberal professions .
I would like to say that those of us , myself in particular , who asked that Parliament be adequately represented , appear to have been listened to and I would like to thank the Italian Presidency for this .
And having said that , please allow me to focus on my observations relating to the economic aspect .
According to the Commission ’s data , investment of 1 % means supplementary growth of 0.6 % .
In other words , we must be flexible here as well .
This is a step .
I do not propose that we go as far as the United States with the deficit spending , but we could at least make an effort .
Because , in reality , what it has generated inside and outside this Parliament is enormous frustration .
Are you telling me that they cannot exercise these competences because they do not have sufficient money to do so and that we therefore need a European fund in order to implement the national competence of expelling citizens who are here illegally ?
We do so much work on them and so many people are involved in their production : the Council , the Commission , the European Parliament and so many others , that in the end we have a text which could be described as a ‘camel’ , in other words , a horse designed by a committee
