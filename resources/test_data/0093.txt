there are 5 women out of a total of 27 Members , it is now proposed that they be reduced to four .
Accordingly I recommend that , in adopting the proposal to approve the nominations of Members , with the provisos mentioned , the Parliament should express the wish that , at any rate , we should receive clarification on what I proposed previously . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , I believe that this is a good example of the proper functioning of the European institutions .
These formulae applying the law of conflict are merely subsidiary formulae and we hope that the Commission will pursue its legislative drive by proposing texts offering the consumer material protection which is uniform throughout the European Union , thereby removing the need to resort to these complicated conflict-of-law provisions . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , the fact that we are here , at this late hour , discussing the common frame of reference , is an indication that at least those of us who are here have a strong interest in this issue , and the Commissioner herself has indicated the interest that she and other Commissioners have in the matter .
European law in general and contractual law in particular can only be developed by establishing certain principles .
The model would be something like the United States Uniform Commercial Code , which has been described as the least uniform code of all , giving the least possibility of unification .
Despite this , the House will continue to work and point out areas where we have not done well .
This trade disagreement will go down in history as one of the main features of this summit .
I also wish to state my satisfaction at the progress made in relation to safety , a difficult and complex issue if ever there were one , with some areas that are totally clear , as today 's report shows , and others rather darker , although I prefer not to say which areas occur to me .
I also feel the solutions provided on penalties are extremely important , as also Parliament 's control not only in relation to comitology , in the case of flight time , but also in relation to the right to information , in the case of the Management Board .
In addition , it does not merely consider promotion inside and outside the EU , but achieves a multiplier effect through national action and private action within sectors .
I was subsequently draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the same issue , and have also followed its progress as the representative of the Socialist Group on the Committee on Legal Affairs .
Repair parts , in other words , parts which have broken or come loose after an accident or for any other reason , have to be replaced and , as Commissioner McCreevy said , the normal format is a part equivalent to the part replaced .
The main issue is this period , as Mr Lehne stated .
I therefore feel that Parliament should basically adopt the report , without prejudice to any minor difficulties that might be posed by certain amendments .
I wish to highlight the opportune timing of this report at a time when the scale of socioeconomic changes , the rapid transition towards an information society and the demographic trend associated with an ageing European population all require significant effort in the education and training of adults and lifelong learning .
Finally , I wish to refer to the importance of broadening the supply of training in digital technologies to reduce the digital gap which also exists within our societies between sexes , between generations , and between the populations of different geographical areas .
In short , education must prepare people for looking ahead and for innovation and must no longer concern itself with just fitting in .
Crime is dynamic and is constantly changing , therefore Europol and the other EU instruments to protect the safety of its citizens need to adapt more quickly to the changing times .
The work done by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs has fulfilled two objectives .
Thank you very much .
President-in-Office of the Council , I would therefore like once again to highlight the issues that concern us : we cannot fight crime on our own .
It is extremely important to us that Parliament has control and it is very important to us to decisively and determinedly fight organised crime together .
It is immoral and undignified not to respect judicial decisions and , on top of that , to throw them back in the face of a colleague who does have dignity and morality .
It must nevertheless also be borne in mind that , of this percentage , 21 % accounts for part-time employees ; indeed , women account for 65 % of part-time employees in the industrial sector .
Attention must also be paid to reconciling work and family life .
It is no minor issue that Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provide that rape , sexual slavery , enforced prostitution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilisation or any other form of sexual violence are to be treated as crimes against humanity and war crimes , and will equal , in terms of treatment and persecution , torture or serious war crimes , whether or not they are committed during an armed conflict .
We must make the United Nations and the European Union declare sexual violence a crime against humanity .
