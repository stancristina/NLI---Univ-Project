Mr President , it is perhaps symbolic that we should be starting this debate on future policy just before the Sydney Olympics with two rapporteurs who are former Olympic champions .
It has become a question of public health , and all the relevant players need to be mobilised to deal with it .
It is essential , for instance , to ensure maximum coordination of policies and regulatory measures .
This report has furnished the Commission with its first defined 'doctrine ' in the realm of sport .
They must try to be more transparent in the way they manage sponsorship and television rights .
( Applause ) Neither the European Parliament , nor the Commission , nor the Council can ignore the fact that the sports movement represents a real force in society .
First we must consider how useful these references could be and what we want to do .
It is with that in mind , ladies and gentlemen , that , like your rapporteurs , Olympic champions that they are , I hope that those men and women who will be making superhuman efforts in Sydney in a few days ' time will all be winners , because true sport , fair play in sport , is not a question of coming first but of surpassing one ' s own limitations .
The framework directive on water has finally been adopted - very welcome news .
Public health and long-term supplies are at stake just as much as biological diversity and landscape conservation .
For all these reasons , I voted for this text .
The directive would also allow Member States to introduce these provisions before the dates specified .
The amendment I tabled and supported has , in fact , been fully incorporated into the final text .
We condemn these amendments , which would lead to what I would also call a nonsense in industrial terms .
We voted against the joint resolution on mergers in the telecommunications sector .
The method , however , is highly questionable , for at least two reasons .
Really , from whatever angle we look at this Charter , it is impossible to find any virtue in it whatsoever .
And if there were to be only one such issue , without doubt it would be the defence and promotion of human life and dignity .
Clearly we cannot allow this trend to continue and must rapidly adopt measures to reverse it .
It has been admitted that emissions from aviation account for about 3.5 % of the global warming produced by human activity .
Doping in sport runs totally counter to that ideal .
Above all , sport must be regarded as an educational and social activity that encourages team spirit , solidarity and loyalty and helps combat racism and xenophobia .
Mr President , as a militant supporter of the Lutte ouvrière party in a country that played and still plays a shameful role in Burundi and in Rwanda , as it does in the whole region of central Africa , I cannot remain silent in the face of a resolution that strings together phrases supposedly in support of the people of that region while , in fact , concealing the despicable role the major powers played in the massacres carried out by the armed bands of the two conflicting ethnic groups in that region , the Tutsis and the Hutus .
Is that really impossible ?
ASEAN is simply a grouping of totally different countries , with widely diverging interests and no prospect of integration .
But , however great their responsibility for the misfortunes of their country , it does not match the cynicism of the British ministers and high dignitaries .
I should like to devote a few moments , ladies and gentlemen , to responding to a number of criticisms outlined in Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines ' report , and stressed by several of you , particularly Mr Herman Schmidt .
The qualitative assessment was based on wide sampling of the projects with additional interviews with national bodies and , subsequently , with the initiators or promoters of these projects at grass roots .
Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines ' s report pinpoints a certain lack of clarity with regard to the objectives of the European Year of Lifelong Learning , which she considers to be due to the lack of a definition of lifelong education and training .
Moreover , as you know , education from this angle has continued to be one of the themes of the Japanese Presidency .
We further acknowledged that this right must be adapted to cater for the advent of the information society .
I think this is an extremely dangerous demonstration , given that France is a country in which the fight against religious cults has had some very significant successes .
The first of these problems concerns our relations with the South , in the event the producer countries .
And that is not counting the plummeting euro and the explosion in the price of a barrel of crude oil , factors not anticipated in the past oracular pronouncements by self-styled experts on Europe .
Mrs de Palacio has just emphasised that Europe is the world ' s biggest oil importer .
Following this vote , the Council modified its proposal for a regulation , stating that the Eurodac system for comparing fingerprints should be established and administered by the Council rather than the Commission .
The people of Europe find it incomprehensible , and surprising to say the least , that the European Parliament should one day come out in favour of a report only , a few months later , to go back on its decision and vote in favour of a radically different report .
It infringes the legal protection due to refugees in being applied even to 14-year-olds .
I doubt , however , if that would be possible , so respectful is this
