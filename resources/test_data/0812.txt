say to Mr Papayannakis that I really cannot answer the question he has put or , indeed , his supplementary question .
It is Greece which exercises the Presidency in these matters , and I would therefore recommend that any supplementary questions be put in writing , whereupon they will be answered on the basis of careful instructions from my Greek colleague .
Mr President , I should like to assure Mr Papayannakis that Denmark exercises the Presidency both in the Committee on Internal Affairs , in spite of the fact that the Danish derogation applies to certain subjects dealt with by the committee , and in the ECOFIN Council .
I should like to add that , in common with the majority of the Danish parliament , the Danish Government would like to see these derogations removed as soon as possible .
It is a democratic decision we are respecting , and I am pleased that Mr Papayannakis is sympathetic to our doing so .
It was initially to last for ten years , whereupon it was to be automatically extended each year .
It has therefore always been clear that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Georgia was a long-term commitment for both parties .
It has created a framework for political dialogue that has contributed to the development of the links between us , and it has also helped promote the economic ties between the parties .
On the other hand , there is clearly still a long way to go , namely in connection with the need to support Georgia 's efforts to consolidate its democracy and develop its economy .
There is also a lot to be done within the fields of legislative , administrative , economic , social , financial , civic , technological and cultural cooperation .
Moreover , Georgia has also had to struggle with some quite special problems .
Two unresolved internal conflicts have meant that there are now almost 300 000 displaced persons within the country 's borders .
It is a genuinely tragic situation .
The EU has provided EUR 350 million by way of aid since independence in 1991 but , in the Council 's view , it would not at this stage be responsible to consider further steps that are subject to agreement .
This is also apparent from a recent letter from President Shevardnadze to Mr Solana , in which he talks about the need for further progress in the implementation of this agreement .
In that connection , the Council wishes to emphasise that the two internal conflicts in Georgia and the conflict between the other countries in the Southern Caucasus mean that conditions in the area are far from stable .
The lack of stability leads to problems involving terrorism , poverty , corruption , weak political institutions , illicit trade , emigration and the risk of ethnic conflicts .
Conflict resolution must therefore be our first priority .
We cooperate with Georgia in frequent meetings of our Cooperation Council and Cooperation Committee .
Failure to implement existing legislation impedes progress and limits the impact of EU aid .
We look forward to progress in this area .
I hope my answer has shown that the Council is monitoring the situation very carefully and that we share Mr Dupuis 's regret concerning the situation .
We are also obliged to ask Georgia to make an effort .
Mr President , I have to say to my good friend and former colleague , Mr Dupuis , that it is , unfortunately , unrealistic to put Georgia on the list of possible candidate countries .
I believe that we in the European Union must consider alternatives to membership for our near and distant neighbours in the east and south .
For certain European countries , the obvious solution is membership ; for others , that is completely unrealistic .
I do not believe it would be wise , in any case at the present moment , to awaken any hopes at all of membership in either Mr Shevardnadze or other leaders in Georgia .
Mr President , I can just briefly say in reply to Mr Posselt that there is of course an ongoing dialogue with the Russian Government concerning the Chechen problem .
Nor are we doing so .
So I agree with Mr Posselt in a way .
It has not been forgotten , as will also be apparent from subsequent questions if we get around to them .
Mr President , I understand that reasoning perfectly well , but the issue is that of whether this would be good advice to give Georgia and whether it would be a good solution to the current problems to switch on that light at the end of the tunnel .
As it is in this case , the tunnel can , of course , be so long that the hope is too faint and might be said to be in danger of actually distracting Georgia 's attention from the eminently here and now demands upon it that it is not complying with , including certain agreements we have with Georgia .
I do not believe that encouraging Georgia to work towards membership would be good advice .
As I am well aware , Georgia is , however , a part of Europe , and there is of course a theoretical possibility , which probably cannot be excluded , that Georgia might at some time or another be able to become a member of the EU.
At this conference , a declaration was adopted , together with an action programme , confirming the intention of improving the least developed countries ' preferential access to markets , while making progress towards the goal of giving all products from the least developed countries duty-free and quota-free access to the developed countries ' markets .
The UN Secretary-General , Kofi Annan , has also entreated them to do this .
