You are completely right when you point at the availability of data , because it is important that we can make real progress in that respect with a view to public safety .
This is an even-handed report which strikes the right balance between protecting privacy on the one hand , and creating opportunities for the improved exchange of data on the other .
Accordingly , it is true that we back the request for more objective and comparable data , for the executive bureau to be anchored in the Centre’s rules , for regular assessments of the Centre’s activities and also for the Reitox network of national focal points .
Indeed , the scientific committee is tasked to issue advice about scientific issues regarding the Centre 's activities .
The policies of various Member States vis-à-vis these problems vary greatly .
We have not discussed any of that , unfortunately .
We have discussed other things , such as how much influence the Member States will have on the Scientific Committee , how we are going to elect the chairperson of the Management Board , who gets to sit on the Management Board , and whether the European Parliament will have a say on the Executive Committee – not to be confused with the Management Board , which is something completely different .
Let us accept that .
This week , the Heads of State or Government will be addressing the same subject during their meeting .
This attitude further strengthens my optimism that Romania and Bulgaria will take their homework seriously .
We would reiterate that request now .
Continuing with constructions from the top down , dreamt up by the powers that be , will not solve anything .
It is quite understandable that the people of Europe are questioning our aspiration of a fully-fledged Constitution if we cannot even manage to make sound agreements in all those other areas , or if we contravene the agreements that are in place , such as the Stability Pact .
There was a total of approximately 630 votes for the first part , and only 545 for the second .
There is , in this House , an apparent lack of common sense if we fail to realise that true racism in Europe is fortunately a very marginal phenomenon , but that , on the other hand , our citizens are anxious about the undermining and erosion of safety , welfare and the cultural identity to which they are entitled .     Mr President , I voted against the Ždanoka report because we are yet again being faced with a list of proposals that do not offer a solution to the problem , but are , in fact , part of it .
That is true .
As a consequence , we will really have to change our way of living if we want to secure an existence for our children and grandchildren .
If it is anything , the EU is a community of values , and if we are a community of values , then we should be discussing these matters at European level and we will not accept that Member States hide behind the argument of subsidiarity , because that is only a pretext .
Finally , we should not hesitate to use an instrument we have at our disposal , namely Article 7 , in cases where a Member State or a Member State government fails to comply with EU principles .     Mr President , first of all , I should like to join in the emphatic and unqualified condemnation of any kind of violence , of course .
Since 11 September , safety is , of course , more than ever , an important topic , and it goes without saying that aviation requires our particular attention , given the potentially devastating effect of attacks involving aircraft .
Is it the customers , industry , or perhaps the government ?
Some countries , including France and the United Kingdom , have already used them , while others , such as Greece and Spain , have not .
As this involves sensitive and confidential information , it is understandable that people should wish to keep this out of the public domain , but it does make it all the more necessary for Parliament to be able to closely monitor the implementing measures that were agreed behind closed doors .
At a time when other modes of transport have made much more headway , cross-border European traffic has evidently never been that important to the monopolies .
We have to consider the entire corridor , from beginning to end , down to the last mile .
Member States and others refuse to face this reality and think that Europe , even if it has no money , should still be the driving force behind initiatives such as these .
Moreover , there is every chance that at least the first software version will need to be upgraded in the foreseeable future .
Until it can be fully introduced , we must make sure that the tried and tested protection systems are not neglected and prevent a further shrinkage of the railway network from becoming a means of quickly reaching good statistics with ERTMS.
The existence of nationally-geared protection systems is without a doubt part of this .
I am also aware of the interest in this system from outside Europe .
This represents prospects for industry and more employment .
One of the points of discussion springs to mind , namely whether or not one corridor should be singled out .
I wish the Commission and the ERTMS coordinator much success in this difficult balancing act .     .
I say the proposal , because the Commission did not like that terminology , but I think this is what has been done , through the good cooperation and professionalism of the people involved .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies
