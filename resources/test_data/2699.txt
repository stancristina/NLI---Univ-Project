It strikes me as especially significant that we can take into the Parliamentary elections actual proof that the fourth freedom of the treaties , freedom of movement , has been revitalised as a result of Parliament and the Council adopting this directive .
Parliament proposes , on the one hand , that this agency should be given a less intergovernmental structure , with the composition of these bodies , which would involve the Commission more in the aim of greater effectiveness .
This regulation also violates democracy , by opting for biased structures defined at the top rather than by the citizens at the bottom .
It would be difficult to justify imposing strict controls on European Union operators if those from third countries were able to avoid them .
I am also grateful to the Commission , which did everything in its power to offer us continual assistance .
Providing as it does for revision of the directive , especially in line with changes to Community legislation , this is a forward-looking compromise .
If intellectual property really is the oil of the twenty-first century , then of course it is important to talk about it .
How are we going to explain to the citizens of Europe that Parliament’s rapporteur , the person most directly involved with this dossier , happens to be married to Mr Fourtou , the chairman of Vivendi Universal ?
Clearly , we are today considering in particular Israel’s violation of the rules of origin within the framework of the association agreement .
Furthermore , the ongoing construction of that shameful wall can only exacerbate the situation .
My conclusion is a general one .
We propose more widespread use of alternatives to prison sentences .
I am thinking particularly of the status of women in Islam .
The regulation is currently the subject of an appeal before the Court of Justice , which I filed together with several of my fellow Members , thus showing that the delegation of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is equally determined to oppose this new resolution .
Although in the past I supported the Regulation , I cannot now endorse the content of this report .
The report entrusts the allocation and management of Community funds to the Bureau of the European Parliament , on the grounds that the Bureau is already responsible for funding issues concerning the internal organisation of Parliament .
They deceive consumers or they usurp the identity , reputation or technical procedures other businesses have invested a lot in establishing .
The French Government should have had the courage to do the same .     .
Equality between men and women certainly requires that .
It goes without saying that the institutions must seek to provide greater clarity of definitions and legal concepts .
The resolution on which we shall be voting tomorrow is addressed to the Council and calls on it to adopt a common position on this serious violation of the fundamental principles of law .
This new Financial Regulation now provides a clear legal framework for the subsidies we give to a large number of leading European organisations in the fields of culture , youth and education .
As you see , there is no more ambiguity and I will therefore end by thanking the rapporteurs , Mrs Iivari , Mrs Pack and Mrs Prets , for the quality of their work and above all for the spirit in which they undertook it .
Mr President , I promised that during the first half of 2004 I would outline the future prospects for the European programmes for which I am responsible .
I can also tell you in all honesty that the timetable will be tight because we will need 2006 to put these programmes in place and ensure a smooth transition between today’s programmes and tomorrow’s .
Even if the expenditure in question is appreciably increased in the interests of citizenship and in those of the men and women of whom Europe consists , it will still be only a very tiny percentage of the Union’s overall budget , not to mention the fact that , as I can tell you very clearly , there is still a lot of political work , a lot of persuading , to be done if we are to have that tiny percentage .
We think development at this level , too , is very important .
These will be the three common themes running through all our cultural actions .
Downstream there is the problem of distribution .
You have given us the opportunity to do so , which is a pleasure to hear .
My third question concerns the cinema .
If we do not give ourselves the money to finance the 360 000 Erasmus students or the 10 % of schools that could benefit from an education mobility programme , then we cannot do it .
Are you aware that hunters from the West , from the Fifteen , go in great numbers to hunt in these countries , because the fauna is still very interesting and there are still major trophies  – bears and wolves  – to bring back ?
Europe needs its farmers and needs to support the population in its rural areas .
It is tobacco cultivated in Europe that allows European cigarette manufacturers to comply with the ever more stringent health regulations that we impose on them in terms of nicotine or tar level .
Foresight is given to tobacco planters , the proposal from the Committee on Agriculture is within the budgetary framework of the entire CAP as has been set until 2013 .
Finally , the Commission ’s report offers a new and bold definition of another of the Lisbon strategy ’s key concepts : ‘the sustainable development approach is beginning to be taken into account in the definition of policies [ ...] it is thus that several Member States have embarked on reforms to their pension systems in order to face up to the problems of an ageing population’
