but , above all , out of solidarity with other people .
We also support the rapporteur when it comes to the legal basis and to extending the instrument so that it also covers disasters affecting public health .
Otherwise , the chlor-alkali industry , which has the largest stocks of mercury in Europe , will export huge quantities of it .
It is of fantastically high quality .
You can see how three quarters of mercury discharges stem from amalgam , with the majority of them originating in dental clinics .
The way he did this was excellent .
Society has changed as a result of this process , and workplaces are now of a higher quality than they were when I was growing up .
The issue is , however , one of how , then , we are to implement the restructuring .
Then , factories will simply have to close down .
Both sides of industry , including employees , must be involved in the whole process so that , when the restructuring process takes place in the form of skills updating and such like , people are prepared .
I know , for example , that , following last year’s closure , 75 % of former Electrolux employees in Västervik have now already obtained new jobs .
There has been cooperation between the company , both sides of industry and the local community with a view to creating new jobs .
However , we must also use the old instruments , such as the Social Fund , to promote the updating of skills .     I wish to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality , especially Mrs Gröner and Mrs Sartori , for their committed work on this issue .
I think that these last three should also have voting rights and that the voluntary organisation should be a women’s organisation .     The June List believes that gender equality issues are important and that it absolutely goes without saying that women and men should be treated equally under all circumstances .
Will the authority help increase gender equality , or will it mainly constitute a type of alibi and way of showing that the EU cares about equality issues ?
There are also national authorities that work on equality issues and that can cooperate across national borders .
Cooperation can also take place in more decentralised forms , without the EU growing larger as a result of new authorities being created for every important issue .     The report proposes that a new European Institute for Gender Equality be set up .
Sweden has come a long way with its work on equality , and the June List is convinced that this work is best done at national level .
We have thus chosen to vote against the report in its entirety .     The EU has too many authorities and agencies .
It may actually make sense to have an institute to combat discrimination against the majority , who are women .     There are good reasons for the Member States’ governments to give priority to measures that reduce the risk of natural disasters striking .
Many forms of natural disaster ( such as drought and fires ) are recurrent and can be predicted .
On the basis of this reasoning , we have chosen to vote against this report .     The EU countries should develop structures for helping each other in the event of forest fires and other natural disasters .
I believe that such attacks are of a quite different character to other disasters and that , in order to protect ourselves against them , quite different methods are required .
They should not , therefore , be covered by the fund .
Instead of changing these policies , as they ought to do , these countries want , however , to export them , together with their consequences , to all the EU countries .
It must be possible to relocate industries if these are to be developed .
We have chosen to vote against the report as we think that it goes the wrong way about tackling the problems of relocating companies .
We shall do so by making life easier for more companies and by facilitating new investment in the private market .
We believe that the relocation of companies to third countries outside the EU is something in which we cannot interfere .
This happened in 2002 when the tyre factory in Gislaved was closed down and the company concerned , Continental , instead invested in a tyre factory in northern Portugal .
We therefore choose to vote against the report .
We nonetheless have views concerning individual points in the European Parliament’s proposal .
When the Commission introduced customs duties on TV sets , consumers had to pay SEK 2.00 for every krona earned by the industry .
Now , the process has begun of making the same mistake once more – in connection with shoes from China and Vietnam – but this time we know the cost of the policy in advance .
In total , Swedish consumers can count on paying almost SEK 60 million more for their shoes .
The only EU country in which the business is estimated to be profitable is Slovakia , where SEK 300 000 is estimated to be earned .
In spite of everything , the Commission has consciously chosen to make comparisons with expensive shoes from Brazil and measured the increase in imports before the quota was abolished against that after the quota was abolished .
Nothing has happened .
I believe that a well thought-out strategy is required for dealing with the human rights situation in Iran , and I wonder if we might perhaps draw on our experience from the period when we supported the Belorussian opposition by broadcasting to it from Europe in Belorussian
