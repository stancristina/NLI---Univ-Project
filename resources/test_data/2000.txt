If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe .
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe ' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact , about forty years .
We are losing market share .
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive .
I hope you will help us .
Mr President , there is a mystery .
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997 ?
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now .
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today .
I am very fond of him .
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners .
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues .
There has , over this period , been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive .
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties .
That has only happened recently .
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this .
We really have not progressed very far .
However , since Commissioner Monti is here , I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about .
It was about gradual liberalisation ; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price ; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector .
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive .
The postal service is not just for Christmas .
It is for life .
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service .
It is about keeping communities together .
The postal service is also the bus service .
The postal service is also the social service .
The postal service is also the doctor .
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade .
We will cut them off .
The postal services are important .
That message must be taken back from here today .
The Commission must listen to it .
Mr President , postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so , given their importance .
Only last week , in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners , Plaid Cymru , the party of Wales , made his maiden speech on that subject .
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices , especially in rural areas , play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities .
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services .
Post office outlets in Scotland , as we have heard , handle much more than just mail delivery .
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents , local taxes and so on .
But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts , so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened .
If a rural post office closes , usually with the only local shop attached , then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result .
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems , governments , and the Commission too , should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon , providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents .
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all , even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union .
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt , on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides , Orkney and Shetland , there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service .
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services , like all service industries , are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open , even international , competition .
I would suggest that there is a solution .
It is already employed widely in the transport sector .
Air routes , ferry routes , train routes , bus routes , within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender .
The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract .
Let us call this a negative tender franchise .
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system .
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put
