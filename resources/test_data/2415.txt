hoped-for 'most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world , based on knowledge and able to guarantee sustainable growth , with more and better employment and greater social cohesion ' as defined in the Lisbon Strategy .
Under this initiative , air operators will appeal for 'volunteers ' who , by giving up their seat , shall be offered a choice between having the cost of their ticket reimbursed , or being re-routed to their final destination .
One need only think of the significant reduction in air ticket prices and , consequently , the impressive increase in passenger numbers .

I have voted in favour of this report , all the more because it has weighed up the various interests in this field and contains a set of reasonable compromises which , for this very reason , received the broad consensus of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
Although the rapporteur claims that the aim of competition and completion of the internal energy market should be implemented in such a way as to allow for universal service obligations , the options it favours for supporting the funding of priority projects , even in tricky areas , cannot exceed 20 % and then only in exceptional cases .
This is all the more relevant in the case of the outermost regions such as the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores .
It is also important to focus on research in the field of new energies in order to ensure that their production costs come down and on decentralised sources .
This category will include a limited number of energy network projects with a very significant impact from the point of view of the essential criteria of energy policy , in other words , to complete the internal market and to strengthen security of supply .
The terrorist threat has assumed global dimensions , requiring a global reaction in order effectively to combat this threat to democracy and the free exercise of human rights .
The tragic events of 11 September 2001 cannot be used to justify excesses or abuses that enable security to suffocate freedom and justice .
I opposed two truly deplorable paragraphs in the joint resolution , but in the end I have voted in favour of it , because I believe that combating terrorism is crucial - it is the greatest global threat of our times - and because I do not wish in any way to contribute to sending out a weaker message in this field .
Without giving in to any political or moral buck-passing , the fight must be pursued by means of all available political , diplomatic , military , police and judicial instruments available , as circumstances on the ground and the effectiveness of dissuasion or suppression dictate , rejecting shilly-shallying that blames the victims and favour the aggressors .
The problem , however , is that Russia has already promised on several occasions that it would ratify the Protocol and this has not yet happened .
We must take Kyoto to the next round at the World Trade Organisation .
With regard to the role of Parliament 's delegation in New Delhi , I would emphasise the words of its Chairman , Caroline Jackson : the parliamentary delegation must be allowed to attend the daily meetings held by the EU representatives .
This is something I fail to understand , Mr President .
We have been waiting here since 5 p.m. to start this debate , but the time management of the various presidencies has been thoroughly incompetent .
It would be a mistake , however , to confuse this funding stability with the status quo of the CAP.
I believe that it would be preferable to undertake a balanced reform now , before 2004 , which guarantees that the markets and their regulatory instruments will be managed , which guarantees Community preference and which guarantees aid for farmers , rather than to do so after enlargement , with the inherent risks of uncertainty about the negotiating and decision-making procedures in the first few years of the enlarged Union .
In other words , the same Union budget that has served a Europe of fifteen countries will also have to serve a Europe of twenty-seven .
In a parallel directive , the Commission is proposing to extend these measures to ships undertaking international journeys in all European seas .
This is why I had no alternative but to abstain from this vote .
Given the implications of the restrictions imposed by the Stability Pact on the least-developed countries - not least Portugal , where the draft budget proposed by the government , in the aim of complying with the convergence criteria , will considerably accentuate regional imbalances - this answer will have to be given on the basis of a real evaluation of cohesion policy needs and with a revision of the financial perspectives with a view to enlargement .
For this reason , my final vote , in conjunction with the various partial votes , is an attempt to express the fundamental value that I attach to this Community principle ( see Article 158 of the EC Treaty ) as a fundamental founding principle and permanent guiding principle of the European Communities and of the European Union .
From now on , therefore , these States must have the same rights in Community waters as the nine Member States that established the common fisheries policy at the start of the 1980s .
We argued for international fisheries policy and also joint ventures to be strengthened , and for public aid from the European Union for investment intended to improve conditions on board ships , which are currently very poor , to be maintained .
