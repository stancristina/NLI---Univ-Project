discrepancy between the Union’s budget and its increasing responsibilities can only have detrimental consequences for the EU 's capacity to take action , and in turn for its image among the citizens .
Following the natural disasters across large parts of Europe , we have seen the inadequacy of the Solidarity Fund since it was set up in 2002 , given the unpredictable nature of these phenomena .
All measures – both those already in existence and those proposed here – need to be available .
The establishment of a Community forest fire protection programme ; 3 .
This is another example of a situation in which those in control call the shots ; that is to say that in this ‘federalist ’ Parliament , the weighting of Members from each country , with central and northern European MEPs the dominant force , is a decisive factor in undermining the interests of Mediterranean countries , in which more than 90 % of forest fires take place .     .
We believe it is crucial that a Community programme to protect forests from the scourge of fires should be created in the next financial framework 2007-2013 , with the appropriate funding , with the aim of fostering awareness raising activities , and fire risk prevention and management .
Disasters of this nature that my country and other EU Member States have suffered lead me to join the rapporteur in calling for effective prevention measures , such as technological research and development and the establishment of a European Monitoring Centre for Drought and Desertification .
I regret the fact that the legal issue relating to the formula in Article 3 is not the wording that enabled us to reach consensus .
I shall speak about one , the Lisbon Strategy , which is the issue that over the past five years has left us most open to ridicule .
We will not have jobs or satisfaction for our citizens .     – The dominant forces in Parliament continue their fools ’ crusade , promoting ad nauseam the inappropriately named European Constitution , which would strengthen federalism , neoliberalism and militarism in the EU.
In a word , unacceptable .     – Europe’s main mission is to comply with and promote international law and the humanitarian principles that underpin it .
Furthermore , the fight against terrorism is not only pursued through the mechanisms of criminal law .
Guantánamo does not define the limits of law and politics , yet to define the limits of law and politics is a basic requirement of the principles of justice .
Emergency measures must therefore be taken at Community level in order to ensure revenue for the sector and its workers , which is what the sector ’s representatives have long been seeking .
These businesses have a great deal of difficulty in accessing information of this nature .
Unfortunately , in Portugal we are very familiar with this situation and its effects , as confirmed by the recent spring 2006-2007 economic forecasts .
As draftsman , I wish to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work and for his cooperation in accepting a large number of amendments , three of which I should like to highlight : Firstly , the liberalisation of the energy markets must be matched by the quality of the regulation .
Women still suffer from discrimination at work , which takes a number of different forms , such as unequal pay and difficulty of access to the labour market , and in particular to well paid , prestigious jobs .
Such measures will undoubtedly help to stop discrimination against women and will help women to have the children they want to have .     – Mr President , the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women in terms of access to work and work-related activities must be implemented across a wide range of areas .
I particularly welcome the idea of gearing the CIP towards potential applicants , in other words its direct beneficiaries .
The Commission ’s proposal will plug a gap in public health , which has long existed in the EU and which has , in some cases , led to dependence on the US or Asian pharmaceutical industry .
I voted in favour of the Grossetête report on medicinal products for paediatric use , at second reading , because I feel that , in light of the specific nature of the child’s metabolism , medicines developed specifically for children should be promoted .
The act of bringing together in one sole document the various initiatives on equal treatment will serve to simplify the existing legal framework .
This is a crucial step towards improving cooperation between the Member States in protecting children .
It also showed that , in the election , the people under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority did not prioritise a negotiated settlement to this age-old conflict .
I share the concerns regarding the Guantánamo situation and endorse the request made in this House to put an end to this type of situation and to close these detention centres .
I should like to restate what I said in October 2004 on this matter .
We feel that the civilisation values in which we believe must be upheld .
In recent years , difficulties have come to light that , in many cases , can be resolved .
There are therefore three aspects that I consider to be fundamental in any debate on the matter .
This is true of the economy itself ( take , for example , the energy question , the growth of economic powerhouses such as China and India , and world poverty ) and of security .     .
Whilst trade is an important tool for development and a means of reducing poverty , it is clearly impossible to attain real progress towards these objectives unless fair rules are established at international level
