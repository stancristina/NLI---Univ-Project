idea and vision has been the fact that it is convinced of the advantages of developing European cooperation together .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party supports the report .
It is only by acting together that we can defend and stand up for our common values and ambitions : freedom , democracy , human rights and a functioning market with growth and prosperity in a Europe that gives the citizen pride of place .
We liberals have stubbornly fought for a situation in which the Copenhagen criteria , especially the political criteria , are respected .
We must make demands upon ourselves , both in the old and the new Member States , which we must not see divided into A and B teams .
Many difficult issues have been resolved during the autumn .
I hope that everyone can contribute to such a solution .
It will be a celebration at which the division between ' we in the EU' and 'you in the candidate countries ' ceases and at which we all become ' we in the EU' .
Today , I nonetheless want to draw attention to the sustainable development strategy adopted by the Gothenburg Summit and also to the UN 's environmental management programme adopted in Johannesburg .
Up until 2006 , approximately 10 % of the structural funds are to be set aside for the purposes of environmental infrastructure , for example the cleansing of waste water .
Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteur for a typically sound report .
In certain quarters , a number of people are , however , sceptical about this cooperation , which has been accused of being only for the richer countries in our part of the world .
I myself come from the Baltic region .
The same applies in the area of the labour market where there is a risk of jobs ' moving as a result of poorer conditions .
We all of us have the opportunities to become winners , both the existing EU countries and the candidate countries .
Mr President , for 28 years , Berlin and Germany were divided .
Turkey must respect the UN resolutions and give its full support to efforts to reach a political solution regarding Cyprus .
If the discussions fail , Cyprus must nonetheless be given the green light for membership in 2004 at the Copenhagen European Council this coming December .
We are concerned here with the credibility of the EU and with the EU as a peace project .
A hundred years later , a thousandth of the population is Christian .
The work of enlargement must proceed further , however .
What we do not want the EU to interfere in where our own countries are concerned , the EU must not interfere in where the new Member States are concerned , either .
Three years later , the European Parliament cannot now , as some amendments demand , try to change this .
There are things that remain to be done , and it is for Turkey to decide whether it wishes to continue .
Mr President , I have a question for Commissioner Diamantopoulou regarding the European employment process and the most practical difficulty to which it gives rise , namely the problem of implementing the policy in the Member States .
I think this sounds excellent .
I therefore wonder why the Commission is not clearer on this point .
Mr President , my questions also relate to environmental policy .
I would like to repeat the question from Mrs Frassoni on PVC and what has happened to the goals regarding PVC in this work programme , for they were included in both last year 's programme and that of the previous year , but they have now disappeared .
Perhaps Commissioner Liikanen or Commissioner Wallstr√∂m should answer the question of what has happened to the Commission 's goals on the issue of PVC.
I now want to know whether it is the case that the Commission has started to set up an internal organisation to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to implement this type of impact assessment for EU-financed plans and programmes .
With this enlargement , the new candidate countries will have a period of quarantine in terms of a person 's freedom to seek work in the various Member States .
No one wants to introduce internal border protection within the Union .
( SV ) We , the Swedish Social Democrats behind this explanation of vote , would like to present our motive for voting against Amendment No 17 , regarding Article 2 b , which is that the definition of advertising cannot be implemented under Swedish law .
The term commercial advertising does not include editorial texts , opinion advertising , product placement , artistic expression and all other forms of marketing which are not part of an advertisement .
The directive involves a ban on advertising tobacco products in newspapers , radio broadcasts and on the Internet , as well as making tobacco-related sponsorship illegal .
.
The committee 's amendments are certainly good , as they are aimed at repudiating the reversed burden of proof , but this still does not clarify the situation sufficiently .
A satisfactory legal text should clearly establish that only property deriving from proven criminal activity , or of equivalent value , can be seized .
For example , we oppose state subsidies for a fishing fleet which is already too large in relation to fish stocks , despite the fact that there are probably deficiencies in terms of safety on some fishing vessels .
That is something about which there can be no doubt .
This concerns pollutants which threaten humans and animals in northern Russia .
Which Russian company was responsible for the 50 000 tonnes of oil on the tanker which had been loaded in St Petersburg
