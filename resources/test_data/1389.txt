international player .
Logically , the first strategic objective must be to extend and stabilise the security zone around the European Union , in other words , around our continent , specifically to the east and the south .
Fortunately , the European Union has a whole panoply of means for acting that range from diplomatic activity to armed peacekeeping action .
I therefore believe that when we were given the mandate in Helsinki , at the end of 1999 , to start considering how the European Union could undertake civilian and military action , this possibility was also being considered .
I also believe it would be wrong to think that the focus of the war against these new threats should be strictly military .
In my first speech , I spoke about the operation in the Congo .
Mr President , I wish to speak , like my fellow Members who have just spoken , about trafficking and the fight against the illegal trade in light weapons .
The assessment meeting presents a good opportunity to achieve this .
Light weapons must fall under the control of an international system , as has been done with anti-personnel mines and chemical and biological weapons .
( ES ) Mr President , out of courtesy to the Members of the European Parliament who have kindly remained with us until the end , I wish to say that the European Union will be embarking on a new exercise , that it will attempt to undertake this exercise as seriously as possible and that it is going to present a document on security strategy , the first ever , in a few days in Thessaloniki , which will certainly be followed by a mandate from the Heads of State and Government to continue working on it .
From this statement we can infer the need for a European industrial policy which , in order to be effective , must not only cover the strictly industrial aspects , but must also be a horizontal policy that embraces , amongst others , the social and environmental aspects and above all , trade policy .
Another challenge facing the industry is China 's accession to the WTO , and by way of illustration , it is worth recalling those studies predicting that once quantity restrictions are eliminated , China could see a 150 % increase in its global textile and clothing exports and could consequently gain 50 % of the world market share .
Less than two months ago , Parliament 's Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy held a hearing , at which one of the speakers was the Chairman of Euratex , the textile employers ' association , who concluded his speech by asking what we could do to solve the problems facing the textile industry .
.
The Regulation seeks to establish a solid and transparent legislative framework for the recognition and financing of European political parties .
At the same time , there must be a reliable verification system .
To conclude , Mr President , I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results it has achieved , on the compromise reached between Council and Parliament , in which the Commission played a part and which should , we hope , enable this dossier to be concluded at first reading .
Furthermore , we should not ignore the fact that the proposed rules discriminate against political parties of its stateless nations , such as the Basque Country , as Mr MacCormick mentioned just a few minutes ago .
I also hope that , thanks to this debate and to measures that have been adopted recently , we are finally going to be able to resolve the matter and move ahead with constructing the Europe that we all want to see : a Europe that is transparent , responsible and at the service of the citizens .
I have chosen to interpret the report as support for the proposal made in the Commission Communication and I have no problem with the amendments Mr Wijkman tabled last week .
The resolution correctly notes that the Commission has been very modest in suggesting special and reserved funding for energy investment in developing countries .
I also wish to say that the energy chapter is indeed still one of the least-present elements in cooperation and assistance for poverty eradication and for the development of the poorest countries .
The only difference is that , when the time comes , we will be able to present it with the backing of the conclusions obtained in Johannesburg and of the awareness-raising that has been carried out since then .
Please remember that , ladies and gentlemen .
I can however assure you here and now that it makes no sense whatsoever .
What is actually needed however are funds and resources .
I am certainly prepared to have a calmer discussion with the Commissioner .
Further , this communication recognises the lack of an integrated policy for the protection of the marine environment at Union level .
The Sixth Programme contains an important chapter calling for the protection of the marine environment to be strengthened .
The Committee on the Environment was of the opinion that it should be strengthened .
They must not be seen as substitutes , however .
The Mediterranean , which is the cradle of European civilisation , is a responsive , living , but extremely fragile place , characterised by its status as an enclosed sea , which brings its own dangers .
Its fleet - as we have already heard - essentially comprises small-scale fishing boats .
Poor application of the principle of subsidiarity - and this is perhaps the strongest objection I would put to Mr Lisi - resulting in the renationalisation of the CFP , would be a death sentence for fishing in the Mediterranean .
