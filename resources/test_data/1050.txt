.
If things continue in this way , a form of inequality will develop among the next generation which sets us back a hundred years in education .
We need a new plan - as my colleague Mr Hendrick pointed out - to supplement universal service , whereby every citizen must be given access to the network .
This means that those who have a traditional conception of social policy - I am trying to be restrained in my comments here , since last time Mr Caudron complained that I expressed myself too plainly .
What makes me happy is not delivered by the market , but I know one thing very well : competition and the market is better than a monopoly every time - and not least for providing universal services .
Why should it be imposed on any of the operators ?
We do that all the time , and that is why we look so tired and pale !
However , we cannot accept the competition rules which have been presented to us and which you have drawn up , Commissioner , for the following reasons .
The Commission 's role cannot be discussed separately from the underlying political concept .
This has so far been kept secret , no doubt because it states in black and white : if the competition rules enter into force , then 20 to 40 % of jobs across Europe - between 300 000 and 600 000 of them - will be lost .
When I read the Council 's proposals for the Dublin conference I feel like the child I have been describing .
But on what is perhaps the key question for the European Parliament , it now creates a basis on which it will be easy to continue negotiating under the Dutch presidency of the Council .
The Irish presidency of the Council has produced a good structural basis for the further negotiations .
This manipulation makes it clear to every last one of us that Serbia is not a constitutional state .
They still approved of Karadzic when Milosevi dropped him as a result of Western pressure .
I hope we will be able to work as efficiently as the Irish Republic has done .
That is the precondition for the politically , economically and morally necessary enlargement of the European Union .
The unnecessary discussions about powers at European and national level did not produce an iota of progress in terms of the formulation of effective programmes to combat unemployment .
Rather , it concerns the kind of democratic regulation needed to enable market-based mechanisms to function to the common benefit in this area in which public funds are inextricably linked with private goods .
Children are sexually abused , maltreated and commercially exploited .
Furthermore we call for a separate directorate-general or separate Commission department to be set up with responsibility for children 's rights and for Parliament to appoint a children 's ombudsman .
All the demands set out in my report are based on one crucial fact : children have the advantage over other groups requiring protection in society that they have a lease on the future .
The best condition for effective protection of minors is and remains the family .
The Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs has declared itself prepared and undertaken to promote closer cooperation in police and judiciary policy .
In this respect , however , I believe two aspects are particularly important in terms of the direction we follow .
Insolvency proceedings are included , but a distinction is drawn between reconstruction and liquidation proceedings .
After all , a few days ago we heard from the Serbian foreign minister that this region is now fully incorporated in the territory of the present Yugoslavia and that no special status can therefore be envisaged for this oppressed region .
We consider this particularly urgent , especially in Germany but also in Austria , because more and more transfers of undertakings are taking place not within the EU but to Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary .
But that does no service to the employees concerned .
Another aspect that is considered in this mid-term review is the environment ; especially against the background of the WTO negotiations in Singapore I certainly want to congratulate the Commission on its success in this area .
To conclude let me once again declare that we regard it as most important that our amendment on fixing a limit value for radioactivity in water is adopted .
I would be glad if the Member States could act that quickly .
To pollute the rivers first and then to clean them up by the use of technology is quite definitely the wrong road to follow .
We should not on the one hand had save a few costs while on the other allowing a costs to escalate in the health system .
This has nothing to do with debate and everything to do with democracy .
My dear Mr HÃ¤nsch , you have already had your bouquet , before the vote , and despite all the aggravation I would present you with another now , but twice would be too much of a good thing .
We want our vote to become public knowledge , so I would prefer it if we could vote before the end of this week .
It would not be a good thing , however , if this were to be the start of an inward withdrawal by the EU.
What is actually happening with Europol ?
Madam President , in view of the threat posed by organized crime , the European Union 's citizens ultimately measure the Union in terms of whether , and to what extent , it can develop efficient machinery to counter international organized crime .
We must always be mindful of that .
