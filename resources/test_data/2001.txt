The best idea , it seems to me , would be to see what we can arrange on a voluntary basis with our industries , in the form of self-regulation .
The islands of the Pacific and the Caribbean will be in the front line if the situation deteriorates .
Mr President , I gather that the Commissioner says she did not understand my question .
It would be much better to align the economic and monetary policies of the present and future Member States in a totally unforced way , with the Member States themselves working to achieve monetary and exchange-rate stability .
Second , the Heads of Government will shortly be meeting in Florence to plot a course for a common , active European employment policy .
The same applies to decent wages , which can also in turn encourage continuing training and education .
An excellent report was produced on employment , growth and competitiveness which we have been discussing for two years now , but it has not yet been implemented .
The Council is mainly to blame for failing to make adequate progress on its recommendations concerning education and training , greater flexibility on the labour market , new working hours , shorter working hours and above all shifting taxes on labour onto other targets .
Because we could not limit it to currency market transactions , otherwise the speculators would simply turn to other financial transactions such as derivatives .
This is often referred to in the press as the sixth convergence criterion .
Do Mr Waigel 's 'stability pact ' and other similar proposals also imply restrictions on the independence of the Central Bank ?
The first thing we might expect the broad economic guidelines to do is to set a course for achieving adequate growth in the short term .
And by curbing wages in all the Member States , so that there is little growth in internal purchasing power and therefore in intra-European exports ?
There are four translation errors , all stemming from the same problem .
These two are by no means developed and subsidized to the same extent .
I am less enthusiastic about the calls to increase Community price support .
I would just like to ask the Commissioner whether I can conclude from this that social clauses may be included in public invitations to tender , provided that they do not give an advantage to a particular firm , but simply seek to create opportunities for a particular social group which faces difficulties on the labour market ?
This is precisely what I wish to talk about .
The real argument is probably that less noise will mean less engine capacity , which leads me to suspect that the lobby we have been talking to mainly involved 'superbikers ' .
And I would bet a good European motorbike that we win , Commissioner , then we can both ride on it .
We need to have standards that are realistic and likely to gain public support .
Cooperate with the police .
I cannot understand why we have to protect the bikers ' interests , and not the interests of these poor people .
Mr President , the European Parliament can be quite content .
Bikers who make too much noise not only spoil things for others who are out enjoying themselves , they also spoil things for other bikers who behave in a more socially responsible and environmentally-friendly way .
We were therefore totally taken aback when , at the end of last year , the Commission proposed that the import ban should be postponed indefinitely .
Leghold traps are extremely brutal instruments and must be banned .
The Pimenta report is , in my opinion , a good compromise between the various viewpoints .
We therefore feel that measures must be taken which deal with both sectors fairly .
The amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on Agriculture are definitely heading in the right direction .
The first is the risk which looms of a crisis of public confidence in Europe 's ability to safeguard something as essential as public health .
Respect for Community law , and respect for Article 5 of the Treaty , means that a Member State cannot place itself outside the European system of law by deliberately blocking the normal working of the European Union .
This is why the resolution put down by various groups of people from the various political groups is particularly clear and particularly critical .
I sincerely trust that the Florence Council will not degenerate into squabbles over mad cow disease , but that it will produce a sign of hope that social dialogue , the originality of your proposal , of your pact of confidence , will prevail over squabbles which threaten to damage public confidence in the European idea .
I approve of the proposal which has now been put forward .
We want more openness and transparency .
Madam President , I understand quite well the political reasons behind this request of the Socialist Group .
Humanitarian aid is given without political strings attached and aid for reconstruction does have political strings .
There are some 300 000 of them and we hear that they are increasingly forming gangs and thus creating a new danger .
Is there any truth in the rumour that Mr Bildt too will be resigning at the end of the year ?
We are already hearing that some people , namely foreign journalists , are experiencing problems , are being harassed and hampered in their work .
On top of that the Security Council decided yesterday to lift the arms embargo , thereby placing the Americans on the ground in IFOR in a very ambiguous position , as peace-keepers in IFOR on the one hand and , on the other hand , as the biggest supplier of arms to the Federation of Bosnia-Hercegovina
