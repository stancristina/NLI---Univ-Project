Their value to the EU is disproportionate to the costs entailed in current integration .
We have also seen how both unions and employers have conducted successful campaigns outside the Economic and Social Committee .
What is more , it would be advantageous to obtain responses from organisations and parties that are not necessarily completely dependent on the EU budget .
It began with changes in the United Kingdom , including legislation on economic issues and the abolition of the guild system .
The idea that there might today exist unusually wise people who know in detail what measures European countries should take in order to help Europe develop into a dynamic knowledge-based region is quite wrong .
We should occupy ourselves with proper issues in the European Union .     Mr President , I shall use this brief minute to concentrate on an amendment by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in which we welcome the proposal by the Heads of Government of six countries that a European pact for equality between women and men be set up .
The objectives in terms of child care and of being able to combine gainful employment and parenthood are particularly important .     Mr President , when we discuss the Lisbon process , we can see how different countries are succeeding with it to greater or lesser degrees .
Those countries that have implemented reforms and changes are coping that much better with globalisation and managing to be that much more competitive .
The Commission ’s primary and overarching task is to combat the new protectionism we see developing among governments and politicians in Europe .
Europe has fantastic potential , and where we have implemented reforms we have been successful .
It must be the results that count , and not the objectives .
It is in both our democratic and economic interests to do so .     We are highly critical of the EU’s destructive fisheries agreements with third countries and thus regret the fact that the EU is choosing to conclude fisheries agreements with new countries .
According to one of Parliament’s opinions , the fishing agreement at issue may , moreover , have harmful environmental consequences .
Those EU Member States whose vessels operate in third countries ’ waters should be liable for the costs of the agreements .
It is incredibly important for people arrested in connection with the European arrest warrant to be guaranteed legal aid and help in the form of translation and interpretation .
The Member States have clearly shown that they wish to retain parts of the traditional extradition system .
Few measures that can be taken against an individual are as far-reaching in their effects as legal proceedings or the requirement to serve a sentence .
However , we take the view that the resolution should extend to include all prostitution .
Above all , however , there are clear links between a woman choosing to prostitute herself and previous physical , psychological and/or sexual abuse .     In the report on restructuring and employment , the rapporteur , Mr Cottigny , adopts the same unfortunate attitude also present in the report on relocation in the context of regional development , which we voted on yesterday .
We voted against such economic protectionism yesterday and are doing the same today .
We support the demand for closer dialogue between the social partners where these issues are concerned , but we can counter the harmful effects of restructuring and relocation in ways other than that of preventing the private sector from developing .
The June List’s basic attitude is that the consequences of relocation and restructuring are a matter for the individual nations .
No matter what political views are taken in relation to the aforesaid issues , they are issues to be dealt with by the individual nations .
This fund would involve direct payments to individuals and be the start of a process whereby the EU would assume power over social policy , which would be an unfortunate development .
Social integration and poverty are , however , issues that must be dealt with nationally or through voluntary cooperation between the governments of the Member States .
We are opposed to the devising of a statute for Members ’ assistants , who would then be in danger of living under quite different conditions than the people with whom they have to work closely in the constituencies .
The report makes no mention of any particular sum by way of compensation .
We disapprove of further budgetary expenditure within the EU and have chosen to vote against this report in its entirety .     In this resolution , the European Parliament enters into areas that it is for the parliaments of the Member States to attend to in order to achieve the agreed European targets concerning increased growth and employment .
Paragraph 3 of the resolution states that the EU’s budget must be increased if the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are to be achieved .
Rather , they should have scope themselves for taking care of what is required by the Lisbon Strategy .
Be assured that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is with you on this .
The various initiatives for getting the countries to cooperate with each other and with ourselves are excellent .
At the same time , we are also talking about different countries with different traditions , different histories and different degrees of development .
With regard to the death of Slobodan Milošević , we are talking here about an odious dictator , responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and a large part of the tragedy that has taken place .
The unification of East and West in May 2004 marked the end of the division of Europe and showed what power there is in the dream of a unified Europe based on democracy , free
