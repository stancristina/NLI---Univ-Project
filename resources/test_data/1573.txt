, we will allow ourselves to be marked against each other , we will allow ourselves to be marked against the rest of the world ' .
That really is a brave decision , because some Member States will clearly find themselves towards the bottom of the league table , which is something nobody likes .
But this is important if we are to have a genuine achievable outcome from this Lisbon Summit rather than perhaps setting off down another road - a road which I know Prime Minister Gut√≠errez does not want to embark on , because he actually wants to see something achieved in the process of the Lisbon Summit .
There are other areas that we must look at .
One of these is the challenge of creating an e-Europe which involves all its citizens and does not leave anybody on the wayside .
Another is the process of actually having a genuine single market - which we still do not yet have - and skills training that will be the key to delivering that innovative and knowledge-driven society .
There are tough choices , but once again in the gallery here tonight , I would like those people listening to this debate to take away with them the belief that we are going to actually have a society based on full employment , that the road to Lisbon will be the end of our journey , and that some concrete results will actually come out of it .
I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area .
Who could challenge such an ambition ?
I have to say , however , that dynamism and entrepreneurship as well as social cohesion are a very ambitious target , not to mention the creative tension between those two objectives .
I hope that we will achieve them , but I sound a warning note .
I note another ambitious objective of playing a proactive role in organising cyberspace .
I cannot help thinking this is more a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted !
I welcome the emphasis on bolstering research and development in Europe , on developing content industries and on speeding up broad-band networks with all that is involved as part of working towards a knowledge society .
Actually , I would prefer to call it an information economy because it is the economy aspect which is the most important .
We live in the time of IDEA - the Internet digital electronic age .
That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side , the electronic side , of life .
But I welcome the fact that this summit is aiming also at a wider emphasis on reforms of our economies in Europe to improve competitiveness and innovation .
That must be right .
We cannot just focus on the new economy .
We must pay attention to the old .
I look forward to hearing more detail about the European Charter for micro-enterprises - that should be very interesting when it comes forward .
One of the priorities which has been identified under the Cardiff process is to improve the sensitivity of the financial markets to the value of intangible investments and investments in knowledge .
That has been achieved possibly beyond the wildest dreams of people a few months ago .
It can be seen in the phenomenal growth in the stock markets of Europe in the value of dot.com companies and just recently in the major changes in the composition of the FTSE 100 index in London .
I cannot help thinking however that although these values have gone sky high and we may expect the bubble to burst , nevertheless the underlying structural change in our economies is here to stay .
Mr President , along with my colleagues , I would like to welcome the very clear document that the Portuguese Presidency has given us today .
I want to emphasise what I believe is the real challenge which will face you and your colleagues when you sit down at the end of this month to discuss the presidency 's proposal : namely how to change our whole attitude and thinking about entrepreneurship , about encouraging people to go out and start the new businesses that we now acknowledge are the engines of the new economy .
It is sad for Europe that it has actually needed the stimulus of the "knowledge economy " to realise what has been clear for the last decade or more , that our economy is not adequately geared towards encouraging those small entrepreneurs to come into the market , to take the risk to set up new businesses .
But it is not just the risk-takers who need to be encouraged .
It is everybody who is in a job working in an organisation .
In the new economy we want to give those people the opportunities to start businesses themselves ; to go and work for the new growing businesses ; to have more control over their working lives ; to truly achieve their potential .
Think how many people are working in large companies , not using all their skills , trapped in large organisations , worried about moving because they cannot take their pensions with them , concerned not least about unemployment .
One of the keys to mobilising this type of risk-taking is to move towards such full employment that people feel they can take that personal risk .
However , I would conclude by asking : which is going to come first ?
Can we really achieve that full employment without unleashing that entrepreneurial talent ?
If we wait for that to happen , I fear the great objectives you have set before us will not be achieved .
Mr President , every day five million items of solid waste are thrown overboard from ships .
