Mr President , my point was to highlight the problem in relation to the European chocolate industry .
Did you follow the debate organised by the International Cocoa Council , the European Cocoa Council , the British trades union in the chocolate industry and the Belgian organisation Caobisco , Commissioner ?
Thank you for your reply , Commissioner .
I think that this is where the Commission needs a more joined-up position .
I imagine that , over and above what you said , the question of taxation and the question of social security also play a very important part in reducing the gap between poverty and wealth , to put it one way .
This directive introduced a general framework for any indirect discrimination , including on the grounds of religion or belief . Ã‰n particular , Article 4( 2 ) deals specifically with churches and other public or private organisations based on religion or belief .
I assume that the question raised by Mr Alavanos , especially as regards statistics , refers to the actuarial study commissioned by the Greek government and not to statistics provided for the purposes of the institutional bodies of the European Commission .
According to the Commission ' s information , the purpose of this study was to broaden the fiscal prospects of the insurance funds and , eventually , to identify the changes needed in order to safeguard their fiscal viability .
The Commission is not , therefore , in a position to check if the data used by this firm is correct or to check the methodology used in order to conduct the study .
Your third question concerns the modernisation of the public administration , especially the insurance funds , under the Kleisthenis programme .
This programme was due to be completed in 2001 but has been extended to 2002 .
If possible , could she perhaps be more specific on the forecasts and the specific funds incorporated into the third Community Support Framework ?
I cannot make any comment on commitments relating to the European Operational Programme for the other individual funds .
When we talk of corporate social responsibility and of new action , we are talking about greater investment in human resources , in the environment , in the social environment and in the immediate vicinity by which , of course , we mean over and above their obligations under the law .
I should like to highlight two basic aspects of the Green Paper .
One of the questions which will be raised in the public debate triggered by the Green Paper in June will be how we can mobilise international monitors , independent international bodies , in conjunction with government organisations and with what specifications , so that we have an objective assessment at international level to which to refer .
The existing corporate social responsibility network is also made up of large companies .
As Mrs Theorin says in her question , the issue of unequal pay between men and women in the European Union is still a major problem , despite long-standing national and Community legislation and case law .
May I remind you that , at the Stockholm Council this year , the Commission undertook to develop indicators so as to ensure that there would be no difference between men and women due to unequal treatment .
The policy applied in Sweden on the question of equal pay is , I think , both pioneering and effective , because it is the only country which has managed to minimise the wage differential .
Madam President , on Monday I had the pleasure of reporting the release to the House of Mr Tsiakourmas , who was kidnapped by Turkish-Cypriot kidnappers and released following a resolution by Parliament calling for his release .
I said that I hoped that this might be the beginning of a change in Turkey 's behaviour , with the representatives of the Turkish-Cypriot community abandoning violence and provocation so that we can move towards reconciliation .
It is the first time I have heard that drink driving is not just a crime but the sort of a crime which can only be punished by violating borders .
The rapporteur is therefore quite right to raise these major issues .
In other words , trivial , anodyne , fragmentary proposals which , at best , are ingenuous , in that they are a long way from dealing with a problem which claims the health and lives of millions of minors .
As far as the present situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned , we have a clash of two political philosophies : the political philosophy expounded by the Representative of the Council , whereby two different nations live within the same borders , cooperate and live in friendship , and the philosophy which says that the rights of the Albanian nation can only be secured by armed struggle and bloodshed .
Unless we do these things , the whole civilised approach argued by the Council representative - which of course we want - will be a waste of time .
Mr President , I make no judgment either of the procedure for or the outcome of this decision .
It is in this sense that I protest because my democratic rights have been undermined .
I refer here in particular to my own country , Greece .
We also call for the European Parliament , the social partners and other agencies in the civil society to be given an opportunity to help prepare the annual conference on social exclusion .
The rapporteur , Mr Cercas , had to cope with pressure to liberalise and privatise the insurance system , alongside other maximalist positions wanting to undermine a whole series of new data .
The second results from the fact that , in the end , the progressive line has prevailed .
I would point
