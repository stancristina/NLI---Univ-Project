, on an ordinary Thursday afternoon , we are to do a bit of quick shopping for the evening meal .
It was not possible to implement this because the Member States invoked legal and constitutional reasons why it should not be .
As a Liberal , I perhaps eventually realised that it is probably not the state’s and the authorities ’ task to say that the one producer is good and the other bad .
The funding of duties is a very controversial issue – not between the Commission , the Council and myself but within Parliament .
The same basic conditions do not apply from Portugal to Finland or from Ireland to Hungary .
It is important for us in the European Parliament to protect the small producers of unusual products that are the essence of Europe’s cultural heritage in the area of food .
Finally , I wish again to extend my many thanks to the Commission and the Council and , above all , to the Italian and Irish Presidencies .
I would ask the Commission to reply to the European Ombudsman , for matters are as Mr MacCormick described .
In particular , extending the regulations to include patents would be a mistake .
The legal basis can also be questioned , since the procedure is now at issue .
We believe that , if such large alterations are to be made to legislation and thus to Swedish legal tradition , the changes should be well thought through and well worked out , and not arrived at in a hurry as these have been .
We interpret the Council decision as saying that drug trafficking is prohibited , and we therefore believe that ‘coffee shops ’ should not exist within the EU.     At present , drugs policy is not harmonised within the EU.
Even what are termed party drugs , that is to say the most dangerous synthetic drugs of all , are becoming more widespread .
The possession and use of drugs must therefore remain criminal offences .
The wrong signals are still being sent out to the young people of Europe when anyone can buy five grams of cannabis at a so-called coffee shop .
We do not wish to legalise , we do not wish to liberalise and we have not given up the dream of zero tolerance for drugs .     We are well disposed towards an agency for better coordination and cooperation in the area of border controls .
We do not , however , think that issues concerning the ways in which welfare is to be organised should be decided at EU level .
It must be possible for both parents to combine working life with responsibility for their family .
We agree with that and have therefore chosen to vote against the report as a whole .     I have actively supported the fact that , in paragraph 3 , the European Parliament comes out in favour of the Christian Democratic idea ‘that family policy should create preconditions to enable parents to spend more time with their children’ .
The Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats succeeded in voting down Recital G ( by 321 votes with 169 in favour and 21 abstentions ) and , thus , the attempt to create a new and diffuse definition of what constitutes a family , something that is definitely not a task for the EU.
They promised to direct their efforts to ensuring that these issues remained areas in which strictly national legislation applied , without the involvement of the EU.
Were that to happen , it would be to the detriment of Swedes and be in danger of conflicting with Swedish custom and tradition .
The report also focuses helpfully upon the serious health problems present in the developing countries , where EU aid policy has an important role .     Together with the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I have voted against the report as a whole .
We demanded clarification of this paragraph by means of Amendment No 20 , adding the words ‘in the countries where this is legal’ .
This undermines confidence in aid work , creates conflicts and clashes of culture , religion and values and leaves a bad taste of self-styled European superiority in the mouth .     Mr President , I was not recorded as present in yesterday’s Minutes .
A further four Britons still in Guantánamo Bay will not be released , at least not yet .
The Swedish detainee , Mehdi Ghezali , is also still there , with no immediate prospect of being released .
Here we are today , more than two years later , and this is as far as we have got .
The officials from Sweden’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs who have been able to visit Mehdi Ghezali are not allowed to tell his family how he is .
I think that the old saying , ‘It takes two to tango ’ is apposite in this case .
We cannot just have debates at regular intervals about them .
It is necessary to work across all frontiers in order to link cause with effect , and that is not easy .
Several of the conferences we have had in order to prepare our action plan have taken place in the new Member States .
It is therefore incredibly important to follow matters up and ensure that this happens , so that no hunting takes place that infringes the existing directives designed to protect wild birds , animals and various other creatures .     – Mr President , there are now only fifty days remaining of the long journey that began with the scenes of joy on 9 November 1989 under the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin .
