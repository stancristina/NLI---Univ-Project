The proposal which Ritt Bjerregaard has put forward represents , in fact , a retrograde step and contains , disastrously , no concrete political undertakings in respect of Europe &#x02BC ;s environment .
Objectives and resources in the agricultural policy must accord with the direction of the environmental policy , for us to be able to achieve results and press on towards sustainable development .
This is thus an appropriate opportunity to point the EU at a goal after the year 2000 .
The Toronto conference &#x02BC ;s proposals in 1987 have had a major political influence .
This , in my view , is a tough target , but it should be possible to achieve it .
This makes the objective even more unrealistic .
We can , on the other hand , make considerable efforts to phase out nuclear power in Eastern and Central Europe .
Am I to understand that these are not accepted ?
Mr President , this report does not have any budgetary implications for any of the major areas within the Community , except for one of the most important .
An environmental issue often begins its life by being picked up by the environmental organisations and then , much later on in the proceedings , implemented by means of legislative proposals or other decrees .
This is also true of the contributions to environmental organisations .
Clearly , nations themselves must bear a significant responsibility , but no nation can solve the environmental problems by itself .
At present the budget has not yet been finally adopted ; it will be subject to a second debate and the Council will very soon have its say .
When criticism was levelled some 10-15 years ago by some of us , it was regarded as deceitful , anti-Semitic propaganda .
For making this statement , Edward Said has been punished by having his books banned in the Palestinian-controlled area , which itself testifies to the fact that his fears are not simply a figment of his imagination .
That is why we , the Greens , have maintained that it is important that , in connection with the statements made and the attitudes assumed in respect of the peace process , we also direct a justified criticism at the Palestinian administration &#x02BC ;s contravention of human rights and freedom of expression which are cited by Amnesty , Reporters sans fronti√®res , reliable journalists and by many others .
It is therefore pleasing that the other parties have also now come up with these demands .
Mr President , this is not the first time that the question of human rights and Turkey has come up for discussion .
There were those who voted in favour .
If one party does not keep to an agreement , is it not natural for the other party to cancel the agreement , since the agreement concerns mutual obligations ?
Information and diplomacy used to be a good form of action in such a situation , but do not appear to help where Belarus is concerned .
I think that the Council should have made clear its dissatisfaction earlier .
The reason for my question is that I have found that in many countries in Europe , alcohol is dealt with primarily as a matter for the internal market , just like any other goods .
This has been achieved via high tax pressure , by preventing young people from using alcohol and by means of strict import controls .
It also finances the investments in the health care sector which are necessary as a result of damage caused by alcohol .
I come back again to my previous question , since it is correct as the President says , that this concerns the internal market and derogations .
But why should there just be an temporary derogation ?
Why is that not possible , in the Council&#x02BC ;s view ?
Does the Council of Ministers share the view that it is this decision process which is applicable ?
But we are still concerned about a government which bases its power on a blatant electoral fraud in ordinary parliamentary elections .
Intervening in trade policy to bring about changes in what can be broadly defined as social clauses is , in my view , the wrong way to go , for the same reason given by the Council representative in his answer on Albania , namely that " sanctions are against people . '
The report contains clear demands for a concrete , humane asylum procedure which ensures legal certainty .
Mr President , the events of recent years have only confirmed what many have long maintained , namely that without harmonisation the individual countries will simply try to underbid one another where refugee policies are concerned .
At the same time I am forced to conclude that the energy policy pursued by the EU , or to be more precise the research policy pursued by the EU , unfortunately does not emphasise renewable sources of energy in the same way as the Scapagnini report for example .
Action is also needed .
I therefore hope that the Commission will include much more about renewable energy sources in the Fifth Framework Programme of Research .
The experts in this field say that the technology exists - it is the political will that is lacking .
Nuclear energy and fossil fuels do not meet these requirements and must gradually be phased out as forms of energy .
The use of certain EU funds to build new reactors in Ukraine must therefore be rejected .
The Commission must also produce immediate proposals on how carbon dioxide emissions are to be reduced .
When such expressions are used in respect of the situation in the former Yugoslavia it does far more harm than good .
If it is to be completely successful and able as a result to serve as a model for
