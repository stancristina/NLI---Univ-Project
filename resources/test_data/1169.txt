They completely rule out the possibility of restricting tobacco advertising in the press and on the radio .
Hopefully , too , the rapporteur will return to his original position and reject these amendments , which were accepted as compromises by the Committee on Legal Affairs , as they are not compromises at all : they just make this directive utterly pointless .
It does seem strange that we appear to be finding excuses for how we might continue advertising at European level to make this product , as wretched as it is in terms of public health , more tempting for people .
On the other hand , this directive is being dealt with under the Hughes procedure with the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , and the Commission proposal was unanimously supported by that committee , so we might say that , as a result , the majority strongly back the Commission proposal .
These unfortunate decisions , which the Committee on Legal Affairs has arrived at , can certainly then be amended in the vote on Wednesday .
Enron and similar finance-sector scandals shook the confidence of investors and market operators in the stability of financial conglomerates on both sides of the Atlantic .
European legislation thus also has an obvious impact on how financial conglomerates operate in third countries , and vice versa .
We still have much work to do to make the mutual recognition of systems possible and stop a jungle of multiple regulatory systems from spreading .
In return , companies in North America must make their views known with regard to how EU legislation affects them .
The final outcome will hardly satisfy all parties , but we can at least be satisfied that the debate on both sides of the Atlantic has been conducted openly .
It is a positive sign that the Council accepted almost all Parliament 's amendments at first reading .
I am prepared to accept this proposal and I shall support the rapporteur provided that the provisions of the directive can be assessed regularly in terms of their viability and revised if need be .
Our new neighbours are also likely to apply for membership and enlargement will continue .
It is very important for us all that our external border is both open and secure .
We also have to level out the economic and social differences that exist between the Member States and our neighbouring countries .
This morning some Members of the European Parliament were trying to lecture Members of Parliament of the new Member States , saying they must be prepared to give up their own country 's right of self-determination and accept that the Union will develop into a supranational federation .
The most important task of enlargement the Union has to face is to ensure that never again do European nations submit to the aspirations of power-hungry dictators or are driven to hatred for one another .
It is just as crucial to strengthen our common democratic structures at the same time as enlargement takes place .
Until now we have spoken all too little about how the EU itself will benefit from enlargement .
Cultural and linguistic diversity is a great source of wealth and offers enormous potential .
We must remember that viable labour relations are an essential part of the Union 's activity .
I hope that my neighbouring country , which has been very successful in the financial and technology sectors , can sort this problem out too .
I would , however , like to raise a matter that President Prodi mentioned today .
On the previous occasion the European Union acquired the Northern Dimension in addition to the western and southern dimensions that already existed .
The northern and eastern dimensions meet in the Baltic Sea area .
Furthermore , future regional and structural policy must make transboundary cooperation and cooperation on both the old and the new borders possible .
Turkey has improved its human rights situation and its legal praxis in a way that is worthy of our respect .
With enlargement , the Internal Market , which is the EU 's core mechanism , will grow larger , which will improve the EU 's chances of success in the global markets .
I agree with the rapporteur , Mr Brok , that there is still a lot of work ahead of us .
It is difficult to implement economic structural reforms at times but we have to keep to the commitments that have been made .
We have to ensure in particular that the future Member States have the administrative and legal capacity for operating as part of the Internal Market .
This means that the work cannot stop with Copenhagen .
The European Parliament will also have to monitor the situation and ensure that the present Member States , the Commission and the future Member States each play their part in completing the enlargement process .
At present we seem to have all our attention on enlargement , but we must fight tooth and nail to hold on to the Lisbon objectives .
We have to focus our attention on the applicant countries ' ability to implement the Lisbon objectives .
In the old Member States too it is necessary to give attention to the implementation of EU legislation .
The liberalisation process must be speeded up substantially in the electricity , gas , telecommunications and transport sectors .
Labour costs are high while at the same time there is considerable unemployment in Europe .
Now too conditions in Russia are stabilising , except with regard to certain aspects , which I shall return to .
This being the case , we are in favour of establishing a Common European Economic Space .
The Union has said Russia is a normal market economy .
Russia will lose
