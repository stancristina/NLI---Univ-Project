How often have we heard it said that Europe was a single territory ?
We are against referral back to committee , because we think it is high time that Parliament took a stand and made its position clear to the Council and Commission .
Madam President , freedom to travel is probably the most important element in creating the internal market as an area without internal frontiers .
The decisions taken in 1990 should have been implemented by December 1991 , and you know what has happened up to now .
If you had come clean about it , we would not have needed a committee of inquiry .
In my view , the issue has been dealt with .
We cannot allow that .
And , by no means least , there is the idea - which has become self-evident - that today , transport policy can simply no longer be drawn up without taking the environment into account .
The Council was fundamentally opposed to such a list .
Clearly , the construction of the trans-European transport networks is an essential precondition for the further development of the Union .
Following the Council 's display of ignorance and arrogance , it must be made clear that we shall continue to pursue our aims with all means available .
As previous speakers have already explained , the Council simply said that we should refer to the Essen list .
As a Member of the European Parliament , I am certainly not happy with the way in which the Council acted .
The decision on the trans-European networks can be a major step towards the further development of the Union .
Parliament will no longer allow itself to be deprived of the democratic rights conferred on it by the Maastricht Treaty .
The European Parliament should call for a ban on any type of consumptive embryo research , as well as for more precise rules on embryo protection in the case of in vitro fertilization .
Modification of the germ cell line is not a question of therapy but of the breeding of humans , and under no circumstances can we accept the vision of humanity which underlies this .
That also applies with regard to persons who are incapable of giving consent .
I should now like to ask you what form the Commission believes the treatment of social issues at the WTO Conference in Singapore might take , and whether the Commission intends to advocate the establishment of minimum social standards - for example on the question of child labour - within the framework of the WTO agreement .
I should like to make two comments on the honourable Member 's remarks .
I hope that we can achieve such a settlement in the near future .
We are currently engaged in such discussions with the Greek Government .
In practice , however , I doubt that the majority of Member States would allow structural policies to be agreed between the Commission and the regional or local authorities alone .
For 1995 , those values were - as a ratio of public deficit to GDP - 10.7 % for Greece , 5.8 % for Portugal and 5.9 % for Spain .
Mr Evans , you will be aware that the Commission 's programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the border regions of Ireland is geared to rapid help and support for the peace process .
Some people have also said that we could save ourselves a great deal of time and unnecessary work , since the convention will , in any event , have no legal force .
There are various points in the Council of Europe 's draft Bioethics Convention where the possibility is not entirely ruled out that such terrible things might be repeated , and Mr Pelttari has not come down on these points heavily enough .
There will then be a good chance that the Bioethics Convention produced will be one to which the European Union is prepared to accede later .
Would it not be better for the wording of the convention to be more liberal , and to have implementing provisions which go into possible abuses in detail , rather than for the convention alone to be formulated so inflexibly ?
We also hope that over the coming weeks and months in Austria and Finland - where elections are also to be held - and indeed throughout the Union , people will judge the work done by Members of the House not just on financial criteria , but also on other issues , such as the central question of who best represents their interests .
So what we need to do is to carry on with the positive side of the ECSC while at the same time making it more open and less privileged .
We are going to have to compete more with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , and this is why it is vital that we should not go back to needing state aid to compensate for poor competitiveness .
I cannot give you any further details of the transition from the ECSC Treaty to the general rules .
The Community measures already adopted and others still in the pipeline will require considerable amounts of information to be exchanged between individuals , economic operators and public administrations , and work is already being done on this .
We really need structures which are specifically able to provide support for employment .
At the same time , I think we have to take another look at Annex I , section 7 , which is simply a list of technical numerical values .
This conflicts with other provisions in the directive and with the Council decision on the conformity assessment procedure , which provides for the use of quality assurance systems as an alternative to such procedures .
