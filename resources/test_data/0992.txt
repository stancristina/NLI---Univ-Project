why a high level of education and training is vital when it comes to exploiting the use of the aid given to the applicant countries .
The partial decentralisation of administration to the applicant countries under the supervision of the Commission is also a step in the right direction .
Already at this stage of the initial screening and negotiation process it has become clear that there is a need for investment under the PHARE programme in all countries concerned , particularly for 'institution building ' in order to implement Community law and modernise the legal systems .
The applicant countries must themselves finance most of the changes required .
Via this northern dimension cooperation networks could be established , for example , in the areas of environmental protection and nuclear safety with the Baltic States , and we would get Russia involved in large-scale regional security projects .
I also believe it is now essential to ensure that this more transparent policy is put into practice .
The poorest regions must be included in the group receiving the highest amounts of aid , that is to say the under-75 %-GNP regions , as well as the current northern and sparsely populated Objective 6 regions , as already agreed in the accession negotiations .
Unemployment and mass migration from the countryside demonstrate the need for development aid measures .
We have thus shown ourselves to be unanimous in our wishes here .
Now we should also be able to agree unanimously that once the Council has finalised its decisions by the Brussels summit in March , Parliament will then be able to take part fully in the decision-making process .
The Commission communication on the Agenda 2000 document has provided a very good and solid basis for regional and structural policy reform .
The Commission 's proposal is founded on the principles of the Treaty of Amsterdam , which took account of the fact that important environmental matters have gained greater prominence in the eyes of our citizens .
What is of most importance is that the environmental authorities play a full role in the selection and implementation of regional projects .
Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs JÃ¶ns for her splendid work .
I would like to raise three points in particular relating to the proposal by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
Secondly , we need action to promote the status of women , and thirdly , we need to address the possible role of the social funds in implementing Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam on non-discrimination .
It is vitally important , as without resources the article on non-discrimination might not have any real impact .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , Agenda 2000 aims to facilitate the eastward enlargement of the EU and to prepare for the next WTO talks .
The Agenda 2000 timetable was decided at the Edinburgh summit , and the ELDR Group is pressing ahead with the agreement of reforms laid down in the timetable .
The global economic situation has got worse and so the plan for the funding of enlargement has altered .
The co-funding of environmental aid is also something already happening .
The Agenda 2000 reform , therefore , should have given more weight to the needs of the worse-off regions , as was called for in the Luxembourg resolution .
The share of direct aid in the income structure for the Finnish farmer has now grown too large .
Agenda 2000 is only exacerbating the situation .
The provisions on forestry aid in the Agenda 2000 reforms are worded very unclearly , and it is thus difficult to discover what they mean , for example , in terms of funding .
Madam President , although I am speaking last , I do not think I am speaking about anything trivial if I take up the points made on this issue by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
In practice this is not actually being implemented very successfully .
There is no desire to make joint decisions , but this is vital if we are to be able to change tack .
Agriculture , as is well known , is one of the worst polluters of soil and water .
As for future agricultural policy in the European Union , the issues have been gone over at many summit meetings .
Mr President , Russia has made an abrupt switch from communism to capitalism .
The first condition of financial aid must be that it no longer goes to those engaged in shady dealings .
I do not believe that aid should be given via a commercial chain and all at once , but gradually and through social organisations .
We lost money the last time through using commercial networks of distribution .
There is even a TV programme called VID , which specialises in helping people .
Mr President , we have followed the work here in Parliament of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and we have noted that its attitude as expressed in Hedy d'Ancona 's report is very liberal .
I would like to turn your attention , however , to the fact that the rapporteur has recommended cooperation with non-member countries , but only with regard to central and eastern European countries .
A great deal of traffic , some of it in transit , enters the European Union area from Russia .
I would hope that the rapporteur takes this into account next time .
Mr President , Mr Pirker 's report now under discussion touches on a very timely subject , that of drugs .
Presumably only a small proportion of drugs is ever seized .
The second pillar of the EU , cooperation in internal and legal affairs , owes its greatest justification perhaps to the fight against drugs .
