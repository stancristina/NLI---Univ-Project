to tobacco growers is paid for by the EU ?
No one has a comprehensive view of the situation : aid is paid out to tobacco growers while , at the same time , hospitals are having to deal with the damage caused by tobacco and building up substantial hospital bills as a result .
This is not a matter of impoverishing rural areas .
The Agriculture Committee , in my view , has only considered the tobacco growers and the agricultural sector , while the health aspects , as has already been pointed out by the Environment Committee , are conspicuous by their absence .
In my opinion , these proposals still do not address long term policy in this sector .
After all , the roots of the agricultural policy lie in supplying food to the European Union ; the tobacco sector definitely does not fall within this objective .
What makes this even worse is that some of the most evil of the suspected perpetrators are still at large and are thus still able to exercise political influence in their countries .
This is also the only chance that the survivors have of acknowledging those who were exposed to the war 's most manifestly gruesome atrocities .
If the governments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina continue to ignore their commitments under Dayton , the SFOR forces must be given the task and the necessary power to arrest the suspects , using force if necessary , and bring them to trial .
But a repulsive form of punishment is still applied in the world 's greatest democracy .
But it does lead to a brutalising of society .
We think that executions cast a shadow over President Clinton .
The O'Dell case is one that we find particularly disturbing .
It is possible to say that the EU has totally failed in its economic strategy which has been narrowly directed and focused on the fight against inflation and on price stability .
Deregulation and demands for flexibility and adjustment must not be allowed to lead to deregulation of employee rights and of agreements arrived at as a result of mutual understanding and collective wage agreements .
It is possible that 5-10 million new jobs could be created in EU countries , depending on the number of hours cut from the working week .
The dialogue must , first of all , be held with the labour market partners , at a national level and , of course , at European level as well .
This is excellent .
Good !
A structure is required which accepts the forces of change and which allows for individual and local solutions .
It is the Member States which are responsible for making checks to ensure that there is no fraud .
It is also important that we remind the Member States of this procedure of proceeding , so that we do not have to read about various fraudulent dealings in the newspapers .
How , for example , will the Structural Funds affect the environmental objectives which we , ourselves , have set up in the EU and confirmed in the European Parliament ?
The bureaucracy frightens people away and should be amended in the not too distant future .
It is also important that the Member States make a better attempt to integrate EEC law when drafting national competition legislation .
During the period of Conservative government 1991-1994 , an almost identical copy of the EEC 's competition legislation was introduced in Sweden , with the addition of a group exemption for large chains .
Vertical agreements often take on the character of long term co-operation for management , finance and training so they can be a good , almost necessary support for many new entrepreneurs who otherwise would not have been able to start their own companies .
The modernised legislation - because we are not talking about anything new here , just a review of something which has , for the most part , been very successful for a long time - must be transparent and aim to bring about neutrality in competition , legal security and also provide for continued development and greater effectiveness in distribution .
Mr President , this is a positive communication from the Commission which highlights to the importance of culture for employment , regional development and , of course , trade between regions and nations , as well as for ensuring that the structural funds are used in a better way than today to support the cultural sector .
Another important point is that employment should be widespread and evenly distributed across the various regions of a country .
There are great opportunities here to support local and regional cultural life by providing assistance and by developing various cultural activities and cultural institutions which can create both a better cultural exchange and job opportunities which are well distributed over regions and countries .
We make these demands because the old monopolies are failing to live up to the demand for a wellfunctioning service which we are all entitled to make .
If the decision which the European Parliament took at first reading a little over a year ago had been the final position , then the countries which had carried out the necessary deregulation and so created alternatives to and competition for the old postal monopolies would presumably have been forced to re-regulate at least parts of the post office 's activities .
It would have been quite unreasonable if we had made such a decision .
I want to thank Commissioner Bangemann for that .
This means that there is now a lot of choice , and many new companies have created many new job opportunities .
Mr President , the report by my Swedish colleague , Mrs Eriksson , which we are now debating concerns a fundamental problem
