of ensuring that Structural Funds do not just merely , as it were , replace public spending otherwise earmarked for those areas that are lagging behind .
I am rather sorry that the Regional Policy Committee did not incorporate that in the report themselves , but there it is .
There are a number of questions that I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to take back to Commissioner Barnier .
I appreciate that he is the Commissioner in office today but he may not be in a position to respond to these points himself .
However , these are points that I seek to put in the context of certainly the area that I represent and I daresay they are points that would be supported by Jillian Evans on behalf of her party .
What progress is being made in relation to the approval of the programming documents within the Commission ?
Will the Commissioner take the step in terms of transparency of publishing at an appropriate time the correspondence that has taken place between the Commission and the National Assembly ?
We were assured , I am bound to say by a rather complacent Economic Secretary , who has now become the First Secretary , that all matters were proceeding in an orderly fashion .
Yet we hear from remarks that are made from time to time by the Commission that there are real problems and we find it difficult to do our job within this Parliament without that degree of transparency .
So , will the Commission undertake to make that information available to all Members of the European Parliament ?
Will they undertake to keep us informed in relation to these matters ?
Will they undertake to challenge Member State Governments in relation to the maps that have been drawn up in relation to Objective 2 where also there has been quite clear evidence of jerrymandering also .
The additionality issue is an important one , but I must say it is not the only one which gives much concern to many Members of this European Parliament .
Mr President , I should just like to touch on a couple of points that Mr Evans raised .
First of all , I acknowledge that there is difficulty in the Midlands with the Rover Group .
I would not like to make political capital out of it .
There are too many jobs at stake .
Secondly , he also mentioned their by-election .
I congratulate his party in securing a victory in this by-election .
But , unlike him , I have been in Ayr for the last three weeks , on the doorstep.
I can tell you that additionality was never raised once .
I turn to the question at hand .
I thank the Nationalists for having raised this .
It is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the Structural Funds .
But I suspect there is a deeper plot here .
What are they actually trying to achieve ?
I listened to Ms Evans .
Basically , what I took from her contribution is that she wants to redefine the Structural Funds regulations .
I would remind people in this Parliament that it was not so long ago that this Parliament passed , by the assent procedure , the rules and regulations governing the Structural Funds , including Article 11 , which defines additionality .
Is it therefore Parliament 's role now to change that ?
We should not change that .
The role of this Parliament is to ensure that the rules are complied with .
That is what we should concentrate on .
I know that Ms Evans , along with one of her colleagues , Dafydd Wigley and a member of the Scottish Nationalist Party , Mr Wilson , went to meet Commissioner Barnier .
I should like to read out the statement made by Commissioner Barnier after that meeting : " I know that there has been a great deal of debate in Scotland and Wales recently about European regional funding .
But I have the impression that this has sometimes confused two separate issues - additionality and cofinancing .
I am not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion among the Nationalists on this .
Additionality , whether or not EU funds are providing additional impact , compared to what would otherwise have happened , can be used as one of the selection criteria by the local programme planners before they decide to approve aid to individual projects .
The Commission , on the other hand , is obliged by the rules to make a global assessment of additionality for the UK as a whole , with the specific aim of ensuring that the European financial aid is additional to , and not a substitute for , national finance .
We have always been satisfied in the past that the national requirements have been met " .
Mr President , it is clear from what the Commissioner has said that the Commission is conscientious in measuring the additionality of structural funding at Member State level , and it was good also to hear his assurances about the various different levels of evaluation that take place .
As the Commission will be aware , however , a number of Member States within the European Union have devolved systems of regional government .
Such regional systems of government are normally financed in whole or in part from central government funds .
It appears to me that , under the present rules , central government can build the EU contribution to structural funding into its calculations for determining regional government budgets .
There appears to be no mechanism , despite what the Commissioner said , for ensuring either of two things : first , that the additionality rule is applied to this calculation , and second , that the amount of EU funding which ultimately reaches individual regions corresponds directly to the amount earmarked for those regions at the planning stage
