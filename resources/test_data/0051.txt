To the same extent as you are reassured , I think , because there is no doubt that the problems of these numerous refugees in Tanzania are severe .
Mr President , I am not going to speak about anything that we are going to debate now , and I apologise for departing from the agenda .
I think these are two entirely distinct debates , which should have taken place at separate times during this Strasbourg part-session , and each one should have been given the importance it deserves .
So , for the time being , the one that does not want it , and I say for the time being , is Morocco , at least on the terms that the European Union is demanding .
We have to recognise the global importance that fishing now has .
Let us therefore make it an active policy , both in fisheries agreements with third countries , adapted to each individual situation , and in the regional fishery organisations , in which we must play a leading role , as we have often said , and let us not resign ourselves to a situation in which the 15 states that today make up the European Union - tomorrow perhaps 20 or 25 - must forever have as much weight as , for instance , Estonia has now .
Let us denounce attempts to extend exclusive economic zones and lead the effective fight against flags of convenience .
But I am not one to blame you .
The Union would like to have fair cooperation with its partners , and now we all realise that we would have gained a lot if the Moroccan Government had responded in time to Community appeals .
The balance that we socialists desire can only be achieved through a fisheries policy based on scientific criteria and adapted to the market , with the suppression of the political discrimination that still persists .
Lastly , I should like to congratulate Mr Varela - and also Mr Cunha - for the excellent report on the challenge of globalisation and the dangers that certain aspects of it pose for the Community fisheries sector .
As for the matter of fisheries and globalisation , it must be recognised that the low level of Community self-sufficiency in fisheries products has encouraged the liberalisation of trade sooner and more fully than in other sectors .
What the media is saying is that if there is agreement , it may even be highly detrimental to the interests of the European Union .
I therefore ask for our amendments to be approved , because far from entering yet again into sterile discussions they reflect this desire for change and the need for careful thinking about the fisheries policy , with our sights set on the future and not the past .
That is why I must again stress that , when there is evident dissatisfaction with the resources policy , the brilliant results of which we have just seen yet again at December ' s Council meeting , with a TAC system that encourages discards , when issues such as relative stability and freedom of access have yet to be resolved , not to mention the matter of bringing the only Community policy that still discriminates on grounds of nationality into line with the Treaties , the Commission cannot seriously propose a draft Green Paper like the one it has drawn up .
Now some of our fishing towns are going to develop their economy partly around and thanks to the drug that Morocco grows and markets and we Europeans consume .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am deeply grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to speak on a matter which I believe , as I am sure you will agree , rightly deserves to be dealt with as a matter of top priority by Parliament .
In dealing with the matters which have given rise to concern in the House , I shall endeavour to do so from the Council ' s point of view .
In time , those symptoms would develop in a similar way , and the outcome would also be similar .
Such openness and transparency must be common to all : they must permeate all the Member States of the European Union , relationships between the Member States of the Union and NATO , and those between NATO and other allies involved in peace-keeping operations in the Balkans .
We have remained in constant contact ever since .
In addition , it was agreed to make all information concerning this incident available to the United Nations Environment Programme .
As the presidency has correctly stated , the next step will be to review the body of scientific material as it becomes available .
I refer for example to the reports submitted by the Committee of the Belgian Federal Nuclear Monitoring Agency .
The fundamental cause underlying this debate is that there was a problem involving failure to respect human rights in Bosnia , which this very House condemned time and again .
We must not forget our starting point .
That was the first time that the fifteen governments of the European Union met with all the governments of the Balkan countries , and that every one of them had been democratically elected .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have absolutely no doubt that we shall all be true to those guiding principles I referred to : responsibility , transparency and honesty .
This is an issue which by its very nature lies within the remit of national governments and we are necessarily therefore dependent on the information provided by the individual governments .
Right now , nobody should have any doubt but that all the countries and all the international organisations are doing their utmost to find a solution to this problem , bringing
