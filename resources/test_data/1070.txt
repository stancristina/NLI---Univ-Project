for the European emigrants living in Venezuela not to be forgotten .
It is not , however , for us to tell the Venezuelans what to do .
This is the fifth or sixth occasion on which Parliament has not followed its Rules of Procedure .
For preventive reasons - the same argument used by Mr Aznar to justify the war against Iraq - the newspaper Egunkaria has been closed down - and I have a copy in my hand - the only daily entirely published in Basque , the language not just of the Basques , but - according to the most prestigious experts - the primitive language of the Europeans .
But he has accused the Civil Guard of torture , which takes us even further back , if that is possible , to the times ? ( The President cut off the speaker )
We clearly need to improve the efficiency of port services , and that is what this initiative intends to do .
In any event , I will refer later , in particular , to some of the amendments which deal with these aspects .
I know this is an issue of great concern to the rapporteur and other Members and furthermore I believe that progress must be made on it .
In this regard , Amendment No 10 , duly modified , with certain important alterations in accordance with the solution we may find , could help us to find that compromise formula .
Those amendments which seriously restrict this approach - since , in various ways , they hinder self-handling operations - restricting them exclusively to seafaring people , cannot be accepted .
The Commission has always shown itself prepared to seek constructive solutions with the European Parliament .
Furthermore , these negotiations have helped us to understand that Parliament must respect the Commission 's exclusive powers of legislative initiative .
We must also forget the idea that liberalisation and lack of safety go hand in hand .
Furthermore , pilotage , mooring services and stowage , given their status as obligatory services , must not be included in the Community Directive , but their regulation must remain in the hands of the respective port authorities , without prejudice to respect for European social conditions .
Secondly , we have an entirely ideological question .
Ladies and gentlemen , our air sector , as was said a moment ago , does not appear to have suffered as a result of introducing competition .
Furthermore , nobody is asking for a reduction in the safety elements .
I will now discuss the second point that has been discussed , which is social dumping .
I would read two things to the honourable Members .
If we were to abide by your fears in relation to liberalisations , Ryanair or Virgin would not be operating , for example , and we would all be living with State monopolies , and I believe that more than one of you makes use of Ryanair and Virgin .
On the contrary , we are talking about guaranteeing social standards and requirements relating to employment , and of regular personnel , not temporary personnel .
Finally , the issue of timeliness , mentioned by Mr Savary .
But in order to create European cabotage and for it to genuinely compete with other transport systems , that is land transport , we need efficient port services .
Of all of them , I would like to highlight the one relating to the reasons for which a Member State can have different objectives to those in question and I would respectfully ask the Commission to verify compliance with this Article 4 of the directive .
This is a significant vacuum in relation to the quality of marketed fuels .
Some may believe that this is unrealistic , but they also thought this of the directive promoting renewable energy which was approved two years ago .
I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy for the serious way they have analysed this report .
Throughout this entire process the Commission has promoted the inclusion of binding objectives .
However , we accept that equally valid reasons may still arise for the establishment of lesser objectives .
I would like once again to thank the rapporteur , all the members of the Committee and Parliament for your support and naturally I can assure you once again that , as you have requested , the Commission will ensure strict compliance with the provisions agreed for this Directive and I hope that the Council will shortly approve the taxation elements , which are essential if it is to have real content .
I am trying to take measures so that this promise , this agreement , this commitment made by all the countries in this Parliament and in the Council , of 12 % renewable energy , may genuinely be achieved .
It is true that it is an economic activity that involves a natural resource which must be protected .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am one of several Basque Members of this House .
Mr President , further to your reference to Guantanamo Bay , I should like to inform the House that a group of Christian Liberation Movement activists has been rounded up , harassed and attacked in Santiago , the capital of Cuba .
My group fully endorses the report .
The 2004 budget should represent a statement of faith in ourselves .
Unfortunately it cannot currently be guaranteed .
In the present climate of disunity and dissent , the Union 's institutions are called on to illustrate dialogue and cooperation , not to contribute to the unrest .
It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to give some indication of how the policy on decentralisation has evolved .
They are bound to be affected following the conflict with Iraq
