I think that this debate about the expansion of this second circle is of fundamental importance if we wish to conduct the debate about the boundaries of the Union in a positive manner .
These changes have since been overshadowed by others .
This is wishful thinking as far as I am concerned .
In Directive 98/43/EC an attempt was rightly made to make advertising and sponsorship at European level impossible .
The first one is about Kaliningrad .
We also note that there is a tougher stance on the part of the Russians with regard to Chechnya .
Finally , I would draw your attention to an environmental problem .
How to deal with the ambivalence of Moscow 's policy ?
I wish Council and Commission persistence in the search for a well nigh impossible political settlement between Russians and Chechens .
We are going to have to devote some attention to this , so that we can continue to talk of regular cooperation .
Russia is large enough , it can look after itself .
If we help Russia with all kinds of problems , then Russia itself must be constructive too and say : okay , we are going to solve a problem with this candidate country immediately , we will ratify .
We have before us a proposal on which , as far as the objective is concerned , everyone is actually probably agreed .
Now , to the best of our knowledge , no mandate has been given here .
That is the message I would like to give the Council and the Commission in their future deliberations .
Was that why the Commission did not specify Article 308 ?
Regulators and market players themselves are pressing for further European cooperation and integration .
In my report I have tried to keep my distance from power games of this kind and to focus on the substantive arguments .
What I really want to emphasise and also insist on in this debate is the 'enabling clause ' we have included in the report to provide a legal basis for the possibility of the performance of European supervision at European level too .
Perhaps this can be discussed at the IGC and perhaps also by the Convention .
We shall , however , be taking a closer look at this in the remainder of the debate .
A prime objective of the Lamfalussy procedure is improvement of the control and the supervision of the financial markets .
I am told that if you were to do that , the next treatment of animals with antibiotics would have far more damaging consequences in general than if we were to leave things as they are .
For many herbal remedies that have long been in use new tests are unnecessary however .
Mr President , I did indeed intend starting with the difficult legacy of this dossier , which goes back to the early nineties when a number of proposals for directives on atypical work were submitted .
Thirdly , because I believe in the opportunities that temporary work offers workers with specific wishes or problems .
It includes flexibility and security , promotion and patronage , acceptance and protection , liberalisation and regulation .
Thirdly , they are trying to exclude the exception that was in paragraph 5.4 of the Commission 's proposal , concerning short temporary assignments , and to make it general and even to raise it to 12 months .
Mr President , this is an extraordinarily involved directive with an involved previous history , as has already been said .
Thanks to the work of the rapporteur , but also thanks to the work of the two shadow rapporteurs from the PPE-DE , this has been achieved to a very large extent and I would therefore like to thank all three of them very much .
We cannot deal with codecision this way .
There are , however , also very many Member States that do not offer good protection , Mrs De Rossa made full reference to this .
I still think that equal treatment is best served by the principle by which , as far as essential employment conditions are concerned , a temporary worker is compared with workers of a user company .
That will then definitely be to the credit of Mrs van den Burg too .
After all , did we not , in March 2000 , adopt the Purvis report whose intention was to improve the business climate in Europe ?
The Commission 's action plan , however , already provides for the initiation of a social debate .
I could not agree with you more .
We condemn , however , the Board 's refusal to agree at this stage to a further increase in the next five years .
A drawback is that EIB bonds are not always freely accessible .
It is , however , also important to invest in social infrastructure .
Parliament has advised the EIB at any rate not to overlook the social dimension and to set up a special programme for the candidate countries and other partner countries , which should address the objectives of social cohesion .
This monitoring at national level was the subject of a report which I supported here yesterday .
I think that this can also play a part in the case of the EIB .
The role of the EIB is important .
Creating employment is not one of the Bank 's tasks as such , but it is sometimes , of course , a side-effect .
We believe that the EIB funds should be used for investments and not for the system itself if this can at all be helped .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I should like to make a few comments , which are mainly procedural in nature .
Thirdly , the network of national competition authorities
