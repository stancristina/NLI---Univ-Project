the new types of packaging is that they should be compatible with Community legislation generally .
We know , for example , that certain smoked food can be difficult to store in the right way .
It is important for new regulations , backed by this regulation , to be adopted and for us to know with certainty that food packaging needs to be approved to ensure that it is safe .
I am pleased that we have set out clear rules governing the language used and public access to records .
We therefore need to clarify matters here and now .
That would be in keeping with the position at which we had arrived in our negotiations with the Council and with what COREPER approved last week .
It has been a pleasure to collaborate with her .     Mr President , I must first say how sorry I am to have arrived late for the debate , meaning that I did not hear the rapporteur’s introduction .
Please do excuse me , but the debate began a little earlier than scheduled .
We have nonetheless chosen to approve the compromise .
Finally , I wish to emphasise that , in our opinion , traceability is very important .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , perhaps I have a certain ability to come across as being particularly motherly but , being very often out and about among people , I am able to confirm that there is genuine anxiety and fear among our electorate , that is to say the people we represent .
We now have sound , comprehensive legislation .
Air pollution and climate change have also been addressed .
I rather think that it is a little too far-reaching and perhaps not sufficiently structured .
I have tried to include an aspect that is rather controversial , namely the fact that individuals have to have access to enough information to be able , as far as possible , to make choices concerning lifestyle , food , exercise and detergents – in fact , everything to which we are giving thought and attention – and to take responsibility for their own , and their families’ , health .
I have removed any suggestion that allergies are definitely bound up with traffic problems .
The cause of the spread of childhood allergies in modern times is perhaps also to be sought elsewhere than purely in external environmental factors .
First of all , I should like to thank Parliament for its response to the Commission communication on a European Environment and Health Strategy .
Nearly ten per cent say that they have a close relative or family member that is suffering from an environment-related illness .
Indeed , one of the main objectives of this Strategy is to increase our knowledge and thus obtain a better basis for tackling the problems .
The basic idea is to bring environment , health and research together in order to improve our understanding of , and thus tackle more effectively , the complicated link between environment and disease .
We shall present this at the Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Budapest in June 2004 , which is a pan-European meeting .
Completing our knowledge of the part the environment plays in various health problems will take time .
There are certain areas where we cannot risk waiting until our knowledge is complete , but need to act according to the precautionary principle , and we shall do so .
The substances selected are heavy metals , dioxins , PCBs and endocrine disrupters .
We are fully aware of this risk ; indeed , coordinating data from different areas is one of our most important tasks .
Thank you for your attention .     Mr President , we have here this evening a joint debate on all three pillars of the Århus Convention .
Although theCommunity and the Member States signed the Convention back in 1998 and it entered into force in 2001 , it has only been ratified by a few of the EU Member States .
How can we say that so confidently ?
It is also true that we have a responsibility towards future generations .
We disagree on a number of points ; this is clear from the amendments to this Directive .
In my opinion , this would create new obstacles , and I do not understand the need for this .
Nor do I understand why we should adopt geographical and time limitations or restrictions , which are also specified in Articles 8 and 5 , regarding legal standing .
For example , a small , local environmental organisation might need expert help from an international organisation so , in my opinion , that entails restrictions .
Lastly , I should just like to say something about costs .
We must be very generous in this regard .
It has been interesting to note that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy approved this Directive , and suppressed a proposal to reject it , by only 17 votes to 16 .
Many of us share the deep ideological conviction that other environmental organisations , too , should have this right .
This deadline could be obtained by means of a considerably simpler regulatory framework than the rather complicated situation we have at present .
A proposal to reject the report in its present form has been presented ; Mrs Thors , among others , spoke of this just now .
Surely this is a reasonable consequence of signing it .
Each country is free to go further , to increase the rights in other areas .
In my opinion , the draft adopted by the Committee on the Environment could be improved in a couple of respects .
It is also important not to prescribe a restriction on who is granted the opportunity of bringing legal proceedings .
