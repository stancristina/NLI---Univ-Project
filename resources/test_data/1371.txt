But in short , Commissioner , as of today we do not have an updated scoreboard , nor do we have a legal instrument to regulate the conditions and material assumptions of expulsion .
We mean to carry out this coordination basically through the instrument of major economic policy guidelines , which are applicable in each Member State that approves them and which include not only the major lines of economic policy but also specific recommendations for each Member State .
Mr President , Commissioner , you have given me an answer about European economic policy and the practice in the Member States and the Commission on this .
In overall terms , the euro effect must be seen as a total , absolute success : we have managed to improve growth , improve the conditions for stability in our economy , we have managed to keep inflation down to a relatively low level despite the risks we are facing , and we are achieving the basic objective , which is to keep inflation under control .
We are doing this in cooperation with the Member States , which are responsible for the specific euro changeover programmes .
Eurostat data tells us that 18 % of the population of the European Union live on less than 60 % of average national income or , in other words , 65 million Europeans are living in poverty .
Therefore , Commissioner , I ask for a special effort to be made to eradicate this child poverty .
I also wish to recognise Mrs Rothe ' s hard work and congratulate her on it .
In the specific case of my country , Spain , these guidelines would be responsible for an additional 225 billion tonnes of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere between now and 2010 and for our being unable to meet the Kyoto targets .
With regard to our targets in this field , we have to listen to the people and go beyond the Commission ' s proposal of 21 % , which I think is very positive overall , and increase the renewable portion of the total electricity produced .
A dramatic increase in the price of oil without doubt starkly highlights the problems relating to our dependence on energy from fossil fuels .
The European Union , which flies the flag in the fight against climate change and in the reduction of emissions , must not be the first to fail to comply with its own objectives and its own commitments .
Furthermore , renewable energy sources are a factor in the availability of supply , and we therefore have an enormous potential for production within the European Union .
Therefore , issues concerning the market are of secondary importance .
In the majority of cases that is not renewable energy .
In this context , I must point out two issues .
Those would evidently be mandatory targets for that State , so that it complies with them , so that in this way it complies with these targets , which are targets and not obligations .
We therefore support Amendments Nos 36 and 56 and also certain aspects of Amendments Nos 4 , 15 and 62 , relating to the idea of internalising external costs and compensating for external costs which are not covered in favour of renewable energy sources .
However , the Commission cannot accept parts of Amendments Nos 37 and 38 and Amendment No 39 , insofar as they prejudge the type of system which must be applied or they require that there should be no distortion to the biomass market .
When the time comes , further down the line , we will have to gradually incorporate the market aspects which - as I have said - make up the second phase , since the first phase is to generate a sufficient quantity of renewable energy .
We cannot accept Amendments Nos 26 , 47 and 60 or Amendment No 65 , which impose binding rules on the distribution of connection costs and other network costs at a European level .
Women are double victims of armed conflicts since they are also subjected to rapes and sexual abuse , which have sometimes been used as weapons of war .
My only consolation is that this says a great deal about Mrs Theorin' s parliamentary abilities .
This work has not been recognised or valued , either economically or socially .
This initiative report is very timely , since it deals with a growing need within the labour market .
As the proposal indicates , the Commission feels that providing citizens with access will mean that they are guaranteed better information on decision-making processes , and that administrations will have greater legitimacy , efficiency and responsibility in a democratic system .
However , the Council ' s position with regard to some of the most important provisions of the proposal is still not clear .
I now wish to address certain problems that currently prevent the Commission from accepting certain amendments .
I believe that this is precisely the opposite of what the institutions intend .
With regard to other amendments , we believe that we need time to assess the consequences of the proposal from the operational point of view and we must ensure that the procedures incorporated are not bureaucratic , but are truly accessible to all the citizens .
I would like to highlight that , at the right time , the Commission could accept practically all the amendments , such as Amendments Nos 9 , 18 , 21 in part , 23 , 25 , 26.1 , 28( f ) , 35 , 38 , 40.1 , 40.6 , 41.1 , 42 , 43.1 , 47 , 49 and 52 .
It is timely for three important reasons that affect this special American region , not to mention the importance and political appropriateness of strengthening the dialogue
