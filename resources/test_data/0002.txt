critical analysis of the annual economic report will help to bring about concerted political action and ensure that a market economy underpinned by a socially responsible economic order and job-creating growth finally sees the light of day in the European Union .
This makes it clear that we are losing our room for manoeuvre and our competitiveness , and that we must continue down the road of budget consolidation .
The rapporteur has not requested it .
And I use the word philosophy quite deliberately - it simply lacks the sense that Europe needs to bring its economies into line with one another .
As long as the bulk of the Member States ' financial contributions is poured into support for agricultural overproduction , while comparatively paltry sums are earmarked for research and development , we should not be surprised if the EU 's competitiveness is declining .
We are agreed - and the portrayal of EMU in the report is therefore accurate - that we can achieve the introduction of the euro , the launching of stage three , without relaxing the criteria and by interpreting them in accordance with the Treaty .
And it is important too for the modern techniques of quality management to be more widely applied .
Because of these agreements , it has been able to pledge that there will be no more operational redundancies before the year 2000 .
We should give this some careful thought .
This applies in particular to disabled driving licence holders , since the system of harmonized codes will now set out the conditions for driving a motor vehicle in a clearly non-discriminatory way .
I should like to thank the Council for its common position , in which it takes over the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading and accepted by the Commission .
What Mr Ferber said is quite right : if Parliament retables these amendments - and the rapporteur , whom I wish to thank for his work , has argued forcefully for this - the whole process will remain stalled .
Indeed , the fact that the level of funding commitments and payments to Finland and Sweden is still below the Union average is not unrelated to the learning process that we are jointly engaged in - a fruitful process , I might add , and one that is steering us towards closer partnership .
Of course , Mrs McCarthy , we shall consider carefully any information that we receive concerning unemployment trends in Member States .
On the other hand , this creates a demand for precautionary measures which do have a positive effect , it must be said ; but with the best will in the world , it is impossible to say if they are really necessary from a scientific point of view .
When we talk about cancelling refunds in respect of live cattle or cattle for slaughter , then as I see it we have to deal with two separate issues .
But if we do not also put in place the logistics which are necessary to ensure that there is no break in the chain of refrigeration there , Lebanon will go on importing live cattle , because conserving meat obviously poses no problems so long as the animal is alive .
I think that this is only logical .
Exactly what is it all about ?
Finally , the Committee on Legal Affairs decided to choose a different point in time , namely the moment when the banks participating in the payment system are informed of the opening of proceedings .
We are in agreement with the rapporteur .
Suffice to say that one of them was ornamental plants .
We also endorse the criticisms which the rapporteur has just expressed in the debate .
The first question - do we need to harmonize resale rights - can clearly be answered in the affirmative .
An area without internal borders must also be a market without privileges .
People cannot live on that .
Mr President , I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur , who has done an excellent job as always .
Do you still seriously think that with such a cost to the market , sales would just have carried on cheerfully in Europe ?
There were specific instructions to the Committees of this House to be stricter in supervising expenditure and the implementation and efficiency of the budget , and to make critical proposals where improvements are possible - from own resources through fisheries policy to development co-operation .
And with that in mind , there is one conclusion we are going to draw from this discharge : we expect that money to be distributed , efficiently and frugally , yes , but distributed as this Parliament resolved .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it was no easy matter on this occasion for the Committee on Budgetary Control to submit the report for the discharge in the time laid down - laid down , indeed , by the Financial Regulations .
The Commission 's task is to monitor that .
Madam President , the size of the sums that have gone astray and the obviously out-of-date expenditure structure cannot fail to cause anxiety , to say the least , among the taxpayers in the Member States in the attitude they take to the European Union .
There may be changes from time to time between this area of policy and that , but the problem is fundamentally the same .
Metten report ( A4-0105/97 ) Mr Metten 's report rightly tackles an important problem .
My group welcomes the formation of the all-party government .
I believe the debate , and the joint motion for a resolution , which addresses all the important factors , show that we are prepared to do what is necessary to help support the building of new political and economic structures ; all speakers in this debate have clearly expressed that point of view
