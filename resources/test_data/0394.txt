, the liberals have always clearly stated that a favourable enterprise climate is the most important basic condition for growth and jobs .
Administrative problems cost the business community more than 150 billion ECU each year .
I would also like to underline the proposal to devote special attention to women entrepreneurs and to cooperating spouses .
No wonder that in recent years the Council has expressed constant praise for SMEs , recorded in resolutions of the Council of Ministers .
And the Dutch Government is at the front of them .
Poorly regulated interconnection also leads to the screening off of markets , the disturbance of competition and it is disadvantageous to the consumer .
And I think this is essential .
It has greatly disappointed us that the Council has deviated from this on 6 or 7 essential points .
And that is a crucial point .
From the viewpoint of trading policy I deem standards in the field of information technology and telecommunications , the environment , energy and standards in the workplace very important .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I must begin by complimenting both rapporteurs , Mrs Wemheuer and Mrs Theato , and by thanking you , Mr President , for the initiative of the interparliamentary conference we had in Brussels .
In a judgment of 24 April 1996 , so this year , the judges of the Fourth Chamber ruled that there is indeed a legal basis for action by the Commission to counter fraud .
I would also emphasize that cooperation between European institutions and the national parliaments needs to be improved .
In February 1996 a second meat fraud came to light in Italy .
Later investigations showed that the accused were at the centre of an ingenious network , with contacts in abattoirs , property companies , front men , the hotel and catering industry .
An Irish abattoir was involved .
But Europe has a responsibility too .
Technically speaking , as has already been said , the elections in Bosnia can be regarded as a success , in the circumstances at least .
And when they did go to vote in the other ethnic area there were mobs lying in wait for them and a lot of police .
What should our counsel be ?
But we have to live with the outcome of the Bosnian elections .
The elections are over and IFOR is still there .
Yes , then the way is wide open for all kinds of crime and all manner of perversity .
This incident makes it clear once again that the Union will have to work to secure a peaceful resolution to the Cyprus question .
The Union must help its would-be member , Cyprus , in this .
So great efforts are needed to that end in the immediate future .
If we shirk this duty we are fooling ourselves .
And it is the least which can be done to prevent the situation from escalating again .
The ad hoc international tribunals for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia are doing a good job , but it is now time to think about setting up a permanent body .
So the Member States should apply that policy in practice , certainly when it comes to safeguarding universal human rights and punishing crimes against humanity .
I am thinking of paragraph 7 , but paragraph 8 too .
So in this case there is no question of his having published secret information in a manner prejudicial to state security .
So I urge the Commission to do everything it can to protect the Romanian gay movement against the rabid , crude homophobia which is rampant in Romania .
If it is too expensive for Parliament I would consider bringing one and setting it up myself .
Illegal immigrants , ladies and gentlemen , are a product of the law .
Efforts are urgently needed to regularize the status of those who have been here for years or those who cannot go home .
That they looked at how the problem might be shared instead of offloaded on to someone else .
Madam President , Parliament seems to have been shocked by the rather dramatic expulsion of a few dozen illegal aliens .
It pains me to see once again that the great majority of honourable Members of this House are blind to this reality , to this desperate situation in which the weakest of our own people find themselves when they are driven out of their own streets and areas or worse .
Ladies and gentlemen , the scandal over the exporting of toxic waste was a general scandal involving numerous countries of the South .
Ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , on behalf of the Liberals I too must compliment Mr Adam on his report .
It creates a lot of jobs too .
Madam President , following our debate on the Commission 's guidelines for policy on the Baltic region last year , Parliament is now required to pronounce on a report which outlines the foreign aid extended to this region .
In addition to cooperation in economic , environmental and infrastructure matters , the Union and the Baltic states ought to cooperate in the fight against international crime .
And after hearing what Mr Fischler had to say I can only endorse the Commission 's position that we must stick to what was agreed in Florence .
So the production of the beef cattle sector is steadily increasing .
One sector must not pay the costs of another .
Now is the time to do it .
This production method falls short of the basic requirements concerning the freedom of animals to move around , their access to food , etc .
If these pioneers also have to meet the new welfare requirements in 2008 they will be forced to depreciate the humane measures they have already taken ahead of time .
