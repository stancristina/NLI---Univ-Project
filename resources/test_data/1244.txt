cultural links with those countries that host emigrant communities from the outermost regions and to bring down the barriers that limit trading opportunities with the surrounding geographical areas , such as the West Indies , the Americas and Africa .
If it is so difficult , however , to make more slowly developing regions progress , what will happen when events that are completely out of the ordinary strike one of these regions , events that may result from climatic factors , fires , floods or earthquakes ?
In many cases , these islands are mountainous and they are also less-developed outermost regions .
It is all very well to withdraw a few directives ; indeed there are some that we would really love to see withdrawn , such as the Bolkestein directive , but unfortunately it is still there .
Today we have this last chance , which requires great vision on the part of this Parliament and its co-legislator the European Council , because it requires the European institutions , the political institutions , to take responsibility for something which the national rail undertakings lack the courage , skill or ability to do , namely to stop defending shrinking monopolistic market segments , which are increasingly unable to generate traffic revenue to cover their costs , and instead seek to expand the total market , with potential benefits for all .
These concerns should not be accorded such importance that the type of authorisation is overlooked , with the possibility of awarding domestic public rail transport contracts and services directly and without a competitive process , which is what the revised version of the proposed regulation on public service transport obligations implies .
If consumers are protected , liberalisation can be effective and efficient ; if it does not work , or if there is any risk of it becoming dangerous , consumers will not be protected .
I also approve the Savary report in relation to the need for a common certification system for train crews , the necessary standardisation of their professional skills and the monitoring of their state of health .
The courageous proposal to open up even domestic passenger transport to full liberalisation is vital to complete the single market , relaunch community rail services and provide a better service to the population .
It is an age-old question .
All the groups have signed an important compromise document together , putting forward a united position , but we have also sacrificed a number of points of correctness for the sake of this unity .
In my view , the document is extremely harsh in the demands it makes on Turkey , and such an approach does not even encourage the Greek Cypriots to be more flexible or for them too to seek a solution to this situation , for which they are largely responsible .
Armenia is being discussed in Turkey and it is being discussed with the support of the government : in spite of everything , the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have supported opening this debate .
We wish to emphasise that the outcome of Turkey’s accession procedure must not be a foregone conclusion .
A new law restricts lawyers ’ ability to carry out their professional duties ; journalists can be arrested and their articles considered an attack on territorial integrity ; teachers ’ unions have been condemned for defending everybody’s right to speak their own language as well in school ; and Mehmet Tarhan , a young Turkish gay , has been sentenced to several years in prison for claiming to be a conscientious objector .
The idea that Turkey can join the European Union without recognising Cyprus is utterly unacceptable : the ball is now in Turkey’s court .
They may all be highly interesting and important , but in my view only one thing should guide us in our decisions : the will of the people .
We have had enough of giving in to fear .
Cyprus , first of all : we should be ashamed even to begin such talks when a Member State and an old ally is still not recognised and is partly under military occupation by Turkey .
For the planet , that might mean reducing the tensions that lie at the root of many conflicts .
What we can take for granted , in fact , is that oil prices will rise even higher because , given current demand , there is no reason for them to come down .
Nationalise resources ; 2. strengthen political and economic ties with producer countries so as to become their privileged trading partners ; 3 . stop supporting or being complicit with US foreign policy ; 4 . release European research organisations working on alternative energy sources , especially biomass , geothermal and all other renewable energies , from constraints and conditions and instead give them substantial financial support ; and 5 . monitor the prices that oil companies charge in the various countries of the European Union .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this debate of ours today on the oil problem means talking of the difficulties of our current situation – from wars to the exhaustion of non-renewable resources and to environmental damage – and deciding whether we shall have a different future or whether we shall have any future at all .
The document we approved in the United Nations was not one with which to start reflecting on the UN : it was to implement a debate that was already two years old .
What does all that mean ?
We are in the middle of a pause for reflection after the referendum defeats .
While we support President Barroso’s approach , we believe that efforts should be stepped up to increase the European Union’s presence in Minsk : to distribute information , carry out coordination and support activities , and monitor the situation , particularly regarding human rights
