The other main discussion point - and , still , the point we have reached - is that this protection begins at a certain time .
They are capable of sending out a message to guarantee safety .
So I certainly want to thank the Commission staff that made it possible for first Mr Barrot and then myself to work as effectively as possible .
A consolidated framework for European accreditation of classification companies will also allow us more effective control of our shipping .
Other devices will be applied to the Port State .
It goes without saying that risk cannot be removed altogether from maritime transport , as it is from other sectors , but it is the duty of the law maker , the duty of whoever represents the public , to do their best to limit these risks as far as possible .
I believe I can confirm the commitment of the Commission , which strongly urged the approval of this package , to ensuring its observation by the Member States .
These tasks comply with the Agency 's regulation , even though they are not specifically mentioned , because the latest amendment dates back to 2004 , but they will certainly be included in the next revision of the regulation , which is currently being prepared .
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and say a true thank you because now , European legislation , the European rules on maritime safety , are certainly better than they used to be .
The thing that it is worth doing at the moment is perhaps to thank yet again the Commission for its initiative and the Commissioner for the conscientious way he has followed through the actions of Parliament - and also to vindicate the part played by Parliament without allowing ourselves to become overly self-righteous .
I feel that the opinion approved by the Commission , which is under discussion today , reinforces the Commission 's proposal in some key respects .
The fact that we simply authorised the addition of this tariff charge to the existing surcharge , decided in 2006 to fund the great tunnels through the Alps , amounts to a double tariff charge and this is an obstacle to achieving a single market in my opinion .
On the other hand , the Commission has proposed a common internalisation framework based on a principle that concerns all transport methods and takes into account past initiatives .
I believe that we must find a compromise and the one we are arriving at in Parliament through Mr El Khadraoui 's report is a good compromise on the whole .
I do not , however , think we need to give credence to the critical viewpoint that takes a gloomy outlook because we are in the midst of a crisis .
These matters are more pertinent than ever now that we are faced with problems raised by the economic crisis .
It may be that the Commission and the Council will decide to freeze derivatives , at least to propose it at world level , and to suspend trading in these commodities .
It is a vicious circle .
I voted in favour of Mrs Haug 's report on the amending budget for the financial year 2009 , which takes account of the serious damage caused by the floods that hit Romania in July 2008 .
I support the work done by Mr El Khadraoui on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures , and I have therefore voted in favour of his report .
While I do not agree on some points such as including or not including certain external costs in the charge , I do agree with the 'polluter pays ' principle .
Despite the progress made by the European institutions on openness and transparency , the situation cannot exactly be described as perfect and this recasting of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to documents held by the European institutions should be seen as another step towards achieving an administrative environment where the availability of , and ease of access to , information are the rule rather than the exception .
The crisis means redundancies , and families , who have less and less money , are spending less and less .
That is why I voted in favour of the report .
Adopting extreme measures with regard to Roma communities could however exacerbate the already terrible situation for these minorities and undermine opportunities for integration and social inclusion .
The Roma must , in fact , be treated like all other citizens , without their enjoying excessive benefits and concessions that are to the detriment of other European citizens , who have the same rights ( and , above all , duties ) as that population .
After carefully studying the motion for a resolution on the Lisbon Strategy , I decided in the end to abstain and thus not to vote either in favour or against the motion .
Madam President , I voted for the report .
It is , in fact , crucial to understand that the EU 's cohesion policy makes an important contribution to the European Economic Recovery Plan and is the Community 's largest source of investment in the real economy , providing targeted assistance for addressing priority needs and areas with growth potential , both in the public and in the private sector .
We need to reach a real turning point on the water issue .
Appropriate finances will then , of course , be required .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , dialogue and political and commercial collaboration with Brazil is an important goal for Europe ; a goal to be developed and strengthened , beginning with the fight against poverty , particularly among children , and moving towards strong commercial agreements to build up trade and investment
