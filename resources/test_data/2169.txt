particular .
I hope that the Commission will take the results of this work very seriously indeed .
In particular , I would ask it to abandon the idea of requiring 140 mm mesh size and also to recognise the extent to which the Scottish fleet depends on a mixed fishery .
Accordingly , instead of imposing blanket restrictions on some 15 000 square miles of the North Sea , I trust that it will opt for seasonal closures in areas where the cod concentration is high .
Mr President , Commissioner , it was inevitable that the Gallagher and Poignant reports would not only comment on the past but would focus in detail on the CFP review , and I consider it entirely appropriate that the MEPs should seek to influence the review process in advance of any formal consultation with Parliament .
I contend that the principal objective of the CFP , namely the conservation of fish stocks , has not been realised and as a result we have had to face dramatic year-on-year fluctuations in quotas , as exemplified by the current cod crisis .
In addition , we must re-examine the process by which , and the level at which , decisions are made .
Various amendments tabled with my name attached seek to establish certain important principles for the CFP review , including that relative stability should remain since the good reasons for its inclusion as a founding principle remain valid .
That in the light of experience with areas like the Shetland Box , specially protected areas based on scientific advice should continue in the future .
And a system of zonal management should be established based on the ICES areas and with representation from fishing , science and conservation interests able to participate meaningfully , not to renationalise the CFP , not to take away power from the Council or the Commission but to allow each Member State with quotas in a particular zone to assist in devising and recommending controls which are relevant , appropriate to these areas and , therefore , more likely to succeed .
Recent events have led to even greater lack of faith within Scotland in the decision-making processes and in the structure of the CFP itself .
How can , for example , the Commission justify continuing levels of industrial fishery and even increases in white fish by-catch while on the other hand reducing quotas of fish for human consumption ?
Let us use the opportunities arising from the review of the CFP to achieve a solution which works .
I challenge the Commission and the Council to look seriously at zonal management within a framework of Community-wide objectives , of course , but so that interested parties can participate more fully and so that the new CFP , once agreed , can actually achieve its purpose , namely the long-term sustainability of European fisheries .
Mr President , when we discuss the excellent reports by my colleagues Mr Varela , Mr Cunha , Mr Poignant and Mr Gallagher , it is against a background of crisis in the EU fisheries sector .
As we contemplate the radical reforms of the CFP , which are clearly necessary and long overdue and which are highlighted in these reports , we do so in the knowledge that fish stocks are in spiral decline .
Too many fishermen are chasing too few fish .
As a result , EU fishing fleets are shrinking and many thousands of jobs are being lost at sea and on shore .
The situation in the North Sea is of particular concern .
Savage cuts in the total allowable catches and quotas were announced in December by the Council .
Now the Commission is seeking to implement emergency interim measures to aid the recovery of cod stocks , which have fallen to unsustainable levels in that sector .
I am extremely grateful , like my colleagues , the other Scottish MEPs , to Commissioner Fischler for agreeing to meet us earlier this evening to discuss these dramatic emergency measures .
We welcome Mr Fischler 's generous offer to meet with leaders of the industry to discuss alternatives to the draconian proposals which have been widely publicised by the Fisheries DG in the last few days .
A sensible , multiannual cod recovery plan embracing realistic technical conservation measures , the closure of cod spawning grounds and the decommissioning of the larger new fishing vessels will surely be more sensible than the pursuit of a plan which would allow industrial fishing to continue in vast restricted zones and which would potentially lead to the bankruptcy of half the Scottish fleet .
The Poignant and Gallagher reports have attracted some amendments , which seek to do away with the 6/12 mile limits and break open the Shetland Box and gain free access to the North Sea .
Clearly there are some Member States that still regard the resources of the North Sea as a rich prize .
I hope that this debate may bring them to their senses .
Mr President , it is always comforting to see the same few faces at every fishing debate and I would like to reassure the Commissioner and colleagues and friends that we may be small in numbers but we all have an active interest in fishing and no matter how late the debate is , rest assured we will be there .
The reform of the CFP and the forthcoming launch of the Green Paper mark a critical time for the fishing industry .
On the one hand all of us here in this Chamber want to see the existence of the fishing industry , not least because we enjoy eating the product ; but on the other hand we are faced with grave scientific evidence of depleting fish stocks , so much so that certain species may no longer exist in the future .
