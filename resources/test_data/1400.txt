At the same time , however , we need to take general action that benefits the Roma population as a whole ; they are one of the communities that suffers from the worst discrimination , and so any anti-discrimination policy is going to help them .
These are weapons that we cannot fight using military force .
We do not agree with having United States military bases in the European Union .
I condemn the logic of the militarisation of the EU , which has intensified with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon , and the changes that it introduced , such as the European External Action Service and the role of the High Representative .
We are currently witnessing the highest degree of militarisation in history .
I voted against the Danjean report because it proposes a future Common Foreign and Security Policy that is focused on promoting the militarisation of the EU and its interventionism .
Human rights are a fundamental symbol of the European Union 's identity , because we believe in the values of freedom , tolerance and pluralism .
Firstly , there is political dialogue .
As the European Commission said , the Council 's common position is still valid , and it is an honourable position because it asks for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners .
In the meantime , Madam President , with the legitimacy that Parliament has in representing 500 million citizens from the 27 Member States of the Union , it needs to loudly and clearly echo the unstoppable shout of freedom that we are hearing from the beloved island of Cuba .
For the moment , let us not enter into a subject that divides us : whether the common position should be maintained or not .
Madam President , finally I would like to thank Mr Salafranca , who negotiated this text on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , Mrs Weber , from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , Mr Romeva i Rueda , on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , Mr Kožušník from the European Conservatives and Reformists , and other fellow Members who have taken part in this task , which has been difficult and complicated , but which I hope will be successful tomorrow .
However , I would also like to warn about the risk of using and exploiting this case politically for other issues which , as Mr Yáñez-Barnuevo has said , could be dangerous .
We did not do this for the military coup in Honduras .
What is happening with the persecution in the Western Sahara ?
I call on the Council , on the President of the Council , to clearly raise the following question : is the common position going to be ended ?
In this case , we are doing so in relation to Cuba , by saying and demanding that all the remaining prisoners of conscience in Cuba should be released and that human rights should be respected there .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , increased cooperation with third countries - with countries of origin and transit in migration - is a key element for the European Union in terms of combating illegal immigration .
This is an operational task involving exchanging information , analysing risks , research and coordinated joint Frontex operations .
This visit was followed by contact from the Commission .
The very objective of these agreements is for those borders to be respected .
Subject : Domestic violence In the Spanish Presidency 's statement at the plenary session in January 2010 , the Presidency highlighted its firm intention to combat violence against women , to propose draft legislation to fight violence against women , and to establish a European Observatory of Domestic Violence .
For example , in a resolution that it adopted in November last year , Parliament urged the Commission to draw up a general directive on measures to prevent and combat all forms of gender violence .
This means the Commission and also Parliament having a greater presence at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg .
They are waiting for this protection , which - as you rightly said - now needs to come out from behind closed doors , not only at national level but also at European level .
On Monday , the Employment , Social Policy , Health and Consumer Affairs Council ( EPSCO ) adopted this comprehensive , global approach in the fight against gender violence ; in other words , 'zero tolerance ' .
What is the timetable and what are the main points of the strategy 's content ?
In any case , I do want to say that there has been an important meeting in which progress has been made on the possible content of this strategy , which was held on 25 February in Budapest with the governments of Austria , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Germany , Hungary , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia , in which important conclusions were adopted , suggesting what the essential elements of this future strategy should be .
It also considers the following to be strategic policy areas to be included in the strategy : infrastructure , innovation , cultural and artistic activities , sustainable economic development , tourism , food safety , the economy , cooperation in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises , research and development , migration , sport , education , employment , health , social affairs , along with other areas that the document covers extensively and ambitiously .
They are the countries that I listed , which met a few days ago in Budapest to make progress on setting objectives and clarifying the strategy more precisely , as it is not yet sufficiently defined .
Unemployment : it is currently believed that there could
