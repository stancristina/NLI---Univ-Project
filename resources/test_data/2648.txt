I would also like to say in this vein that I think that the climate of dialogue that has been created is one that Europe should generously join in with and , in this respect , I think it is right and proper that whoever necessary should be received , that the Zapatistas should be received , that they should be welcomed in Europe and that we should offer them our hand .
On these shores , on the old continent of Europe , many of us are pleased to see this political change that is taking place in Mexico in terms of recognising this minority , which has been historically marginalised .
I reject the sceptical position and fatalistic view of those who think that fishing accidents are inevitable and that the victims of them are a price we have to pay to the sea .
The European Union does not even have statistical data ; only five countries provide figures and they are not comparable .
I hope that , as it is the first one , you will look tolerantly upon its defects and support it .
Also , there is no point in having a battery of safety standards if it is not required that they are complied with .
That is a business worth many billions of euros and in that case it seems that competition gives way to quality .
That is to say , I think that there are real problems , but that those real problems cannot be solved by mathematically applying the rules of Community competition and much less by focusing solely on the criterion of prices .
I have said this to you in public and in private .
First of all , the problem could have been avoided .
I did not wish to use these arguments .
I must start my speech by referring to certain allusions that have been made .
Here there are major doubts , doubts that are justified , as to whether the procedure was formally correct , and therefore time does not matter .
Madam President I think that , as the Conference of Presidents very wisely decided , we should wait for Mrs Garaud to deal with this matter and to take the steps that she deems appropriate as the person mandated by the Conference of Presidents .
Let us hope that it will be in the future .
My second question refers to the identity of Community aid , which is one of our fundamental pillars and which is focused on the non-governmental sector .
It will be the cornerstone on which to build a political union .
I think that this is something that would increase the efficiency and accuracy of the battle against counterfeiting .
Mr President , although I am not from the same group as Mr Whitehead , I share his thoughts on Mrs Roth-Behrendt , and if she has to have an operation tomorrow we wish her a speedy recovery because in a way she is the driving force behind the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Cows should eat grass and this is the best way of preventing what is occurring now .
I have taken the floor today to call on the Presidency to send a letter , or take any other measure it deems appropriate , with regard to what is happening to Afro-Colombian communities on the Pacific coast of Colombia at the moment .
Investments of this sort will improve the productive structure of the European Union and make us much more competitive .
Increased monitoring of budgetary policies , following implementation of the stability and growth pact , is having very positive and beneficial results .
Basically , the Commission insists that progress must be made on both counts .
In the short-term , these obviously relate to the fiscal reforms which will improve the administration of taxes .
Firstly , I agree absolutely with him that , during the period of budgetary consolidation in the 1990s , many Member States reduced public investment , sometimes inappropriately .
In giving greater priority to public investment , which I fully support , we must not however forget the other side of the coin : greater public investment does not necessarily mean increased deficit .
However , the Commission would obviously not endorse an increase in investment which could exceed deficit levels or current predicted expenditure levels .
Nonetheless , we also feel that the nuances or minor differences between the Commission ' s proposal and the Council ' s final decision are irrelevant as far as public opinion is concerned .
They point to a number of interesting developments which have also been mentioned today .
These were the issues I wanted to bring to your attention .
This not only makes a positive contribution to the process of drafting regulations , it also enhances the prestige of the European Parliament .
Incidentally , certain accounting irregularities which are not tolerated in company accounts , have been sanctioned in relation to the public accounts of a number of Member States , to allow them to join the euro .
I would like to ask a question about the use of Parliament 's facilities by the PPE-DE in relation to the elections in the Basque country .
If these huge fodder imports are not investigated , the European Union will continue to act as a factory processing imported vegetable products to produce animal products .
The Spanish Reconquista of the Basque Autonomous Community has not succeeded .
The European Union can no longer consider this issue as an internal question of the Spanish Kingdom .
The Supreme Court has the competence to approach this House directly to demand that a petition be processed .
Furthermore , the principle of subsidiarity is being wrongly interpreted and , in my judgment , is largely being distorted by States and many regions
