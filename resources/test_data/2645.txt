if the Council could express a positive attitude today , for it would mean that , quickly and within the coming week , we could bring our reading of this directive to a close , something which I would call upon us to do .
I therefore hope that the Council will approve the amendments and that we can obtain a directive as quickly as possible .
Mr President , I should firstly like to thank the chairman of the committee , Mrs Redondo , and the rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , for an outstanding piece of work .
It is very clear that there are neither vaccines nor laboratory capacity and that , overall , everything is missing that would be necessary to enable us to abandon the non-vaccination policy .
This means that , if a decision on vaccination is to be made , it will be a political decision and not a decision based on scientific and veterinary fact .
I want finally to say a little about the consequences in terms of trade policy .
When there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease , the importing countries - or third countries - exclude all imports of fresh meat from the whole of the EU.
If foot and mouth disease occurs in a particular country or region , it is not therefore necessary to halt all imports of fresh meat from the whole of the EU.
That is why I want very clearly to call upon the Commission to renegotiate the agreements , which are nowhere near specific enough at present .
To outsiders , the effusive way in which we are praising each other may appear odd , but the mutual trust , openness and integrity that has characterised the budgetary negotiations this year inspires confidence that shortening and simplifying the budgetary process along the lines being worked on in the Convention is something that can be done easily and that we can continue the work on ensuring that the budget appears as a political document with clear political priorities .
It will be easier for all of us to see the economic and political priorities in the budget .
Good results were achieved in this year 's budget , and I want firstly to point out that , for 2003 , we found the money to prepare for enlargement to include ten countries in 2004 .
Without exceeding the agreed financial framework , EU legislation must be translated into the languages of the new Member States , and staff from the new countries must be appointed .
Secondly , we found the money for rebuilding Afghanistan and , thirdly , we were given clear pledges by the Council of better cooperation and scrutiny when it came to the funding of the common foreign and security policy .
Is not , however , attention being drawn to the Swedish model , also endorsed by Poland and Latvia , as a way of ensuring future sustainability ?
This is not a factor we have seen taken into account , yet it means that great caution will need to be exercised where future investments are concerned , given how important falls in share values are to the sustainability of pensions .
I am obviously pleased that a report is now being produced , but I have to observe that there is a large discrepancy between the Commission 's report and what the Court of Auditors says .
It might be stimulating to hear a couple of remarks concerning this discrepancy .
The report also observes that there are serious problems with the system , as we also know of course from the Court of Auditors and from a canny Mrs Andreasen .
I am pleased to see the idea rejected that fraud and irregularities can occur , but the Commission maintains that there are too few authorised users with access to the system , and that is something about which the Court of Auditors disagrees .
These really are issues we should very much like to hear something about in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I should like to thank Mr Nisticò and Commissioner Byrne for the sterling work they have done on this matter .
Requirements are being set in terms of staff qualifications , the operation of blood banks , the testing of donated blood and also efficient supervision and monitoring .
I believe it is well documented that voluntary and unremunerated donation provides the best blood quality , especially if there is a permanent body of donors .
I am nonetheless very pleased that the directive now refers to the European Council 's proper definition of unremunerated blood donation .
I am also very pleased that the Member States are now to make arrangements for encouraging voluntary , unremunerated blood donation and that , every three years , they are to submit reports to the Commission concerning the arrangements they have made .
Finally , I think it is important that the individual Member State be entitled to maintain or introduce the requirement for voluntary and unremunerated blood donation , a requirement that also includes a ban on the import of blood and blood components not donated in accordance with these principles of non-remuneration .
It is of course a good example of the European Parliament 's being able to promote the protection of the environment and of public health in Europe .
With regard to octaBDE , the risk assessment has clearly revealed that the substance entails obvious risks for the environment and public health , and it has now also , happily , been agreed to implement an immediate ban on the use of this substance .
A majority of the conciliation committee chose to defer to that state of affairs , so that decaBDE is only included in a recital in the directive and - if , quoting Mrs Ries , I may put it this way - has only been given a yellow card .
