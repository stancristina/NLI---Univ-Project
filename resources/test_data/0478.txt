we can use to respond to all the challenges that are important to us .
As it is , we have the mechanisms for enlargement , but everyone knows that common sense says that we also need a new treaty , at least in the longer term .
It occupies a position of importance in our programme and I mentioned it .
It is one path towards European success in global competition in the future .
We also have the right to express our views on it and we do so with reference to our own constitution and the consideration of matters and ratification procedures which it establishes .
Mr Crowley made special mention of new sources of energy , and I fully agree with what he said in his speech .
It is not .
It is with regard to these very issues that we need an area of freedom and justice .
Mr Paasilinna raised the sensitive question as to whether energy policy is for some in the world a weapon .
On the contrary , the EU line should be that energy policy is a normal part of business .
It must be business-based , and should clearly work both ways and give the same rights to all concerned parties .
This way , when we act we can benefit from one another .
This partnership can serve to improve both the EU’s and Russia’s success globally .
Furthermore , everything that was said on the issue of climate change in the debate , including what Mrs  Hassi said , will be taken into consideration .
This will be the responsibility of the Commission , the Council and Parliament : all those involved in legislative work .
We must consider our legislative work a basis for impact assessments .
This needs to be part of the normal legislative process .
Mr Pflüger described Finland as neutral .
Now we are a member of the Union , part of this community of values , which has a common policy and , moreover , a common foreign policy .
That is just the sort of task that the Union should be engaged in .
It gives firm support to those basic values which our existence relies on .
This will be an exacting task when we are introducing reforms .
At that summit we mean to speak a little about the model of consensus which Finland , for its own part , has used with some success to achieve certain kinds of results .
Hopefully we will achieve a result there .
The Seventh Framework Programme is an important component of that .
The EIT is an important initiative and a suitable structure needs to be found for it .
That is the message we want to drum home in the Union .
Then , regarding Mr Brok’s speech on the importance of the Baltic region , I have to remind you that it is now a common sea .
To Mr Hökmark of Sweden I can only say that for 700 years we were the same country as Sweden , and in a few years ’ time we will be celebrating the fact that we went our separate ways .
Hopefully there is something symbolic about the fact that Finland , the northernmost country in the Union , has wanted even to send a border patrol and a surveillance aircraft to the Canary islands to help and demonstrate solidarity , and show that the problems that we have in different parts of Europe , even with regard to illegal immigration , are shared by all of us .
We need to show solidarity within the Union .
I would also like the Finnish Presidency to act in such a spirit in the Union over the next six months .
The capture of an Israeli soldier and the ensuing Israeli operation has been followed keenly by us all .
Right at the start I want to say that yesterday in Helsinki the Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister , Erkki Tuomioja , discussed the situation in the region with Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Livni .
It is important that the Palestinians release the captured Israeli soldier immediately .
The Palestinian administration must also bring to an end the continued onslaught of Kassam rockets on Israel from Gaza .
The Union’s firm line on this is that any action that goes against international law must be stopped .
It is important to say that it is the duty of both parties to protect civilians .
Hospitals , too , for example , are suffering the consequences of the bombing of the power station .
Neither can we accept that Israel has detained numerous Palestinian ministers and members of parliament .
They must be released , or at least guaranteed a fair trial .
The Palestinian Government must recognise the following principles : non-violence , the recognition of Israel’s right to exist , and compliance with existing agreements and obligations .
How are we to come through the present crisis ?
It was also promising that they decided to meet again soon .
Although the chances of initiating a peace process once again seem very slight in the prevailing circumstances , the idea of a two-state model must be kept alive .
Weapons and unilateral action will not bring peace .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I can only share the profound concern which Members of Parliament have expressed on the worsening crisis in the Middle East .
At the same time we have to bear in mind that the parties involved hold the keys to solving the crisis .
As I see it , the position taken is a very balanced one , unlike what has been suggested in some of the speeches here .
It is crucial that the parties involved can return to the negotiating table and thereby find a solution to the crisis .
