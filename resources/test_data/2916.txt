developed , led by those countries that are slow to implement decisions .
What is sustainable development ?
If the basic education system of our countries fails , there will not be sustainable development .
What are we doing in Europe ?
The result will be a Europe of ageing and poorly educated people .
We have to invest in research and product development .
The countries that have achieved this top all the available statistics .
Since the mid-1990s , 40 % of our competitiveness has been based on new technology , and in the United States the figure is 60 % .
Mr President , the EU budget for 2005 is now at second reading in Parliament .
I wish to thank the rapporteurs , Salvador Garriga Polledo and Anne Jensen , for their excellent work .
The EU budget for 2005 may well meet next year’s needs , but there are question marks over it .
The poor levels of implementation of the budget in recent years have now created a backlog .
That , however , is EUR 500 billion , or more than 1 % of the EU’s GDP.
The statement runs contrary to good budgetary policy as the budget has to include all known expenditure for the financial year .
It should be mentioned that at the same conciliation meeting it was agreed to increase the payment appropriations in the Structural Funds this year by EUR 3.7 billion , because funds have run out .
In the budget debate , the issue of the rapid rise in the number of Agencies in the European Union was raised .
In recent times , a lot of Agencies have been set up as a result of trade between Member States .
It might be that this way we are establishing units that are hard to monitor and which are partially responsible for creating nothing more than a double layer of bureaucracy .
We believe the system to be based on favouritism , which muddies the grounds for financial support , making them unclear .
Parliament should remain a legislative body and leave implementation tasks to the Commission , which would be the best way of monitoring impartiality .     Mr President , as the representative of my political group , I have been following the budget debate in the Committee on Budgets since the spring .
The problem from Parliament’s point of view is budgetary discipline , which does not recognise flexibility to any adequate extent .
The only way to create more flexibility would have been to terminate the interinstitutional agreement that came about in such strange circumstances , but Parliament has not been prepared to do that , in spite of the fact that the inflexibility of the budget has been common knowledge .
It is not just the volume of EU funding that is at issue , but what future action is to consist of in general .
The proposal by six countries for a ceiling on expenditure of 1 % is a stringent one .
It does not even reflect the extent of next year’s budget , although the transition phase for the new Member States is only just starting .
Will it end when it is a matter of money ?
The Commission ’s proposal puts great emphasis on improving employment and competitiveness .
Industry and enterprise cannot succeed if there is no serious research and development work .
We already have examples of this in the fields of space technology and particle research .
The creation of new research programmes must be based on the premise that they will focus on projects that call for Europe-wide cooperation .
There must also be more substantial production of training courses in connection with programmes of research .
Madam President , we have come a long way since Bulgaria applied for EU membership in 1995 and opened its negotiations in 2000 .
In the past few years Bulgaria has made steady progress in all areas in its preparation for accession and for meeting the Copenhagen criteria .
Substantial support from the Union is being provided as assistance to these efforts .
Overall , Bulgaria has consolidated and deepened the stability of its institutions .
We will , however , need to keep a close watch on some areas .
Bulgaria has made progress in gradually building up its administrative capacity but further efforts remain necessary in this regard in a number of areas .
It is also necessary to take account of a longer period between completion of the negotiations and the effective date of accession than in previous waves of accession .
The Commission will continue to keep the European Parliament informed of Bulgaria’s progress towards accession .
Bulgaria is on track for accession on 1 January 2007 .
Thus the Black Sea will become a new coastline for an enlarged and unified Europe .     .
I will respond to just a couple of the most central issues .
On the other hand , as Mr Nicolaï very clearly explained , each is being treated according to a differentiated approach , especially now the process is in its last stages and the monitoring system and safeguard clause are ways of ensuring that each country is assessed according to the extent to which they are able to implement the reforms and commitments that need to be fulfilled before these countries can accede to the Union .
That is quite right and I agree with those views expressed .
Bulgaria has recently drawn up a determined strategy to act against corruption .
This is in fact the main focus of Sub-Programme 4 under the PHARE programme and it will also become much more obviously the main focus over the coming two years , in 2005 and 2006 .
It took effect in January of this year and it is presently being implemented in conjunction with an anti-discriminatory action programme to improve the status of minorities .
