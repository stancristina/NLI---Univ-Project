These are vital life-line funds for jobs and growth .
I therefore welcome the fact that this House voted by a majority against cutting off resources .
The Commissioner would , in any case , have had no legal competence to stop approval and therefore I am glad that , at the end of the day , common sense has prevailed in our vote .
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted against Amendment No 7 because we do not feel that a reference to the supposed 'Echelon ' network is appropriate to this report .
Allegations that such an 'Echelon network ' exists are based on hearsay and circumstantial evidence .
Furthermore , the democratic oversight of national intelligence services is , in any case , primarily a matter for national parliaments .
The United Kingdom has one of the most effective systems of democratic oversight , both political and judicial , of its intelligence services in the world .
Political oversight is exercised by a House of Commons committee , which has full access to documentation .
Moreover , the intelligence operations of third countries , including the United States , operating in cooperation with British intelligence services within the United Kingdom , are also subject to the same democratic oversight .
- British Conservatives are in the forefront of those seeking to improve human rights in many parts of the world .
While there is much in the Malmström resolution that we can support , unfortunately there are significant elements that have been included which we find unacceptable .
For example , we do not share the enthusiasm for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We are sceptical about demands for substantial increases in expenditure and bureaucratic activity and in the role of EC-funded NGOs .
We are concerned that it is minority differences that are stimulated , with little emphasis on integration .
We are concerned at the extension of the concept of human rights to include , for example , domestic violence , which is properly a matter to be handled under other legal instruments .
We are opposed to the introduction of sweeping new categories of eligibility for asylum , which would be open to abuse .
Many of us do not support the abolition of capital punishment in principle .
And we are suspicious about proposals to impose further codes of conduct on business .
While we value the role of the EU in supporting human rights , we believe that human rights regulation and legislation , as in so many areas dealing with the relationship between the citizen and the state , is a matter for national governments , and we do not welcome an extension of EU intervention in this area .
It is for these reasons that British Conservatives have voted against the Malmström resolution .
Haarder report ( A5-0050/2000 )
- Obviously , we have no objection to a report on human rights being presented to the European Parliament but as all Member States of the European Union are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights and all citizens are therefore ( even if indirectly ) able to pursue cases of breach of these human rights to a Court of final arbitration , what concerns us is the way in which this report seems to go well beyond the important principles enshrined by the United Nations and the European Court of Human Rights .
It is not the primary function of this parliament to produce extensive and controversial additions to current legislation and extra channels of redress on an assumption that these should automatically be acceptable simply because they have been proposed .
All of us want human rights to be uppermost in the minds of national and European legislators .
In most cases they are .
We do not need this report either to remind us of them or to attempt to push the agenda into areas which are likely to be of great controversy and are likely to achieve counterproductive results instead of an enhancement of human rights already determined .
Mr President , I too am sorry that the vote will not now be taking place .
I am concerned , as are the other speakers , at the plight of the people in Iraq .
One should never forget that the plight of the people in Iraq is being inflicted upon them by their own government .
We should not forget that in January this year Parliament passed a resolution asking that the Kuwaiti prisoners of war still imprisoned in Iraq should be released or at least that details should be given to their families and that there should be compliance with the United Nations resolutions .
That has not happened and we must be quite unequivocal in sending the message to Iraq , and indeed to the people of Kuwait , that we in Europe are not going to forget and are not going to ignore the plight of those people still being improperly imprisoned in Iraq .
We want to make that message as loud and clear and unequivocal as we possibly can .
Mr President , I am pleased that we are debating this resolution today even though I would have preferred the ELDR resolution to have been the one we are debating .
India and Pakistan have carried on this conflict for over fifty years now .
There were UN resolutions that called for a plebiscite for the people of Kashmir all that time ago , and still nothing has happened .
It is even more important now that we find a solution , especially as both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers .
If there is another war across that border , I believe it could turn into a nuclear war , and that will be a problem not only for India and Pakistan and the people of Kashmir but for all of
