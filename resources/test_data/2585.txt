Next I would like to say a few words about Mr Fantuzzi 's report on measures to promote our agricultural products in third countries .
We are sympathetic towards the Commission 's move , but we believe that the favouritism shown to the olive oil sector is untenable in relation to all the other products which we would also like to sell on the world market .
However , we cannot endorse the proposal on national cofinancing .
That is why I believe that general promotional measures should be financed in full by the Union , and far more funding should be allocated for this than has been proposed by the Commission .
It is important for us to have an effective instrument to promote exports and react to US measures in this area .
However , where more specific sales promotions are concerned , I think that the private companies and producer organisations involved should also participate in the financing .
Mr President , the Europe of Nations Group would also like to congratulate Mr Prodi on his nomination .
We regard you , Mr Prodi , as a centralist and super-federalist in favour of a United States of Europe , and we are therefore going to vote against your appointment .
We regard you as Jacques Delors the Second .
We shall be critical every time you propose a step in the direction of more Union .
What we need now is not a new Commission , but a spring clean by independent individuals who can dispense with any Commission work which is not transnational in nature and introduce complete openness for what remains .
There should be an end to 50 years of secrecy and privilege .
It is scandalous that the current Commission , after its resignation , has decided that Mr Van Buitenen is not allowed to help the Belgian police to investigate any of the matters which led to the Commission 's downfall .
To personal friendship and political enmity : ' Benvenuto , Signor Prodi !
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I personally am going to vote against this report .
The proposal is a blatant example of a lack of respect for the principle of subsidiarity .
This question should be regulated nationally and between the social partners .
There is therefore no need for more EU rules in this area .
Unfortunately , this point of view has not gained much support in Parliament .
During the committee procedure , I proposed an amendment which would have allowed Member States to refrain from implementing the directive if the social partners agreed that adequate schemes already existed .
I would not like Member States which do not have adequate schemes for informing and consulting workers to be able to evade the directive .
That is why it is needed .
On the contrary , I am in favour of solidarity among workers in the EU , but at the same time I want a Member State such as Denmark - where over a period of more than 100 years the social partners have developed a successful model for information and consultation through collective agreements , in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue - to be allowed to retain such a system .
We dump waste and we incinerate it , neither of which is good for the environment .
It is clear that pollution has a great effect on human health .
Many women in Europe have high concentrations of dioxins in their breast milk .
This proposal on incineration brings the hope of a higher level of protection through a fall in dioxin emissions .
The idea of combining these directives is that the incineration of waste can create a pollution problem regardless of the type of waste being incinerated .
In addition , there was a risk that Europe could have had tougher limit values for the incineration of municipal waste than for hazardous waste , if we had allowed the Commission 's division of the areas to continue as presented to us .
There could perhaps also be a risk of cheating in the classification of waste .
Emissions from waste incineration , such as sulphur , nitrous oxides , dioxins and soot , should be treated in the same way , regardless of what is being incinerated .
But the point is that they should all comply with tighter emission standards .
So co-incineration , including in the cement industry , must comply with the requirements for tough emission values .
That is why critics who say that the combining of these two directives will lead to less protection for the environment are mistaken .
The Commission should also follow up the waste strategy which has been adopted , where we stress the importance of recycling and reuse .
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr LÃ³pez for an excellent report on a very complicated subject .
I think it is important , as Mr Schnellhardt also emphasised , for us to ensure that EMAS is a useful tool for our businesses here in Europe .
It must be understood that participation in the EMAS scheme is voluntary .
It is important that this scheme is as flexible and unbureaucratic as possible .
Now , if I may , I would like to comment on some amendments .
I hope very much that my colleagues - and the Commission too - will welcome them .
We in the Liberal Group are opposed to this proposal , because it would allow the use of the EMAS logo on products and packaging .
I heard my Austrian colleague talk about best available technology , or BAT.
We in the Liberal Group have asked for split votes on the amendments dealing with this concept , because we cannot support the inclusion of BAT in EMAS.
If BAT is included in
