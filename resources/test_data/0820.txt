We have ensured that the European Investment Bank is able to provide far more ambitious funding and that more young people are able to take part in educational exchange programmes .
We have also ensured that the EU budget for health and consumer protection was not subject to the swingeing cutbacks planned by the Heads of State or Government .
Let me give an example .
Parliament supported the Commission , but the result has only been EUR 7 billion .
I think that the Council owes us an answer regarding how the common projects can be made a reality .     Mr President , the European Parliament is now entering into a compromise with the Council of Ministers concerning the half-witted budget for the next seven years .
Danish farmers ’ total net income for agriculture is only a quarter of the direct subsidy .
Farmers could obtain four times more by way of total net income if the various arrangements were circumvented and the money sent to farmers directly .
The reality is that poor people in distant regions are direct net contributors to the EU budget .
In Latvia , 80 % of EU aid goes to Riga .
Poor people living in the countryside pay a large contribution to the EU via their daily purchases , but the money is not returned by the EU to those who pay .
Instead , allow the new countries not to have to pay contributions .
Begin rearranging the budget now by voting against the compromise on funding .     Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to thank our rapporteur , Mr Elles , for his visionary proposal regarding the work on the 2007 budget .
I would particularly draw attention to the new cost-benefit thinking in the budget whereby , year by year , we are to assess the value of the individual programmes in relation to their costs .
Now is the time for us to prepare the ground for reconfiguring the budgetary framework so that its focus is on new needs and no longer on things that do not work properly .
All of this work must take place in close cooperation with the specialist committees .
In the foreign policy area we must now comply with the new sets of rules whereby Parliament is involved in developing strategic frameworks and thus obtains a basis for monitoring the policy conducted .
We shall thus be able to see whether we are achieving the goals laid down by means of the budget .
The method of working to be used in this connection must , of course , be developed , and it is important that the work get off to a good start .
I should like , however , to emphasise that the appropriations for investment in transport are not at all in keeping with the Member States’ own ambitions for the trans-European networks .
It is the Member States that are responsible for coming up with the funding if they do not wish to pay via the budget .     Mr President , we are , today , debating with an honest advocate of a United States of Europe .
He does not deny the facts .
Unfortunately , it was overlooked in the constitutional Convention , and that courage failed him when Belgium was to ratify the Constitution .
The views of the Belgians were not to be heard through a referendum .
The United States of Europe – yes – but not by asking the people .
Take heart , Mr Verhofstadt .
Take your colleagues with you in burying this rejected Constitution .
Get proposals drawn up that can then be put to referendums in every country at the same time .
Put every document on the Internet .
Allow the Commissioners to appear in the European Committees of their national parliaments and thus to be in touch with their national democracies .
I am pleased that the programme contains a broad definition of innovation , so that this definition also includes non-technological innovation .
Adding value occurs at all stages of the value chain , which means that innovation in distribution , marketing or management is just as important as innovation in production .
One reason for this is that energy efficiency and renewable forms of energy are amongst the areas in which more innovation can make the biggest contribution to the competitiveness of the EU.
A substantial challenge in relation to the CIP is to achieve the necessary synergy effects in relation to other programmes .
I believe that it is essential to ensure sound coordination between the CIP , the Seventh Framework Programme for Research , the programme for Life-Long Learning and , especially , the Structural Funds .
If we are to increase the number of entrepreneurs in Europe then we must get more women to take on the challenge .
I hope that the Commission will focus on the gender-specific dimension in relation to entrepreneurship , and it pleases me a great deal that the programme will provide the opportunity for microfinance , since precisely this form of financing is of particular advantage to women .     Mr President , I would also very much like to thank Mr Grech for his constructive and thorough work on Parliament’s Budget for 2007 .
The first of these is that nearly half of the expenditure is caused by the geographical spread of Parliament’s activities and the fact that we work in many languages .
Secondly , I wish to emphasise the need constantly to reprioritise and to bring about greater efficiency , particularly with regard to staffing policy , where redeployment is required .
A third point that I would like to raise is the matter of the purchase of buildings in Strasbourg .
So we are forced , for the time being , to put the purchase of buildings on hold .
Personally , I would prefer it if Parliament were able to content
