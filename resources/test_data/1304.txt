we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning .
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law .
Without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people .
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate , 'necessarily with acute vigilance ' .
I wonder , since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber , whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government .
Does the Commission support the Council ?
Madam President , when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view , I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning , as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue , it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States .
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier .
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ?
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops .
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ?
Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee .
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened .
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves .
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC.
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study .
They need a political deal .
It is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months .
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda .
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at , especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries .
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree .
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated .
However , there are six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .
There is time .
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act .
It lasted only five months .
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year .
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason .
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda .
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view .
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles .
I thank the Commission for doing that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission said .
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward .
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that .
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.
That is all to the good .
The Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda .
I wish you every success , President of the Council , in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine ' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the French Presidency takes over , by the end of this year .
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted .
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner .
It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights .
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty
