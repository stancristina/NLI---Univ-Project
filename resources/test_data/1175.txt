away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another .
The consumer pays twice : he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods .
The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another .

Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions , it would still be unfair to third countries , the new EU countries and EU citizens .

It must be beyond doubt that there is a need to tighten up the EU 's sanctions against Burma .
The junta 's statement that Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested for the sake of her own safety is an insult to the intelligence of any thinking person , and I entirely agree with Mrs McKenna that we must immediately demand to know where she is , and obtain access to her .
It can therefore only be hoped that more stringent international sanctions will cause the military junta to mend its ideas .
I think it important that the Council should intensify its demands in terms of human rights and continue to support the UN 's special envoy .
They limit politicians ' power between elections , referendums and constitutional changes .
The draft EU constitution has instead become the politicians ' protection against the people .
Six or seven of the 13 will be people who can no longer be elected in their own countries and who can share the power among themselves after each election to the European Parliament .
In that way , Mr Blair can become President , Mr Fischer Foreign Minister and Mr Aznar President or Vice-President of the Commission .
EU leaders elect each other and are not accountable to the electorate .
One of them must have a majority in the European Parliament , but Parliament cannot elect a second .
If the Commission is elected , it can be overturned by a 2/3 majority , but Parliament still cannot elect a second one .
If the European Convention were to apply for EU membership on the basis of the present draft constitution , we should have to say that there were very fine objectives and values in Articles 2 and 3 , but why have you forgotten democracy ?
Why must the constitution not be approved by referendum in all the countries ?
That is in the interests of both the EU and the United States .
We therefore need closer institutional ties between NATO and the EU so that we might react more consistently to the new global challenges in terms of combating international terrorism , organised crime and the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
The EU must increasingly work in partnership with the Americans , and not in opposition to them .
The news we received from the foreign ministers ' meeting in Luxembourg concerning a stronger and more pro-active foreign and defence policy was therefore encouraging , and it is with great excitement that we now await the High Representative 's proposal for the first common European security strategy .
We can be happy about the fact that the Council generally wishes to strengthen European defence and cooperation around research and development in this area , but the proposal should also fully support the re-establishment of the transatlantic partnership .
In this connection , it has been gratifying to read what has been termed the Allbright declaration on this partnership .
I think that that is the task to which we first have to put our minds , and I should like to see us beginning to talk about what our priorities are to be .
Some of those priorities have been given all too little weight for many years , and it is an obvious task for a specifically cooperative organisation like the EU , which is based upon agreements between old enemies .
I should like to hear what the Council 's and the Commission 's plans are in anticipation of the UN meeting in July on the control of light weapons , for this is one of those areas in which the EU could have a role to play .
We have a code of conduct from 1998 - mentioned , I believe , by Commissioner Patten - but , of course , weapons prove , all the same , to end up in the wrong hands and on the wrong markets .
We can do this with dairy cows in the EU.
Would it not be marvellous if we could do the same with weapons ?
What plans exist for doing so ?
Mr President , the supranational political parties are artificial products that are in no position to collect voluntary contributions from ordinary people .
Those who are to use the money can themselves decide how much they want .
