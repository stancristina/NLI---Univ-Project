fraud .
It may well be that it is not a final or a complete proposal , but at least the debate has got underway .
I hope we shall meet on numerous occasions when you have left Parliament .
You have always had a great social heart .
I hope we shall meet again .
In the municipality I live in , no taxpayer would accept that 10 % of the local authority 's budget should be lost in fraud .
I think it is the same for everyone in this Chamber .
In my view the explanation lies in the distance from the voters , the distance from those who have to pay .
The solution therefore is no more Brussels , with more staff , more grants , common criminal justice and police .
The cheapest and best way of dealing with fraud is to ensure complete openness on appropriations .
That way journalists and a critical public would enforce the necessary self-accountability .
We prefer full openness to a new bureaucracy in Brussels , a leaner and more transparent EU instead of fat times for yet more fraudsters .
Commissioner , I would like to ask whether consideration has already been given as things stand to ways of tightening up the rules and improving them for the purposes of future tests .
Indeed it has implications for the EU 's reputation too .
I can promise you , Commissioner , that we will be given a hard time in the election campaign that is due to get underway soon now .
Do you share these concerns with me , Commissioner ?
Mr President , it is the last part of the Commissioner 's answer regarding the other budget lines that I am interested in .
There is , for example , NGO cofinancing .
Is it possible , for example , to take money from the NGO cofinancing budget , where it currently is , and in certain cases make transfers , even if the amounts are very small , so that money can be made available for this very , very important area ?
We are after all in complete agreement that it is essential for the developing countries themselves to be included in the WTO negotiations .
I am always happy to tell them that we in Parliament 's Committee on Transport and Tourism have worked unremittingly , in Strasbourg and Brussels , to improve safety in all forms of transport .
Our commitment to ferry safety , in particular , is well known , which is reflected in the report we are discussing today .
I do not mind saying that I myself make 200 sea crossings a year , so I know the ferries .
After all , they should apply throughout the world .
Given the profusion of flag states and different legislation , it is necessary to have directives which ensure that trained seafarers are employed , port state control is applied and so on .
Ferries will be moved outside the EU and so forth .
But , as I have said , one might wish that this approach based on the Watts report and the Commission proposal could be the beginning of a global initiative which will ensure safety at sea everywhere .
Again and again we come up against the need to incorporate IMO measures into Community law .
At this time - unfortunately , it might be said - a book is coming out in Denmark which deals with the Estonia accident .
I hope that this directive , but not least the implementation of the directive , will help to strengthen the common legislation and guarantee safety in the future .
They relate to Amendments Nos 2 , 15 , 16 and 17 , since it is debatable to what extent the Commission should have the power to act .
But leave that to one side for the moment .
Mr Swoboda also said something on those lines .
Many of us feel the same way about all these traffic planners .
We suspect them of making it a little too simple .
We must be clear that the aim of this communication from the Commission is to secure the strategy .
But the strategy only works if one is able to ensure that neighbouring countries and Member States are serious and will honour their commitments .
To begin with , the partnership which is to create a transport network extending into the next century will also , in the context of an enlarged internal market , help to secure growth possibilities and have a decisive influence on the sustainability of the pan-European project .
I cannot associate myself with Mr Wijsenbeek 's remarks regarding the new applicant countries .
Secondly , the communication represents a huge leap forward , without subsidiary aims or description of methods .
Perhaps they are not appropriate at the present stage , but we ourselves know the situation when neighbouring countries disagree over strategy and method .
It is even more difficult when the Union takes one view and the neighbouring country takes another .
I could conceive of a process of step-by-step agreements , so that a common way forward is assured .
Yes , but I know of both good and bad examples .
A third comment relates to ambitious technological projects , such as satellites , telematics , traffic service , etc .
We talked earlier about black boxes .
That would indeed be a way forward , which could prevent many accidents , but unfortunately we cannot implement these proposals .
I think it important to note that a concrete step has now been taken in determining how the fraud investigation unit , UCLAF , can be strengthened .
Parliament has once again taken the initiative and put forward a concrete proposal .
So now it is up to the Commission to react to that proposal and draw up measures to strengthen UCLAF .
