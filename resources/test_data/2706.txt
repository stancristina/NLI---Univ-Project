process .
We trust that those initiatives will be adopted as soon as possible .
Should that proposal be adopted , nothing will change and we will not make any headway in combating these crimes .
The access given to the public vehicle registration authorities will be clearly defined and limited to what is necessary and appropriate , in other words , solely concerning objects , in other words , the vehicles themselves , in order to ascertain from the system whether or not the vehicle in question has been stolen .
I therefore welcome the Commission ’s two communications .
The current system clearly has its shortcomings .
I should like to reiterate our call for economic aid to be increased , with no provisos attached , for the regions of origin of migratory flows , with the aim of reducing those flows and of promoting solidarity with the poorest countries and with the people who are most in need .
Consequently , it is essential that we establish a policy that encompasses three key elements : firstly , the application of the Geneva Convention ; secondly , the legitimate aspirations of citizens of third countries to seek better living conditions ; and thirdly , the capacity of each Member State , and that of the EU as a whole , to welcome refugees .
The Commission was called on to explore all parameters in order to ensure more orderly and managed entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection , and to examine how the regions of origin may better ensure the safety of those persons .
What geopolitical state of affairs will result from the adoption of new external borders for the EU , which will lie not only outside Europe but also on the doorstep of armed conflicts ?
These observations do not imply that we have any less regard for the great Turkish nation ; far from it .
Opting for the so-called ‘legislative harmonisation packages ’ has enabled Turkey to bring its legislation into line with EU standards more quickly than would have been the case if it had conducted an across-the-board review of the basic legal codes on which its political , judicial and legislative system is founded .
This regulation is part of a package of regulations that aims at strengthening mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States , in this case in the field of excise duties , in which tobacco smuggling is particularly significant .
It gives the green light for the European Union to accede to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean .
By establishing a Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) , the convention aims at ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the highly migratory fish stocks in those areas .
In 2001 , Parliament and the Council rejected the previous proposal , which sought the financing of national measures in this area , which was unacceptable and removed the strategic importance of ensuring the maintenance of biodiversity , particularly in view of the Community’s commitments under the various relevant international United Nations conventions .
I thus believe that the objectives of the amendments agreed in May 2003 to the Protocol currently in force , concerning a reduction in fishing effort and support measures for sustainable fishing , are acceptable .
The waters of Guinea-Bissau , which used to be abundant in fish and crustaceans , have suffered from overexploitation of their resources .
The European Parliament is thus sending out a positive signal in support of the Guinea-Bissau authorities ’ efforts to stabilise the country .     . – I have been following social and political developments in Guinea-Bissau with great concern .
This is my sincere hope .
Secondly , the Commission could have taken the opportunity to carry out a general review of the regulation and increased the maximum amounts of individual aid payments ; this is something that Parliament’s amendments attempt to address , even though they do not go far enough .     . – Parliament has once again been called upon for its opinion on a strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture , as part of the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy .
This seems too long to me .
To take account of , and implement , the recommendations under the strategy , the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance ( FIFG ) – that is , Regulation (EC ) No 2792/1999 – has had to be amended .
This proposal , however , intends to restrict access to funding just to the new Member States and , even then , with a contribution rate of only 35 % .
In this context , I support the establishment of cross-border exchange of information , as this is a simple , useful way of imposing sanctions across the EU that are effective , proportionate and , most of all , dissuasive .
At the same time , the initiative to simplify and tighten up the allocation of funding is commendable .     . – The adoption of the regulation on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources broadened the objectives set out in the common fisheries policy and necessarily created new rules for enforcement .
As the report addresses this main requirement , I voted for it .     . – Regulation (EC ) No 3069/95 establishes that observers should be placed on board all vessels operating in the Northwest Atlantic , regulated by the regional organisation NAFO.
Since the euro changeover , there has been a growing number of cases of fraudulent use of fake euro coins in coin-operated machines .
The aim is , above all , to protect the public from any kind of fraud and to safeguard the currency .
