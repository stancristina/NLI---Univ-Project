today voted in favour of Mr Santini 's report ( A5-0312/2002 ) .
We are nonetheless aware of the fact that the directive is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark , cf . the protocol on Denmark 's position .
Activities of the European Ombudsman ( 2001 ) Deliberations of the Committee on Petitions 2001-2002 Mr President , the task of Ombudsman demands both great patience and considerable optimism in terms of getting the EU institutions to comply with basic demands concerning the Rule of Law and democratic accountability .
It is difficult to sustain optimism , however .
Absolute power does not only result in passivity ; it is revealed in the active opposition to the Ombudsman 's efforts to introduce the Nordic countries ' administrative culture into the institutions of the EU.
One has only to read about the latest victim of the arrogance of power .
Data protection is used not to protect citizens ' private lives but to secure the Commission 's monopoly on knowledge .
The Ombudsman 's right to gather uncensored information is sabotaged outright by the Commission .
I would take the liberty of referring to the Ombudsman 's brilliant answer to the Commission 's scandalous statement of 6 March of this year , a statement characterised by the Ombudsman in terms of the negative points of view and false assumptions it contained .
With his latest report , Mr Söderman deserves a big thank-you for having tried to make the way shorter , but his departure gives new topicality to the issue of whether we shall ever reach the end of the road or only remain at the start of it .
There are an appallingly large number of witnesses to the fact that the answer might be in the affirmative .
Mr President , I must also applaud the splendid work done by Mr Söderman as European Ombudsman .
We must have institutions that fight for citizens ' rights in the EU.
It is our task to ensure that citizens are also given resources to campaign themselves for their own rights .
That , moreover , is precisely the job of the European Ombudsman .
It is therefore also our task in the European Parliament to ensure that the Ombudsman is given the opportunities and the tools that make for the right working conditions , including access to documents and the opportunity of talking with employees and obtaining clear answers .
I would urge the Danish Presidency to make efforts along these lines in order to ensure that the European Ombudsman is able to operate as intended .
Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Boudjenah on this successful report which highlights as something positive the fact that the Commission wishes to introduce a free-trade area between the EU and the ACP countries .
Instead , this is , as several other fellow MEPs have also pointed out , the EU 's heavily subsidised agricultural exports .
Simple economic theory therefore tells us that African countries would have a superior position in the sugar market and that opening up the markets would be the route to growth .
Nor , of course , will the situation change through the ACP countries ' developing internal markets .
They stand in the way of any development and of any fight against poverty .
Mr President , the train that began its journey in Helsinki is now only two stations from its destination .
It is very gratifying indeed that it has been possible to push ahead with the Commission 's progress report to such an extent that it has appeared a month earlier than last year 's , and it is also gratifying that we now have a complete basis for making decisions as to which countries are ready to conclude the enlargement negotiations .
To begin with , I should like to thank the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for the commitment and the energy they have shown right from the start in carrying out this historic task .
It has been a pleasure to note and observe their commitment , which also shines through here in Parliament today .
The Commission has come to the view that ten countries are ready to conclude the negotiations .
On certain points , there is a need for further efforts with regard to administrative capacity , and the Commission proposes that consideration continue to be given to the candidate countries ' preparations for membership .
According to the Commission , Bulgaria and Romania have made good progress since the last reports , but are still not so far forward that the negotiations can be concluded .
The Commission notes that Turkey has made great progress towards fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria .
It is also noted that there is still some way to go , and Turkey is therefore being encouraged to carry out further reforms and to implement reforms already adopted so that it continues to improve its prospects of membership .
With regard to the Seville conclusions , Copenhagen will be the decisive moment in the development of the relationship between the EU and Turkey .
In the run-up to the Brussels European Council , we must not now pre-empt the decisions to be made in Copenhagen .
The Commission calls upon all the parties involved , and Turkey in particular , to take active steps to bring about a solution before the conclusion of Cyprus 's negotiations for accession to the EU.
Finally , I want to endorse what the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have said about the Irish vote , and I want to concur with the words of the President of the Commission about the risks and costs of not enlarging the EU , for the risks and costs of non-enlargement are much greater
