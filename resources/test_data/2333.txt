I therefore believe we should all show solidarity and support this report .
Similarly , I deplore the report 's abuse of the word 'charity ' , which is reviled and taken out of context , ignoring its real theological and semantic meanings and replacing them with a populist clich√© that is incorrect and unhelpful .
I am also aware that it is certainly possible to improve it in future and to make it more operational , as proposed in item 4 of Mr Sylla 's report .
The Union is also working on an area of freedom , security and justice which , it is hoped , will contribute to defining its true identity as a political union that respects the fundamental values of the democratic rule of law .
We also intend to launch a study to assess the form that the Commission 's programmes should take in order to ensure that they are coherent and effective .
Central to this Constitution , according to the conclusions of the Convention on the Future of Europe , will be the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which was adopted by the preceding Convention and which received the political endorsement of the three institutions at the Nice European Council .
We will then be able to construct a genuine fundamental rights policy in the Union , implement it ourselves and thereby set an example to the entire world .
I think not .
Furthermore , I must inform you that the Portuguese authorities are continuing to modernise their prison system and to make it more humane , without harbouring the illusion , of course , that they can do overnight everything that has not been done to date .
We can see the progress made in 2002 with the adoption of various instruments that constitute the first steps towards a common immigration and asylum policy .

The financing of female participation in business should be promoted .
( PT ) I voted against this report , not because I consider less widely-spoken European regional languages to be undeserving of respect , protection and dissemination , but because I feel that the rapporteur 's approach to this question gives impetus to separatist tendencies within the Member States .
I recognise the need to preserve Europe 's cultural and linguistic diversity , but I feel that pushing for the establishment of yet another European agency to that end is a signal that ? ( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
A complementary move is now afoot to reorganise some Structural Funds and Community programmes with a view to dealing with the effects of the disaster ; that move has also been given a boost .
Fire prevention in southern European countries should be encouraged through binding measures to which the governments of the Member States must strictly adhere .
Today 's Cuban 'socialism ' cannot be exported beyond the island 's shores .
Since I am in agreement with the resolution 's main points but feel it does not go far enough , I abstained from voting on it .
Their aim is to destabilise Cuban institutions and even propitiate conditions which could act as a pretext for a military attack on Cuba .
' Cooperation ' should not be used as a means of interference .
The European Parliament had to take a firm political stand against Fidel Castro 's regime .
In 2003 , the regime responded to that message by taking more political prisoners , by continuing to violate human rights and trample the rule of law under foot .
( PT ) I am delighted with the compromise resolution , which was approved unamended .
I hope that the Council and the Commission will now follow it up properly .
In it , countries listed as 'friends ' are defended , while those listed as US or EU targets are criticised , thereby applying double standards .
We need a rigorous and effective assessment of the quality of that protection , enabling a clear overview of the current situation as regards fundamental rights .
The charter only applies to the latter however , when they are implementing Union law , as Article 51 makes clear .
( PT ) The rapporteur steered a straight course towards this one-sided and partisan assessment of the situation as regards human rights , choosing to ignore the common interest and the institutional assessment which should guide work in this area .
I could do nothing other than vote against this report .
While the shortage of drinking water in developing countries has worsened , however , the privatisation of water utilities continues apace , particularly as a result of the conditions for receiving loans imposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , and structural adjustment programmes which weaken public services and induce under-investment in this sector .
( PT ) More than 2.5 billion people in developing countries have no drinking water , and 3 million die every year from water-borne diseases such as typhoid fever , dysentery , cholera , hepatitis , malaria , trachoma , fluorosis , and Japanese encephalitis .
( PT ) To quote the rapporteur , who is a member of my own political group , if we want fairer trade , contributing to sustainable development and to the fight against poverty , concrete measures must be introduced at the forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun to take account of developing countries ' requirements as regards world trade .
The injustices of world trade are the fruit of the development and global expansion of the capitalist system itself .

History tells us that attempting to change the 'economic ' climate by imposing legislative restrictions has little effect .
Secondly , it should raise standards of effectiveness and transparency of aid through a strategy which respects precise goals and timetables ; is
