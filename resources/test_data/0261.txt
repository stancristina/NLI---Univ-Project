The UN Human Rights Commission should adopt the resolution defending human rights in China and the position of Tibet .
There is really no room for it , as there is a danger that structural unemployment in the industrialized countries could rise as high as 30-40 % if the world economy continues to develop as it seems to be doing at the moment .
I also believe , as regards Mr von Wogau 's criticism of Mr Wolf just now , that what Mr Wolf meant was of course that whole sectors of the economy are excluded from taxation .
I believe they are very promising .
Now it should be possible to decide on taxation jointly , but as we all know , our problem is that all the Member States have to be in complete agreement before anything at all can be done .
The result is that nothing is done .
It is no wonder that it has proved impossible to do anything about unemployment .
Mr President , we have to be strict about not allowing Member States to collect tax on driving licences annually .
I failed completely to understand why a centralized monitoring system in the form of a register of penalty points should be introduced in connection with driving licences .
The wearing of glasses or contact lenses with a strength of +/-4 does not in any way hinder their driving .
There are proportionally more long-sighted people working as professional drivers than in any other profession .
Parliament will have to request immediate negotiations between the bodies concerned in order to correct the directive in this respect .
In the report of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy Mr Argyros has taken due note of the points made concerning these issues in the opinions of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment in particular .
Research into the social impact of innovations should therefore form a part of innovation policy .
Finally , I should like to emphasize that the innovation policy presented by the Commission focuses too much on technology .
Social innovations and cultural innovations should be supported by the EU , particularly since these areas are becoming more important in safeguarding individual well-being and improving employment prospects .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner .
As far as the share allocated to third world countries is concerned , where the problems are severe , the amount is really negligible , a mere five per cent .
Since the aim is to improve the procedure for project selection by laying down new criteria to govern eligibility for financial assistance , the entire application procedure should be made as clear and as open as possible .
They should promote the development and application of the most useful technology available .
A clean , viable environment is fundamental to the future of mankind .
This is why I consider it very important that the results of these projects are communicated efficiently , so that the information can be circulated as widely as possible .
Overland traffic in Central Europe is increasing at a rate of 5 % a year , which leads to an increase in congestion .
Short sea shipping makes sense and is a suitable form of transport for the most remote European areas , such as the Baltic Sea , the Mediterranean and the Black Sea .
Increased accessibility for EU vessels to Russia 's inland waterways is also a way of developing financial ties between the European Union and Russia .
In particular this would create significant opportunities for developing the Saimaa waterway network in eastern Finland .
Despite a long tradition of co-operation in shipping in the Baltic area , going back as far as the Hanseatic League , and despite the fact that sea shippings on the Baltic Sea generally are known to be ecologically beneficial and efficient forms of transport , transport in this area is slower and more difficult than transport across the continent .
A good example of this is the rail-ship combination , which is expected to increase strongly due to demand .
Transport connections to northern Europe which work well are obviously beneficial to trade in the entire EU.
The Baltic area should consequently be given similar status in EU traffic policy as has already occurred in the Mediterranean area .
I am referring to the transport of oil in European waters - oil transportation , both in small and large vessels , should be prohibited unless the vessels are equipped with a double hull .
Mr President , the common denominator in this morning 's reports is that they all want to keep strictly to the schedule and criteria set for EMU, regardless of the consequences .
In any case EMU will cause divisions in the Union , and taking into consideration an expansion from the Eastern bloc there will be at least a 'three-speed ' union .
As far as employment especially is concerned the internal market has hardly had any positive effect .
The Commissioner has also chosen to present this report during the summit in Florence .
The Green Group unanimously supports a healthy economic policy , where there is an equilibrium in the public sector and where budget resources do not have to be largely spent on interest payments on public loans .
Another reason for a postponement of the EMU schedule is that it makes a genuine rapprochement between the economies in the EU countries possible .
This objective has been voiced by many Member States with high unemployment and also by the European Union .
Above all the Green Group proposes a thorough reform of taxation .
The Commission has recently published an interesting document on taxation within the European Union .
No solutions regarding taxation have been achieved at the EU level , and I would like
