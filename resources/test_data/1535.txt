the region .
It is not what recommendations have been made and must be made , but it is how existing recommendations , and the initiatives that have already been taken , will be implemented and bring about a result .
It would be much more effective if , instead of mediators , instead of a multiplicity of opinions , we set about creating one body , in which all the institutions could participate and which would be headed by an individual with a proven knowledge of foreign policy and of the problems of the region .
What remains of significance are the prerequisites for a solution .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , I think we have arrived at a point where we have no room for manoeuvre .
Mr President , both of the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner made some interesting points .
I too believe that the discussions taking place in Russia are sending out a positive message that could be taken on board .
The reasons for this are , firstly , because this very nationality is in doubt and , secondly , because the borders are so short , and the situation so fragmented , that we will turn the Balkans into a sieve .
The second issue is that we have heard a lot about Milosevic - with which I agree .
This is important for us to understand the whole issue as a problem for the Serbian people itself and for us to deal with anxieties and problems .
We need to look at it with a clear head .
They want a peaceful settlement with respect for all minorities ' rights , and they want with independence without separation , because otherwise we will never find a lasting settlement in Europe .
But Kosovo is an integral part of the Yugoslavian Federation .
We are categorically opposed to any form of military intervention because it would have horrendous consequences .
Mr President , first of all I must congratulate the British presidency on the very complete and comprehensive Cardiff declaration .
The leaders in Belgrade need reflect on their heavy responsibilities towards the muchafflicted Serbian people and to consider where the imprudent policy of armed confrontation , the responsibility for which lies in the political and military regime of present-day Yugoslavia , is leading the Serbian people and the people of Montenegro .
Turning now to the people of Kosovo , I wish to emphasize the importance of the European call for self-restraint and for support for Dr Rugova .
Madam President , the vastly important contribution of medical devices to the quality of public health service provision has been acknowledged here .
To start with , the proposal was considered constructive , not only as it would have been useful for the reasons I have mentioned , but also as it contained many elements which would have contributed to a better qualitative control of in vitro diagnostic devices .
Next , the devices of human origin which are used in in-vitro diagnostic methods have been clearly defined , and the number of reagents which are classed under Annex 2 has increased , given that the reagents in this Annex are subject to considerable control .
That is why this Directive is of benefit both to the industries that produce the devices and to users , who will be able to use them with confidence .
The issue here is that we have a minority which has deep cultural roots going even further back than Ancient Greek civilization .
Especially with regard to the Assyrian minority .
My question refers to the specific event which took place there , which should to be condemned , and to the explanations that have been demanded and to those that have given by the Turkish government .
You have answered another question , which I did not ask you .
Your country signed the Corfu Protocol of 1914 , which refers to autonomy in northern Epirus .
Mr President , salmon , herring and other sea-foods make the issue very appetizing and appealing .
This policy has had particularly negative effects on coastal and small-scale fisheries , which show reduced levels of production and employment as well as a reduction in their share of the total fish market , to the benefit of large-scale fishing industries .
Any attempt to organize the market for fisheries products must therefore be aimed at the protection and balanced growth of the fishing industry .
Measures must be taken to tackle illegal fishing and the landing and trade of fisheries products , as these will have positive repercussions for consumers who will have greater guarantees of product quality and price stability .
I will submit them in a written explanation of the vote , as this matter of the fisheries industry , which really is extremely important for the Community , must be tackled by the Commission with both prudence and gravity .
This considerable increase in Community production has created huge reserves , while in many cases the difference between the price from the producer and the retail price has created problems of competition .
It is also necessary to preserve the intervention mechanism and the intervention price in order to ensure market and price stability in a sector where production varies considerably from year to year .
Madam President , today 's debate , which is the result of a procedure that certainly was not the best , concerns a product which is important from every viewpoint .
This proposal is one which , with some improvements , can lead to what we are calling for .
The system of intervention must be preserved as a safety net for the producer .
This same time scale must be implemented for the common organization of the market in olive oil .
Madam President , when we speak about olive oil producers there are three things we must not forget .
