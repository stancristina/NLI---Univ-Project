If anyone should understand the importance of trade without customs and barriers then it should be us , here in Europe .
The first myth is that consumers are calling for this measure , but the truth is that most do not care .
The third myth is that marking strengthens European competitiveness , but new technical barriers to trade to protect European industry have nothing to do with competitiveness , which is strengthened only by open markets within a good business environment .
Thus the cost would be in the millions , maybe even the billions .
To now require it of third countries without recognising that , in this case too , it is protectionism , smacks of hypocrisy , in my view .     Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , many Finns have been amazed that Finland can maintain a road tax that has made it almost impossible for people to buy cars abroad and has forced them to pay much higher prices than others .
It is important for us to devise a road tax based on how much pollution is caused by cars .
As I say , new cars are also safer .
This proposal too will leave it entirely up to the individual Member States to decide to what extent they wish to tax motoring .
What we are taking a decision about in this case is the structure and system of taxation with a view to facilitating the internal market .
I should like to say to our Danish fellow MEP , Mrs Auken , that what is important for us is to obtain new , modern cars .
I wish to emphasise how constructive it is that , in her report , Mrs Riis-Jørgensen has also included a proposal for having tax incentives for new types of vehicle , for example hybrid cars or cars propelled by other fuels , as this would perhaps also lead to the motoring world being quicker to take increased account of the environment .
It is , however , also important that , through this approach to car taxation , we give the European car industry an opportunity to develop more quickly in terms of its response to environmental considerations .
Those women and children who are subject to violence need the Daphne III programme .
Myths about the involvement of alcohol or drugs continue to flourish .
Having a joint programme for these two different social problems would be to perpetuate the myths that there is a connection between drug and alcohol abuse and violence against women by men .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left gives its full support to this report .
There are two terms in the report that I would like to see changed .
The other term I would question is ‘private life’ .
For as long as we do not agree that abuse , both physical and psychological , is also a violation of human rights for women and children , millions of women and children will be subjected to exactly that .
This means that we need to stir up a debate in workplaces , in schools , at the dinner table and even amongst the peace-keeping soldiers we send abroad in the name of the UN.
Those countries with which we have agreements need support .
There is much to do in this field .
There is room for thought on this matter .
However , we do not believe that additional resources should be allocated to the Maritime Safety Agency .
The current Member States do not share a common point of view in these areas , while their legal cultures also differ .
This claim is not backed up either by statistics or references to scientific studies .
It may be possible for us to accept registration taxes in the future if they are designed in such a way as to result in clear benefits for the environment .     , . – Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs , who have worked very well together .
We all have systems that build on solidarity with those who are unemployed or sick or who have suffered industrial injuries .
If the social model is based on common values within different systems , this means that we can learn from one another in the course of the process that we now find ourselves in .
In view of the demographic change , we must also show solidarity with the next generation .
Amongst other things , this means having reasonable working hours .
As far as globalisation is concerned , there are two ways to go .
The first of these is to copy the economies of our competitors , China and India , namely in terms of wages , labour market conditions and the like .
People involved in a changing labour market need to feel secure .
I likewise do not see any incompatibility between competition policy and employment policy .
With competition in mind , it must not become difficult to recruit new workers .
In this way , voters are being lied to .     In this report , the rapporteurs propose a host of measures that should be taken in order to solve problems relating to employment and social policy .
I have thus voted against the report as a whole .     The mental health of the population of each Member State is an issue that should be dealt with exclusively at national level .
We believe that the EU’s destructive and immoral fisheries agreements should be abolished .
I have thus voted in favour of the report .     Mr President , the EU is using the conflict between Israel and Lebanon as a pretext for strengthening the common foreign and security policy .
The international community must become better at preventing conflicts
