cases , if the ground for invalidation of a design obtains only in respect of one or some Member States , invalidity shall be declared only in respect of such a Member State or States .
The whole process proves that Parliament was right to adopt the approach in creating the directive first , followed by the resolution .
Since the Commission ' s proposal followed the wording of the directive almost to the letter , it received our support .
We do not agree with this interpretation and would go as far to suggest that the amendment in question includes certain distortions .
I should also like to point out , as a result of those gremlins which sometimes appear in this House , that the Committee on Petitions ' conclusions were not incorporated in the rapporteur ' s report .
This is why I urge you to approve the two amendments tabled by the Committee on Petitions that are no more and no less than a clear reflection of the Committee on Petitions ' concern regarding the procedures used for handling citizens ' complaints .
The rapporteur is absolutely right , Mr President , to say that these amendments , though very interesting , are not relevant in this case .
I should like to mention a few points in relation to Mrs Grossetête ' s report .
I believe that this is an essential point because the Prime Minister of Portugal , over recent months , has indicated that he is firmly committed to defending these common values .
I would like to highlight the importance of the agreement which has been reached on taxation , because the European Union cannot make progress in the social field if the increasing discrepancy between employment incomes and capital incomes persists .
I hope that Mr Seixas da Costa ' s personal opinion can be endorsed by the out-going President of the Council , because I believe that would be very positive .
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency has shown signs of patience and perseverance and has defended our common values .
I am talking about a serious interinstitutional problem , since this Parliament is not undergoing a codecision procedure , it is not tabling amendments .
At least , I would support you if the directive were reformed .
This is because no company is going to accept its implications in terms of investment and change , unless it knows that it will be guaranteed the possibility of having access to the free circulation of information .
Lastly , cancellation .
My political group , and practically all the others , are complying with the existing regulations .
However , when free to do so , each group has managed its finances in the way they considered appropriate .
It is not your direct responsibility , but you already know that we believe that a lot of funds are wasted as a result of this passive attitude , the lack of motivation amongst officials and the failure to take responsibility , because people are too concerned with controlling errors or seeking their own promotion .
Thirdly , we should not have cooperation or integration of a variable composition , since that would mean a Europe á la carte , that is to say , an ungovernable Europe .
It would at least be a step forward in terms of this clarification which we are all requesting , but which we never get to see , at least with regard to something which must not be forgotten , Mr President , i .e . the distribution of competences in the European Union .
They were a defeat in the sense that , for the first time in its short independent life , Zimbabwe has a multi-party political system , which was something that Mugabe clearly opposed .
This relative consolidation of a new urban vote , together with the manipulation of official democracy and the violation of human rights , would not otherwise have led to many citizens voting against him , and that is what they have done .
Unfortunately they are nothing new .
A year ago in October , the Tampere agreements were adopted .
All of this is interconnected .
Anything else is mere verbiage and preaching .
This six-month period , with the French Presidency of the Council , will be decisive in terms of completing the negotiation of these agreements , including , amongst others , the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco .
There is an irrefutable fact in her report : category 4 , which was approved in Berlin , may become insufficient if we continue to add the funding of new commitments .
I believe that - as he says - we must enter into trialogue with very open minds .
Once again , the insufficiency of what was adopted in Berlin , in March 1999 , for external policy , rocks the foundations of the Community budget .
Just imagine .
Let us not push things to the limit .
You have demonstrated this in your reply .
We know these measures would be difficult to implement but , in any event , any advance in this respect would save human lives and contribute to the pacification of truly dramatic conflicts in Africa .
I believe that these practices , as well as the possible substitution of the well-known national monopolies by a European oligopoly , should be combated relentlessly by the services which come under the responsibility of the Commission .
As regards what some have said , it is true that there is no timetable .
In that respect , there is a will to seek an establishment of tariffs which will lead to an increase in exchanges and clear access to the network .
We need to hold a reasoned debate on the possibilities available to us , in terms of sources and the guarantees of supply , in the light of the Kyoto commitments
