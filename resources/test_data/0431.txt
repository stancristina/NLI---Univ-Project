during its presidential term , should together also begin to draft the next Northern Dimension Action Plan , as the current one becomes void at the end of 2003 .
This is about cooperation between the whole of the European Union and its northern neighbouring regions and not just cooperation between the northernmost Member States and such counties as Russia , Iceland , Norway and Greenland .
For example , the gap that exists between the standard of living in Russia and that in the European Union and the difference in the rate of development are so enormous that this in itself constitutes a threat to security .
- ( FI ) I wish to indicate in the way I vote my support for considering the point of view of farmers with regard to GM labelling .
At the moment farmers cannot completely guarantee that the food or raw materials they produce are GM free .
Any reduction in this will not significantly improve consumer protection ; on the contrary , the system will be prone to incorrect labelling .
Extending traceability to livestock products , where GM feed has been used in feeding the animals , is not a realistic idea .
It will prove cumbersome and will not significantly increase levels of safety for the consumer .
For the reasons outlined above I voted in favour of supporting the legal protection of farmers where it related to this issue .
Mr President , I voted against this report because I do not believe it falls within our competence .
Rights at the expense of the unborn child and also , therefore , at the expense of humanity .
Human life cannot be subject to voting .
Mr President , the fight against terrorism has also led to excessive military strikes and an excess of justifiable defence , which can easily defeat their purpose .
That is especially true now that we have our attitude to the charter of the International Criminal Court as well as peacekeeping in Bosnia to consider .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my thanks for this excellent report .
The media is also decidedly centralised , and I have not seen the Commission interfere very much in that .
A company will thus have a considerable market share in a group of ten countries .
I do hope the Commission will address the situation and assess the globally important market position .
The Union 's binding principle of social cohesion requires that the business interface takes account of social welfare and labour law , and let us also mention the rights of shareholders , which is also part of the social cohesion system we have decided to embrace .
The Sixth Environmental Action Programme approved the principle that the volume of waste generated should be de-coupled from economic growth .
For this reason , in any revision of the 1994 directive ambitious targets must be set , as the rapporteur , Mrs Corbey , has also stated .
It is not wise to establish any rigid hierarchy with regard to re-use and recycling ; in some countries recycling works better , whilst in some regions re-use is more effective .
For example , in Finland the re-use of soft drinks and beer bottles works excellently , and must therefore be encouraged , but in a way that allows everyone to be involved in this system openly .
When we discussed this directive with various parties , we noticed that there are just as many experts as there are interested parties associated with the materials .
Recycling is also an excellent solution when talking of sustainable development as a combination of social , economic and environmental policy .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , I would also like to thank my colleague , Mrs Corbey , for a well prepared report .
The Commission 's proposal for a general level of recycling regarding packaging waste is an ambitious aim , but it is attainable on certain conditions .
Material-specific recycling targets should be closer to one another .
Material-specific targets within the EU accord a different status to each material , but Member States are also in an unequal position if their practices regarding packaging and , as a consequence , the proportion of different packaging materials they use varies greatly from one to another .
Whether the re-use of packaging should be encouraged must be assessed on a case-by-case basis .
Recycling for the sake of recycling itself is something we have no need of ; it must mean a genuine saving .
By virtue of its legislative nature the directive should still allow for flexibility on the part of Member States in its implementation .
Population density and distance will be the deciding factors in assessing whether recycling is sensible .
I am of the same view as Mrs Corbey that material-specific recycling targets should not be put forward .
They concern really quite small details , but are the sort of thing this directive seems to need for it not to become too cumbersome .
It is to be hoped the directive will have an impact in two directions : it will be of major importance in rationalising practice , but , hopefully , also in preventing the generation of waste .
The volume of waste should be de-coupled from economic growth , as my colleague Mrs Myller quite rightly stated here .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent work in drafting these important reports .
The reforms are necessary to keep the costs of air traffic down , reduce the number of delays and increase capacity .
There are whole areas in the regulation where opinions in Member States have differed .
These could be ensured by means of a safeguard clause
