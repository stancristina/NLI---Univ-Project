Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , after a very tense debate on chemicals policy , it is a great relief to get back to considering a topic on which there has already been a very broad majority in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , and on which I assume there will be one tomorrow as well .
It was threats on the part of the USA and Canada to contest these import restrictions before the WTO that resulted in the negotiation of an agreement between the EU , Canada , Russia and the USA , which only the EU and Canada have so far ratified .
The fact that this is not the case is another reason for us to vote against this report .
This is too important a matter for us not to seek out the best for animals as much as for human beings .
The topic is a decidedly delicate one , as the procurement of military equipment can be said to touch upon the very heart of national sovereignty .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like Mr Wiersma , I would have liked this debate to have been held at a rather more civilised hour , since it is one that I – as a member of both the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs – regard as particularly important .
We must aim to enable our troops to operate together .
The report appears to regard the war on Iraq as a blueprint for an attack on Iran , even though now not even the former Secretary of State Colin Powell asserts that Iraq actually possessed weapons of mass destruction at the time and is now ashamed of his performance before the UN Security Council .

The new ‘ Human Development Report 2005’ tells us that the number of people living in absolute poverty is continuing to increase dramatically .
That sort of thing gives you a feel for what is going on in Kashmir .
What we wanted to do in the first place was to resolve a point of order .
In the event of any conflict and of you being required to negotiate outside the framework set by the mandate , it would be right for you , Commissioner , to enter into dialogue not only with the Council , but also with the delegation of this House that will be there with you .
