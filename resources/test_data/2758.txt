Group and many others will vote against it in order to support Amendments Nos 100 and 101 , which will achieve almost exactly the same effect with the slight improvements .
Madam President , there seems to be a lack of correspondence between the different linguistic versions of Amendment No 118 .
The French version simply refers to "les autorités compétentes " , whereas the English version refers to " the competent devolved authorities " which , in English , has a more significant meaning .
We established our voting lists in favour of this amendment on the basis of the French version .
However , I understand that the original version is , in fact , the English one , in which case , unless the word "devolved " in the English version can be removed , I will recommend my Group to vote against this amendment .
Madam President , your services were informed yesterday that we would not sign this compromise amendment . on Amendment No 174 from the PPE Group
Madam President , this interesting idea simply takes up in oral form the compromise amendment that has just been rejected .
It is not really in order with our normal procedure .
Madam President , I must refute what Mr Brok said .
A number of compromises were made and we respected those compromises , except in two cases where there are problems , as we sometimes find when we take compromises back to our various groups .
I proposed a solution in both cases .
In this case , we informed your services yesterday that we would not be signing that compromise amendment .
Thus , it should never have been tabled in our name .
It may have been a compromise between the ELDR and the EPP Groups , but it was not a compromise which we signed . before the final vote
Mr President , I would like to underline that no one in Parliament will agree with every single item and every single paragraph of this important report .
That is clear .
The overall message that we are giving to the IGC is that this Parliament wants the IGC to be ambitious , to think long term and not short term and to address all the issues that need to be addressed if a Union of nearly 30 Member States is to be able to function effectively .
We have put a large number of suggestions on the table .
Clearly , not all of them will be taken up in the form which this Parliament has advocated .
But we know that .
We think it is right that the IGC should look at these issues , look at them seriously and come up with appropriate solutions that will enable the Union to work .
My Group , as you know and as Barón Crespo has just said , has some reservations on particular points .
They relate , in particular , to the composition of this Parliament , where unfortunately attempts to reach a compromise position fell down at the last minute .
We must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this House .
I am confident that we can do that .
We were very near to a compromise agreement .
We should be able to crack this one .
We are happy to vote for the report , given the circumstances , and with the reservations I have just described .
- While not able to endorse every dot and comma of this report , I support its broad thrust .
If we are to make a success of enlargement a number of key reforms are essential .
A Union unable to make decisions would not serve the purpose of existing or applicant states .
Therefore , we must increase the use of qualified majority voting in the Council in order to avoid paralysis in decision taking , we must limit the number of Commissioners so that the Union 's executive remains efficient and we must limit the number of MEPs to 700 to enable Parliament to function effectively .
We must continue to improve the Community 's capacity for external action and further democratise key areas of the Union 's activities .
- The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament .
The Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report covers a wide range of issues which could be considered in the framework of the IGC which is taking place over the remainder of 2000 .
The debate which has begun between Member States is reflected in the points of view expressed within the European Parliament , as is the tension over the scope of the IGC.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that it is imperative to conclude the IGC before the end of 2000 in order to leave the EU fully prepared for enlargement .
In order to achieve this , we believe that the scope of the IGC should be restricted to "tidying up " the outstanding points from Amsterdam , plus a small range of other issues .
EPLP Members voted in accordance with this approach , reflecting our concerns over the following areas : There are doubts over the practicability of a European top-up list from 2009 of 10 % of MEPs to be elected on a single European constituency .
We have concerns over the workings of a European Public Prosecutor 's office whilst being concerned to protect the Union 's interests and resources against fraud throughout Community territory .
Likewise , the legislative measures in criminal matters in respect of fraud damaging the interests of the Union will need to be carefully constructed .
The EPLP believes that unanimity cannot solely be restricted to constitutional items , as issues including tax and social security must be dealt with at national level .
