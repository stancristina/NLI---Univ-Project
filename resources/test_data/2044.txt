The contradiction may be due to the fact that discharge can be refused by a simple majority but a motion for censure only by a qualified majority .
The reform of the Financial Regulation began with the report in 1999 by the external committee of experts commonly known as the Five Wise Men .
The reform is partly linked to the Commission 's administrative reform .
This change will mean an increase in their power and responsibility .
Because authorising officers are the officials with the most important executive role they must be fully accountable for their actions , and cannot take refuge behind the backs of others .
The system now to be decided on must not be spoilt by new amendments .
It would make it easier for the Kaliningrad Russians to travel to their mother country than is the case with normal visas , but it would also safeguard Lithuania 's sovereignty .
The point is , how many of the present Member States would agree to have a train tearing along through their own country , coming from another country that does not belong to the European Union and whose passengers could not be checked ?
Would Belgium , Spain , Italy or France agree to this ?
In examining the way opinion has been formed I have noticed that the further away from Kaliningrad a current Member State is , the more unrealistic the points it has put forward to solve the problem .
It is regrettable to find that people are unable to view the drawbacks or dangers which that would bring realistically .
For that reason , it is rash for just one individual EU country , for example , to promise such a thing , and I seriously fear that merely discussing the issue would harm the favourable attitude the citizens of countries applying to join the Union have towards the EU.
Immanuel Kant 's KÃ¶nigsberg should once again have the honour .
Finally , I should like to raise the matter of the Eurobarometer .
Why do they do nothing ?
Mr President , I wish to return to a subject I raised in the debates yesterday .
There are some very problematic points in these security measures .
In my opinion it is something of a scandal that we are attempting to vote on this without any kind of debate , on the quiet , as it were .
Our rapporteur , Mr Blokland , has , as always , done a precise and excellent job , for which he deserves our thanks .
All these are aims worthy of support from the point of view of the EU 's targets , but some of the provisions now being discussed go even further than the Rotterdam Convention .
Parties to international agreements on the environment are countries at different levels in terms of commitment and the levels agreed in the Convention do not necessarily go far enough at all with regard to the EU 's targets .
The rapporteur 's suggestion that this proposal for a regulation should take into account the Stockholm Convention concerning POPs concluded in May last year should be supported .
The objective of the proposal for a regulation is the protection of the environment and human health .
That is why the rapporteur , Mr Blokland , has arrived at the absolutely correct conclusion when he proposes that Article 133 of the Treaty that relates to common commercial policy should be replaced with Article 175 as a more suitable legal basis for the proposals .
Mr President , there are still too many obstacles in the way of smooth provision of financial services across national boundaries .
The integrity of European markets has to be safeguarded .
Like some other colleagues , however , I am worried about some proposals whose basic intention might be good and respectable but whose effects would be devastating .
I believe that there must be tough rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest among financial journalists .
Free speech is one of the cornerstones of democracy .
This would be impractical , unnecessary and disproportionate .
The aim is to cover an extensive range of routine financial journalism where standards have remained high and existing governance mechanisms have proved adequate .
The proposals would have an adverse impact on media freedom and on journalistic independence .
Financial journalism contributes to one of the key objectives of the directive , that is to ensure market transparency .
They are the investors in the European Parliament should be trying to protect .
He took the views of the shadow rapporteurs into consideration back in the formulation stage in an exemplary manner and the levels of cooperation we have seen have been fruitful .
The candidate countries must be included in programmes like the TEN-Energy programme as swiftly as possible .
If and when Ignalina is closed , and whatever decisions are made concerning bituminous shale , the Baltic countries ' energy strategies cannot rely exclusively on Russia .
What sort of timetable does the Commission have for including the new Member States in the trans-European networks ?
The basic philosophy here is that the energy sector must be one in which the market economy works unaided .
Previously , aid was available only for studies in the planning stage .
It is good that the Commission will provide support for building trans-European networks .
There have been a lot of problems when constructing power lines as a result of the way in which decisions have been made at local and regional level .
Residents complain about electromagnetic radiation , the impact on the environment , blighted landscapes , and so on .
Matters relating to technology must not be linked to this programme .
In certain circumstances they serve as excellent local solutions .
As a separate issue I want to mention Amendment No 9 .
The Commission is proposing an electricity interconnection capacity of at
