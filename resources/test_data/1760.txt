from the whole , from cooperation between the different administrations , since local administration – the closest – has the best knowledge of the needs of potential job seekers and the means to satisfy them .
Without a guarantee of this kind , in the territory in which it may take place , I believe that the possibility of abuse and fraud are within reach of irresponsible employers .
It must be respected and protected’ .
I believe that the division between the free provision of services and freedom of establishment according to the sixteen weeks criterion was very difficult to justify .
Furthermore , this issue is regulated in each Member State .
Because we want their integration and that of their families and children , because we are concerned about the situation of immigrant women , because we are in favour of intercultural coexistence in communities , cities and work places .
In other words , we have more and more hours of television , more and more electronic hours , more magazines , more books and more means of production , but they are practically devoid of content .
I would like finally to refer to enlargement .
Well , on behalf of 80 % , I admit .
It is absolutely clear that we must try to prevent a second failure in the Intergovernmental Conference , but also , looking at it positively , it is very important that we are able to face our responsibilities .
We are also dealing with important international decisions which will affect the European Union over the coming months : the reform of the United Nations , to which we Europeans are directly committed – tomorrow we will receive its Secretary-General – the situation in Iraq , the situation in the Middle East , and the European Union 's international policy and responsibilities .
Bilateral contacts may be useful , but the IGC is a body which must act jointly , debate and reach agreements on a final consensus .     Mr President , we are at the end of the mandate of the Commission and Parliament and therefore , on this occasion , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Monti on the excellent work he has done throughout the mandate of this Commission .
The third and final point would be to ensure , both in the Commission and in the other institutions of the European Union , that the operation of the courts responsible for competition , at all levels within the Union , is correct .
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political groups and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for their support during the many discussions we have held .
The notion that there is sovereignty over airspace , an area in which we are going to regulate and act according to common rules within an integrated system is a tremendous step forward which we cannot underestimate , and therefore , the fact that the Member States maintain – as reflected in the text which we have finally agreed on – the guarantees necessary to accept this change , seems to me to be the appropriate compensation if we want to continue taking steps forward in the knowledge that Europe cannot be built in one day , but that it is a process within which we must continue to make progress on the basis of consensus with the support of all the States , because it is not a question of leaving anybody behind .
In this regard , I would like in particular to thank the honourable Member , Mr President , because it is true – Mr Dimitrakopoulos – that your work during the conciliation procedure was key .
We must also take account of the will of the States .
We have been able to separate the issues and resolve what could be resolved and not paralyse everything as a result of trying to resolve everything .
The second element we are working on is the monitoring of the work carried out by the European Space Agency on validation in orbit .
Mr President , if I could only mention three , then these would be the three tasks which we will have achieved – and I say ‘we ’ because we have achieved it amongst all of us – a team , a Commission team , and I would like once again to thank the services I have referred to , from the Director-General to all the people responsible who have acted and worked throughout this time but of course with the invaluable cooperation of this Parliament , which has given us support systematically and , of course in the end as well , the cooperation of the Council .
Together with the European Space Agency , the EGNOS programme , and hopefully also ITER , it creates a launch pad so that Europe can be in the leading group in terms of the most important challenges humanity is going to face during this twenty-first century , that is to say , taking advantage of our atmosphere and outer space in a manner which is sustainable and respectful of nature .
I believe we have achieved this amongst all of us and there have certainly been really difficult times .
All there is is a concession for its management by a private company .
Thirdly , the final signal , as you know , is a security signal , closed to public use , intended exclusively for use by governments .
Each has its advantages and disadvantages , but I believe we must support all three because of what they have in common : any of them is always going to be better than depositing waste in dumps .
This happened because we received information at the eleventh hour about certain irregularities in the accounts
