development of compulsory insurance schemes for passengers or airlines , and , ultimately , to the idea of introducing targeted changes in national bankruptcy laws .
Obviously , Parliament 's contribution will be crucial as far as I am concerned and - in view also of the dedication with which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has worked together to come up with this oral question today - I believe that over the coming weeks , we will be able to cooperate usefully in order to identify together the best solution for meeting passengers ' needs and for safeguarding their rights effectively should airlines go bankrupt .
It should be our duty not only to safeguard citizens but also act to ensure that good airlines can remain operational , thus safeguarding jobs .
For this reason , at the Transport Council due to be held in Luxembourg tomorrow and the day after tomorrow , we will tackle the question of the rights of sea and river transport passengers .
The report could therefore be published during the second half of next year and will be forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council .
Obviously the exact timescales and contents will be decided by the next Commission .
We were therefore obliged to postpone the report to ensure that the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company had actually been in force in all the Member States for long enough to make it possible to draw up an indicative report on its application .
However , we know that even great countries can go off course , can mix up public property with private interests .
I did not have this opportunity in the time that was allocated to me .
One should then consider that , of 455 judgments handed down by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on freedom of information , only seven concern Italy , compared with 29 for France and 28 for the United Kingdom .
The European Parliament must be a place of growth , of debate and of exchanges of best practice among the Member States .
Normally , it takes an average of around 18 months to mobilise this fund .
For these reasons , faced with a situation that it is not a clich√© to call tragic , I believe it is necessary to improve the quality of the aid that is allocated to those countries , rather than just look at the quantity .
Firstly I , and the committee which it is my honour to chair , would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to us in Parliament right at the end of the Agricultural Council which was held in Luxembourg .
It has explained how it intends to use a fund of EUR 280 million - which , I would remind you , we will be voting on this Thursday in the context of approval of the 2010 budget - and set out some of the measures it will implement , such as the private storage of cheese and raising the ceiling of de minimis aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 , as requested in our resolution which was adopted in September .
However , the budget must also be credible , feasible and tangible , and in this regard , it was fundamental to avoid making financial resources for the coming years too inflexible by restricting excessive spending beyond the maximum expenditure ceiling contained in the perspectives of the multiannual financial framework just to cases that really are an absolute priority .
In times of crisis , there is no point merely writing figures in the budget , but instead we should build a useful budget , immediately ready for action .
Parliament 's openness towards the Commission today should not be interpreted as full delegation with unrestricted powers , but as a gesture of responsibility in a dramatic and wholly exceptional situation .
Mr President , having noted the Presidency 's decision on the admissibility of these amendments , I would simply ask the authors of these amendments to withdraw them for the sake of political expediency .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is precisely the events taking place at the lowest , provincial level in Italy that are the greatest demonstration of freedom of the press and of information : think of all the local newspapers , the newspapers of the cities , large and small , that people read every day and see who they talk about !
The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament agrees with the position adopted in the Brok report , which it played an active part in drafting .
It is a position that aims to develop the role that the Service can carry out as a bridge between the Community dimension of the Union 's external action and the intergovernmental dimension of the common foreign and security policy , as laid down in Title V of the Treaty of Lisbon .
On the basis of this work , the committee that I have the honour of chairing will be able to conduct a constructive but firm dialogue with the future High Representative and to defend the Community character of the new External Action Service .
Since 2005 , the number of executions in Iran has quadrupled , and Iran is the only country in the world which executes minors guilty of crimes .
One final comment : how can President Ahmadinejad have any credibility in the negotiations on the nuclear issue when he is persecuting and going against his own people who are calling for greater democracy , greater freedom and greater respect for human rights ?
Clearly , we would have preferred Parliament to have been more directly involved in the pilot project - this has been said and it is the subject of our question .
