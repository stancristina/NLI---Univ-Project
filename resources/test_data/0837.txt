In spite of all this , and without any objective justification , President Klaus was granted a derogation in order to ensure the non-application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
As we are equally dependent on energy supplies , we need to ensure that the agreements in the three-way relationship between Russia , Ukraine and the EU are formulated in such a way as to prevent a drop in gas pressure in parts of the EU every winter .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what we have just heard from the Commission and the Council is somewhat discouraging .
However , there are a few things than I am not sure about in this regard , and the questions that we raised have not been answered .
Will they have language skills ?
It would be good if the Commission , and the Council , too , could take up the subject of European patents in the areas of pharmaceuticals and bio-research and make it clear that we need this .
In a word , for the average citizen , the EU remains a riddle wrapped up in an enigma .
I would also like to remind you , in relation to financial regulations , and specifically in relation to how the money is actually dispersed to and within the Member States , that this must , of course , take place in a way that is secure against abuse .
According to the Commission proposal , Macedonia , Montenegro and Serbia have met the majority of targets and are therefore now to have their requirement for a visa removed .
Given Europe 's increasingly aged population , this figure is likely to double over the next few decades .
The European Parliament and national parliaments must play a more significant role in both .
Other than that , there is not a lot to say , and even though one tends to want to exceed one 's speaking time , I can cut mine short in this case .
In our case , it has only taken a few weeks - as Parliament had spent a long time making in-depth preparations for this event - for the new Rules of Procedure to be approved on this basis , so that once the treaty takes effect , we can immediately start working according to the new Rules of Procedure .
We know that global climate protection is not possible without financing .
That is a new beginning , and I hope we are able to take part in the briefing between the Council and the Commission since , under the Treaty of Lisbon , we have joint legislative power on the Copenhagen agreement .
The new regulation will clearly regulate the conditions and procedures for granting Community financial aid , which will provide the corresponding legal certainty , in particular , for the States and regions that plan such projects .
Equally , we must ensure that the delusional emphasis on privatisation hitherto does not lead to UK-style massive delays and safety failings .
That notwithstanding , we also have a severe economic crisis to overcome .
It will be our job , as parliamentarians , to demand of the Council that it no longer allow this understanding to slip away , or for it - as with the SWIFT agreement , for example - to create precedents , despite not involving us here in Parliament in the approval process .
What is more , the procedure within Parliament that led to this resolution was largely opaque and , at times , chaotic .
Why do we , Parliament , allow the Council to run rings around us time and again ?
Mr President , Mrs Malmström , Mr Barrot , a miracle has occurred .
The fact that we have nothing , not one single proposal , for how things should be in the future , disturbs us .
That target is to spend 3 % of gross domestic product on research and development .
The Commission therefore announced this year that it is to bring forward an 'innovation act ' .
Mr Rübig , you know my answer , of course , but I am grateful for your question .
Mr Papastamkos , this question gives me the opportunity to relate to you a very pleasing tale of success .
The Commission is currently working on further proposals that it will be putting forward shortly and that will offer potential savings of a further EUR 2 billion , meaning that we will have total potential savings of more than EUR 40 billion a year .
Subject : Tourism under Lisbon Can the Commission outline what plans it has developed , in terms of preparatory actions and other initiatives , to prepare the ground for the development of the tourism competence under Lisbon ( Article 195 TFEU) , assuming Lisbon comes into effect ?
Mr Leichtfried , in relation to the first question , I would say that we can always try .
One of the worst consequences facing the Member States is the reduction in employment and the corresponding rise in unemployment rates and the extreme difficulty of creating new jobs that are stable and of good quality .
Following an intensive debate in the Committee on Budgets , we gave the green light to the mobilisation of the Fund in both cases .
Mr President , Commissioner , you are right , the railway system is a very safe system when compared to other forms of transport .
I would also like to ask you to ensure that , when you make your evaluation , you do not forget the social aspects - they need to be taken into account .
We said that , as the second largest group in this House , we wanted the second position in the Commission , in other words , the
