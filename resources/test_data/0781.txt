to remove all those rules that make our work ridiculous .
Even though we all believe there are details that are not quite perfect , we must adopt a global perspective and take the opportunity that now exists and that many previous speakers have said will not perhaps be there again .
The correct way forward in this case is to approve the liberals ' and others ' amendments .
It is also important for us to obtain a system that is transparent and that our electorate can scrutinise .
In the vote , we shall support an amendment aimed precisely at retaining the right to pay national tax .
If this proposal is rejected , we shall unfortunately be forced to vote against the whole proposal .
( SV ) Mr President , Commissioner , allow me firstly to make a very personal observation .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has been closely involved in this issue .
We also support the proposal for having 2010 as the final phasing-out year , a proposal that the Council had come up with and that we are now prepared to agree upon .
Our experience shows that what the EU has agreed upon is in fact translated into the rules of the IMO.
Or what other measures is the Commission prepared to take ?
We can all see that , instead of a uniform framework for budgetary aid , the EU has a variety of such frameworks .
I would therefore venture to state that the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy welcomes Mr Belder 's proposal that the Genval criteria be introduced , making it possible for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to exercise effective scrutiny of the forms of aid .
It is difficult to see any valid reason for retaining the present system of EU budgetary aid to non-member States , which is opaque and , in all likelihood , unnecessarily demanding in terms of resources .
Our work can have practical results , something which is needed .
The basis for this policy was the Lisbon strategy , according to which economic and technological development should be combined with a concentration on work of good quality , cooperation between the parties , production and , especially , solidarity with weak groups .
We have therefore put forward a range of proposals .
That is important , for it is not enough just to increase levels of employment , as is done in periods of prosperity .
Secondly , we have placed considerable emphasis on the fact that , in an economic situation like the present one , new jobs and new businesses are needed , something that certainly also requires political initiatives .
Above all , we propose that equality be made into an overarching objective alongside the three objectives proposed by the Commission .
I am pleased that there are clear responses to these demands , for it looked rather bad for a time when this feature had disappeared from what was the last guideline .
The problem has been that European employment policy has not been linked up with , or integrated into , the national policies .
They will then have Parliament 's support .
There therefore remains a certain lack of agreement , something upon which I wish to comment shortly .
I am therefore opposed to Amendment No 62 .
If we are to come up with views on this , we must express ourselves in very general terms .
In conclusion , I just want briefly to say that the Liberals ' amendments on tax issues are of a quite different character .
In conclusion , I want to say that we have , in general , reached agreement .
It is very important for us to be able to agree upon a document so that we have an answer to give to the Council that is sitting and waiting and will listen to what we are to say today .
Employment policy is important on the whole .
Allow me to say something about the overarching objectives .
Even if these are two aspects that run approximately in tandem , they do not do so one hundred per cent .
For this , we need a properly educated labour force .
That is important .
Allow me briefly to say something about the disagreement .
You only have to look around in the European Union .
It is an over-simplification to say that , generally speaking , a reduction in tax is also good for employment .
I shall be guided by that consideration in the vote .
I shall therefore concentrate on the Commission 's proposed guidelines and , above all , comment on Mr Herman Schmid 's report , as it appears following the vote in committee .
It does not make sense to cite , as now in this proposal , an ever-increasing quantity of measures and detailed objectives .
At present , it is a question of 15 Member States ; tomorrow , of 25 .
The rapporteur writes that responsibility for implementing a successful employment policy lies with the Member States .
Germany is an example of what happens if a rigid labour market is not reformed .
He said that structural reforms are needed if the European economy is to be given new impetus , that more trade liberalisation is required and , above all , a liberalisation of labour markets by means of fewer regulations and healthier levels of labour protection .
It is estimated that , by 2050 , the European Union will have 40 million more pensioners than at present and , thus , 40 million fewer people of working age .
This is an incredibly important issue , but it is not good that Amendment No 43 states that work and family life will be reconciled notably through commitments to develop childcare services
