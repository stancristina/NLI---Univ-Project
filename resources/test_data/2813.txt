for the citizen , something which this House , as the ultimate expression of its will , must always defend .
In this case , this request could be extended to the other regional or national parliaments in which the representation of women is still low in comparison with the percentage of women , who make up half the population , and in some cases rather more than half the population .
I believe , Mr President , that the most honest and reasonable thing for Mrs Sanders-ten Holte to do would be to relinquish her responsibilities , since she cannot accept the opinion of plenary and since she has not been able to win the support of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .     Mr President , I would like to talk about the way in which a temporary committee has finally been approved to investigate the effects and consequences of the unfortunate accident off the Galician coasts .
Specifically , there are two twenty-year-old Spaniards , Carlos Martín Martínez and Fernando Pérez Borraiz , who are facing extraordinary accusations .
It is a form of subterfuge aimed at hindering the European funding of research with stem cells , when there are many countries which allow it , because there are significant sectors of the scientific community and of the social community in general which believe that researching with stem cells can lead to great progress in the fight against the extremely serious diseases which devastate us today .
Let us not now aim , as a result of intolerance , not just to destroy the European Area of Research , but also to prevent and hinder successful research in this area in the countries where it is allowed .     Mr President , I was against the compromise reached by Parliament on this issue at the time , and I am against the Commission 's proposal today as well and , consequently , the Liese report .
Because , however many time limits we set , however many ethical principles we establish to justify this research , the destruction of an embryonic life represents a clear violation of the most fundamental of these principles , these principles which we say we defend and which we do defend : respect for human life and the dignity it deserves .     Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to join other Members in expressing my approval , not only of the three reports we are discussing here but also of the Commission ’s proposals .
Furthermore , this project can be in operation from the outset linking the French and Spanish States , via Irún , since there is already an international European gauge track throughout the French network as far as that point .
Moving on , Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Poettering for bringing politics into this debate .
I should add that I find the document far superior to the speech he gave today .
I believe the most outrageous behaviour we have witnessed during these last few days was when the President of the Council departed totally from the line taken by the Council of Ministers , the Commission and Parliament .
No doubt we shall find out then .
This is a crucially important request .
After all , this issue is crucial to the new Member States and also to the balance between current Member States .
Nonetheless , I am surprised that a new instrument amounting in practice to a duplication of OLAF is now being proposed .
Finding a loophole in every law is a widespread human weakness .
Mr President , I therefore feel it is essential to negotiate an urgent procedure to allow these issues to be discussed before the end of this legislature .
Further reform is needed .
We want to cooperate to strengthen and improve European institutions still further .
We would like to work with the Commission to get it across .
It also contains the decision to be taken on granting asylum status and the minimum conditions for people to request asylum in Europe .
Mr Prodi , you can count on our support in defending the programme before the Council .
You can count on our support over this .
There is also an extensive list of decisions outstanding in the field of cooperation over criminal issues .
In modern organisations it falls to the administration of political power or of legislative power to exercise control .
We wonder how many of the acceding countries really are in a position to transpose the Community between now and 1 May .
Leaders of industry have been arrested , imprisoned and tried .
I shall endeavour to be brief .
Alternatively , the information should be placed before the judicial authorities .
With regard to OLAF , President Prodi , I suggest the introduction of some kind of ruling on admissibility .
Firstly , Mr Prodi , President of the current Commission , was invested and endorsed by the majority of the groups in this House .
Thirdly , I should like to state my personal opinion , if Mr Romano Prodi , who is both an Italian and a European citizen , decides to stand in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament , he should then resign .
I would remind you of the case of the cruise liner .
It is desirable to extend some of the provisions of these instruments to domestic maritime traffic within Europe .
There is also provision for an inspection process overseen by the Commission .
The main aim of the draft regulation before the House is to ensure Member States of the Union adopt the necessary measures within the agreed time period .
Thanks are also due to the whole House for its efforts to reach a swift , effective and efficient solution in the interests of the citizens of the European  Union .     .
It is important to bear this in mind .
