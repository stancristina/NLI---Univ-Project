Local shipping between the Netherlands and Belgium does not exist .
I should like to touch upon those demonstrations .
Shipping companies have acquired more entrepreneurial room , which they need in order to secure a good return on investments .
They involve the handling of cross-border flows of goods between different states , not only within the European Union but also across the entire world .
In a competitive battle of this kind , ports that service a common hinterland will destroy each other .
By hindering , or reducing , existing protection of registered port labour against unfair competition at Member State level , this competition is only set to increase .
The fact that a directive is coming into being was suddenly more important than its exact content .
It does not include the compulsory authorisations that had been requested for new service providers with regard to social , environmental and other requirements , such as safety .
That , and nothing else , is the bottom line of the report we are debating again today .
The fact is that , for thousands of Flemish dockworkers , liberalisation in this context means nothing more than unemployment and social misery .
I therefore hope that there will be a massive vote against this report .     – Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Jarzembowski , thank you for the work that you have done , but I will not support the compromise , because I see this compromise as lacking an essential link , namely that authorisations should be used in EU ports .
Whatever the result of next Thursday ’s vote may be , this worsening situation will need to be addressed with or without a directive .
After the ships of convenience , we are now also being faced with ports of convenienceThis fear is not only present among port workers , but also among those who are concerned about social peace in our ports , which is being jeopardised by your directive , Mrs Miguélez Ramos .
I take the view that a general authorisation obligation would serve this purpose much more effectively .
One point has always taken priority in my party , the Dutch Labour Party , and that is our minimum .
As many speakers have already said , this Directive is indeed bad news for dockers , because there are no minimum social standards that are enforceable throughout the EU.
Risks are ever-increasing on account of the shipping routes becoming busier , and also of maritime personnel being less well trained .
I asked myself , therefore , whether I should support this result or not .
The fact that the compromise gives the Member States freedom of choice as to whether or not to introduce authorisations for self-handling – this form of subsidiarity – makes the whole authorisation system a hollow shell – this much is now clear to everyone .
In addition , it is a slap in the face for all those dockers who have demonstrated against this Directive several times and who , furthermore , just this morning handed our own President of the European Parliament more than 20 000 signatures to make it clear that they disapprove strongly of this Directive .
To liberalise or not to liberalise , that is not the question as far as I am concerned .
We do not like that idea , and therefore I do not agree with this draft text .
This social dialogue offers employers a guarantee that their requirements , too – as regards employment , social services , safety and quality – will be included in a social agreement .
They are accustomed to proceeding via social dialogue .
My question is as follows : has the warning notice to importers had any effect on the Member States that have a rather casual approach to the rules of origin ?
The figures speak for themselves .
The European Union has an enormous task ahead of it .
I should also like to say to the Italian Presidency that a very peculiar procedure has taken place .
Ordinary extortion demands are made , then you have to pay a certain amount and you will be left alone .
Fortunately , the Agency has also been given an executive role .
Will you not let that take place behind closed doors in the Council ?
After all , it is cross-border problems that are at issue here , and the jurisdiction of the Member States stops at the border .
In any case , it is good that a compromise has finally been reached , and so the ELDR Group will support the report by Mr Paasilinna .     Mr President , I have put a very pertinent question to the Italian presidency .
Would you allow the Italian presidency to answer it ?     .
The problem in this whole debate is that waste recovery is not necessarily more sound in environmental terms .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is of the opinion that , until the European Commission formulates these conditions , the Member States should have the option of imposing their own conditions on waste recovery .
It can no longer be ascertained where the waste has gone and what has happened to it .
They themselves admit that they cannot control shipments of waste .
It should have taken the initiative in providing clarity many years ago .
If the sludge has leaked out , that would perhaps be useful , but definitely not if it is soaked in water .
As a Member of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I should like to discuss a number of aspects of that care .
The promotion of modes of transport that have less or no impact on the soil , such as inland water and coastal water transport , presents an opportunity
