I want to thank you , Commissioner Monti , for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role .
These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless .
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets .
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and , to that extent , are helping to undermine the value of the euro .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .
At present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment .
Finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs , and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid .
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
To conclude , I want to welcome the Commission ' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .
But , as I have already mentioned , our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned , and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid .
As Liberals and Greens , we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems .
Mr President , will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds ?
On the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
In the way it is structured , Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes .
OLAF , Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and , when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States , we can also achieve a lot with this .
It is simply too bad , and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor ' s Office instead .
However , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office .
It is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law .
Instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
At the moment , Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission .
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter , for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate .
Thank you for a very clear answer , the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements .
It is a very clear answer , but it is also an answer , may I point out , which puts Danish organisations , the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very , very difficult situation politically , for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model , which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements , and the Continental model , which presupposes legislation .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997 .
We support these critical remarks , and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approving the accounts .
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission ' s implementing a series of reforms , so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission ' s period of office is not repeated .
We do not think that the new Commission , under any circumstances , could incur liability for the past .
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better .
By means of this extraordinary procedure , Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs , namely with the previous Commission .
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall
