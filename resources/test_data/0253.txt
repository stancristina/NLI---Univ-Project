The attacker has often been confused with the attacked , and the real motivation behind the provocation unleashed by Hizbollah , with its launching of missiles against Israel and kidnapping of two of their soldiers , has hardly ever been spelt out .
One side is defending its legitimate survival as a democratic state , while the other is the armed wing of the fight against democracy and the West !
We must debate the implications that such an initiative may have .
For the first time , Europe could demonstrate a united political will and the determination to play a constructive role in the Mediterranean and Middle East by equipping itself with the appropriate tools .
It could be a first step towards restoring that agreement , in the run-up to an international conference that may lead to a stable , lasting solution for the entire area , as the President-in-Office mentioned .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the message given out when a foreign minister of a founding Member State of the European Union – the foreign minister of my country – walks arm in arm with a top-ranking Hizbollah representative is not a positive message for Europe to send out to its citizens , to people who seriously want peace and want to help solve the dire problems in which that area is floundering , particularly a tormented country like poor Lebanon .
The more neutral the peacekeeping forces remain , however , the more credible they will be .
I support the line you are taking , Commissioner , and the more assertive role that has been adopted .
Lastly , I must mention the conference proposed by the Council : the peace conference is an important moment that must be seized when the time is right , and the European Parliament will certainly not fail to support it .     – Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , unilateralism has been showing all its limitations for some time , and the European Union has finally taken the initiative and promoted a bold intervention together with the United Nations .
I would ask the Council and the Commission what point has been reached in disarming the armed militia that attacked Israel .
I should mention that last year this Parliament stated that there was incontrovertible proof of terrorist acts by Hizbollah and , by a very large majority of its Members , called on the Council to adopt whatever measures were necessary to put an end to the group ’s activities .
For five years , in fact , ongoing conflicts ( in Gaza , Lebanon , Iraq and Afghanistan ) and the most serious diplomatic tensions ( on terrorist attacks , the Iran issue , etc. ) have all revolved around the same point , and therefore they cannot be eradicated just by means of more or less legitimate military missions created every time and always under different names .
In my opinion , the report is thorough , it can be examined and various parliamentary groups also want to examine it and to endorse it .
The parliamentary group , which is following this problem closely and tabling and gaining approval for various amendments , has highlighted the issue of religious freedom : we are concerned about the Communist party ’s appointing of bishops ; it is like the Vatican appointing generals in the Chinese army ; it is incomprehensible , and the freedom of so many Chinese citizens is being violated .
The trade agreements on footwear , textiles and clothing must also be reviewed with the utmost urgency , as unacceptable imbalances still exist .
How is it possible , then , that , while knowing that 70 % of the counterfeit goods that circulate in our countries come from China , we still have to address issues such as those concerning the running of Chinese courts , the responses , the fact that there is a court here that finds in our favour and to which one can turn ; in short , how is it possible that we have to call on China to completely overhaul its system so as to meet the requirements of democracy and development , and so on ?
It really seems the height of contradiction to me that we should cooperate with the Chinese police .
Thirdly , the application of the label must be backed up by socio-economic activity-based initiatives aimed at encouraging operators in the sector to join the voluntary system and by information campaigns aimed at consumers .
As all Members are aware , once the European Parliament has given its consent , the Community can formally accede to the Hague Conference as soon as two-thirds of the States signatory to the Conference have endorsed the amendments to the statute .
Finally , I can confirm this possibility straight away and , when the Community has formally acceded to the Hague Conference , it will become a reality .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , talks are beginning tomorrow and the paradoxical thing is that we are not even aware of the basis for them .
Systematically keeping a check on people in the name of the fight against terrorism is an authoritarian distortion of the rule of law and , paradoxically , by doing so we are helping to achieve precisely what the terrorists want .
On the strength of that , we can then negotiate with the United States .
That ruling rejected the agreement : someone said exactly that .
They will be forced to do so in individual declarations , and Europe will have lost any power to protect them to a suitable degree .
Obviously , having seen a major operation by the police and security services in Denmark only a few days ago , we are sure that the danger and threat are real and are hanging over
