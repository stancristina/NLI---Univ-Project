return to this matter later .
The aim is thus to achieve more differentiated competitions .
I would be glad to speak on this issue with the honorable Member and hear of his experiences .
It is clear that people who have personal experience of a disability will understand the matter best .
Mr President , the Council did indeed decide to cut the appropriations in this way .
I can however state that our commitment appropriations have been largely used but that there has been clear over-budgeting for payment appropriations .
If there should be any such problem , we have already announced in the Council and in Parliament that the Commission will produce a draft supplementary and amending budget .
Our objective is , in connection with the 1998 draft budget , to take significant measures to decentralize administration .
This will imply a reduction in in-house bureaucracy and greater powers begin given to the DGs to work in their own fields and at the same time increase their responsibility .
At the same time the Commission is preparing a broader set of measures in connection with the ' Santer package ' .
As regards criticism in general , I regard this as the basis of any healthy debate .
.
Certainly in Finland and a number of other Member States it has been severely criticized .
How can we trust the experts sent by the Commission if they have already been gagged and bound to support the Commission 's point of view ?
This in its way is an even more wide-ranging practice and in my opinion it will be good for the Council to be aware of this .
As politicians , we have a responsibility to address the difficult issues as well as the easy ones .
If we are to ban cloning , then we must give practical effect to that ban by including a comparable ban in the patent directive .
On the structure of an ethical review , I think we have got the emphasis completely wrong .
It should be a matter of broad public consultation and debate in order to establish consensus in our societies as to the future direction and application of new reproductive technologies .
Mr President , looking at the Sakellariou report and its well-intentioned proposals from a northern or north-eastern perspective , I feel that there are some very interesting dissimilarities between our case , the Baltic Sea region , and the Mediterranean .
We note the conflict between some government circles in Turkey and the army , the latter representing Atat√ºrk 's idea of a lay society .
The little I have seen of the media coverage in the non-EU countries along the Mediterranean showing events in other countries along the same shores is often distorted and one-sided and does not contribute to an understanding of the cultural and political diversity of the area .
I see a possibility for the EU to exercise moral power and pressure on the countries in question , which is probably the intent behind many of the good proposals in the report by Mr Sakellariou .
Sometimes power comes with money , but not always .
Nowhere is there mention of the fact that US involvement has been crucial and will be crucial in the foreseeable future .
How is this will expressed in a dictatorship ?
The primary objective of next year 's budget has been defined as the prevention of unemployment .
It occupies both the first and second places on the list of priorities .
There are already nearly 20 million unemployed and unfortunately no end to the growth in unemployment is in sight .
Thus the fight against unemployment must be seen to be a particularly central task for the EU as a whole .
The structural funds have a key role to play in strengthening business activity .
Over the last five years almost 20 % remained unused .
Mr President , subject to these comments I still have great hopes of next year 's draft budget .
( FI ) Madam President , the European Investment Bank was founded to promote those objectives which the EU considers most important .
If it was risk-free , financing would be obtainable for development projects from other lending institutions , and the European Investment Bank would be unnecessary .
This definition seems obvious , but in practice it is hard to distinguish between political and economic risks .
Therefore , in my opinion , a practice ought to be introduced whereby loan decisions contain a political risk assessment , otherwise , when a default occurs , the temptation may be to blame purely political factors .
Two types of practice would be possible : either each country in question would be assessed in advance and a decision taken for that individual country on what proportion of the EIB 's risk in the country was political in origin ; or each financing decision should have an assessment annexed to it concerning the division of the risk between political and economic factors .
Therefore in my opinion the concept of political risk should be agreed upon in such a way that , in the event of a default , the damage would be divided in advance into political and economic risk .
Mr President , subject to these remarks I am prepared to adopt the report .
This represents a considerable amount of human suffering and gives rise to substantial economic losses .
This represents a major challenge for the European Union .
Citizens feel themselves to be at some remove from the European Union 's activities , see no clear evidence of their impact on and benefits in to everyday life .
Measures of this kind will help the European Union secure - if it ever does - legitimacy and public acceptance .
Its aim is to prevent and reduce the exposure of workers to carcinogens .
