The Commission and the Council also talk about 'asking the pharmaceutical firms to offer lower prices for the south of the world' , which amounts to saying : ' Let the pharmaceutical firms themselves do a good deed , because we are completely unable to guarantee a right ' .
As has already been observed by the Commissioner as well as by other speakers , the aim of Community statistics is thus to provide regular verification of the drafting , implementation and evaluation of Community policies .
Finally , I believe that we have made some important additions : a requirement for the Commission to carry out ex ante analyses of the financial impacts of the new statistical activities planned that involve additional burdens for the Member States , as well as feasibility studies to achieve a quality label for European statistics and to reinforce the credibility of the European statistical system , including Eurostat , the national statistical authorities and other relevant bodies in each Member State that are responsible for compiling and distributing European statistics .
There is a need for land maintenance geared to practical steps to combat such phenomena , especially forest fires .
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank , in addition to Mr Liberadzki , the dangerous goods committee for their work , bearing in mind that that work has been carried out continuously in accordance with the international agreements in force in this field .
In conclusion , Mr President , this is an excellent report , whose line we support as it is capable of reconciling prevention of the problem with appropriate action in terms of education and information and with zero tolerance for those failing to abide by the rules . on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the collapse of the US market in high-risk loans has caused a splash that is still being felt on the stock markets today and which has thrown speculators and savers into serious crisis .

It is also necessary for the fight against desertification to guide financial policies on climate .
We must combat it with good policy . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mrs Valenciano very much because one of the things her weighty report highlights is the steps that the European Union still has to take in consultations on human rights , and thus the fact that this is a work in progress for all of us .
We thank Mrs Valenciano for having accepted many of our amendments .
Toys are , in fact , the products with the highest number of irregularities , and China is the country of origin with the most infringements .
Commissioner Kuneva has warned that if China does not respond to the EU 's demands , the next step will be to ban the import of some Chinese products .
You , President-in-Office of the Council , also had the impudence to say in 1999 - according to all the European ambassadors we had won because there was a very large absolute majority - on the morning of the vote , a telegram arrived from Brussels telling us to withdraw .

A responsible policy is needed to counter the fears and uncertainties of our increasingly uneasy societies .
Immigration cannot be regarded merely as a security issue .

We call on the Commission and the Council not only to step up EU border controls , but also to introduce harmonised legislation to punish human traffickers speedily and resolutely , and to promote better agreements with immigrants ' countries
