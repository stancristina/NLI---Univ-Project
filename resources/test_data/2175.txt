Naturally , we must condemn the Russian massacre in Chechnya , but we must not forget our own complicity in Russia 's tragedy .
We should recognise our part in Russia 's crisis and Russia 's chaos .
The eyes of the world have of course been on Pakistan since the General promised to hold elections within three years of the military coup to restore democracy and civil rule in the country .
A tiny , tiny part of this promise has been kept : elections have been held .
Secondly , during the election in the form of pressure on individual politicians , different rules for different candidates from different parties , irregularities during the election process and restrictions on people 's opportunities to vote .
Unemployment , poverty and illiteracy are increasing .
I therefore support Mr Cushnahan 's statement here today .
I would like to have seen the social partners at European level solving this issue , so that we would have been able to achieve a directive this way .
This sector is becoming increasingly large , as many people have already pointed out .
That is actually what it is all about .
We have agreements in Sweden in this area , which will continue to be applicable in the future .
This issue has already arisen in conjunction with the Part-time work Directive .
Finally , I would like to say something about the members of the Swedish Moderate Party who will soon be speaking here .
It is then no longer a matter of social cohesion .
The recruitment difficulties of companies are solved to an increasing extent by taking on staff from temporary work agencies .
Immigrants often gain excellent opportunities to get a foothold in the labour market through these companies .
It is therefore difficult to create even framework legislation which takes into account all the differences .
In Sweden , permanent employment is the rule .
Blue-collar workers have collective agreements guaranteeing that pay will not fall below the pay in the user undertaking and that the working hours of the user undertaking will apply .
The temporary work agency sector functions well in Sweden and could be a model for Europe .
At the same time , we should not be frightened simply because we do not have the answers to all the questions .
In this context , biotechnology offers many opportunities .
A society which seeks to develop prosperity and justice , and which wants more and more people to be able to live in acceptable environments must ensure economic growth .
It is not enough to state that we have to be successful , we must also act .
My committee and I are grateful for the fact that the rapporteur and the committee responsible have chosen to take on board so many of the views we have presented .
It would be sensible to have a more comprehensive political debate on the bank 's approach and also more comprehensive scrutiny of the bank 's activities on the part of the other EU institutions .
The reason for the European Investment Bank 's having been a fairly anonymous wielder of power in the EU is no doubt the special status of this body .
We wish to increase the Court of Auditors ' access to information from the European Investment Bank .
It should , for example , be possible to welcome the chairman of the bank to our meetings .
In a year or so , we should also like to see a progress report made on the task taken on in Gothenburg concerning impact on climate change .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr Maystadt , I want to begin by thanking Mrs van den Burg for the sterling work she has done .
Crucial progress has been made within both these important areas .
As you can hear , the EIB now already has more than enough on its plate .
I know that there is a certain scepticism within the EIB where the view is that the EIB cannot be compared with the World Bank and that , moreover , the EU has the institution of the Ombudsman .
Is there by any chance some new scare about new germs spreading here ?
I am happy to leave it to children 's parents to decide about this issue .
We have chosen to refrain from adopting positions on quite a few parts of the report .
The EU should instead immediately abolish the extensive subsidies it pays out for the cultivation of tobacco .
This principle should not be lost through EU coordination .
We have therefore voted against the proposal for a special Directorate General with chief responsibility for coordinating the biotechnology strategy .
Instead , I shall try to make the message as stringent as possible .
The United States 's message is , at least in our eyes , worse in terms of combating the climate change that is under way .
It is , above all , a question of making further progress with the important work that will now commence when this part of the Kyoto Protocol has been concluded .
One factor , for example , is the one I have just addressed , namely the situation in the developing countries and our relations with those countries .
We must adopt a clearer role in helping the developing countries to protect themselves against climate change .
Without doubt , the most serious point in this annual report is , however , the general criticism of the reliability of the EU 's accounting system and of its financial management .
In addition , the changes seem to be taking a long time .
In principle , it is impossible to claim both these things at the same time .
One cannot both point to an accounting system which cannot be followed and
