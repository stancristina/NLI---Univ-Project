I therefore make an appeal that we should not continue to act as in the past .
And I think Europe too will be better off if Albania prospers and if its economic situation improves substantially .
Now , however , the difficulties to be faced by the new government are beginning .
What has happened to the money ?
Mr. President , it is now certain that some of man 's activities pose a grave threat both to the environment and to public health .
We must take particular account of the destruction we are 'preparing ' today for future generations .
The outcry made as he departed this life by the great explorer and environmentologist Cousteau , to whom mankind owes so much , is very recent .
As for the point in the Directive which refers to the type of waste , the green list which according to the commission contains harmless substances , many of which , however , are harmful to the environment and to public health , I consider it very important to take account of the list included in the Basel Convention and incorporate it in the proposed regulation .
The Minister for Education reappointed the candidate , the candidate submitted a complaint against me in 1993 , together with the President of the Legal Committee we submitted detailed memoranda and the matter was consigned to the archives .
Mr President , once again it seems that the chaos of persecution levelled at tobacco cultivation is continuing .
Mr. President , since the first measures against tobacco production in 1992 , production has fallen by 31 % and the number of growers by 7 % .
But it is in fact neither ; it is deliberate , and aims to serve the interests of major tobacco-trading multinational monopolies which want to import cheap tobacco of appalling quality from third countries , to glut the markets and inflate their profits .
Finally , instead of restricting the budget , it should be increased to provide resources for research on tobacco , to improve both its quality ...
The Commission 's proposal to buy up the quotas will result in economic hardship for large regions , increased unemployment and desertion of rural areas .
It would only happen if tobacco imports from cheap countries were also banned and if the manufacture of cigarettes were banned as well .
The Rosado Fernandes report is along the right lines , because it covers the entire scope of the tobacco industry and does not forget the growers .
Go to the north of Greece and see the hillsides and rocks on which tobacco grows .
Unfortunately , the Commission and the Council are trying to present the issue in a different way , claiming that there is supposedly a contradiction since on the one hand we spend money on an anti-smoking campaign , while on the other hand we subsidize tobacco growers , of whom there are approximately 150 000 within the European Union .
Consequently , their concern is not to protect European citizens but to save money , money intended to serve the cause of enlargement .
It is the European Union , all of us in other words , who watched the war take its course while we just sat in the European Parliament debating and passing resolutions , while we waited for America to come along and provide some sort of solution , which is in essence not a solution for peace , but simply a cessation of armed conflict .
But we must not search out the guilty on one side only . there may be more of them on one side and less on another , but there are guilty on both side and it strikes me as strange that we look for them only on one side and not on the other .
Madam President , after many struggles all that has been achieved so far must count as aquis , if we take into account the 1989 United National Convention on the Rights of Children , the 1995 Peking Conference on Womens ' Rights , Article 4 of the Declaration on the Abolition of Violence against Women , the results of the International Conference in Cairo , and others .
The European Union has a duty to oppose such retrogression , which is being attempted mainly by Islamic fundamentalists once more against women , and should raise its voice to defend womens ' rights which are after all human rights too .
The imposition of sexual excision in women supposedly for religious reasons is an act of barbarism , a violation against the laws of nature , it is the deprivation of a right with which nature has endowed women .
Possibly by means of the much-discussed Centre for Fire Protection , which we have talked about for so long and which we would very much like to see established in Greece .
Secondly , to make full use of every option available within the scope of the relevant programmes , such as INTEREG II C and Regulation 308/97 , for preventive action and more effective fire-fighting measures in the Community 's high-risk areas .
So what is to be done ?
A campaign is needed to inform citizens , but the Commission should also monitor the efficacy of the measures adopted .
We also call on the Commission , at last , to develop a global prevention strategy , working along with the Member States but also supervising them in some way .
The one does not exclude the other , and I honestly believe Parliament should have the opportunity , just as it has the standing and the responsibility , to discuss this matter in principle because it has aroused such strong feeling and there are , of course , very differing views on it .
The fast approaching enlargement of the European Union , combined with the need for closer
