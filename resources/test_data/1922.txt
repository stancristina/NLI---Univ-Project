said in the debate last night , they would be very damaging for EU company competitiveness .
They introduce rigid structures and try to bring company law in by the back door , which will not achieve a single market in capital and will undermine investor confidence of our shareholders .
Following ten years of negotiation , I regret that this Parliament has chosen by a narrow qualified majority vote to allow company boards the right to defensive measures to frustrate takeovers without getting approval from shareholders .
However , I welcome the fact that the Commission cannot go along with the rapporteur 's views on this and I hope that common sense will prevail in conciliation .
I am pleased that we rejected the rapporteur 's very messy approach on jurisdiction : this would have led to very much litigation and court cases and would have served nobody 's interests , not least the interests of EU companies .
With the passage of Amendment No 20 , the EPLP has made it clear that while employee consultation is the objective of a framework directive on employment , we also believe that a spirit of cooperation is needed to consult workforces and their representatives when we have discussions on takeovers and mergers .
Mr President , this common position was again voted through with a narrow majority .
The Commission and the rapporteur have failed to recognise that the art trade is a global business and would be better regulated by an international agreement .
We now fear that the art market will go offshore .
The Commission , again , has failed to commit itself to entering international negotiations to get an international deal on droit de suite , claiming that it feels it does not have a mandate in this area .
It now does have a mandate with the voting through and the start of the conciliation procedure .
The Commission has also failed spectacularly to give us any analysis of the economic impact of the directive before us .
This leads us to conclude that it is not proven to be necessary to complete the single market .
It cannot , therefore , be the objective of this Parliament to undermine the European art market and in conciliation I hope now that the Member States and Commission will be able to maintain the common position .
The amendments that Mr Zimmerling has tabled will deal a death blow to the vitality to the European art market , with loss of jobs and , I fear , very few living artists benefiting from this resale right .
The EPLP abstained on this report because it calls for the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor as advocated by the Corpus Juris expert group .
A European Public Prosecutor established according to Corpus Juris would have wide-ranging powers to carry out investigations in Member States .
Corpus Juris envisages the eventual creation of an independent European Prosecution Office with jurisdiction for offences against the EU 's financial interests carried out both by members and officials of EU institutions and by third parties .
It would establish the EU as a single legal area for the purpose of investigation , prosecution , trial and execution of sentences concerning this type of offence .
The British Government is opposed to this proposal , which it considers is too broad in scope and presents too many problems in terms of different legal systems and traditions to be practical .
The government 's preference is to improve existing cooperation between Member States to tackle fraud and other serious crimes with a cross-border element .
This would involve the ratification of the 1995 Convention on the protection of the European Communities ' financial interests by those Member States which have yet to ratify , and the mutual recognition of legal systems .
Mr President , one of the problems with the banana issue , it seems to me , is that it has become rather emotive .
I see my job as a Member of the European Parliament as not just to look after those banana producers within the European Union but all the people in Europe .
I understand how people feel about changes to the system but , as I said , I want to look after everyone within the European Union as a whole .
If , in that process , I can safeguard the interests of our ACP countries then that is all to the good , but I believe that it is important that we safeguard and look to the welfare of European citizens .
We seem sometimes to have lost sight of this fact .
I am not one to welcome the way in which the USA has implemented these draconian measures , but it is desperately important that we get a settlement .
In my constituency I have industries that are being forced out of business .
Jobs are being lost within the European Union because of 100 % tariffs on products .
I have received many letters about the fact that it is an emotive issue .
It may well be to some of our southern Members even more emotive .
Well , I just say to them , this is about real people .
It is about real emotions and about real jobs .
People are being forced out of business because of the Americans and therefore I say it is important that we accept the ruling of the WTO .
Either we are in a club or we are out of it and it is particularly important that we accept this .
As I said just now , I never accepted the way the Americans acted but it is too late now to deal with that .
Therefore , I call upon this House to take a decision tomorrow and I support the proposals by Mr Vatenen , who is speaking later
