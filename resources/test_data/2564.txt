that the necessary infrastructures will be created which will allow women farmers to combine their working and family life and have quality of life .
Finally , I should like to refer to a very successful field of action in Greece , women 's cooperatives , especially rural tourism cooperatives .
There is , of course , the European Commission 's ten-year programme , which we shall also be looking at and commenting on extensively within the framework of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , and there are other ideas which are already referred to in our motion .
The European Parliament has made a proposal here , which I hope the Council will deal with positively .
The legislation exists .
And it is up to the governments to apply this specific legislation as quickly as possible .
We will need to pay particular attention to road projects in order to avoid poor workmanship .
Mr President , I am sorry to have to denounce an unacceptable and disgraceful action by the Turkish forces illegally occupying the northern part of Cyprus .
I think there is no need , Mr President , for me to stress to this House how many and which fundamental rights and international agreements are being violated .
To my point now .
The Communist Party of Greece condemns the illegal and unacceptable action by the Romanian authorities , which is obviously intended to muzzle any opinion which defends fundamental rights and promotes socialist visions .
I had the opportunity to obtain information about certain very serious violations of fundamental human rights , the occasional progress reports on Latvia notwithstanding .
Such is the case of Alfred Rubiks , the president of the Socialist Party , which is represented in parliament , and other important public figures .
Again we have the well-known policy of one sauce for the goose and another for the gander .
Mr President , the European Union continues to keep quiet in the face of the major crime being perpetrated in Palestine by Sharon 's mafia government .
.
It is in fact about the huge issue which is troubling the Council , the Commission and the European Parliament with contradictory positions and which has to do with investigating potential legal bases for the jurisdiction of the European Union to make provision for criminal sanctions for certain serious violations of Community law .
The common objective of all of us must be the effective application of Community provisions , but with solutions which will be reliable , because our main concern is to create legal certainty .
The report concentrates on the issue of legislating criminal sanctions in the first pillar .
In order to make the problem understandable , I have confined myself to raising the basic question to which the report gives a positive answer , in other words the extent to which the Community can impose an obligation on the Member States to make provision for criminal sanctions for serious infringements of Community law .
By contrast , the purely Community method of making direct provision for criminal sanctions under Community law , a sort of communitisation of criminal law , comes up against serious legal objections which start from the fact that there is no clear legal basis in the Treaty for this issue , that criminal sanctions form part of the national sovereignty of the Member States and that criminal justice is an integral part of national culture .
As regards the so-called national method , which means the right of the states to make provision for criminal sanctions for cases of infringement of Community law , this does not create problems .
With the constitution being drafted , these issues will have a new basis .
Thus , the report clarifies that , in order for such a Community initiative to be legal with the law as it stands , it must only be exercised in cases in which this is the only way to safeguard effective compliance with Community provisions .
It is of vital importance to bridge these differences by fostering long-term , balanced and polycentric development throughout our European Union .
It also calls on plenary to accept our motion for a resolution .
Mr President , I can represent Mr Pom√©s Ruiz , if you wish , and speak on his behalf .
As Commissioner Barnier has also pointed out in the past , Parliament considers that if Community funding falls below this point for cohesion policies , these policies , especially in view of enlargement , will cease to be reliable and efficient .
It is becoming clear and I think it has also been understood by the Commission , which has from time to time organised seminars with local and regional authorities on the subject , especially in the run up to the new programming period , that we need to pool our thoughts as to how these actions can be made more efficient by simplifying them .
Nonetheless , Parliament feels there is still a need to clarify Article 158 of the Treaty on island areas .
Parliament also feels that , over and above structural actions , the article referring to state aid , namely Article 87 , also needs to be amended so that the areas we are talking about today are also included in the areas needing special treatment .
The Commissioner recently ordered studies on the subject .
It started with mountain areas and then moved on to island areas .
For example , after 23 years of integration , Greece is still the poorest country in the European Union .
In addition , the poor regions have more than doubled since enlargement .
The purpose of this proposal is to ensure that foreign crews working on ships sailing under the flag of a Member State of the Union have been trained and certified in all cases in accordance with international requirements .
