In Britain the choice could not be clearer in our coming election : to guarantee a decentralised Europe that works , only the Conservatives offer an agenda which can get the post-Nice process right .
To secure our European future , like the British , most people in Europe want to be in Europe but not run by Europe .

Mr President , following Lisbon and Nice , I had hoped to see a better balance in the Commission 's work programme between employment , economic and social policies , but I do not see much evidence of that .
We need balanced progress in the internal market , in competition policy and in social policy , but again I do not see much evidence of that in the Commission 's work programme .
I would like to see , for example , a recognition of the interdependence between these areas of policy .
In competition policy and internal market rules we need an amendment to the merger regulation to include considerations related to employment and social rights and the inclusion , for example , of social clauses in the public procurement framework .
I would have liked a recognition of these inter-relationships , but I do not see it .
I see far faster movement in the economic and internal market sphere than in the social sphere and there are real dangers of a growing imbalance in that respect .
Furthermore I do not see much evidence in the Commission 's work programme of the social agenda agreed at Nice last December .
We will see further progress in areas of open coordination , in employment - well established now - and the first steps in relation to social protection .
I should mention the fundamental problem that key Commission documents are not made available to Parliament and its rapporteurs in good time .
We need to have respect for parliamentary procedures in relation to these new forms of open coordination .
Finally , on a specific issue , the Commission 's work programme misses the point by a great distance when it promises a Green Paper on a corporate sense of social responsibility in the middle of this year .
A Green Paper on such a code is a sick joke to the many thousands of workers who have been affected by restructuring in recent weeks .
We need a complete overhaul of the legislation framework in this area and I hope the Commission will move quickly in that respect .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , we agree that after Lisbon we need a knowledge-based economy .
I am glad that Mr Prodi emphasised the overriding importance of sustainable development , which has implications well beyond the natural environment .
We welcome the acceleration of the energy market , though there is a risk of that aim clashing with the aim of sustainable development .
I hope you will pursue rigorously a policy of encouraging renewable energy sources and rational use of energy .
As far as trade is concerned , we agree that a new WTO round is desirable , again subject to the constraints of sustainable development .
I wish to convey to Mr Prodi our very great disappointment at the lack of involvement by the European Parliament in trade matters , which could have been rectified at Nice , but which was not .
I strongly urge you to work on an Interinstitutional Agreement which involves the European Parliament in trade matters .
We believe in reform and democratisation of the WTO .
We believe the everything but arms move is a good step , although some of us regret the delayed timetable which sends a message of less than complete commitment to the least developed countries in the world .
As far as innovation and research are concerned , we look forward to a detailed Sixth Framework Programme .
If you present us with very vague proposals , that will certainly delay implementation and lead to concern and disappointment throughout the EU.
The European research area is of course important .
We look forward to wide publicity for the benchmarking exercises , particularly in the areas of enterprise and innovation .
Mr President , on this side of the House we are not trying to stop restructuring but we want it to be done in a socially responsible way .
We want a pro-active approach to industrial restructuring and change .
We want to see a corporate code of social responsibility but we can see that this will be achieved only when we have an updated and completed legal framework in this area .
We want to see true partnership at work and the real benefits that this can bring to the European Union .
But the latest spate of restructuring in the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union shows that we are far from achieving those things .
To the Corus workers in the north-east of England or Wales , to the Vauxhall workers in Luton - or , for that matter , the Danone workers in France and Holland - the idea of a corporate code of responsibility - as I said in an earlier debate - is a sick joke , quite frankly .
The promise of a Green Paper in the middle of this year is not an adequate response to the anguish that those workers , their families and entire communities have felt .
We want to see a review of the law on collective redundancies , a review on transfers , a review of the European Works Council Directive , to make sure it is a directive that is observed rather than being systematically avoided by business .
We also want to see the general framework on information and consultation adopted as a matter of urgency .
This is absolutely essential if we are going to
