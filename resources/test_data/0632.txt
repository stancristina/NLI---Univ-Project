it .
Mr President , from the list of speakers it would seem that the rest of you will now have to follow the PPE-DE family ' s internal debate , but of course that is perfectly in order .
Seen in this light the results of the Laeken summit were good .
They will take the Community forward both ideologically and realistically .
The Laeken Declaration is a successful mixture of questions regarding problems to be solved and , on the other hand , faith in being able to solve them .
I think the best decision taken at the Laeken Summit , however , was that by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt , whose personal contribution certainly lies behind Belgium ' s success there , as he very quickly put a stop to the row over agencies .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Laeken Declaration on the future of the European Union is a positive step towards a European Union that is more citizen-oriented and more transparent .
It is essential from the point of view of the Union ' s credibility that words and deeds go hand in hand .
The Union and its institutions have - with good reason - been criticised for being too distant from the people .
The European Council must observe the same principles of democracy , efficiency and consistency that we also expect of the other EU institutions .
The problem , however , lies in the fact that three distinguished European statesmen , each with a long life ' s work behind them , have now been appointed to lead the Convention .
At Laeken the question of the location of the urgently needed food agency to be set up in the new year was discussed .
It is quite indefensible that populist objectives should be able to hamper decision-making in a matter that is crucial to the health and well-being of our citizens .
I shall describe a case which relates to these Directives , and which concerns my home city of Helsinki .
A competing bidder was not satisfied with this , but appealed to the national court , claiming inter alia that the City of Helsinki had selected a bid which was not the most advantageous one economically , in other words it was not the cheapest .
It is interesting that the position of the advocate-general is precisely the same as that of the Commission 's Directorate-General which is responsible for environmental matters , and different from that of the Directorate-General which is responsible for the internal market .
To my esteemed and dear colleague Astrid Thors I would like to say that of course social legislation is different in the different countries , but perhaps this is the precise reason why we should also permit a public authority to comply with its own social criteria , and why we should find sustainable compromises between the political groups in these questions .
It amends the 1996 Directive so as to meet the national emission ceilings for atmospheric pollutants and the recommendations of the World Health Organisation .
In the Directive which has now been approved , the Member States are obliged to submit plans which will allow the limit values necessary for the protection of human health and of vegetation to be lowered by 2010 . 2020 will be the benchmark year for long-term objectives and for the subsequent revision of the Directive .
In Finland for example the greater part of the ozone present in the lower atmosphere originates from transboundary pollution , in other words from emissions which our country could , in reality , hardly influence at all without the European Union .
In the environmental field , Parliament has thus used its new and enhanced authority in a good and responsible manner .
This work needs to be continued , the Commission must be encouraged to be more ambitious when drafting its proposals , and the good cooperation developed with the Council in the field of the environment needs to be kept as warm and effective as it is at present .
Mr President , with regard to the Sixth Environment Action Programme I would first of all like to offer thanks to the 'shadow rapporteurs ' of the various Parliamentary groups for their fine cooperation .
The Commission , too , has been a good cooperation partner : we have held a great many discussions .
In this respect this forms a continuation to the Fifth Environmental Action Programme , but in the course of this integration we must attain concrete objectives and actual results , and then we will also need structural amendments , for example to the Commission 's own actions .
The future agricultural reform must take steps in the direction of more sustainable procedures , and the new instruments for improving the state of the environment must incorporate a clear focusing of the EU 's aid policy on the environmental aspect .
The conflict which presently reigns over subsidies from the environmental point of view must be eliminated .
Money , incidentally , can act as a fine consultant , and in this spirit environmentally-related and energy taxes ( for example ) must also be developed .
This has been a very contentious question : the Commission has not supported this , and the Council also has doubts .
In my opinion these objectives are required , in particular , as instruments for directing policy .
The thematic strategies must be approved using the codecision procedure .
In my opinion this is quite self-evident , since it is through these strategies that we will be directing environmental policy in its crucial aspects .
This is the amendment by the European Liberal and Democratic Party group concerning rejection of the common position .
Mr President , the USA unilaterally withdrew from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty
