date and there are still one or two Member States , in particular my own , where Parliament and the Commission have different offices and where in terms of financing Parliament 's office well over 70 % of the expenditure goes on bricks and salaries , it does not leave much for communications .
The sooner we can make sure that the image of the European Union is reflected by one European House , the better it will be .
The last point refers to the question of the implications for enlargement .
I would like to support what our rapporteur has said that we cannot suddenly leap into beginning to authorise posts for preparing enlargement if a political decision has not yet been taken ; all the more so , because in Parliament 's estimates , as I have understood them , we have in front of us an assumption that we are going to have more languages as a result of enlargement .
Yet we have had no debate in this House to know how we are going to handle not a limited enlargement but an extensive enlargement following the Helsinki Summit late last year , with potentially 12 or 13 new countries , that is 27 - 28 countries with over 20 different languages .
How , Secretary-General , are we going to handle this if we do not have some thinking from the Administration as to where we are going to put them all ?
Are we going to have rooms which we are going to have to adjust for over 20 languages so that in every room where there is a discussion in this Parliament every person has the right to use their own language ?
We are aware that in the last Parliament a lot of work was done on this by Vice-President Cot .
His report was never released to Members .
We never saw it as a report on suggesting how the hub and spoke system should work - the relay system for interpretation - nor , indeed , did we really have any thinking about the freelancing possibilities with modern communications where we can dispatch a large amount of our translation material to people who are in the Member States , rather than recruiting a whole range of people to come and work in Luxembourg as fixed and permanent employees of Parliament .
Therefore , I strongly support the compromise which has been put forward by our rapporteur asking , by first reading , for the Secretary-General to come up with a strategy of how to handle the whole question of languages in Parliament and enlargement .
I suspect the Commission might wish to do that as well , because it is a problem which rightly , in this amendment , relates to interinstitutional matters .
I very much hope that the Socialist Group will change their mind , get their heads out of the sand and realise that this is the problem which we have to tackle and that it is better to do it now rather than later .
Mr President , let me also start by congratulating Mr Ferber on a comprehensive estimate of Parliament 's revenue and expenditure .
I support the thrust of this report , which is in line with the policy of budgetary rigour , because the major challenges that this Chamber needs to address are greater accountability and transparency which will involve embracing institutional reform with vigour ; secondly , the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and thirdly , a drive towards improving efficiency through effective budgetary control and better use of resources .
Our main priority has to be to explain to European citizens what we are doing , why we are doing it and how we are doing it .
We must win the confidence of the European taxpayer and we can only do this by improving accountability through simplifying - not mystifying - the work of Parliament , by reducing jargon , by improving the process of approving legislation and improving the legislative machinery and by making a clear connection between what we do here and how it benefits the individual .
We are going a long way towards achieving this transparency through the introduction of activity-based budgeting and the proposal we have in this report to put appropriations for political parties in separate budget lines will contribute significantly to achieving this .
These virtues are all the more important as we move towards the challenge facing the EU at the moment of enlargement .
We in the Socialist Group strongly believe that the European Parliament should be giving every encouragement to candidate countries in their preparation to joint the EU.
I have the impression that there are those in this House who appear to be frustrating this process of enlargement by placing unnecessary obstacles in the way and often using spurious arguments to limit the preparation for enlargement : for example , the rejection of the proposal to fill the 35 vacant posts in the language reserve between 2001 and 2002 .
The reason given , and also outlined by my colleague Mr Elles , is that we believe that this will pre-empt discussions with accession states .
Do we seriously believe that this small step will influence all the institutions as to which countries are in the first tranche and which are in the second tranche ?
Do we really believe that by committing less than half a per cent of Parliament 's language budget the political decision will be made and taken out of our control ?
I am somewhat confused and if I recall correctly , the rapporteur agreed previously and argued vigorously for setting up an interinstitutional recruitment agency in his last report .
What is the point of approving a joint operation whilst at the same time we are preventing any recruitment of people
