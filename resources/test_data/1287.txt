as a result of the European Parliament 's work , between this directive and the drawing up of a new national and Community fiscal policy for fuels .
I would , however , emphasise that the need to genuinely ensure , in Community as well as in national terms , geographical coverage that enables the effective marketing of fuels with a maximum sulphur content not exceeding 10mg/kg ( PPM) .
These diseases kill more than five and a half million people every year , have destabilising effects on society , and compromise the work and the progress achieved over the last few years in social and economic development .
( PT ) I welcome Mr Wijkman 's report and his proposal for a regulation .
( PT ) I supported the main thrust of the report and of the amendments that were tabled , bearing in mind the urgent requirements of a challenge that absolutely everyone agrees on : to combat the diseases of HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , which are linked to poverty in the developing countries .
This is necessary given the frequent allegations of maladministration , which are particularly shocking in an area in which human health and life are at stake .
To be specific , we did not feel we could vote for a resolution that ignored Iraq 's ongoing and serious breaches of the UN resolutions , or which did not mention the fact that what is at stake in this argument is guaranteeing the preservation of international peace and security , or even linking the Iraqi regime to international terrorism and to the real danger that terrorist groups could be the recipients of arms of mass destruction produced in that country .
This vote might well be celebrated in Baghdad and has , to this extent , at least one positive aspect : it highlights the deceptiveness of the argument of those who are rooted in an archaic left-wing ideology and have boundless rhetoric that appears to condemn but in fact simply plays into Saddam Hussein 's hands .
Mr President , this part of the sitting is usually dedicated to recounting the litany of horrors perpetrated in the world : massacres , breaches of human rights , torture and the violation , in general , of the most basic principles of civilised life .
Consequently the Mozambican authorities and legal system must be supported and encouraged .
Held once again in Brazil , but this time coinciding with the election and inauguration of President Lula da Silva as President of that country , and since he was one of the major driving forces of the World Social Forum , this event was , of course , influenced by these factors .
Porto Alegre was not , therefore , by any stretch of the imagination , merely a critical counterpoint to Davos .
What was omitted in particular were the damaging effects that the primacy of the market causes , especially in terms of deepening the North-South divide , of increasing poverty in the world and of environmental degradation .
In Davos , it was discussed because of the effects of the economic situation of the war against Iraq that the United States and its allies have decided on .
The other issue I wish to raise , Mr President , concerns international maritime traffic , the safety of our seas and of our coastal communities .
This reconciliation is now to be found in Rio de Janeiro , in Johannesburg , in Lisbon and in Gothenburg .
We must take action on prices by adding on the environmental costs of all products .
The last Social Forum , which took place last January , was particularly significant , as has already been said , for the number of participants , around 100 000 , who had come from all over the world , it was significant for the around 1 500 NGOs and other civic associations that were present and , above all , for the quality of the speeches .
It was not so hard to understand , however : Lula explained to the audience of politicians , businessmen and experts gathered at Davos , and I quote 'that his war was different ; it was the fight against hunger and poverty , for access to better education , against diseases and epidemics such as AIDS , not the war against Iraq or to call for higher rates of growth at the expense of unemployment and of greater poverty ' .
Evidence of this is the proposal for free access to the markets of the richest countries for the agricultural products of the poorer countries .
Amongst these are the ACP countries , under the Cotonou agreements , and the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean .
Unless this is done , we shall be doing something that our society does not understand and we shall be attacking our own interests and , even worse , we shall not be supporting the interests of the poorest countries .
The report concerns a long-awaited proposal for a directive which is crucial for facilitating the free movement of persons and which takes into account the work carried out at the end of the 1990s , in particular by the high level panel chaired by Mrs Simone Veil , on citizenship of the European Union .
In particular it extends from three to six months the period during which citizens are not subject to any formalities other than the possession of a valid identity card or passport .
This proposal incorporates the clarifications made by the Court 's recent decisions and , once adopted , it should considerably simplify the exercise of the fundamental rights of every European citizen .
The work of our rapporteur , Mr Santini - and very good work it is - has helped to introduce into this proposal a set of contributions that I believe are extremely positive .
