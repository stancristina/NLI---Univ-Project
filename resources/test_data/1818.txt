On behalf of whom or what would Mr Stoiber call for Mr Prodi to resign ?
Economic development and social progress are not their concern .
So why did the Amsterdam negotiators , who were not stupid either , adopt a stupid rule ?
What is stupid is believing that different societies , which develop differently , can withstand being caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of the money rate and a tighter budget .
They must be considered and developed so that finally the broad lines of economic policy have a purpose , namely that the Member States agree to make them their own when laying down their own guidelines .
It is clear what is causing the block today : on the one hand , the Stability and Growth Pact is growing less relevant by the day ; on the other , the Member States have no desire to hand over their economic and budgetary powers to Brussels , as shown by the stormy debates within the Convention 's Working Party on Economic Governance .
My concern , personally , is that this incorporation would confer first-rung status on the Charter in the hierarchy of European texts .
I consider this declaration to be premature , as certain major issues have not yet been resolved .
Following on from other reports already adopted by Parliament , I believe that the proposal before us today makes it possible to establish something that is a real credit to us , in other words an area of freedom , security and justice .
In the absence of a common European policy on asylum and immigration issues , we are now witnessing unacceptable competition in Europe between all the governments of the various EU Member States , designed to downgrade the conditions for receiving refugees , so as to be the most unwelcoming and the most unattractive , and which also aims to criminalise refugees on the pretext of fighting against phenomena such as illegal immigration .
How many refugees , by the way ?
We do not know .
Subsidiary protection exists , however , to bridge the gaps found in some interpretations of the Geneva Convention , under which a refugee is defined as a person persecuted by a government .
I prefer to use the expression 'vision ' rather than cultural 'policy ' . Those who call it cultural policy are referring to the debate or dispute that we could have .
I believe that , for the performing arts and theatre in particular , it is the same thing , we must have State aid and this aid begins with the responsibility that the States must assume to facilitate the movement of individuals and productions in Europe , as well as to encourage training .
Under the cooperation agreements , I refer to Action II of the Culture 2000 programme , we are currently supporting , and will do so for three years , six networks in the area of the theatre , three in that of dance , seven in that of music , a network in the area of the circus and two interdisciplinary networks , and this is for performing arts networks alone .
I would also like to point out that , as part of the action plan on mobility presented by the Commission at the European Summit in Barcelona , a comprehensive Internet site on the mobility of Europeans is to be set up in 2003 and the development of a 'culture ' portal will enable the Commission to provide an increasing amount of information regarding mobility in the cultural sector .
You mention in particular the question of free movement of stage equipment .
There is , moreover , continuity in Parliament 's requests in this area , and I refer you the Ruffolo Report .
Allow me , first of all , to thank all my fellow Members from all the political groups for the discussions that we have had and the work that they have performed via the 800 amendments .
You will choose between either health or the market .
We must also remember that generic products are only developed due to innovation .
This unmitigated rejection poses a problem , however .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , revising Community legislation on medicinal products , with the aim of providing improved levels of care , is a good thing and we welcome this new process of harmonisation of veterinary and human medicinal products .
We could certainly have gone a little further .
The safety and the quality of medicines are based on a scientific evaluation , which highlights the risks and benefits of the product .
Mr President , the - apparently essential - aim of the proposals for a regulation and directive put forward by the Commission is to strengthen the short-term competitiveness of pharmaceutical companies .
Regarding the protection of commercial data , the compromise adopted in committee , by 8 Members with 2 abstentions , balances the requirements and is , in my view , perfectly suitable .
Yet , the quest for profits cannot be reconciled with the defence of public health .
That said , the rapporteurs have - virtually - achieved the impossible .
This development must be supported without jeopardising the operation of the national health systems and whilst respecting the need for maximum safety .
It costs approximately EUR 22 for a traditional tattoo , almost EUR 70 for a microchip , involving a mandatory visit to the vet , who from now on has the monopoly on identification .
I wanted to make a point of saying this because later on I will propose , on the contrary , that we do not vote on a legislative resolution .
It makes you wonder ...
Once again , the Commission is playing a destructive role , which should lead us to consider the relationship between the European institutions in general .
That
