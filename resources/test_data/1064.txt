In the latter case , that is certainly true , but the idea that , in future , everything serving to combat terrorism will be dealt with in accordance with a codecision procedure , is something I find highly doubtful , since this is an area in which the Council’s decisions must be unanimous .
Mr Alvaro has accurately described how Parliament kept asking questions , for months on end ; it got us nowhere , because the Council was unwilling to give way , until the Commission came up with a proposal that helped us to prepare the way for a consensus .
It was very laborious , but now the job is done .
This is what has prompted the German Federal Minister of Justice , Brigitte Zypries , to initiate a parliamentary review .
I propose to tell you why I have done this .
We must also , though , be aware that we find ourselves caught between the desire to protect fundamental rights and the need to fight against international terrorism and organised crime .
The day after tomorrow , we will be having a debate in which we will be responding to the Chinese military interventions in a Tibetan monastery as a matter of topical and urgent importance .
Are there any implications as regards financial aid ?     .
Mr  Herrero wondered whether the pluralism of the media was still guaranteed in a world where changes took place every day .
We also agree that advertising has no place in children’s programmes .
Let me take as an example the Austrian law on product placement : that is a very sensible law , and it is working very well .
Doing so will enable us to conclude one of the very difficult European transport dossiers this year , at second reading , whilst striking a balance between Europe’s requirements as a business location – with free movement of goods in the internal market of 25 and more – and an infrastructure costs directive that also takes very much better account than previously of environmental concerns and the health of the people having to live along European transport routes .
It brings about a Europe-wide changeover to a system of transport infrastructure costs and thus to fairer user financing of the infrastructure that is calculated on a uniform basis .
We did make some progress during our negotiations with the Council , but too little .
Therefore , the compromise entails a very great responsibility and obligation for the Commissioner .
We also have to ask which costs are already internalised today and which are not .
This would have been a major step ; one that we unfortunately failed to take .     . – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , if a regulation is concluded at first reading , the rapporteur deserves double the praise , especially if it was not a very easy one .
We do not want to be old , however , and certainly not to do without mobility .
I am delighted that the fruits of many years of work in the 15 old Member States , which are now taken for granted in these countries , are also to be reaped by the 10 new Member States , in line with the principles of partnership and solidarity .
Only 10 % of jobs in Jamaica depend on sugar , but the crime rate there is already incredibly high , with 1 400 murders having been committed this year alone in a country that numbers two million inhabitants .
The first of these is the relocation of businesses .
We have been getting along well with each other in this House , but style on its own is not enough .
Those who call that into question are , in essence , also questioning the right of the Palestinians to live as they are entitled to , for , if you deny Israel the right to exist , you are opposing any sort of Palestinian state ; the fact is that , without Israel , there will not be one .
Five and a half months later , Mr President-in-Office , I get the impression that that is still the case , and let me tell you what impression my group gets : whatever country holds the Presidency – not just the British – we always get told the same thing by the Presidents of the Council .
It is not just about selling the new maths to Europe , for I have now learned that there is such a thing as new maths , according to which a reduced increase is the same thing as a reduction .
To avoid this iceberg , Mr Alexander , you have to sail in the direction of the Böge report .
Turning to the Financial Perspective , you affirmed your belief in a Europe of solidarity , yet are dividing the EU financially and creating a first - and second-class Europe .
Do you think it realistic that this enlargement should include the countries of the Balkans ?
Far from us being the agents of the governments ’ national and individualistic interests , our cause is that of Europe as a community , of an effective and decisive European Union united in solidarity .
Ever since the attacks on 11 September , there has been evidence of a growing tendency to take action not only against those in the exposure business – in other words , journalists – but also against those elements that do not conform , or who incur the authorities ’ displeasure .
If we were to adopt the terrorists ’ methods by trampling the law underfoot , they would be the winners .
