In addition to being a matter for social organisations , the rules linking the social participation of shareholders with the right to vote are rules of proportionality , in which equality is fully respected .     .
In the name of competition , priority is given to the interests of economic operators to the detriment of consumer protection .
We also have reservations about the scope of the future legal framework for national payments , since consumers should clearly not have to put up with conditions that are less favourable than they are currently .     .
This Commission communication , which follows on from consultation with the interested parties , which took place following the approval of the Green Paper on IPP ( Integrated Product Policy ) , in February 2001 , defines the measures the Communication will adopt , in order to push ahead with the IPP at European level , with the aim of limiting the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycle .
This is why the Commission is called on to adopt legislative measures to harmonise and enhance this profession at European level and to sign up to this idea under the auspices of the IMO. - The second advocates EU action to ban flags of convenience in European territorial waters .
I shall conclude by reaffirming something to which I have referred on several occasions during my term of office : safety is everyone’s responsibility and requires everyone’s commitment !     .
Although the temporary committee has to date served to maintain the interest of the Institutions , Member States and other organisations involved in the field , it is now up to each of these to assimilate this concern and , above all , to bear in mind ...     – Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with the speech we have just heard .
This must be corrected , otherwise we could be accused of memory loss and of bias .
As a consequence , this mode of transport has lost a great deal of influence to competing sectors , to road transport in particular .
Another point that must be highlighted concerns the agreement reached on the composition of the administrative board of the future European Railway Agency .
The wholesale shift towards liberalisation , like other parallel factors , was bound to reach the railways , in the same way that it has reached education , health and water , establishing the market economy as a single and fundamentalist ideology .
The employment rate at the moment is 64 % ; achieving 70 % by 2010 would entail creating 22 million jobs in the new 25-Member European Union .
As for the objectives of promoting the employment of women and older workers , Portugal has exceeded them .
This then is the background against which we must analyse how Europe’s economic situation develops in the framework of the broad economic policy guidelines .
What Europe really needs is structural reforms , but it also needs the financial means to carry them through .
Aiming at a zero budget deficit in the euro zone over the long term is complete folly , is not supported by any economic theory and would result in the absurdity of a public debt that would , after all , be no better than zero .
In relation to the Parliamentary report , there is general agreement underlining the need to retain the programme of support for the production and marketing of honey .
I voted for rejection of the proposal .     . – It is deeply regrettable that a majority in Parliament has voted in favour of the liberalisation of international rail transport from 1 January 2006 and of national rail transport from 1 January 2007 , the year 2010 having been set as a standing objective for all operators to prepare in an appropriate manner for the liberalisation of passenger transport services , in advance of current Commission initiatives to accelerate the opening-up of this sector to competition .
The rapporteur invited us to approve the joint text after the Conciliation Committee had achieved consensus by weighing up the divergent positions of the Commission and of Parliament , through the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the timetable for the opening-up of the market to freight services , the main point of disagreement .
I must stress that the first article in this directive points out that the objective is the opening-up of the rail network to competition , with the intention of harmonising safety rules across the European Union .
The Member States have agreed to an extension of the Commission ’s powers in this area so as to facilitate the enforcement of the Community rules without , however , ruling out the enforcement of tougher national legislation .
If the aim of the directive is achieved , it should lead to the specification of a high level of technical harmonisation , as shown in the agreement that has been reached .
The revitalisation of our railways has to be a top priority for the European Union .     . – I support the extension of Regulation (EC ) No 975/1999 – which underpins the European Union’s human rights activities in the framework of development cooperation – so as to take account of the financial perspective , which runs until 2006 , and at the same time to adapt it technically to the new Financial Regulation .
I believe , however , that the ‘twin-headed capitals of culture ’ proposal may prove inappropriate in that it will tend to reduce public interest in these events .
The ‘European CV’ , to be known as a ‘Europass’ , may include other documents , such as : - a ‘MobiliPass’ : designed to record a specific European learning
