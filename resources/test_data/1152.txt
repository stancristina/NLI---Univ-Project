We do not have much idea of how the responsibilities can be divided between governments and Commission , or what role trade unions and civil society can play .
Mr President , the debate on my report on the European Union ' s action plans on asylum-seekers and migrants has been postponed until this evening at 6 p.m. , and the vote until tomorrow at 9 a.m.
In this increasingly global world , some people want to impose homogeneity on us , as if we were all soldiers or units in a production chain .
They have released prisoners and accepted the United Nations rulings on eligible voters .
Mr President , the European Union - and Parliament within it , of course - must strive to avoid a new conflict in an area which is already troubled enough .
The instability that could become endemic in this part of Africa could affect some of the outermost Community regions , like my region , the Canary Islands .
If there were to be another postponement it would seriously aggravate the problem .
On the proper conclusion of this process of self-determination depend the stability , peace and indeed the economic integration and development of the whole Maghreb.
The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front must restore the direct dialogue which existed at the end of the 1980' s and which led to the Houston Agreements .
The European Parliament has already had occasion to condemn this type of action by President Fujimori .
There is no independence of the judiciary or of the legislature .
It is well-known - and there is the Carter Foundation report - that access to the media must be provided as soon as possible , media bias must be ended , harassment of candidates and observers in local elections must be ended , improper use of public funds for electoral advantage must be exposed , there must be transparency in electoral administration and access for all parties to the elections and the rights of independent electoral observers must be guaranteed .
From 1980 until barely two months ago , there were regions in Peru under the control of the armed forces , due to the insecurity generated by the terrorism of Shining Path , which cost Peru - and this is the worst thing - 25 000 lives in the last fifteen years and losses of over USD 30 000 million .
We are addressing them to try to preserve species under renewed threat , species like the Asian pangolin , the gorillas of the Congo , the elephants - through the sale of ivory - and the other species mentioned in the resolution .
We abstained because , on the one hand , we support the symbolism and principles of the fight against racism and xenophobia , and some of the points in this report contain important statements , for example , paragraph 8 , on the functions of the European Racism and Xenophobia Information Network and paragraph 24 , which invites the Member States to prioritise some very specific issues in this fight , to mention only two .
Mr President , I am presenting a report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation with regard to information measures relating to the common agricultural policy .
They avoid dealing with the CAP in a passive , purely bureaucratic and technological fashion .
Mr President , that is all I have to say .
This amendment supplements the Council approach , which is purely commercial , and opts for a proposal with wider economic , human and food quality aims .
However , this has still not been done .
On the other hand , the food problems we have had in the European Union have been caused by feeding herbivores with animal-based feedingstuffs , and if we do not encourage the feeding of livestock with plant proteins , such as legumes , and lower their price , farmers will continue to resort to animal meal due to the enormous pressure of competition .
In my country , the consumption of these is 6.5 kg per head annually and anyone who knows how these products are cooked can vouch for the fact that this is a very substantial amount .
I am therefore asking for the support of Parliament for the Commission 's proposals and the improvements which , by way of amendment , are contained in Mar√≠a Izquierdo 's report .
Scotland , Wales , the Basque country , Catalonia , Galicia , even a region as large as Andalusia , cannot depend on the decisions of a central State , however much of a State it is .
These public companies have passed into the hands of private individuals .
It says : " Although the private sector sometimes invests in sectors that are traditionally considered public , it would be incredibly difficult to increase the verification of additionality in private investments , as this would imply the collection and examination of the accounts of a number of private companies which would not be obliged to provide the corresponding information to the national authorities or to the Commission " .
There is a further problem , which should also not be hidden from the Commission or the members of this House : we are talking about the impending enlargement of the European Union with thirteen new Member States , most of which have a far lower average income than that of the poorest regions of the Community and there are no plans to fulfil cohesion policies with regard to these candidate Member States .
From Turkey we expressed our vigorous condemnation of the fact that a person who has fought for human rights for many years , like Mr Birdal - who has not paid with his life in this struggle , although he has unfortunately paid with his health - had gone to prison .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one
