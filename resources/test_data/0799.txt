.     I voted in favour of the agreement between Switzerland and the European Union on taxation of savings income , but I would like to make it clear that I am doing so subject to Parliament being consulted , before this agreement is implemented , about those agreements negotiated with the other third countries : the United States , Andorra , Liechtenstein , Monaco and San Marino .
In 1999 , the Commission came into office promising a policy of zero tolerance as regards fraud and corruption , but today it is bequeathing to its successors half-suppressed scandals ( Eurostat ) and ‘an unprecedented welter of sometimes contradictory rules and newly established units and bodies , making turf wars and mutual buck-passing inevitable ’ ( paragraph 2 ) .
Politically , we do nothing , however .
This brute-force approach has but one aim : that of destroying any hope of a negotiated peace with , as a consequence , the construction of the Wall imposed as the only acceptable solution .
The Union bears a historic and political responsibility , and it can no longer content itself only with issuing condemnations when the region is ablaze or weeping when terrorism strikes .
Finally , and in conclusion , only by reducing the gap between the ruling classes and the people will these reforms be possible .
European comrades , do not ask for whom the bell tolls : it tolls for thee .     Mr President , the Commission 's proposal emphasises the introduction of two new types of packaging in contact with food : what is known as 'active ' packaging , which releases preservatives into the food , and what is known as 'intelligent ' packaging , which warns consumers when the food has gone off or has some undesirable characteristic .
Above all , we must from now on take more account of the immediate environment that causes thousands of cases of cancer .
Our work initially consisted in uniting the various concepts taken up in the texts and in adapting them to the definitions in the Convention .
That is why we should include a precise reference to the concept of sustainable development .
In order to maintain sustainable development , I also suggest not restricting the ability to take action just to NGOs , but including those who manage rural areas  – landowners , farmers , foresters , enterprises etc .
This decision is less simple than it seems , because compromises on some essential points have still not yet been reached .
Finally , our political action must be coherent , effective , and sustainable .
It was under the pressure of events that a coordinator was appointed , even though , in fact , there is an underlying idea , an intuition , one that inspired many of us within the Convention itself : the idea that , with regard to matters where the Heads of State or Government are entitled to their say and must be able to cooperate actively with the tools of a European vision , tools that are in the hands of a Commission , better coordination between various European authorities is needed .
The integration of the financial services markets is essential to strengthen the European economy , as was stated by the European Councils of Lisbon and Stockholm .
The Commission would welcome the creation of groups of market participants within the Committee of European Banking Supervisors , the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee , as well as the Committee of European Securities Regulators .
Up until now , there has in fact been no specific legislation applicable to the extractive industries .
More widely , an excessively security-conscious and repressive immigration policy is a threat to migrants , to international relations and to Europe itself .
The European Parliament has made this false move because it wants to boost its own importance and acquire the image of a defender of freedom ; it may also be due to an element of anti-American demagogy and , lastly , to provocation from the Commission , which has clearly exceeded its powers .
In this report , we have tried to gauge the effectiveness of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , to gauge their effectiveness in respect of all individuals , irrespective of gender , ethnic or cultural origin , sexual orientation , religion , handicap or status .
I turn now to the right of asylum .
I shall now address a few points in greater detail .
Around July , the Commission will be presenting a discussion paper so that the idea of setting up a Human Rights Agency can be the subject of a wide-ranging public debate .
I hope that , together , the Commission and Parliament will be on the right road towards building a genuine fundamental rights policy within the European Union .     Mr President , I too share many of the views and proposals put forward by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery .
There are numerous examples of loathsome financing .
The Yanacocha gold mine in Peru is the prototype toxic tragedy .
It is a matter of harmonising practices , which are already in place in several Member States , concerning the transmission of APIS type data , which is not to be confused with PNR type data .
Quite apart from the energy and time that have been wasted , such an attitude betrays a lack of coordination within the Council and contempt for Parliament and the representatives of the people of Europe , which gives us cause for dismay .
We trust that the Commission will be able to do this .     Mr President , the Marinho report on asylum systems in Europe seems to me to miss the point .
For the period 2003-2007 , over EUR 15 billion are available for new commitments , more than 10 billion for payments
