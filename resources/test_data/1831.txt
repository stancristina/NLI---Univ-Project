Unfortunately , this proposal was rejected by all the political groups and , again unfortunately , it was borne out by the sad events during yesterday 's repeat elections in Albania , which saw very serious cases of intimidation , bombing attempts and so on , against citizens and candidates .
When these terrible attacks took place , the Turkish president happened to be out of the country on an official visit to support an illegal regime which Turkey and the Turkish armed forces have created and are obstinately maintaining in northern Cyprus , contrary to the directives of the international community .
On 17 August , once the shipwreck had already been cut in two , a team from Greece headed by the shipbuilder , Mr Pappas , went to Pakistan in order to clean up the area .
However , under no circumstances can the seamen , especially those who arrived well after the event in order to help clean up the environment , be held as hostages as a negotiating element between the Pakistani authorities and the insurance company .
Public-sector services , courts and laws are all in a language of which they have an inadequate command .
In all three Baltic States , the communist parties are banned and their cadres persecuted .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for giving me this opportunity to report to you on what has been achieved during the European Year of People with Disabilities and how it is to be followed up , given that it is only six weeks until the end of the year .
We have had thousands of events in all the Member States at national , regional and local level , debates in parliament , fora and exchanges of best practices between the Member States , while of course the non-governmental organisations and the Disabled People 's Movement have also made a real contribution to an explosion of events and to passing on the message about the rights of people with disabilities .
It is especially important that we use the momentum created and we must say that today , in every country , initiatives and innovative action are being taken , which was not the case in the past , and we also have important , exceptionally advanced legislation in certain countries .
This relates to our agreement on mainstreaming , so that this policy is not just a matter for the ministries of social affairs or the ministries of health or the ministries of employment , but is a horizontal policy which concerns all the ministries in each country and all portfolios at the Commission .
The deadline expires at the end of December and , basically , only two countries have adopted the directive .
However , we have to go beyond adoption to implementation , where important changes will be needed to the rules which apply today in certain Member States .
The Commission will perform its duty in full as guardian of the Treaty , as regards the adoption of the directive at the correct moment in time , its proper transposition – not in the wrong way and not without there being specific references to the European text – and of course its implementation .
The communication introduces a multiannual , rolling action plan .
Today we calculate that there are 3 million people with disabilities in Europe who could be integrated into the labour market .
Today , the European market is extremely difficult for these people .
As one way of supporting the successful incorporation of these issues in policies , the Commission is proposing the publication of a biennial report on developments in each Member State , focussing each time on planning and new choices of priorities .
Of course , this type of problem has a very large dimension in the candidate countries .
Most importantly , however , it brought the policy of the Disabled People 's Movement itself to the forefront , by putting into practice the slogan ' Nothing about us without us' , meaning they must be involved at all planning and decision-making levels .     Mr President , the European Union 's permanent preoccupation , at the level of communications alone of course , with people with disabilities , forms part of the effort to conceal the tragic reality , which is that there is 90 % unemployment in the European Union – and not 70 % as the leaders assert , with a dramatic increase in unemployed people with disabilities , in conjunction with a dramatic reduction in disabled children attending special schools or parallel departments in recent years .
The problem of people with disabilities is deeply class-based .
Generally speaking , we have a wealth of material before us which , however , needs to be mastered if we want to have an integrated policy on people with disabilities .
Secondly , we need to persuade finance ministers to recognise that expenditure on people with disabilities should be seen not as consumer spending , but as an investment in human potential and , consequently , as productive expenditure .
Only if the problem of people with disabilities becomes a common problem will it have an auspicious outcome .
Allow me too , however , to express my disappointment at some sort of criticism which was voiced .
And I have explained the reasons .
I shall certainly come back to why this could not be proposed at this specific moment in time .
When I submitted them to the Commission , there were public administrators who bet their positions that they would never get through the Commission .
The directives in question – and to be more specific the workplace directive – are now a huge wager which we , the European institutions , have against the national administrations .
It is not that the ministers or
