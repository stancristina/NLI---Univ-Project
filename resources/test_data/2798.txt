there was some differential in excise taxes permitted in those special and particular circumstances ?
Thank you for that response and for outlining the theory of what is meant to happen with this directive .
As the Commissioner has indicated , the reality is often quite different .
I want to ask in particular about the border post of Gorica between Slovenia and Italy .
Over the years the Italian authorities have ignored the requirement of the directive and have done almost nothing to alleviate the suffering of live animals arriving from Eastern Europe .
The latest complaint submitted by the Euro Group for Animal Welfare in April this year resulted in the Commission agreeing , at long last , to take out infringement proceedings against Italy .
I would like the Commissioners to say a little bit more about the specific issue of infringement proceedings against Italy .
What is the progress of this ?
Has it started and , if not , when will it ?
Question No 11 by (H-0774/00 ) : Subject : Health and safety warnings relating to the private use of visual display units Further to my exchange of letters on this issue with Commissioner Byrne , can the Commission give a firm commitment that it will further examine whether a Directive is required to provide health and safety advice to parents and teachers whose children/pupils use computer equipment either at home or at school ?
Can the Commission give an indication as to when it will announce the results of its examination of this area ?
Finally , can the Commission comment on the progress made by Member States who , pursuant to Council Resolution of 17 December 1998 , were encouraged to consider developing voluntary agreements between manufacturers and consumer associations on the production of informative and consumer-friendly operating instructions ?
Mr President , I am grateful to the Commissioner for that information and for some signs of progress in the study of this issue .
Would he agree with me that it is a false distinction to draw here , however , between safety in the workplace and safety in the schoolroom or safety for a child working at home ?
Is it not the case that there should be at least as much consideration given to the safety of people in the latter environment , particularly since , in the time since the 1999 directive came in we know a great deal more about the possible harmful effects of ionising and non-ionising radiation on young people ?
Question No 14 by (H-0745/00 ) : Subject : Burma Aung San Suu Kyi , the opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner , has ended up under what amounts to house arrest , and all contact with outsiders has been forbidden by the country ' s military rulers .
The EU has deplored her treatment and might cancel a planned delegation visit to Rangoon later this year .
Does the Commission take the view that constructive engagement with the Burmese Junta has any value ?
In view of what Aung San Suu Kyi continues to endure , will the Commission ' s view be that the EU should not attend the EU-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on 12-13 December 2000 ?
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for that comprehensive answer .
Can I assume from your answer that the Commission still believes that constructive engagement has any value ?
After the catalogue of terrible events that you have just given us , it seems to me that constructive engagement has seen its day .
Do you not think that we should now be exploring other ways of tackling the problem of our relations in Burma ?
Should we not be looking at investment issues as the French Government are doing ?
Should we not be challenging the whole tourism issue as the British Government has been doing ?
If the European Union is not prepared to call for economic sanctions then why not , for instance , suggest that the SPDC should be challenged in the UN and its legitimacy as the Government of Burma challenged in the UN General Assembly ?
I wonder if you consider that a viable option for the Commission and the Council at this time ?
I was very glad that the Commissioner mentioned the ethnic minority groups and the need to open a dialogue with them .
In practical terms can he tell us what , if anything , the European Union can do about a policy which has been virtually one of genocide over many years towards the Karen , Shan , and other minority groups ?
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Titley on his report , as others have done earlier today .
As many of us said at the time in 1998 , we saw the code of conduct as a very important first step towards having common and responsible arms export policies .
But we saw it as a beginning and not by any means the end of the process .
It is important to recognise that , at a time when our European concerns can seem somewhat abstract and rhetorical , controlling weapons is a real way in which Member States ' governments , the Commission and Parliament can demonstrate the positive benefits of being able to work together here for a common approach to arms control .
Now we have to look at how we can further strengthen that code of conduct and in particular make it legally binding .
We see dealers buying Cold War weapons in Eastern Europe , flying them into African war zones and creating terrible suffering .
It is important to develop ways in which EU candidate countries can be brought into the information exchange and into consultation mechanisms .
Candidate countries should also be involved in discussions on the further development and strengthening of the code .
