the present rules and , if necessary , to set up a new legal framework .
The intention is that the new instrument should help us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , thus forwarding a very important objective of which both the committee and this House as a whole have been recurrent defenders , and , in view of the UN 's recently-published estimate of their effectiveness to date , particularly in the fight against poverty , I see the EU as sending out a very important message in that respect .
The new instrument will have achieved something if it manages to create the conditions with respect to education and health without which productive economic performance that benefits the local community is not even possible . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Kla√ü , Commissioner , that the groundwater directive has not been watered down amounts to a tremendous success , and the proposals now made are a real step in the right direction , although we would , of course , have expected even more .
By voting for you , we are expressing our confidence that you will come to see that .
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and of course the Finnish Council Presidency for the efforts which have enabled us to bring this difficult matter to a conclusion so soon .
Without access to repair and servicing information , however , this cannot be guaranteed .
We were generous with the exceptions for M1 vehicles , but I think that this is justified , since the effects on the environment are comparatively small .
I do not see why we should make a long term exception - lasting well into the next decade - precisely for such dirty , environmentally hazardous vehicles .
This relates to the age of the cars on Europe 's roads and what impact these regulations will actually have .
Business and political interests must not be confused , nor must our misgivings about violations of human rights and of the freedom of the press be suppressed in the hope of making talks about energy more fruitful .
Above all else , it is a message to the Turkish Government to the effect that we want to carry on negotiating with it , and I appeal to it not to let up in its efforts at reform , not to give in to the temptation to play a domestic political card in the shape of a brief anti-European turn in the hope of a few more votes , only then to say that that was not how it was meant .
Here in Europe , we agree on CO2 reduction , and then we conclude a stability pact ; those who fail to stick to their CO2 limits get criminal proceedings brought against them by the Commission .
We did set up Frontex , though .
In six years ' time , countries will introduce the new driving licence model for new applications .
The foundation has been laid ; we are waiting for a clear sign from the Member States here .
Many of us will perhaps not have to do that , if we are wise .

The names Erika and Prestige bring back terrible memories for them .
It is of course not only to do with the conduct of business but also with the fact that people are already in these posts and the new Bulgarian and Romanian Members are now coming , who are of course also entitled to such positions .
Parliament , which screams for transparency and presses the Council and the Commission to take citizens and their cares seriously , is discussing its own affairs late at night , and then after long squabbles and only when forced to do so by the small parties .
I do not believe we need only to put forward new ideas and concepts ; as Mr Langen has already said , we need to try gradually to change reality .
Likewise church groups , the different religions , the National Council of Chiefs , that is , representatives of the traditional structures , are quite clearly on the side of the democratically-elected Prime Minister .
We are appealing to the world 's largest democracy , namely India , to take its democratic responsibility seriously and , together with ASEAN and the European Union , to support democracy and rule of law in Burma and not become chums with one of the world 's most evil regimes . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has thanked the President-in-Office of the Council , which is a good thing , and I should like to join them in doing so .
