connection with this subject , since my very first report , on an amendment to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community , dealt with the bankruptcy of the Ferrovie San'Anna , which was very unusual at the time , a steel company going bankrupt .
The potato starch sector shows the successful operation of the CAP in a nutshell .
The Commission wanted to pay compensation of only 44 % of the price reduction , but the Council rightly corrected this by increasing the income premiums to 75 % of the price reduction .
Madam President , I had the opportunity earlier in the week to tell the House how important it was to deal with this proposal this week .
I think the Commission needs to pursue an active policy here and should say that it is compulsory to use certain agricultural products in the interests of the environment .
There is one person I would like to mention , whom I refer to in our group as the Friday godfather , the one who always has something to say , and that is Mr von Habsburg .
But we knew what we meant .
The nomination of Prodi as President of the European Commission and the recent events in Kosovo have also left their mark on the German Presidency .
The private chats between Germany , France and Great Britain also give cause for concern .
Mr President , over the next six months , the Finnish Presidency faces the weighty task of initiating substantial input to the economic and social reconstruction of Kosovo .
We believe that it is precisely this kind of homegrown contribution that is indispensable to the realisation of an effective Stability Pact in the Balkans .
Mr President , I should very much like to congratulate the President of the Finnish Council Presidency on the statement she has just made , particularly with regard to the comments she made on Kosovo and the Balkans .
Equally , if we are to see justice done then we will have to ensure that full co-operation is given to the International Tribunal in The Hague in order to pursue the criminals that have wrought havoc in Kosovo , and not just in Kosovo but now at last in Bosnia too .
Why have Karadzic and Mladic still not been arrested ?
For far too long now , we as the European Union have taken measures , for example against Serbia , measures which were necessary but which were taken at no cost whatsoever to ourselves .
Our own initiatives must not be fragmented .
It could not be any other way .
I support all those who maintain , on the one hand , that Milosevic should be sent to The Hague as soon as possible and who , on the other , ask for support for the democratic opposition in Serbia .
If we fail to do this then it will create new frustrations , and there is already frustration enough in the region .
If you see an opportunity to achieve something in this respect then I think you will have achieved something very worthwhile for Europe .
I should like to recommend that you concentrate above all on taxation pertaining to trade and industry , for there is a great deal that needs to be brought into line there .
Lastly , a subject I am particularly keen for you to give a great deal of attention to is Burma .
It is your first Presidency but it appears to me that you really are going to do it well .
They are victims and they suffer .
But it is clearly absurd that at the height of the crisis , the Commission and its technical services should be wasting time on discussions with the Belgian authorities and their technical services because there are no standards , because people do not know what the permitted level of dioxins is for different products .
We have seen a number of examples .
Our Belgian pigs are so susceptible to stress that they are given tranquillizers and betablockers just before they are transported to the slaughterhouse .
Quantity takes precedence over quality .
On a final note , this crisis is a disaster for the producers .
Mr President , as the people in my country already know , the dioxin crisis has , I am sorry to say , propelled tens of thousands of companies into extreme difficulties .
I believe we must now have the courage , and we must now ask the Council and the Commission to have the courage , firstly , to learn from past mistakes and to discontinue the kind of agricultural policy we have been pursuing to date , and to opt , at last , for high-quality agriculture in Europe , which is the sensible , sober and necessary choice .
I do not think there is any point in setting up a new bureau after every food crisis .
If they are not prepared to take action for food safety , then the European Commission is powerless .
In fact , they have been there since the Committee of Enquiry into mad cow disease finished its work .
It would indeed appear to me to be of benefit for action to be taken to prevent contamination of the food chain and to avoid public health disasters , without the bona fide farmers being the ones to suffer in the process .
I believe that a dioxin scandal or a BSE crisis , or whatever it may be , can occur anywhere in Europe .
I therefore feel it is high time that the European Commission , together with the European Council , which I understand has given its full support , should develop initiatives as rapidly as possible for bringing about a food policy at European level .
