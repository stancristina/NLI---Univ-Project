of fiscal policy , of the adoption of the single currency .
Since I still have doubts about real convergence of the economies of each of the States , I cannot subscribe to the premises and proposals contained in this report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the PHILOXENIA Programme , which involves a series of measures for tourism and which , basically , we supported , has unfortunately not been put into practice in the most appropriate and desirable manner .
Then we should not have the impression that proposals were being made which were of doubtful effectiveness based on dubious reasons ; what is essential and necessary is simply to make specific measures out of what is already envisaged and so essential for tourism in the European Union .
I hope that it proves possible , for the sake of the economy and the citizens of Europe , to include tourism in the Treaty .
That is mistaken , because for Portugal it is not a case of reintroduction - it is being introduced for the first time and we are only going to apply the quota now .
We must agree , for the sake of intellectual honesty , that there is in fact a delicate matter facing us and that the Commission is right in saying that the cereals sector is receiving too much compensation .
On the other hand , we know that as from 1992 the CAP has been approximately 5 % below the guideline and that money has been returned to the Member States .
Nevertheless , the next reform of the CAP will have to consider very carefully in its aid system the question of equity in incomes support .
The resolutions on agricultural prices proposed by the Commission for the 1997-1998 marketing year are still incomprehensible to farmers in general , above all to those in less-favoured regions .
All production aid should be stopped and transferred to holdings under specifically determined rules .
Its sole objective is to increase the unfair aspects of the CAP and to channel further financial resources into production which is already swallowing up 45 % of all aid which is losing more jobs and leading to more desertification in the Community .
Such facts demonstrate that the first responsibility of today 's leaders is to find a way out for this new European question facing new historical challenges which cannot be solved with the methods of yesteryear .
It is interesting to note that the greater the insistence on unanimity the greater the openness to flexibility either in fact or directly .
This could and should be the turning point needed to bring the past of the European Union closer to the will of the people and to the real needs of today .
We roundly condemn the introduction into the Treaty of amendments in the institutional field which are harmful to the interests of the smaller countries under the pretext of giving specific form to that policy ; similarly we demand that due account be taken of the economic indicators which that might produce in those very countries .
This disparity arises because the Treaty on European Union was not implemented .
We are very concerned about the timid progress made in this matter and , I repeat , about the timid progress proposed in this matter proposed for the Intergovernmental Conference .
I should , however , like to make the following point : I think that this report did not deal at the length required in particular with two aspects which I regard as crucial and which one day we shall have to solve .
That should be complementary to , as already mentioned here and as is obvious , the role of the European Parliament .
Finally I shall refer to the question of the indigenous people and the line taken by Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan .
The answer would be yes provided we had a good agreement .
That is a long time - a very long time to die in agony - and it is a concession which increases the Commission 's figure by a factor of 10 .
But the most glaring example of the Commission 's bad faith is in the subtle amendment it made to Article 4 ( 2 ) in Annex I , where in the version agreed in January for the present agreement there is a marked difference .
The talk in the corridors is of ECU 30 million .
I should like now to mention the institutional pact .
The Council never re-submitted it .
I should like now to mention the indigenous people .
Mr President , I wish to address Sir Leon Brittan directly because it is the first time he has come to a debate on this subject in this House in at least the last two years .
When the House voted on this issue in February this year , the vote was 85 to 3 .
SOCRATES is a programme which , supported by the indisputable success of the ERASMUS university exchange visits , is enabling an increasing number of students and lecturers to exchange experience and to compare knowledge , thus creating a European Community of the spirit and of the heart .
Those are the only ways to reverse the dangerous trend towards isolationism , individualism and consumerism , which are destroying us and discrediting us .
We shall vote for the Funk report since it rejects the bases of the Commission proposal on a system of production aids for certain arable crops .
As regards the Common Organization of the Market , the Commission would point out that , within the scope of the reform of the COM for fruit and vegetables adopted by the Council on 21 November of last year , provision was made for the setting up of operational funds intended for producer organizations which would make it possible to have a panoply of measures in order to improve conditions for the production and marketing of these products
