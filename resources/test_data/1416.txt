we must not shrink away from positive action if we are to harbour hopes of correcting the situation relatively quickly .
I have therefore recommended that special funding be set aside to promote female researchers and to focus on the importance of networks and role models as simple initiatives , which have produced positive results in the Member States .
My work on this report therefore shows that there are many barriers .
Cultural barriers are of course more difficult to express in a formula , but in reality - like the more concrete barriers - it is a matter of focusing on some of the distortions .
Mr President , thank you for the opportunity to speak .
I am pleased to hear that you share my concerns and visions for the future of European research .
With regard to the aforementioned quotas , I believe that I have been a little misunderstood .
I am not talking about quotas for researchers , but it is very clear that one of the most important barriers to employing and utilising the female talent base lies in the composition of recruitment committees .
We cannot continue to ignore this problem and hope that tomorrow will be brighter and that it will happen all by itself .
The Commission has of course been the progressive player in this matter , as a unit for women and research was created several years ago in the Directorate-General for Research .
It is their commitment that will be essential in relation to securing change within the university and research institutions .
I was very pleased with the cooperation of researchers and the European Platform of Women Scientists in particular - special thanks must go to them .
I have been shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , and we have been through some tough negotiations with the Council , but I believe that we have arrived at a good compromise proposal .
After all , the Lisbon objectives are in reality just a way of achieving progress and growth , and one does not need to be a member of the EU to wish for that .
Education is one of the factors underpinning growth and development within the EU.
Investing in better education can help to ensure that we in the EU achieve the Lisbon objectives and together make Europe a better place in which to live .
Through education a better and more competitive workforce is created , which in turn enables stronger growth to be achieved .
Therefore , the European Training Foundation is an extremely important agency .
It is important that we help potential new Member States as much as we can .
I believe that the new structure that we have introduced for the Foundation in Torino is a major advantage for future challenges and I believe that the Foundation can help potential new Member States to join the EU.
We are gaining the opportunity to appoint three experts to the board .
Madam President , I would like to thank Commissioner Michel , and also Mr Van Hecke for a good report .
It is excellent that agreement has been reached regarding the content , and that EU aid will be both increased and improved .
Aid must be aid .
This money must be used for those who need it , and we must be able to see that it is being used for that purpose .
It is therefore important that Amendment 1 is adopted .
It is petty-minded and embarrassing that the EU aid decreased between 2006 and 2007 .
We will not achieve the goals unless we live up to our many promises .
There are many analyses from the World Bank , the IMF , the UN and others that document the fact that the common agricultural policy is undermining the opportunities open to developing countries to grow , and here I am not talking about export subsidies , which are grotesque enough but only account for a small fraction of the destruction being caused by this policy .
We cannot then wait for the United States to withdraw its agricultural support .
US agricultural support is worse than ours , and the EU should lead by example .
Mr President , I should also like to thank Mrs Laperrouze for her friendly , obliging cooperation .
Most of what had been achieved has been lost following lobbying by the agrochemical industry and the less efficient among the public regulatory authorities .
Our overarching aim is to progressively improve water quality in European rivers and lakes .
The weakness of the present report is that there is no real political will to scrutinise any more substances .
If the precautionary principle were to hold force , a number of other substances would have to be examined , but we are letting that possibility slip through our fingers .
We have ended up with a number of substances that are in all likelihood extremely hazardous , yet the Commission balks at finally banning them .
We must monitor whether the Commission gets going with the examination of these substances or whether it just continues to put off taking a position on the grounds that it does not have enough data .
If that is the case , it should go and get the data .
There are some improvements .
In addition , the Commission is not permitted to wait until as late as 2025 , as it had wished , to review the situation .
Yes , we shall be voting in favour of this report .
Mr President , I do not think that Mr Ferrari has been the worst in this connection .
We should of course have preferred to see a report that went even further in its endeavours to protect pedestrians and other vulnerable road users against cars , and the ideal scenario would have been to get many more drivers using public transport or bicycles .
