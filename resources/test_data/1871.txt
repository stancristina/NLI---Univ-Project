That is the case for the WHO and for the Codex Alimentarius ; that was the case in Community Europe until the entry of the United Kingdom , Ireland and Denmark , countries in which - since the war and not always , and I am sorry for them , because in those countries there are two generations who do not know what real chocolate is - a product has been marketed with a fairly high percentage of vegetable fats .
The countries whose economies depend on cocoa exports would certainly rely on us , the European consumers no longer able to know exactly what they are eating would rely on us , many small European chocolate producers finding it more tedious to withstand the competition or having to change their traditional production processes would probably rely on us .
Mr President , so far much of the work of the Union has been carried out in favour of a harmonized approach , a unanimous , similar undertaking in all Member States on the complex questions of copyright and related rights .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights believes that copyright and related rights should not be considered obstacles , a tiresome heritage of the past , possibly opposed to consumers ' rights and public rights .
That is why we believe it important for the directive currently being prepared by the Commission on systems of technical identification of works to be issued shortly , as well as a directive updating fundamental concepts , such as that of public communication , distribution , reproduction , providing for exceptions that have to be made , that fill the void that still exists on private copy , that establishes the procedures for handling rights praising the task of the collective management companies and also the so-called single counter method , which is necessary for rights to be acquired more simply and more quickly in view of an increased multimedia environment .
I just wish to express my amazement to the House so that at least it is recorded in the Minutes .
When examining the budget of the other institutions , we sought to adopt a uniform line which , once again , came up against a brick wall on several highly significant amendments , such as the one to increase the Sakharov Prize appropriation .
In order to complete the common market it was unavoidable that the use of additives in foods should be coordinated .
In the event , because of further developments in the area of food additives it became necessary to alter existing regulations and complete them with expanded annexes of limits .
This has to be added so that the fruit does not immediately discolour and start to rot .
Madam President , as has been said , the people of North Korea are suffering from an unprecedented famine that is producing a real massacre .
The Communists of North Korea have obviously established in one of their central committees that the agricultural harvest produced by the collective farms is sufficient to meet the needs of the North Korean population and , faithful to that position , they continue to deny the evidence that their population is dying of hunger and that thousands and thousands of children and old people are in dire poverty and are dying from malnutrition .
It is fairly difficult , if not impossible , for the new Congolese authorities to be able to run their country on the path of democracy and development without European Union aid .
I think that it would be quite reprehensible if the European Union failed to pay particular attention to this , not so much to the disaster in itself but to what this disaster means in terms of the loss of cultural wealth of humanity .
For this reason , seven political groups are proposing a resolution asking for emergency aid which I believe is already being provided .
Yesterday in Brussels , at a meeting held with the Italian delegation , Commissioner Fischler and his colleagues , while indicating a certain availability of funds already allocated in Italy - as mentioned earlier by Mr Ripa di Meana - and to deal with technical issues , did not include the requirement to recover the funds not used by Italy in the years 19891993 or to invest additional resources for the much higher sum requested .
Mr President , much has been said by my colleagues on the disaster that began in Italy in Umbria and in the Marches , in central Italy , on 26 September .
The Italian Ministry for the Budget is working along these lines .
Those unfortunate Italians affected by the earthquake , benefit - if I can say that with a touch of irony - from the good fortune of belonging to a state which has only managed to spend one-tenth of the structural funds allocated to it .
Floods in Spain
Our group is voting for the resolution presented here with firm conviction because it confirms , albeit it with adaptations , the inspiration that has always characterized European legislation with regard to intellectual property , based on the protection of the author 's moral rights , which there is no reason to abandon in the light of the new situation created by the information society .
Madam President , I wish to speak simply to express the full consent of the socialist group to the report presented by Mr Whitehead just now .
It emphasizes fundamental points : we need speed in decision-making because we cannot wait any longer .
I will just mention the Committee on Transport and Tourism , where we have fully debated the problem of the conditions of travel and health of animals in transit , and it is good that we have this synergy of opinions and intentions , and efforts too
