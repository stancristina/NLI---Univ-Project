I should like to make a point of thanking the European Parliament for its constructive cooperation .
Mr President , the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda is obviously extremely valuable because it allows us to draw conclusions as to the progress made .
Around two-thirds of the new jobs which it is estimated will be created between 2002 and 2010 will be filled by women , which is why I was especially pleased , Commissioner , with your communication a short while ago about the new initiatives which you have taken on behalf of the Commission to coordinate economic policy and employment policy .
Mr President , I share the regret expressed by Mrs Smet in her report about the delay in submitting the contents of the last scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda .
The report looks more like a routine job than a fundamental approach .
So we need to make more of an effort with the form and content of the mid-term review , which the European Parliament expects to receive before the next spring Council because , as you know , Commissioner , it wishes to play a part in shaping social Europe , and rightly so .
Obviously the report reflects efforts which have either been completed or are under way and legislative activities which have either been completed or are at the consultation stage .
The fact that it has opted for a regulation , which ensures immediate application , and the fact that the proposal was not discussed with the interested parties , especially SMEs , shows just how concerned the EU is to directly promote the interests of large companies .
State aid for employment is an important way of stimulating the job market and small and medium-sized enterprises .
This state aid represents net revenue to employers ; it results in workers being replaced by the subsidised unemployed and permanent violations of collective agreements .
The workers want full , stable employment , protected social rights , a higher standard of living , real social development and prosperity , unemployment benefits of 80 % of the basic wage and a different sort of policy , which centres around man and his needs .
It happened in Iraq in 1991 , in Cyprus in 1974 , in Yugoslavia in 1993-99 and elsewhere .
Following the horrendous attack on 11 September , the pretext for the savage attack on Afghanistan , which resulted in unimaginable destruction , countless thousands of victims and mass slaughter , was the fight against terrorism , based on the arbitrary , unproven claim that the US agent bin Laden , al-Qa'ida and the USA-supported Taliban , were to blame .
Mr Blair , who is even more merciless , tells us that the attack on Afghanistan was carried out as the moral basis for the forthcoming attack on Iraq .
Hence , the Bush regime is even more dangerous and nations need to unite against it ...
The subject of this debate is the European Union 's policy towards Asia .
However , I would point out that , so far , this dialogue has , for the most part , been held solely at the economic level and it needs to move on to political , educational and cultural issues .
All the members of the European Union belong to ASEM.
I hope , in fact I am certain that successful developments will result from Copenhagen and I believe that this European Union policy will be more widely accepted in an area wracked by conflict and crisis , by which I mean the whole of Asia .
I should merely like to ask the President-in-Office a straight question : what message is the presidency of the Council of the European Union sending Turkey .
I should like to ask if the Council intends to put pressure on the Turkish government to take the steps needed in order to help resolve the Cyprus problem .
However , it is not clear exactly what the Council is calling for or I , at least , fail to understand what he means by 'dealing with the problem ' .
I would remind the President-in-Office that Greece sends generous financial aid to Albania and that over 600 000 Albanian immigrants work legally and without obstruction in Greece , earning wages that workers in Albania can only dream of .
Mr President , first a comment on the manner in which the President-in-Office replied .
How dare he reply like that .
What does he take us for ?
It is what happened during the Nice summit , when thousands of Italian protesters found the French borders closed , during the Genoa summit , when hundreds of Greek demonstrators , who were badly mistreated , were prevented from disembarking in Ancona .
We have huge inequalities between the Member States in the field of education , as the report acknowledges , and consequently we also have huge vacuums and huge problems in lifelong training .
But what are we , the European Union , doing about it ?
At least one in two Member States has no specific strategy and a strategy is vital if we are to have economic development , if we are to improve industry and mobility and if we are to improve unemployment programmes .
Madam President , Commissioner , there can be no doubt that , with the new order created by globalisation and the leaps and bounds being made in science and technology , the constant renewal of knowledge through lifelong learning is vital if we are to make the best possible use of human resources .
We therefore need to take serious account of the gender dimension when we take policy decisions and apply measures which will abolish direct and indirect discrimination against women , given that such discrimination always comes at the expense of the viable development and competitiveness of the
