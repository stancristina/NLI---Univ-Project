of the European Union .
Each one of the institutions has its own remit .
Let me first of all say that at the first exchange of views at the General Affairs Council , the two country delegations Mr Lindqvist has just mentioned informed us in their speeches of the concerns they shared with the honourable gentleman .
I think we are agreed on this .
The formation of the Council was the following on 67 occasions : culture , education , industry , youth , civil defence , research and transport as well as work and social affairs .
Mr Haarder somewhat overestimates my ministerial capacities for tax recovery .
Nevertheless , I will endeavour to satisfy him as regards the Council 's intentions because it is a question which I believe is of interest not only to the European Parliament and the Commission but also to our taxpayers .
I have mentioned this example , Mrs Ferrer , so that you can understand the breadth of the problem we are facing and the extremely global dimension of this social question .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi on her excellent report .
The key aim is to ensure that crimes do not go unpunished while at the same time protecting citizens from arbitrary application of the law .
I would like to pay tribute to the work of our colleague and I subscribe to the amendments that he proposes to add to the initial text of the Commission .
Moreover , it cannot be ruled out that the WTO will one day tackle the system provided under article 227 .
We all know that the shaping of Europe rests on the principles of Community preference ( Treaty of Rome ) and on the preservation of the economic interests of the ACP countries with whom the EU Member States have committed under an agreement of original , specific and close co-operation ( Lom√© Agreements ) .
There is really no time to lose .
The current situation is inconsistent and the Europe of Nations group is also urging the governments of Member States assembled within the Council to take steps to impose a total ban on imports .
Why then was no attempt made to obtain the withdrawal of the American claim against hormoneinjected meat and bananas in return for the withdrawal of the claim of the European Union against the HelmsBurton Act ?
The negotiations , once initiated , should not drag on eternally pending a possible agreement , which would be tantamount to yielding to Turkish blackmail .
Gulf States
We are also following that very closely .
These agreements were established before we decided that all agreements with third countries would include a clause on human rights .
The Commission therefore fully shares the appeal made by the European Parliament to guerrilla factions so that they quickly reply to the government 's proposals .
The Commission has regularly raised the question of human rights in these two countries as permanent themes in the bilateral dialogue with China .
Indeed , we must meet the crisis of confidence among consumers in the EU countries not only by promoting the sale of all quality beef products but also by giving consumers genuine information on the origin of meat , breeds of livestock , locations of production and methods of production .
I will emphasize three points : firstly , rigour in the method of production which must be more 'natural ' : we must combat the authorisation to use hormones and to link production to the land .
Conversely , Mrs Hardstaff in her report proposes to convert this promotional campaign in favour of quality products into a generic campaign in favour of indiscriminate and standardised products encompassing all products and Member States .
This shows how low we have stooped .
We are still practising a baling out policy !
As my colleague Edouard des Places mentioned during the debate , our group rejects most of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur .
Mr Hallam 's initial draft report proposed this option .
So why does it do this ?
I , too , would like to speak about Parliament 's session and the part-sessions for 1998 .
Secondly , you asked how we can move the package of measures forward so that the European Council of 21 November is a success .
There therefore exists a group of proposals which aim to reduce taxation on labour , to reinforce the general trend .
In the short term , we must think about finance for businesses .
Mr President , Mr Santer , I have listened to what you have to say with great interest , and I think you are right .
I myself took the initiative , on 31 January last year , to set before you a confidence pact for employment which , it has to be said , did not find the same success with the Member States as it did with you .
Firstly , concerning funds for the Phare programme , the availability of ECU 150 million which is forecast for the end of the financial year must lead us to question ourselves sincerely as to whether the tool is sufficiently adapted for the intended objective .
It just wishes its work was followed up in the same way by the Council and the Commission .
It is therefore desirable that Canada and the European Union join efforts in the search for new stability for the international community .
There is therefore a lot that could be said , some criticisms expressed too , in particular with regard to the position taken in favour of the World Trade Organisation , that is , a world without frontiers abandoned to the appetites of the multinationals .
Once we French have freed ourselves from Brussels ' authority , we will be able to tie once again the links broken with our Quebec brothers two centuries ago .
