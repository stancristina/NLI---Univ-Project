situation .
The consumers are worried , they are uninformed .
Retailers , too , are calling for clear guidelines to ensure that they will not need to be ashamed of their customers .
Has the Commission received any reply from the WTO ?
How many more days will the Commission still need to appoint this Pope and does it intend to create any uniform labelling practice for these genetically altered foodstuffs ?
Under these conditions , the Union will not gain the confidence of the citizens .
It is quite essential to obtain socio-economic supervision over the structurally inward-looking European Central Bank .
The European institutions are important when each nation of the Union feels that it is represented .
This should be the case in the Commission too .
Tightening cooperation between the WEU and the EU is appropriate when seeking to improve the efficiency of the common foreign and security policy .
Now the attempt is being made to adapt the alliance to Nordic geopolitics , which under the current circumstances would create uncertainty in the latter .
So it was not clear in the vote that I supported amendment proposal No. 47 , which stresses the importance of maintaining the balance between large and small countries , although this was my intention .
I would also like to stress that the resolution which has now been approved should , in my opinion , mean that Parliament can view the forthcoming enlargement negotiations positively .
Madame Chairman , when three new Member States joined the EU at the beginning of 1995 the tradition of military neutrality in the Union was strongly reinforced .
This should be remembered .
In this area , Finland , together with Sweden among others , has been very active in recent times .
Why should we pursue a policy which increases tension ?
It would , amongst other things , make peaceful border cooperation considerably more difficult .
This would mean that we would have to give up our military neutrality .
We would wish , however , for our decisions too to be respected in the same way .
Mr President , the Liberal Group is satisfied in general terms with Mr MacMillan-Scott 's report .
We are pleased that human rights issues have a central place in the report .
In this connection I should like to stress that we must also be consistent in these matters .
On behalf of the Liberal Group I have tabled two amendments to this report which concern environmental questions .
My first amendment aims to do this .
The form of words I am proposing places the EU and China on an equal footing with respect to each other and is more diplomatic than the original version .
Mr President , I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur .
The report approaches Baltic cooperation in a very broad sense .
The political , economic and social situation of the states in the region varies , for there are both EU Member States and future Member States there , and the region is also an EU border region .
Baltic cooperation considers not only the integration process , - common regional needs , - but also the northern dimension .
Mr VÃ¤yrynen 's amendments focus on the right issue , but approach the question from the opposite direction .
In the Baltic States region there are opportunities and threats , including environmental protection and nuclear safety .
It is important that the meeting of the Baltic Council this month will also make evaluations of the implementation of the programme .
The Union is only one protagonist in this cooperation .
The Commission should also decide soon whether it will act on Parliament 's demands to begin negotiations simultaneously with the applicant countries , for the clock is ticking inexorably on towards July .
For example , trade between the EU countries and the 'transitional economies ' is expected to quadruple in the next few years in the Baltic region .
The Agenda 21 programme for sustainable development is currently under preparation in the Baltic region , as the report mentions .
The Commission is also involved in the creation of programmes , but with a very small input .
The traditional concept of military security has lost its meaning in the Baltic region as elsewhere .
Mr President , Parliament should promote the conclusion of a border agreement between Russia and Estonia , because it is a precondition for the development of cooperation among the states of the Baltic region .
I congratulate him on it .
As Mr Tindemans said in his report , the Baltic and Barents Sea cooperation areas partly overlap .
In addition , all the Member States of the Barents Sea Council are also members of the Council of Baltic States and the Commission is involved in both on the same terms .
My amendments seek to obtain a definition by the Union of the position of Barents Sea region cooperation in the Union 's policy on northern regions and its relationship to cooperation in the Baltic region .
Mr President , I am delighted to be able to speak on behalf of the Liberal Group in support of Mrs Cresson 's initiative and Mrs Fontaine 's well - prepared and lucid report .
The aim is to help particularly disadvantaged young people to obtain international experience and language skills as well as to learn civic responsibility through work .
The relationship of this new voluntary service programme to the important Youth for Europe programme , and its influence on that programme , is as yet unclear .
The Commission should give an overall account of the Union 's youth policy and should consider the need to create a comprehensive youth framework programme .
At the same time it is possible to simplify administration , reduce bureaucracy and ensure that the resources earmarked are really used to benefit the participation of young people .
