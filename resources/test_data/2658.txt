does not distinguish between fraud and administrative and financial irregularities ; that is , administrative mistakes and people who set out to cheat the EU of money .
To give you an example , a farmer may fill out a form incorrectly .
That is not to say that he means to defraud .
It may be that he measured his land incorrectly .
And then there are the big fraudsters : the people who , for example , import cigarettes illegally , avoiding tax .
There is a huge difference between these two things .
We need to have them distinguished much more clearly .
Let us not forget that 80 % of the fraud takes place within Member States .
Yesterday the Commission made a commitment to us that they want to cut irregularities by 2 % .
We want to know whether the Member States will follow that lead .
It is clear that a lot of the problems lie there , in particular with the Structural Funds .
To take up Mr Dell'Alba 's point , the Socialists will be voting against a number of paragraphs in this report , not necessarily because we do not agree with them , but because it is not the right context in which to discuss these points which relate to the White Paper .
Finally , I want to read out a list of shame - Member States which have not yet ratified the Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the EU : Belgium , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Italy , Spain , Portugal , Greece , Ireland and France .
It is about time they signed up .
They have had five years to do it .
Let us see them ratify it .
- I welcome my Socialist colleague , Willi Rothley 's recommendation on protecting motorists abroad .
We are sadly all too familiar with the high figures of road accidents across Europe .
As many as 500 000 drivers in the European Union are victims of road accidents abroad every year .
This is 500 000 too many .
We must put safety first and ensure that as much as possible is done to protect our citizens whilst travelling abroad .
The proposal extends current EU directives on the handling of motor insurance claims to cover cases where a person visiting another Member State is the victim of an accident caused by a resident of that country .
Every insurance company will , therefore , need to appoint a representative in each Member State .
The European Parliament has gone even further , calling for cover for accidents which take place in non-EU countries , provided that the vehicles involved are registered in the EU.
Under the compromise , the directive will apply to such accidents in a certain number of countries outside the European Union .
Thousands of British holidaymakers travel by car or hire cars every year in France , Spain , Portugal and many other countries in Europe .
Surely we owe all of our citizens the right to ensure that things are made as easy as possible for those involved in car accidents abroad and for their families .
This is not about high-and-mighty insurance companies hindering claims , it is about the European Parliament driving forward a lifeline for our citizens .
For my own constituents and for all of Europe 's citizens , I give the green light to this proposal .
Martínez Martínez report ( A5-0114/2000 )
Madam President , the situation in South Africa is difficult - and it is by no means an easy country to run .
Yet South Africa presents itself as a beacon of hope in an otherwise turbulent continent .
We should therefore be doing everything possible to assist the economic , social and democratic development of that country .
That is why I regret that the Council proposes only EUR 787.5 million for South Africa , which is effectively a 10 % cut on the amounts we agreed five years ago .
Parliament , in its Amendment No 2 , proposes that we give EUR 885.5 million to South Africa , EUR 98 million more than the Council .
EUR 98 million is not an insignificant sum of money in South African terms .
In terms of the European budget it is not something we would struggle to find .
I would urge that we be generous to South Africa , that the Council finds this EUR 98 million , does not go to conciliation but accepts Parliament 's amendments and gets on with implementing this new regulation with South Africa .
Mr President , I also wish to endorse and praise the work of Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Böge on this issue and the initial proposals from the Commission .
Safety must be a priority and we all understand that if we are to have equal precautions throughout the Member States , we need a variety of measures in place which have not so far been instituted .
Commissioner Byrne is to be congratulated on moving that closer .
These proposals take us a good deal further down the line in the field of diagnostic testing , in a more sceptical attitude to animals which ought to have been under suspicion but in some Member States were not , and in terms of the general prospect of fallen stock being tested for the possibility of BSE.
I want to say something , however , coming from the Member State which first suffered the full rigours of BSE and which has also , as a result of that , been in the vanguard of cleaning up this problem .
We have now had for a considerable period of time in the United Kingdom an over-30-month cull of all animals which have been taken out of the food chain .
