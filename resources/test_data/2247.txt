In the future , our institutions are going to be called upon increasingly to respond quickly and effectively to the new challenges posed by the increase in the average life expectancy , and to provide the elderly throughout the world with an increasingly high standard of living .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur and I support the work that has been carried out on a subject of such major importance as the ageing population of our countries , of our continent .
.
( IT ) I would like to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 16 , tabled by Mr Pronk and Mrs Lulling , which reads : 'considers that the Member States must shoulder their responsibility to guarantee pensions which will enable every pensioner to lead a dignified and independent life and to participate in social and cultural life ' .
The names of some of the citizens have already been included in the list annexed to the regulation , even though no evidence has been produced of their connection to terrorist movements or involvement in terrorist activities .
We voted against the motion because it is now clear that , after 11 September , it has become standard practice to exploit the urgent procedure , using it as an emergency measure in situations that do not justify this .
( Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
It is true that it was a rebellion but I would point out - apart from the fact that the comparison is inappropriate - that resistance to Nazi Fascism never involved attacks on civilians : killing civilians is not a form of martyrdom - as has been said - it is terrorism .
These are all positions of the Sharon Government which have placed Israel in difficulties , and they certainly do nothing to further the advent of peace or - consequently - a secure future for Israel .
They are women from The Jerusalem Link , Israeli and Palestinian women .
We cannot turn a blind eye to the policies and practices conceived with the aim of humiliating and oppressing the Palestinians and forcing them to submit to the strategic programme of expropriation , settlements and colonisation that Israel has been pursuing throughout 34 years of occupation .
Now we must turn words into tangible actions .
The Lebanon and Algeria will not abide by these commitments , although for different reasons , of course .
I would point out that the Barcelona Summit was also hailed as a success and now we are labelling it a failure .
Will we be content with his ' No ' or will we call for an end to the constant suicide bomb attacks ?
Europe should be making increasing efforts to bring peace to the Middle East , but so far it has failed in its task .
The Middle East crisis is in danger of sparking off localised crises throughout the Mediterranean area and of breeding further terrorism , not least by providing conditions conducive to the recruitment of terrorists .
Italy has declared its willingness to host a peace conference .
That is why we must all genuinely strive to build a new Europe with a single foreign and security policy , an influential Europe which is the Europe of inclusiveness and subsidiarity .
The creation of the Bank , relations of closer cooperation and association relations are all tangible projects which show the European Union to be the ideal partner for the other shore of the Mediterranean .
It is a symbolic fact of extreme importance : the attention of the whole world is focused on what is happening in the place where Jesus Christ , the bearer of peace to all men , was born .
Once again , it is a formula as old as the hills .
Mention must be made of the United Nations , which has certainly played a role which has been exhausting , not least , and important but inadequate and , in any case , ineffective ; an intervention force was needed and it has been called for on many occasions .
Some months on , with regard to the non-violent action of Mr Dupuis , we can warn the human , civil and political rights activists who are placing their hope in the European Union not to be under any illusion .
Mr President , today 's debate and report on human rights would appear to be timely .
A few words on the subject of underage working , Mr President : we believe that all forms of underage working , of child labour , are a violation of the right to childhood , which is a stage of life during which people are not supposed to use machine guns , for example .
This is achieved through two innovations : firstly , an ambassador for human rights , the expression of Parliament , and secondly , a European agency for the promotion of human rights .
However , what interests me most at the moment is the first feature of this budget .
With the Community framework strategy on equal opportunities , the mainstreaming of the gender dimension and the Community equal opportunities policy as a whole , we are heading in the right direction .
It is important to note , however - and we too see evidence of this every day - that there is a huge information gap between citizens regarding the existence of this strategy , its objectives and the procedures for implementing it .
I agree too with the first statement made this morning , when a Member mentioned the refugees who died off the coast of Spain .
Immigration levels were higher in the past than they are now , but the issue was not then on the agenda , or not a priority .
