In all events , the time of responsibility has come .
Nor should anyone declare in the future that they are surprised if it emerges that secret prisons , flexible interpretations of the Geneva Convention , the tapping of thousands of telephones , distrust of every European traveller and the approach to the millions of immigrants living among us with repression rather than integration measures are not only giving terrorists recruiting arguments , but are also , primarily , measures that undermine the sense of security and democracy at the very heart of Europe .
However , Parliament 's balanced and strong stand does not appear to bother certain ministers in the ΕU.
In Europe , however , it would appear that some people wish to draw a line and say that democracy does not count here .     – Mr President , we have all realised that there is now an urgent need for us to take a common approach towards terrorism , organised crime and illegal immigration .
Particular emphasis needs to be placed on better management of sea borders in Europe by creating a Mediterranean coastguard in order to prevent human tragedies and control immigration flows .
The sights of the gigantic data-recording mechanism being promoted by the ΕU are now set on every EU citizen , in that the personal data of every person can be collected and transmitted without their even being suspected of an offence , purely and simply for reasons of public order and security .
It is yet another step which tightens the noose around personal freedoms , targets action by the mass grassroots movement and creates the preconditions for the movement 's fighting activities to be classified as criminal .
The Greek Communist Party voted against the report and calls on the workers to step up their action through the workers ' and grassroots movement to defend democratic rights and grassroots freedoms .     – Services of general economic interest , with the distinction between their economic and non-economic aspects , are in the sights of big business , with a view to commercialising the satisfaction of basic grassroots needs and increasing their profits .
According to the ΕU , services profitable to capital must be sold off .
It supports the workers fighting for better and cheaper public services for the benefit of the standard of living of the people and not of the profits of the monopolies .     – I voted in favour of the Eurlings report on Turkey 's progress towards accession to the European Union because I am in favour of Turkey 's European prospects .
The Turkish leadership needs to implement the undertakings it has made under a specific roadmap .
Five resolutions later , however , in Resolution 1706 , we unfortunately find – as regards its application –international indifference and international hypocrisy .
On 20 October we have the summit .
So take initiatives towards the Arab League , the Islamic conference , China , Russia and even the United States .
At the same time , however , it should be stressed that India is the biggest beneficiary under the Generalised System of Preferences , with preferential access to the Union 's market .
Under no circumstances , however , should such a bilateral agreement be interpreted in terms of a negation of our attachment to multilateralism .
In addition , as the Commissioner mentioned , the prospects for strengthening intraregional relations between the Union and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation need to be investigated and broadened .
India is a strong emerging economy , a new geostrategic pole in Asia as a whole .
India , as we have said , is a very important factor .
It is vital to our future relations with India .
As you know , the fishing industry makes an important contribution to the prosperity and to the economic and social fabric of coastal and island areas and to the maintenance of their cohesion .
It also makes a contribution to the supply of fisheries products with a high organic value , to the employment of a large number of workers in related industries and to the maintenance of local cultural traditions .
To close , I agree with the rapporteur that the eco-labelling could significantly promote product differentiation and provide a fundamental incentive for a sustainable fishing trade .     – Madam President , congratulations to the rapporteur on his report .
Support measures need to be taken .
We need tax relief , because otherwise fishing undertakings will not be able to compete with undertakings from third countries , as they have triple the operating costs .
The sea conceals many dangers .
Finally , the fishing industry must be saved , because fishermen are an important part of tradition , civilisation and European culture .
Organic products are starting to guarantee a better diet , which is why they have been growing over recent years and quite right too .
Undertakings in third countries producing organic products for export to the European Union should be inspected once a year .
On the contrary , one could say that they are the first in the world .
Universities , research centres , industry , companies and banks need to come together and cooperate closely and with vision .
We cannot afford to again experience the European paradox which we have seen in the past .
This procedure is considered fair .
However , we disagree on the point which states that certification may be done by accredited agencies in return for reasonable certification fees .
Over recent years there have been numerous problems , in coastal fisheries in particular , partly caused by the COM , vessel scrapping programmes , the reduction in first-sale prices to fishermen , with no concomitant reduction for consumers , and increased costs due to increased fuel prices .
As a result , the industry is in
