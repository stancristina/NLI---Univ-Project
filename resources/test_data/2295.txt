Indeed , the trafficking in human beings is a prime example of cross-border crime , which is what makes prosecution so difficult .
Realistic in the sense that practice and theory are two different things .
For example , when we repatriate people , for example when we send illegal Poles from Germany back to Poland , you need to realise that , some of them have train tickets , obtained from their illegal employer , to return to Germany , within two hours of their arrival , because that is where they work , where they have their jobs and where they are able to earn money .
If they return , if they are repatriated to their countries of origin , the scars will still be visible .
I would like to finish off with a comment on the police forces .
We need to try to use the budget efficiently .
Thirdly , particularly in respect of agricultural policy , resources must be used more effectively and more pressure should be exerted on the Member States or the Commission in order to speed up the submission of plans which can then be implemented adequately .
This morning , we talked about the 1998 discharge .
We very much hope that with this line of attack , namely a modernised budget , we will be able to turn the negative image , about which Commissioner Patten had every right to complain so bitterly , into a positive image of a Europe which is open to fighting poverty at world level .
As it stands now , the civil society , i .e . activities by non-governmental organisations in terms of human rights projects , is proportionately having to foot the lion ' s share of the bill , and this seems to me a recipe for disaster if we want to achieve stability in the long run .
For the reasons set out above , it would be preferable to adopt a pragmatic rather than a theoretical approach .
Mr Swoboda referred to this a moment ago : a vigorous railway sector within an internal market , which can be effective for the entire Union .
After all , no one can be on both sides of the fence at the same time .
If we pursue this line of attack , railway undertakings will need to put their customers and passengers first , rather than act out of self-interest .
First of all , the speed at which the EU-wide railway sector is making headway is far too slow , both in terms of transport of people and goods .
We should avoid building complex structures around tasks emanating from regulations within the sector .
What he wants to achieve requires a complete change of tack and what he proposes will lead to further regression .
We have now gained some experience in liberalisation thanks to the English and Dutch models .
This reality renders the proposals made by Jarzembowski unviable .
In percentage terms , the train has lost a considerable share in the transport market and it is difficult to detect any movement within European rail .
Safety takes absolute priority and cannot be monitored by the transport companies themselves .
Mr President , may I start by thanking the members of your House for the interest they have shown in the proposal and for the work carried out by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and Mr Wieland , in particular ?
Moreover , it is said that these amendments will considerably delay the final adoption of the proposal , which would not just be terribly unfortunate , it would also be out of all proportion to the many benefits which we stand to gain from this draft directive .
With this in mind , it is necessary to organise the practical dimension of the changeover well as a matter of priority .
The changeover will require an effort .
During a previous debate on the information strategy to be pursued , I was already bound to make some critical observations with regard to the highly peculiar wishes of some of my fellow delegates .
Unfortunately , I cannot escape this here , either .
I can think of different ways to achieve this .
Taking care of public transport and the environment should be of concern to all of us , including therefore our democratically elected government .
Indeed , they cause frustration amongst users and unnecessarily drive freight and passengers onto other types of transport .
These are cheaper for the consumer , but cost society as a whole more dearly because these alternatives cannot afford to care as much about workers and the environment .
A government which keeps information from its citizens is unreliable but a government which does not even take its own parliamentarians seriously is not ready for democracy yet .
Furthermore , it is not up to one institution to decide on what is confidential and what is not .
But organised crime embraces a great deal more .
The present currencies are not yet being converted into the euro .
For this reason , and for other reasons , but especially for this reason , it is important that consumers should not be cheated when they convert their money into euros .
When , in 1998 , reports emerged about the possible harmful effects on children ' s health , the European Commission proposed - or tried to propose at any rate - a ban on the application of certain phthalates .
I do not know how harmful these phthalates are , but if I do not know , then I need to at least ban a number of these phthalates in line with the precautionary principle , because , in my view , this is also what the internal market wants .
Neither do we know for which application they are
