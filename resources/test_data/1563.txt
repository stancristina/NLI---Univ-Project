I do not so much to the rapporteur 's proposals , which I think deserve universal acceptance , although I do not agree with the way in which the question of conditionality is approached at times here , but more especially because of the present political importance of four of the amendments proposed by our German colleague in the PPE.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Madam Commissioner , we ought not to forget that the purpose of the Cohesion Fund is to contribute to the fight against social and territorial disparities .
It has reached some of them , but not all of them .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Madam Commissioner , we have before us three interesting reports which give us a very illuminating insight into the islands and the position regarding Structural Funds .
For that reason , the proposals contained in Agenda 2000 must not penalize Portugal and take away a slice of the funds it now receives , because that would be unfair and morally wrong .
( More than 12 Members stood up )
Will it go on until society cannot put up with it any longer ?
This is not the way to rectify things that urgently need putting right , even from a point of view we do not share .
The principle approved , namely that the Cohesion Fund is only for countries which are not members of EMU, is a new one that bears no relation to the commitments we have accepted and has been rejected by the Commission several times .
It is true that some situations apply to all islands .
It is a pity that his loyalty to his island has led him to support policies of indiscriminate privilege , which do not conform to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
In essence I think it is an agreement which contains some innovations , because we are basically trying to put into practice an old principle we always follow in this House , according to which money and financial compensation paid by the European Union should benefit the fishing industry in the countries with which we enter into agreements , and I therefore think our argument that at least half the Community financial compensation should benefit local fisheries is correct .
Tobacco , we call it .
We are all concerned that young people should not drink , but wine has to be produced ...
Then again , there is the Committee on the Environment .
And I cannot prevent my neighbour from doing wrong .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the object of this report is to provide the European Parliament with a set of general principles which can be used as a reference framework for the sectorial reports to be approved later on .
Now we all know that the less specialized , more peripheral , more extensive , less productive agricultural systems , and in general those in the less favoured mountain , arid or Arctic areas , start at a major disadvantage and will be the first victims of the globalization of agricultural markets if the CAP does not grant them the minimal response they need to survive .
For that reason direct financing should also apply to rural development in the regions mentioned in Objective 1 .
If this is not put right we shall in future be creating a kind of agricultural apartheid with some cultures entitled to direct aid and others excluded from it .
Apart from that , the rules of fair trading must cover such important matters as consumer sensitivity , environment-friendly practices and respect for human rights and basic freedoms .
The truth is that attacks on it in the world market , by American criticism , by Fortress Europe , by the Keynes group and by all the groups whose historical situations are very different from ours , including the United Kingdom itself , have naturally made Europe ashamed of the CAP it created and which it now considers to be an illegitimate brainchild .
But I would have liked the Commission at least to have thought a little .
Similarly , we have doubts about the period specified by this Protocol - only two years , and therefore less than in most EC agreements of this type - which will not provide sufficient operational stability for the Community fleet .
Although we consider the proposal for the extension of new plantations for special-quality vines to be a positive step , we would reject at the outset a strategy that continues to support the abandonment of viticultural land , because of the importance of viticulture to southern countries , especially Portugal .
Or , after that , it should be placed on the very important contribution which tobacco growing makes to the struggle against increasing rural desertification .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Arlindo Cunha 's report is much better than the Commission 's draft , although it goes no further than is absolutely necessary .
The second point is that the agricultural policy still militates against the environment and quality , inasmuch as it is still geared to the support of production rather than production methods and the defence of quality in the food chain .
There is no absolutely obvious need for family farms to receive aid , to the detriment of large-scale producers .
The Agenda 2000 proposals , however , favour the meat , cereals and dairy sectors , and restrict themselves to a little individual fine tuning of sectors such as olive oil , fruit , vegetables and
