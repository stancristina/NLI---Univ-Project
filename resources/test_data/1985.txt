It seems almost superfluous to say that we need to increase the quantity and quality of aid .
I have a few questions regarding calls for proposals .
Cancellation of debt , expenditure on refugees , grants for foreign students constitute expenditure which should be excluded from development aid figures ; and so I invite you to support the relevant amendments .
This relationship is , however , of fundamental importance and we ought to put it right by pointing out inadequacies and inefficiencies , identifying the main problems and possible approaches for solving them .
This can no longer be accepted .
I hope that with regard to these proposals , that I hope Parliament will adopt tomorrow morning , the Commission will provide an immediate follow-up , that is , at least , speedy and specific .
This can best be done through a legislative initiative by the Commission . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my Group awaited today 's statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner with great interest .
I should like to thank her again and say that the Commission 's communication , adopted on 20 May , made very interesting reading .
To this end the Commission has identified four projects , recalled by our Commissioner this morning , in addition to the activities already planned : motorways of the seas , depollution of the Mediterranean , environmental management , civil protection cooperation to tackle natural disasters and , lastly , a solar energy programme for the Mediterranean .
The European Union has also made major commitments in the Middle East , and we expect these commitments to be followed up with political action .
In all sincerity - and I say this to our Green and GUE colleagues , and to Karl-Heinz Florenz who I see has re-tabled an amendment from the Environment Committee which bore my signature and which I cannot therefore but support - in all sincerity , looking at both the compromise and the Environment Committee texts , we have achieved - and the main credit goes to you , Mrs Jackson - a really amazing result .
Allow me , nevertheless , to make a few critical comments .
It is totally unacceptable and liable to cancel out the culture of welcome we have had for thousands of years , and the deep roots of a European identity that has been forged through the practice of hospitality .
It makes provision for the detention and expulsion of unaccompanied minors , it lays down a re-entry ban , thus systematically infringing the right to asylum , and provides for discretionary legal aid .
The truth is that governments want to activate immediately the EUR 700 million allocated by the Return Fund .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mr DÃ­az de Mera .
This proposal aims to ensure a high level of protection against the risks that such priority substances ( and a few other pollutants ) pose to the aquatic environment and it therefore lays down some environmental quality standards .
If we tried to overcome the current diversity of legislative frameworks , according to the Council we would exacerbate the situation and create even more distortion .
Among the most sensitive points , I would like to mention ABS , the brake assist system : this is a system that will make it possible to reduce deaths on the roads by 35 % .
I am referring particularly to collision avoidance systems .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to thank the speakers , partly because I believe that this is a job that we have accomplished together and I think that it demonstrates the validity that both Parliament and , in particular , the Commission , have together been able to impart to a proposal that is , in my view , in the current times , quite significant and important .
How much does it cost ?
This is the problem .
The question of speculation obviously needs to be addressed .
I am speaking for the first time not so much from a different place in the Chamber - I have moved four seats along - but it is certainly a great honour for me to be here , and I think it is important for Parliament to have a Member - for that is still how I think of myself deep-down - sitting on the Commissioners ' bench .
I would also like to take this opportunity to express my particular thanks to Mr Liberadzki , the rapporteur , for the efficient manner in which he worked on this proposal .
The Commission certainly promises to keep an eye on enforcement by the Member States , as it does for all other legislation .
That is why we must press on with our work .
For this reason , over and above initiatives geared to improving the conduct of road users and the level of vehicle safety , infrastructure ought to be the third pillar in any road safety programme based on the principle of an integrated approach .
Many administrative obligations and requirements to forward information have been removed , in order to ease the burden of red tape .
Our aim is to change the cultural attitude to safety at the road design , construction and maintenance stages .
Concerning the Commission 's proposals referred to by Mrs Sommer , I believe that at the hearing , during my policy statement the other evening , I emphasised the importance of the Commission 's , but also Parliament 's , commitment to the sensitive subject of road safety .
The Commission is making preparations in Paris , but also in other European cities .
