My Group welcomes the latest decision by the Commission to launch a campaign to inform passengers of their rights - something which the airlines in particular have failed to do over many years .
We believe we need something more to ensure that passengers are better protected from delays and cancellations .
We have all heard the excuses offered by the airlines , ranging from "aircraft going technical " , which is aviation-speak for ' I ' m afraid there are not enough people booked on so we are going to consolidate ' .
" Air traffic delays " is the next one , but of course that is an easy excuse because there is never anyone from air traffic control there to say that is not the issue .
Then of course there is the 'get them on board ' scenario , irrespective of whether the plane is going to leave or not .
Without doubt aviation has made considerable progress , but I also believe that aviation has a responsibility to its passengers , to its workforce , and also to the environment .
Finally , my Group looks forward to receiving from the Commission its new proposals regarding slot-allocation , even though they have been a long time in coming .
I hope this document will embody the view of the fair market access for all , in particular in clarifying the present legislative position regarding the trading of slots .
Mr President , could I begin by thanking the honourable Member for his question .
I substantially agree with the points that he very effectively made .
In fact I would only diverge on one point .
He may be right that behind every great woman is a great man - there is a debate about that .
What I am certain is true is that behind every great man is a very , very surprised mother-in-law .
The honourable Member is , I know , very clear about the fact that responsibility for employment policies and patterns in the Commission , as a separate institution , lies with the Commission itself .
However , in order to provide useful information to this House and to the wider public , I am glad to respond to the two questions which the honourable Member has put down .
In order to give full and detailed answers to his first question , whilst saving some of the time of the House , I have sent a paper to the honourable Member listing the number of appointments of senior officials made in the Commission since taking office and also giving the names , nationalities and previous functions of all concerned .
To provide comprehensive detail , that paper also sets out the total number of senior officials from each nationality in the Commission and of the total numbers of all A grade staff of each nationality in the Commission .
A copy of that paper has also been provided to the secretariat-general of this Parliament for information and , naturally , it will be generally available to honourable Members .
In this oral answer , therefore , I will summarise the situation relating to senior appointments as at last Thursday , 27 April .
Since the present Commission took office , six appointments have been made involving promotions to grade A1 .
They related to three officials of German nationality , two of Italian nationality and one of Irish nationality .
There have been fourteen other transfers at Director-General or Deputy Director-General level , which did not involve promotion in grade , although in four cases relating to Spanish , French , German and British officials , the changes meant advances in responsibility to full Director-General posts .
In the same period 19 appointments involving promotion to grade A2 have been made .
These related to officials of the following nationalities : 5 British , 4 Italian , 3 Belgian , 2 German , 1 Dutch , 1 French , 1 Spanish , 1 Irish and 1 Austrian .
Eleven transfers at Director level which did not involve promotion in grade have also been made .
In addition , two external appointments have been made in this period , one of a German national at Director-General level , and one of an Austrian national at Director level .
In summary therefore , a total of 25 promotions to senior appointments have been made since this Commission took office .
Six of the officials are Italian nationals , five are German , five are British , three Belgian , two Irish , one Dutch , one French , one Austrian and one Spanish .
These figures are accurate as of 27 April 2000 .
As the House will know , in an international and multinational institution like the Commission , it is essential , as the honourable Member said , that the allocation of jobs broadly reflects the diversity of the Union that we serve and uses abilities effectively .
Those principles of balance and quality are clearly set down in the Staff Regulations and the Commission is committed to applying them fully at all levels .
As in any large organisation there is continual change amongst the staff of the Commission as people move , retire , become recruited , or promoted .
As a result , a still-photograph of the staff profile at any fixed time does not , and cannot , give a complete picture .
To be properly judged , balance must consequently be assessed and be maintained over the medium term and the Commission is also actively committed to ensuring that .
In response to the honourable Member ' s second question relating to the rules and criteria applied to senior appointments , I draw the attention of the House to the decisions on the subject which the Commission adopted and published last September and last December .
Those decisions constitute specific legal rules for the institution rather than
