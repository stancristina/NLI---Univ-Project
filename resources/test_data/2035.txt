EXPLANATIONS OF VOTEJackson report ( A5-0041/2001 )
Stockholm must mark the beginning of a thorough debate on public participation in key industrial sectors .
In both recital D and in paragraph 8 it is unfortunate that NATO is mentioned because NATO has been one of the main causes of problems in many places , as we saw in the former Yugoslavia , in Kosovo and in Cyprus when it was invaded by Turkey .
We therefore believe that , in relation to the conflict now arising between Macedonia and Kosovo , we must first concern ourselves with the complacency with which the Americans in the region have fallen into step with the KLA forces and , on the other hand , we must recognise and support Macedonia ' s efforts to reach a border agreement and condemn terrorism .
Now , if we reject vaccination , we would have to respond in a tough manner to the measures adopted by Canada .
The crisis surrounding us should lead us to draw up a CAP aimed at serving the consumer and the producer rather than commerce .
What position will you adopt in relation to third countries ?
I am not speaking as a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs but as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and I would like to express my agreement with the comments by Mr Cox , Mr Goebbels and Mr Herzog .
Otherwise we would simply be allowing the governments to continue playing amongst themselves and drawing Community legislative camels .
This process would also , as Mr Bolkestein correctly pointed out , lead to better functioning of the single market and the disappearance of barriers within it .
Amongst these positive results is the healthy economic situation the European Union currently enjoys .
Some of you have also raised the concern that employment is the fundamental issue .
Structural reforms are regularly mentioned .
A better combination of fiscal reforms and supply systems will certainly have a positive influence on the behaviour of the working population , as it must also help to create a better balance between wages and productivity on a local level , improve employment in certain areas and will also have a positive influence on certain factors such as the mobility of labour or better work organisation .
They also altered the figures that we had hitherto taken into consideration , which produced an imbalanced approach and those responsible for managing the public debt of the Member States have suggested that we continue with the previous system for excessive public debt .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate Mr Fava on his report , which I believe addresses a key factor in the coherence and visibility of the European Union ' s external action .
Secondly , the European Parliament gives legitimacy to our project of integrating Europe and I think that Parliament is therefore extremely well-qualified to represent the European Union .
In addition , therefore , to the traditional reminder of hard data on the activity of the Assembly for that year , we opened a more politically-charged debate on the role of the Assembly itself and , what is more , on how we should view the role of the Members of the European Parliament in the Assembly .
The catalogue of events is described in some detail in the report .
Of course , decisions on this fall to the Assembly itself , but Parliament has the responsibility to state its criteria in order to guide the work of its Members in this Joint Assembly .
To conclude , I wish to thank the secretariat of Parliament ' s Committee on Development and Cooperation for their considerable cooperation .
We cannot escape from this reality and we also need to consider it from a European perspective , because the situation demands it .
It goes on to cover some aspects of saving water , efficient use of water , land-use planning and other aspects .
Returning to the content of the previous answers from Mrs Wallström , I must point out to Mrs García-Orcoyen that I am surprised at the sudden change of position that there appears to be between the Commission ' s reply to us and what the honourable Member says she was told .
The framework directive says that no movement of water can take place unless there has been a rigorous prior assessment of the need for it and unless all the possible alternatives have been exhausted .
These articles establish the objective that the current state of water should not deteriorate , and it also says that this should be complied with from the entry into force of the directive , i .e . 22 December 2000 .
These plans also need to be in line with the Community directives on water , Natura sites , habitat , birds , etc. , in conjunction with the national irrigation plans that should be in accordance with the forthcoming review of the common agricultural policy and rural development in order to deepen essential sustainable development .
I think that this is a framework directive that - and I agree with what has been said here by several speakers - is going to promote a new culture in terms of water in European countries , based on criteria of efficiency and quality of water resources .
It is therefore difficult for it to violate any directive , and therefore , any information either for or against this - such as some that has appeared in the press - is absolutely unwarranted .
Having received the press release that the Group of the European People ' s Party in the European Parliament distributed yesterday to the Spanish media in Strasbourg , dated 13 March , half an hour before Question Time finished , I would like to inform
