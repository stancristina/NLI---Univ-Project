another ministerial meeting at which specific political positions on the matter might be sealed .
The lives of millions of people in developing countries are at stake .
This problem is currently dealt with on a provisional basis .
Consequently , when it comes to discussing the question of whether the compulsory licensing system should be used for Viagra or for medicines to treat toothache for example , members have the confidence to prevent the discussions degenerating into a legal battle .
We were the only party reluctant to ask the WTO for a dispensation to implement the Kimberly agreements .
Mr President , as Mrs McNally said during the previous debate , agriculture was one of the make or break issues at the Doha negotiations mentioned recently in another context .
Consequently , Mr Franz Fischler and I have always made it our business to ensure the Union pulls its weight in negotiations on agriculture .
This reduction is based on the method applied during the previous round .
It must be made quite clear that obviously , this twin proposal can only be implemented if the other parties involved also restrict comparable export subsidies .
This would involve putting in place a special safety net mechanism for the most sensitive products in specific developing countries .
In contrast , the European Union has set ceilings for expenditure on agriculture .
In addition , the Union is the only party to have created a system of non-reciprocal preferences in the framework of the Lom√© Convention and subsequently of the Cotonou Convention .
All this applies to the countries of the north as well as to the countries of the south .
To date , we had been discussing subjects which lacked soul .
Above all there is Mr Fischler 's project , begun in July 2002 and confirmed in January 2003 , which involved deep cuts in subsidies .
I would then like to dwell on two or three points in a little more detail .
The Commission has indeed put forward a proposal .
I do think however that we have already gone too far in reforming the common agricultural policy in recent years .
This in itself is excellent news .
This is how we in Europe perceive agriculture and this is why Europe has adopted a balanced position on a number of outcomes .
Together with my group , I support the many NGOs that are asking for matters relating to public health to fall outside the scope of the WHO .
The immigration issue must be part of an overall , long-term vision of the EU 's policy as a community .
The third reason cited is that the regulations governing the immigration of third-country workers is apparently a cornerstone of general immigration policy .
In fact , it is not for us to pass judgment upon governments .
I ask you to vote against this part of the sentence because I think that cooperation of this kind , focused on the fight against crime , must begin immediately , whatever the conditions prevailing in the country concerned .
The directive proposed by the Commission , however , switches from one meaning to the other , taking the case-law of the Court of Justice as a basis but going beyond it , without the necessary adjustments being made in the Treaty after democratic debate .
Not to mention countries such as Argentina which , although it is wealthier than Belarus , has similarly seen its working classes plunged into poverty by the unpredictability of the market economy .
Although the agreement is interesting because it integrates the human rights dimension and consultation of civil society , it nevertheless deserved a more extensive debate on its possible impact , both positive and negative .
Having built a bureaucratic super-State in Brussels , having swallowed up an Eastern Europe that has only just escaped the Soviet empire , the Euro-federalists are still not satisfied .
Economic and monetary dependency might lead to the ' Argentinisation ' of the country .
In its report , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy raised the issue of the impact of these kinds of pollution on human health .
The fall in coffee prices is indeed catastrophic .
For example , we began with the 'Everything but arms ' initiative , which allows a number of countries among the poorest in the world to diversify their exports .
It is not that businessmen hungry for access to extraordinarily attractive markets have taken control of these negotiations .
I do not want to go into detail here , but I know some regions within the ACP group that are ready to start negotiations tomorrow .
They did not lead to an agreement .
In response to your three questions , Mr Howitt , I shall begin with the timetable .
This is not a change .
I believe that public services or services of general interest must be at the heart of the Union 's transport policy and must , as such , be incorporated into future Treaties .
I therefore support many of his requests , but I am very afraid that at the time of voting , the necessary electric shock will not be sufficient to cause deep-seated policy changes in this area .
Beyond this financial aspect , I would like to draw your attention to three other aspects .
Extremely specific analyses must be carried out on service provision to the peripheral regions , in particular the island regions and outermost regions with , in particular , the establishment of a public service obligation relating to the need to guarantee the principle of territorial continuity and to ensure the best possible operating conditions .
In this area , the Commission would point out that progress was made in the development of 3G terminals in 2002 .
