the EU.
They act as a bridge between the citizens and the authorities , as a catalyst for European public opinion and as support for civil society to take action and for broader participation .
Because Europe is waiting for its political parties to fulfil their role , a single European statute for Europe 's political parties must be created to strengthen party structures , as a matter of urgency .
The report also contributes towards a certain European-level party awareness , whereby we – who become organised in an attempt to take responsibility for the world – can understand that these organisations have also acquired a new scale .
Immigration is only a partial solution .
What can be done to redress the situation ?
Various social protection , solidarity and social security mechanisms have seen their sustainability come under threat .
In addition , mutual knowledge of different social security systems must be increased and people must be given the opportunity to move freely from one national system to another , be it public , private or any other kind , for example , mutual benefit systems .
Let us therefore rise to the challenge of helping to ensure greater solidarity between the generations .     . – The demographic changes taking place in the EU , are , on the whole , beneficial rather than detrimental to society .
The main priorities as regards managing demographic change are jobs with rights , fairer income distribution , strong public social security based on solidarity between generations , and high-quality public services , in particular in areas such as health , education , housing and social protection .
I feel , in this regard , that the use of biofuels could make a positive contribution .
As the resolution says , the import dependency for energy of the 25 EU Member States is extremely high – 48 % in 2002 , potentially rising to 71 % in 2030 if no additional measures are taken .
What we can refer to as the ‘energy question ’ is the expected result of economic progress , coupled with the restricted production and processing capacity of traditional energy sources .
Lastly , I endorse the Green Paper , and the resolution , especially as it introduces the issue of security into the debate .     .
The major powers in the EU , namely France and Germany , with the support of the Portuguese Government have failed to promote the end of the illegal exploitation of natural resources – in which companies from EU countries have been involved – and the end of external meddling in the country ; have failed to respond to requests for humanitarian aid from the United Nations ; and have failed to promote and provide financial support for the disarmament and socio-economic development process , thereby ensuring that it is the local population that uses and benefits from the natural resources in the country .
In order to encourage the citizens to become more involved in politics at Community level , what is needed is a complete sea change away from neoliberal policies , the end of the Stability and Growth Pact , the withdrawal of the so-called Bolkestein Directive , and the replacement of the Lisbon Strategy with a strategy characterised by solidarity , sustainable development and social cohesion .
These developments can be put down to two factors : firstly , people are living longer and , secondly , the birth rate has dropped .
This will ultimately benefit the citizens and their quality of life , as well as the economic sectors involved .
The Commission ’s evaluation of this phenomenon , although in principle a good idea , is often inconsistent with these objectives in practice , especially when it comes to public services .
It is therefore important to update the rules in force to meet our objectives .     – Mrs Wallström , ladies and gentlemen , we believe that the right of access to documents is one of the most important rights enjoyed by Europe’s citizens .
This amended regulation must also form the legal basis for establishing rules , good practices and inter-institutional agreements designed to improve the drafting of legislative texts and to ensure that final legislative texts are accessible .
I wish to express my regret at the omission of the issue of access to documents that the Member States classify and make available to the Council .     . – The bulk of the integrated guidelines for employment growth contain the main barriers to an effective employment policy that prioritises the creation of high-quality jobs with rights , social and territorial cohesion , and people’s well-being .
Families must also be supported , both in terms of rearranging and reducing working hours , without any loss of rights , and in terms of investing in public services to support the family , as this would help to create jobs better suited to local and regional needs .
As we know , the demographic situation on the European continent and the phenomenon of globalisation make it imperative that we carry out a range of reforms to the social and economic models of many EU Member States .
By putting up certain types of barrier to the free movement of workers , some Member States are actually in the preposterous situation of helping workers from third countries to gain access to jobs ahead of those from new EU Member States .     – Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the recommendations drawn up by Mr Garcia-Margallo , whom I wish to congratulate , have come at the right moment to turn around the EU’s economic situation .
The Council decided to support the Commission in drawing up a common European energy policy .
Increased competition is a necessary prerequisite to the creation of a common energy policy .
