President , I would like to finish by saying that certainly many people , and many people in Europe , who never believed in Europe are as dissatisfied with this Treaty as they would be with any other Treaty .
Finally , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , yes , I am very proud , yes I am very satisfied , yes , I feel very honoured to have been part , along with many others , of a historic and decisive moment , the moment in which the Lisbon Treaty was born , because it means that Europe will move forward .
However , measures designed with this in mind must be proportionate and it must not be forgotten that it should primarily be a matter for the Member States to help reduce the risks involved in the use of plant protection products by means of national action plans .
He died after having helped me with this report .
The first is that , by encouraging the recognition and supervision of alternative measures to prison sentences , we are promoting a political culture which will make the courts more likely to apply these measures .
Most of these principles are protected by criminal legislation .
Finally , there is also a need to safeguard the principle of hearing defendants in cases involving the revocation of a suspended sentence or the imposition of a conditional sentence .
Then , ten were killed .
Then , on 8 October , fighting erupted in the town of Muhajiriya , controlled by a Darfuri rebel faction .
Everybody knows that , and it is time to stop this game of hide-and-seek with the Government of Khartoum . rapporteur . - ( PT ) Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the Schengen area is one of the greatest successes in the history of European integration .
I must start by welcoming and congratulating them .
Mr President , the absence of internal borders not only requires better controls at the external borders and a good exchange of information and data through the Schengen Information System ( SIS) , it is notably an exercise in mutual trust in which everyone must strictly comply with the adopted rules .
That is why the European Parliament , in the political resolution to be adopted , which has been co-signed by five political groups , and in the legislative resolution , asks to be informed in detail within six months about all pending issues .
I have two final comments .
It is absurd to deny Parliament material with which it exercises its legislative competences .
The objective will have been achieved if this text is widely approved by Parliament .
While the pioneering European approach is a duty , it should nevertheless also be seen as an opportunity to gain environment-related technological and innovative comparative advantages .
Should Parliament adopt the amendments to the Commission proposal in this plenary session , as I hope it will , we know that the Council has already said that it will also adopt the same amended proposal for a regulation .
It is for that very reason that we are seriously concerned about the attempts to make development aid conditional on security strategies intended in practice to achieve more or less concealed objectives of interference , plundering of resources and neo-colonialism .
The EU must determine strategic priorities for relations with those states with human security as the overall goal .
The causes of fragility must be taken into account in defining strategies and in the globalisation of the EU 's financial instruments .
It stresses the importance of maintaining quality public services , a solid public and universal social security system and high levels of social protection and quality employment combined with rights and of ensuring effective gender mainstreaming in the formulation and implementation of such public policies ; finally , it urges the Commission and the Member States to give maximum priority to women 's social integration and women 's rights , by altering their respective policies accordingly , including income distribution policy .
Social policy falls to a large extent under the competence of the Member States which is why I am in favour of promoting the open method of coordination as well as the exchange of best practices aimed at combating social exclusion .
I should like to mention that it is appropriate to remember that before the persecution of Christians we had the persecution , for example , of the Jews , and we had and still have persecution of the Yazidis , the Mandians and the Muslims themselves , whether Shiite or Sunni , in Iraq .
In this spirit of compromise and also in the Christmas spirit , I feel that we can accommodate these proposals . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PT ) Madam President , you probably did not hear what I said .
I believe that this is possible and that we should make this effort .
The important point is to minimise those risks .
I therefore recommend that this report be adopted by the House . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the new EU tourism policy proposed by the European Commission and discussed in the Costa report deserves my full support .
I myself , in order to reinforce the terms of the Commission 's proposals and take account of the rapporteur 's proposals , tabled various amendments further to the positions that I defended in the Queir√≥ report .
We therefore need to continue to improve the coverage , quality and reliability of this type of statistical data .
I hope that , as a result of the negotiations with the Council , we shall achieve greater coherence , clarity and accuracy throughout
