conduct at Community level up to now : I think I made it quite clear that Austria has been a loyal partner within the European Union and that nobody is questioning Austria ' s conduct .
With regard to the political question which the honourable Member has put to me about the attitude of the Member States towards the effective operation of the Austrian Government , I would like to stress a point which has not always been sufficiently emphasised in relation to Austria : the current situation does not represent 'business as usual ' , neither for Austria in general nor for Austria ' s political life .
As regards Austria acting as a full partner within the Community , as it has done up to now , nothing will militate against Austria at Community level .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall reply very directly to the questions that have been raised , so as to avoid any possible doubt about the Council ' s position , and I think it is indeed important for that position to be clarified .
I would like to make it very clear that in no way has the Council stated its opposition to all Parliament ' s amendments , nor has it called upon the European Commission to come up with any new proposals .
I recognise that there are some concerns about this , but I would like to say that this is in line with the practices followed in Member States , which in some cases even allow fingerprints to be taken from children under 14 .
But we have to recognise that the creation of a set of EU mechanisms for regulating all these issues relating to applications for asylum needs to be subject to rigorous technical scrutiny , failing which it could be perceived as implying a loss of citizens ' rights .
The Commission , in this case , has a different position from both the Council and Parliament .
It is inconceivable for me that my country is one which criminalises all children of 10 years of age just because they are fingerprinted for their first identity card .
We will come to Parliament and the Council with proposals in the next few months .
Of course , the Council has been generous in the sense that it has given to the Commission management and the technical functioning of the system .
Maybe through this balanced solution it will be possible to address in a more relaxed and trusting way some of the reservations and political doubts that have been raised by several Members of Parliament during this debate .
As regards the specific question of trafficking in women , which is covered in the chapter on violence against women , the objectives are very clear .
The importance of this programme should not be underestimated , given that it has helped to finance a great many projects and has proved to be genuinely effective .
I would also like to point out that this issue is periodically considered under the transatlantic dialogue , because this phenomenon also affects countries like Canada and the United States , and is not limited to the area immediately adjacent to the European Union .
We think that an attempt should be made to assess this figure more accurately , and we should not get involved in commenting on an estimate of this kind , which does not seem to us to be well founded .
The Member States of the European Union are also playing a very active role in the meeting of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women which is preparing the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on women .
The Commission is paying particular attention to this subject , and I believe that the fact that during the Portuguese presidency various negotiating chapters linked with this - particularly in the field of justice and home affairs and freedom of movement - are to be opened with the Luxembourg phase candidate countries may help to create a common culture , a common culture that the candidate countries will later on have to share in terms of respecting the acquis communautaire .
I detected a great commitment by the Romanian authorities to going as far as possible to confront situations of this kind .
As for Article 7 , which is in fact a Portuguese proposal that I was able to present to the Reflection Group which prepared the previous Intergovernmental Conference , this article establishes a specific mechanism , and this is the point to which the honourable Member ' s question refers , for taking action against any Member State which seriously and persistently breaches the principles mentioned in the previous article , Article 6 .
As this procedure has not been invoked by any of the bodies with this right of initiative , this situation does not , in our view , constitute a matter covered by Article 7.
We still have an almost purely national framework for justice , although certain situations are in practice clearly of a transnational nature .
On the other hand , I would like to stress that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights that is being discussed will very probably help to strengthen these new aspects and will certainly help to give the European Union a more solid body of legally arguable principles , which some of us , and the Council in particular , would like to see .
So I do not like to be taught any lessons by a party which behaves in a racist and xenophobic way , and makes racist and xenophobic statements which it seems to me give us every reason to be concerned .
I think Mrs Kauppi must have misheard or there must have been a mistake in the interpreting .
Any country can disassociate itself from the declaration made by the 14 countries .
