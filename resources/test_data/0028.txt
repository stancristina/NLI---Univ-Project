There was much resentment against some nation states at the hold-ups there had been over the new trade agreement with particular reference to spirit names .
We are doing much for South Africa and I hope , in return , President Mbeki will work for peace in the region , with particular reference to Zimbabwe .
The implication in the rapporteur 's report that this regulation may have been delayed because it was being used as a bargaining chip is very worrying .
The Commission might like to comment on this particular point .
I would also like to hear from the Commission on how we can streamline the system .
In the last session in Strasbourg we had another regulation that had also run out last December and this should not happen .
I must strongly support the rapporteur and his suggestions that the Commission should be tackling the issues of major topics , such as the importance and the overall impact of the programme in relation to the agreed objectives rather than individual programmes .
I would also like to see delegate offices strengthened with more and better staff to be able to cope more efficiently with monitoring and evaluations .
This regulation is bound to have an impact on neighbouring states and I hope the Commission will take this into consideration .
The rapporteur has broken new ground on commitology which can only bode well for the future .
My group supports this regulation but asks for a speedy conclusion to the vacuum we are in .
We would not like to see any disagreement on budget amounts hold up ratification .
Mr President , we are in a strange situation because a decision was taken in the groups before the Committee on Budgets had decided on this issue of Montenegro .
Also , I have not had a chance to speak to my good friend Mr Westendorp .
I believe that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy is sympathetic to the position of the Committee on Budgets , which I am about to state .
However , since I have not spoken to him directly , do not quote me on that - it is only second-hand information .
Firstly , I should like to make it clear that the Committee on Budgets supports any aid to Montenegro .
It has done so in the past and will do so in the future .
On this occasion there is no urgency for this to go through now .
The monies will not be made available until August for the first tranche and the second tranche will be paid at the end of the year .
We are of the opinion that the relevant committees need to study the details of this proposal .
Whichever the lead committee is - Foreign Affairs or Industry - we would merely give an opinion , but those committees and Parliament need to evaluate these proposals .
We should not be bounced into a decision because the Council deems it to be necessary .
As for budgets , our main concern is where the money is coming from .
It is great to make proposals but we feel this urgency should not be agreed upon until we know where the money is coming from .
We should leave it until next month .
The committees can debate it and we can vote on it at the June part-session .
Mr President , we have not discussed it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , but my personal view is that we should not accept urgency now .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work that he is doing for our House in terms of getting value for money out of our budget .
It is not right that we should be expecting the Commission to do a whole range of things in putting their House and their budget in order unless we also take the same kinds of rigorous steps .
The approach which has been taken is absolutely correct , not only in making sure that we do not simply give money away if we have a little spare in the budget , but also where we have asked the Secretary-General of Parliament to come forward with a number of reports : for example , in paragraph 6 of the resolution where we have asked the Secretary-General to look at and identify job needs in the same way as the Commission so that we can match job needs to the staff which we have available in the longer term .
That quite clearly is a way of long-term planning which is very sensible at this stage of Parliament 's life .
There are three things which I would like to emphasise in particular in this Parliament Budget 2001 .
The first is a plea from an individual parliamentarian that we should make sure that we have a date firmly fixed for the second network computer in our offices .
It is a matter of frustration for many of us that our staff can access the net with their computers , of course , Parliament 's computers , but if we as parliamentarians bring in our own computers , we do not have a place to plug them in and work effectively .
It is important to have a date when this facility will be available to us .
Secondly , on a matter of communication , under paragraph 21 of this resolution , I would like to draw the House 's attention to the fact that we have on many occasions in these debates called for all Commission and Parliament offices in the Member States to work together within a European House framework by 1 January 2000 .
As we have now gone past that
