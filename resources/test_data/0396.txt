And this is what is involved .
The vote against paragraph 11 of the Palacio Vallelersundi report is based on respect for the " constitutional identity ' of Member States , a principle for which there is a special proviso both in the Treaty on European Union and long before that in Community law and precedent .
We have full confidence in them and seek to collaborate increasingly closely with them in the fight against crime and terrorism .
The Commission shares the view expressed by the UN Secretary-General that the decision to open negotiations should be seen as a positive development which could promote the search for a political settlement .
The Commission of course welcomes the successful holding of municipal elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 13 and 14 September .
As you may recall , at the ministerial meeting in Sintra last May , we agreed on the need to support those parties who are themselves supporting Dayton and to do what we can to undermine those who are opposing it .
In that sense , support for free media and , just as importantly , support for municipalities that are working to put Dayton into practice - these are the main goals of the Commission following these recent elections in Bosnia .
The initiative of the Unión de Fiscales Progresistas , which was received by a Spanish court , should be given our political support .
Democratic elections brought President Allende to power .
In this involvement , the European Commission is always guided by the principles of the highest degree of environmental protection possible for the Baltic Sea region .
The Union has sought to cooperate with them in all the appropriate fora which promote the protection of the Baltic Sea .
Although we agree with the Commission 's theses on the agri-monetary system in force , that is , no basic change in the present arrangements , simplification without comprising the system as a whole , or abolishing the agricultural conversion rate and reappraising possible future choices , we nevertheless consider it necessary to make some comments .
A situation of this magnitude for the European Union budget will , in practice , compromise the CAP reforms and make it completely impossible to make the necessary improvements in the structures and organization of markets for Mediterranean crops .
Such measures have been rightly repudiated by both Canadians and Europeans in another context .
At this point I would like to make what seems to me to be an urgent observation of central relevance on a view which is gaining general acceptance , namely that social security protects citizens against risks of a social nature .
Mr President , the formal adhesion of the European Community to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea concludes a long and difficult process in which Europeans have not always been able to identify their real interests .
For that reason , however , we must now go beyond the apparent conflicts which are dragging on interminably between the defenders of traditional concepts based on acquired practices and those who uphold inter-sectorial and integrated interests .
After our leading role over the last few years , with the results I have described , it appears that my country is not among the 120 which - to date - have signed the convention .
It correctly evaluates the positioning of the European Union , which , from the economic point of view , is the second largest investor in the region , and will have to opt for a positive approach of strengthening its participation in actions which further the economic and social development of those countries .
It would therefore be more appropriate and politically justifiable to require that country to comply with the international rules recognised by the UNO than to ask Portugal for leave to negotiate thirdgeneration agreements , although it is recognized that these have intrinsic importance and value as the best option for a new dynamic in European Union-ASEAN relations .
I say this openly because it is , in my opinion , a report of truly exceptional quality .
And to be fair , it is not simply a question of having equal rules for everyone .
But if the majority of countries continue to be suffocated by debt , our action will be virtually lost .
I honestly believe that the Martens report underlines this on many occasions and that , in this respect , we are totally in agreement .
It is discriminatory .
I hope that Parliament will be able to support us in this frontal approach , because in my opinion it is the best way of anchoring the Lomé V Convention .
The Commission has become increasingly concerned about the welfare of animals during transportation and , in particular , the long-distance transport of animals .
Following the adoption in the Council of new standards on the protection of animals during transport , there were two major obligations for the Commission to propose further detailed rules .
Once this regulation is adopted by the Council , the Commission will then decide detailed implementing rules which will gradually increase the degree of protection for cattle being transported .
The Commission , through the Food and Veterinary Service will continue its mission to monitor the situation in Member States , despite the fact that enforcement is the responsibility of each Member State .
A very worthy objective , some will think .
The opinion of the Committee for Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy is even more political : it refers explicitly to the blocking of the agreement and sees the way out of the situation as being an order that Portugal withdraw her objection , arguing that this would make it possible to create a legal basis for the protection of human rights in East Timor .
Since this is an area of extraordinary potential , the European Union 's concern to establish a new dynamic in relations with ASEAN is understandable
