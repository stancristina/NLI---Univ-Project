The necessary response , then , is not to do as in the past and make promises , but to make more competition possible , and the fact that the Commission is at last doing something about this gives cause for hope .
That is precisely the wrong way to go about it .
I tend towards the view that , yes , we should be bold enough to set ourselves definite targets , targets that are capable of being reviewed , notwithstanding the risk of one or other country , or perhaps the whole European Union , failing to achieve what we have set ourselves 100 % , but the ten million jobs – 2 million a year – is a realistic target .
Getting this Financial Perspective off the ground in the first place was a great achievement , and for it I would like to thank Mr Barroso , the President of your House and all the groups in it , and the negotiators .
The institutionalisation of the cooperation of liaison officers adds to security around the European Union and in its immediate neighbourhood .
That is why I voted against this report .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , Mr High Representative , during the elections in both Palestine and Israel , it was still clear to me , despite the different outcomes , that the great majority of citizens on both sides are moderate , and that they want peace and an end to violence .
Even following Mr Arafat 's death , when Mr Abbas was President – and this was during the withdrawal from Gaza – it was not accepted .
I should like to emphasise that point here .
We must remind them that all that these people have done is to make use of one of their human rights , namely the right to demonstrate and to express their opinion freely .
The Council and , I am sure , the Commission , too , will continue to work to this end .
You can therefore be assured that the Council will continue to work very seriously and vigorously and very specifically on those measures that are ultimately of use and that achieve the goal for which we are all aiming , namely democratisation and the inclusion of this country in the EU 's neighbourhood programmes .
There were technical problems and shortcomings , but not to an extent that should cause us concern .
It was the total dedication with which many citizens exercised their right to vote freely , for which they had fought a year previously .
There is a specific need for this , and the Council will do so in cooperation with the Commission .
That does not mean , though , that we will not continue to work with Ukraine with great verve and enthusiasm , as the President-in-Office said .
A successful transport policy rests on three essential pillars – people , vehicles and infrastructure , and , in the course of the meeting to which I have referred , we were able to discuss all three of them in detail .
Significant efforts have been made since 2001 to make Europe’s roads safer .
Then , because we were unable to agree , in the legislative process for the basic regulation in 2002 we settled for at least an interinstitutional agreement that the Commission should present a proposal for the public financing of such aviation security measures .
However , if we want fair competition between the different modes of transport , there must also be fair rules for the financing of security measures .
At least part of your speech should have dealt with this subject .
That is why my clear position is that all this is a national function , and we have to face up to that .     .
The situation is still not satisfactory .
You can therefore be assured , honourable Member , that we are also seeking to end the suppression of the Falun Gong faith and its adherents .     .
I would answer your question like this .
Madam President , in answer to Mr Beglitis ’ question I can first of all say that the Council is of course very much aware of the questions he raises .
The extent to which progress is made in the reforms and Turkey complies with its Treaty obligations will naturally affect the negotiation process .
That meeting , with all the foreign ministers present , was not the right occasion to raise Dr Mugraby’s case .
Madam President , may I perhaps begin by saying – because it is something in which I take a very personal interest – that the Council constantly argues for the unconditional preservation of all international standards of human rights and of humanitarian international law in the context – and particularly in the context – of the fight against terrorism .
The Council welcomes the fact that the Court of Justice found that examination of the questions referred by the national court for a preliminary ruling revealed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Articles 5 , 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC ) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights , and repealing Regulation ( EEC ) No 295/91 .
I would point out to the honourable Member , however , that this , too , is a matter for the Member State concerned .
As President of the Transport , Telecommunications and Energy Council , I myself have constantly pointed out the importance of realising the TEN priority projects and , as I have already mentioned , have also made the responsible parties to the negotiations aware of this and applied pressure where this was possible
