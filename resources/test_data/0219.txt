Let us also tell people what it would cost if there were another conflagration on our borders or within Europe .
The leader of the Pan-African Parliament 's Election Observer Mission , Marwick Khumalo , and the SADC mission assess the events of 27 June as follows : ' The atmosphere prevailing in the country did not give rise to the conduct of free , fair and credible elections .
If we cooperate more closely in this area , we will be able to spend our money more usefully and achieve greater efficiency .
Perhaps we should consider whether European budget funds could not also be made available for the other planned projects I mentioned . rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , I would like to take up what Mr Verheugen said and also answer Mr Pflüger and Mr Batten on the question of what the citizens of the European Union want .
My group strongly supports Sarah Ludford 's report .
I also see problems with implementing the proposed new regulation .
I should like to say to all the Members who disagree with this that , as long as you are not out to get a quick headline , but instead have the objectives of cooperating to achieve something for the minorities in Europe , and of all groups in this Parliament , both large and small , pulling together , then jointly we can achieve something for these people .
Our aim was , and still is , to clarify the facts properly first of all .
The citizens want us to be more effective , more transparent , more democratic , and they want the national parliaments to be more democratic and have more influence .
It is the task of the European Union to restore to them the feeling that growth in Europe , the economic progress of this continent , does not serve the banks and the large conglomerates but each individual citizen .
( Applause from the left ) Mr President , I have just looked it up , and it is true that Rule 149( 3 ) states that , provided 40 of them do so together , Members may request that it be established whether or not the quorum is present .

Many Members here today were also present .

The present decision supplements this obligation to the effect that the EJN and Eurojust must inform each other on a reciprocal basis about all cases on which they take the view that the other organisation is better able to deal with these .
I hope , and I am confident , that we can move ahead in a positive way , and I greatly welcome that . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that , in the current situation , we should be discussing what to do now .
Therefore there is a real political problem .
However , I would stress that the ' European contract law ' project should really be led by DG Justice and Home Affairs because the reference framework is not just about consumer contract law ; it is also intended to make it easier for SMEs to shape their cross-border contracts with other business partners who are not consumers .
Mr Karas has rightly pointed out that cross-border accidents account for a very small percentage of road traffic accidents and that most of them are settled out of court .
This , then , is our position : we fully support Mrs Bowles ' report in all other respects , but if Amendment 4 on the abolition of the Savings Taxation Directive gains a majority , we will reject the report in its entirety . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , listening to the speeches delivered by the previous speakers - by Commissioner Špidla , by the President-in Office of the Council , Mr Bertrand , and by you , Mr Daul - one has the impression that all is well .
Since we are entering an election campaign , it is only right to ask why there was such optimism fifteen years ago about the future of social policy in Europe , and why there is such pessimism today .
This is why we need to spell out very clearly that the struggle for the European social model is also the struggle for a basic philosophy .
I believe that all three statements require critical analysis .
We have therefore come a long way already .
