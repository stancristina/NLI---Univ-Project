look after , it is unacceptable to make comprises as regards the economic dimension of what you have to look after and the measures you take .
We need to make an effort to increase citizens ' sensitivity in the approach to and use made of forests .
That is why there must be very close and very efficient cooperation between countries which belong to the European Union and others which do not belong and we must help each other to bring about the best possible result .     Mr President , I should like to congratulate the Commissioner and Mrs de Sarnez on this ambitious programme , on this big , substantial step .
We reward both the institutions and cooperation between them under this programme , as well as promoting the excellence of the students from whichever country , continent or cultural background they come .
European students , inoculated from cooperation with foreigners , have a great deal to gain and a great deal to understand from the culture which they will bring to us .     Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , I should like to congratulate the four rapporteurs on the work they have done and to wish them continuing success , because it is obvious that the conciliation procedure with the Council is going to follow .
The same applies to air transport .
We must always bear in mind that we cannot talk about a single European market if we do not have a single transport network .
Tomorrow morning , of course taking all the steps needed for safety rules , so that we have liberalisation at a high level with no risk to passengers , as is the case in air transport .
I hope that the Commissioner will help us with the statement she has made and which may be used as a final refuge so that , immediately afterwards , we can proceed to liberalise the railway market as far as passengers are concerned .
We shall proceed in this spirit , hoping that , by the end of the Italian Presidency at the end of December , we shall have the best possible result on the criterion of the liberalisation of the railway market , not because we consider it an end in itself , but because we believe that it is the best way of serving the European economy , European consumers and the workers themselves , in that more jobs will be created .     Madam President , the 2004 budget is an expression of the anti-grass roots , autocratic policy of the European Union .
For yet another year , a budget is being presented which strengthens big business and the expansionist imperialist policy of the European Union .
The murder of Palestinians by Israel is being funded under the agreements and the invasion of the USA in Iraq is being funded and legitimised .
Any convergence happening is happening downwards , dragging even broader sections of society into poverty and penury .
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against this budget because , instead of resolving , it will create new problems for the workers , farmers and small enterprises in the regions and instead of contributing to peace in the world , it promotes war and the imperialist hegemony .     Madam President , unfortunately , I could not resolve the problems of the Structural Funds with EUR 10 .
Here , in an effort to limit appropriations horizontally as far as personnel are concerned , I think that problems are being created for the ‘take-off ’ of this agency , which needs to operate efficiently and quickly at European level , so that there is one contact for these issues with the Federal Aviation Administration ( FΑΑ ) in the United States .
We would like to hope that these sums will be taken up .
Similarly , we do not know the place of origin of the pharmaceutical products , because they often do not come from places such as the USA or Canada , but from India or Brazil , with the result that the composition and content of the pharmaceutical product are very harmful and bear no relation to the indications .
Do we really have to allow this advertising , especially when it concerns young ages ?
In other words , what we have here are tolerance and the concealed assent of the Commission , and Commissioner Bolkestein in particular , to an infringement of the legislation of the European Union , especially the directives on data protection .
I should like to take advantage of the vote to point out the following : First , my agreement with the European Parliament proposals for higher compensation margins .
Thirdly , the importance of the Aegean islands ' acquiring the same privileges as the remote regions of the Union .     I thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
We also know that the Council has been paying special attention to the fact that the Cuban courts have sentenced about 70 United States agents .
I welcome the Commission initiative on the Green Paper on entrepreneurship with particular satisfaction and congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen , on the detailed , cohesive work which he is presenting to us for the vote .
Banks must stop being the oppressor of small and medium-sized enterprises and must undertake the useful role as their advisor and supporter .
Finally , the social perception which the leftist ideology has been cultivating for years now , that profit is the demon and enemy of society , must be overturned immediately and definitively .
I think that the report drafted by Mr Evans , while supporting the basic objectives of the Greek proposal , at the same time supplements them and provides safety valves so as not to discourage donors
