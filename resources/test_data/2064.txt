to look at other ways of spending that money , because , as I see it , we could make better use of it .
We could encourage young farmers , who face so much red tape and bureaucracy now .
Young farmers have computers .
Farmers ' wives know how to use computers and could use them on the farm .
That is the way forward for the future .
Question No 27 by (H-0969/00 ) : Subject : European chemical industry The carbohydrates industry employs some 8 500 people .
However , even with the export refund applicable in previous years , the competitive disadvantage to the European chemical industry is demonstrated by the fact that four European production units have already been closed down and six new production units have been set up by European companies in third countries , with the adverse consequences of loss of direct and indirect employment ( farmers ) and a loss of outlets for European agricultural products .
What will the Commission do to reverse this trend ?
I thank the Commissioner for his answer but would ask the Commission to explain the obvious lack of coherence between its and the Council 's politically declared will to promote the biotechnological industry and the measures taken , which endanger the very existence of this industry .
I tabled a question to the Commission in October on the environmental hazards posed by DU, depleted uranium 238 , shells in the Balkans and suggested that some of the emergency aid package to Serbia should be dedicated to investigating and , if proven , making good the toxic and radioactive damage possibly posed to the people of Kosovo .
Commissioner Patten rather surprisingly replied that this was not a priority .
In view of the recent EU-wide publicity and concerns expressed about DU shells and the hazards posed by the dust in particular if inhaled by soldiers and civilians , particularly children playing in the vicinity of where there has been bomb damage , have the Commissioner 's views changed since then ?
This aid is very laudable on the one hand , but , could it not also be letting the Indonesian Government off the hook ; and should we really not use the political and economic strength of the European Union to force the Indonesian Government to look after its own citizens , especially this Christian minority ?
Question No 43 by (H-0984/00 ) : Subject : Conflict Prevention and Peacekeeping in the Developing World How does the Development DG intend to cooperate with the Swedish Presidency on issues related to conflict prevention and peacekeeping in developing countries ?
Mr President , Commissioner , the answer is , of course , very satisfactory but I wondered if you were aware Commissioner that the strategic policy planning and early warning units in the Commission has 20 staff , 11 of whom are responsible for the Balkans and only one responsible for Africa which is your responsibility .
I wonder if you would look at that issue and try to ensure that we have more staff on the ground in these units .
Also , are you aware that they depend on annual funding which means that they cannot make long-term planning of the kind that you suggested now , so it is important that the Commission looks at these issues .
Secondly , Commissioner , the whole matter of decentralisation to the delegations : will you be ensuring that in the delegations you have members of staff with expertise to deal with conflict prevention and peace building ?
Mr President , Commissioner , at the outset I want to acknowledge the assistance which I received from the secretariat of the Committee on Fisheries and indeed from the secretariat of my own group in preparing this report .
I want to thank Mr Poignant for his cooperation while producing my report .
Both myself and Mr Poignant had one major preoccupation - to make sure that our reports were not only complementary , but more importantly that they were not contradictory .
After all they deal with the same subject , and I would like to think that the same spirit will prevail in the House when both reports are voted on tomorrow .
Under the regulation establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture , the Commission is obliged to report at least every three years to Parliament , the Council and the Community bodies representing the sector on the implementation of measures and developments in the common fisheries policy .
This report reviews the years 1996 to 1998 .
The timing of the present communication gives it a special significance in that it represents a bridge to the Green Paper to be published on the review of the common fisheries policy .
Not only is this is an historical snapshot of the past , it is an important indication of the direction of Commission thinking about the future and shape of the CFP after 2002 .
This , of course , is to be welcomed .
The report covers all aspects of the CFP , including conservation and management of resources , structural policy , external fisheries policy , market policy and monitoring and control .
In the conclusions to its communication the Commission lists among its priorities : better coherence between the various objectives pursued by the CFP , such as conservation of resources , the economic efficiency of the fleet and securing employment in fisheries - dependent areas , taking account of the economic dimension of fisheries management , better integration of environmental and fisheries policy , improvement of management tools such as multi-annual management objectives and strategies , management of fishing effort , and full integration of the Mediterranean into the Community management regime , a more accountable decision-making process and maintaining the external dimension of the common fisheries policy
