is the only case since executions resumed in 1977 in which the evidence of unsolved , unadjudicated crime in a foreign country has been used to secure the death sentence .
Juan Garza 's death sentence came as a result of murders in Mexico , which he was never charged with .
Thirdly , there are 21 prisoners currently in federal death row : 14 are black , 5 are white , one is Asian and one is Latino .
We know that in state trials black defendants are four times more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants .
Fourthly , Governor Ryan of Illinois , as we have heard already , has imposed a moratorium on the death sentence in his state because of its appalling record of wrongful convictions .
When we bring all those factors together we see that the death penalty in the US is an arbitrary process and is fundamentally a racist process .
That is why we constantly demand that the death sentence should not be carried out in the US.
In this case it is particularly important because it is a federal execution and will be the first since 1963 .
That is why we urge President Clinton to grant clemency in this case and a moratorium on federal executions .
There is a presidential campaign under way .
In a presidential campaign executions , regrettably , become a political football in the US.
President Clinton has the opportunity - he is not standing for re-election - to make a stand on this issue today .
Mr President , this short debate takes place against a background of increasing tension in Zimbabwe .
All of us who speak should remember that every word of our speeches and the resolution will be eagerly read in Zimbabwe within the next 48 hours by all sides .
We must , therefore , all encourage Zimbabwe to move towards elections in May .
The old parliament was dissolved on 11 April and President Mugabe pledged at the EU-Africa Summit in Cairo that the elections would go ahead .
It is therefore worrying that constituency boundaries have yet to be set .
This could take up to three months .
I hope that , when the elections are called , observers from Europe will be invited to Zimbabwe to monitor the proceedings .
This would show real transparency .
It is not for Europe to meddle in the internal affairs of any nation .
African countries must work together to consolidate their future .
However , the old Lomé Convention made democracy , human rights and the rule of law a requirement for development aid .
The new Partnership Agreement goes further and asks for good governance .
All we ask is that disputes of any kind be settled through courts and not in open conflict .
I particularly highlight land issues .
Zimbabwe has much to gain from the Partnership Agreement and urgently needs aid and debt relief .
Much of this could go to rural areas for agreed land resettlement .
It is disappointing that Zimbabwe feels the need to be involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo at a time when precious resources could be spent on domestic requirements , such as education and health .
We all look forward to the rule of law being strengthened and a democratisation process fully operating under an independent judiciary to allow civil society to express its wishes through a fair and open press .
The Zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future .
Mr President , I should like to clarify whether this resolution is compatible with the resolution that we passed in January of this year , drawing attention to the problems of the prisoners of war who are still in Kuwait , or whether this resolution is to be taken as contradictory to our resolution of January of this year ?
Mr President , since this voting session is a continuation of the lunch-time voting session , would I be correct in thinking that the few roll-call votes in which we have participated this afternoon will count as part of our daily count , and that this has direct relevance to the earlier vote on whether we had a quorum or not ?
Perhaps you could let me know later .
- I wholeheartedly endorse Mrs Gröner 's recommendation to approve the agreement reached with the Council on European youth action programmes .
The previous youth programmes , Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service , will be grouped together in a general medium-term programme which will run from 2000 until 2006 , as the European Parliament has demanded .
A longer-term programme will ensure young people have the opportunity to benefit from such schemes for a guaranteed time .
Every participant will also have full access to health services and social security , therefore allowing as many of our young people as possible to become involved .
Although the funding of these programmes of EUR 520m is well below our original demand of EUR 980m which is necessary for new Member States after enlargement , there will be a possibility of increasing this figure , following extra demands on the budget by enlargement .
These programmes will certainly benefit our young people and give them invaluable opportunities to learn about themselves , about others and about Europe .
Not only is this crucial for their personal development , but in a fiercely competitive world it will vastly improve their chances on the job market .
Increasing our young people 's skills has always been one of our priorities and we must continue to support this aim .
Our young people are Europe 's future .
We must encourage them to learn about others and about the European Union , as well as developing their own values , ideas and skills .
