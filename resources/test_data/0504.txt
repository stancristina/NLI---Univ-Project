this success , you have played a leading role , Mr President .
It is true that we have done so , but we have done so precisely in order to provide the European Union with greater democracy .
I believe we have always borne in mind the idea of safeguarding the necessary balance between the institutions , that that has been the fundamental premise of all our work .
I believe , Mr President , that you have presented the European Parliament with a challenge today .
We do not want it to be ceremonial , we do not simply want to take lunch in Rome , although Rome is a wonderful city .
We are facing a situation in which the devastating fire which destroyed the UN headquarters in Baghdad and also the murder by means of car bombs of the Shi'ite religious leader , Mohamed Baquer al Hakim , are part of a terrorist fight , but also of something which could be compared to a resistance and , at a time when everything that happened before the war is being reconsidered , we must be aware that what is required in Iraq is not more besieged troops , but to seek a timetable for the country to be reconstructed , and reconstructed , furthermore , with the involvement of the Iraqis .
Like Commissioner Patten and the President-in-Office of the Council , I welcome the humanitarian efforts being made by ECHO .
I believe that Mr Patten has made a statement loaded with pragmatism and good sense and I , if I had to consider any aspect as urgent - apart from security - would place the emphasis on infrastructures because , being an inert system , it makes accumulated backlogs irrecoverable .
It is also unacceptable , in a state which purports to respect the rule of law , that the government has ordered the closure of two news organisations .
I would like to expressly state , however - and in this regard I do disagree with his explanatory statement - that it is only the victims of terrorism who really suffer torture and all types of suffering , and not the ETA terrorists , who use the strategy of accusations of torture to try to weaken the rule of law .
I could reply in the same tone .
Though I fully share Mr Sylla 's view , I must confess that I have some reluctance in accepting a report subjected to the pressure of current standards of political correctness , which passes over in silence more important considerations such as evident breaches of human rights and political freedoms in some Member States such as the Kingdom of Spain .
In this regard , what I would like to ask is whether you believe that , independently of all these issues approved at European Councils , we should not take humanitarian measures appropriate to the everyday reality taking place on our coasts , and other places which are not coastal , where there are immigrants living in bad conditions who require suitable humanitarian assistance ?
I thank you very much for your reply anyway and I would like to know whether or not you believe that women 's issues should be progressively introduced into political dialogue .
I therefore advocate this notion of flexibility , adaptability and numerous small projects , despite the fact that there are broad problems .
I believe there are legal issues of great importance which Europe should promote and we should also introduce the concept of flexibility , sustainability and made-to-measure actions .
Women are the poorest and suffer most from illness in the developing countries .
I would like to congratulate Mr Howitt , because his report was approved unanimously within the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
The other source of funding , the decentralised cooperation line B7-6002 , involves very small amounts - 3 % of the amount provided for NGOs .
It should be pointed out at the outset that this is a very useful compendium of data and comments which are not available in any other form for easy consultation .
Another issue which remains in the air is the quest for greater efficiency in our actions by means of selecting more suitable interlocutors with whom to implement our actions .
Thank you , Mr President , and thank you also to the Members who helped me in the production of this report .
We in Spain already channel enough money towards the promotion of languages and , for this reason , we do not agree with channelling more Community budget for this purpose , bearing in mind all the existing needs at European level .
In my case , in the Spanish state , there are several nations .
Mr President , I regret that , despite having offered a written translation , I have not been authorised to speak in Euskera - the language of an ancestral people , the Basques , which has survived the passing of time with a small population and which , in the opinion of eminent foreign researchers , is the language of the first residents of Europe .
I tried , through my group , to offer a translation of my words and to speak in Euskera , and the reply was that only one person per Parliamentary group could speak .
Allow me to comment , however , on a single area of concern : as a Catalan speaker , I am aware of the existence in Europe of languages spoken by millions of people which are not thought of as being minority languages or regional languages and which - despite having official status within their autonomous region - are not state languages and are therefore not languages with official status in the European Union .
If we want a society free of violence , which is what we all aspire to , we must invest in it .
