The new strategic guidelines rightly focus more than before on growth and jobs , with the emphasis on knowledge and information society , entrepreneurship and employment .
I have no desire to repeat that experience today , but I have to tell the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that I am not going to mince my words either .
Perhaps , in this instance , it will be the German Presidency of the Council that will send out the signal that moves the European Union further ahead , but I have to say that I would like to see Finland and Portugal acting as particle accelerators , for Germany , although large , is sluggish ; it is comparable with France in being a country with great traditions , but not much in the way of speed .
That is not on !
Since this can , ultimately , be determined only by , for example , a judge in state B repeating the whole proceedings from state A complete with the collection of evidence – which would involve such things as re-interviewing witnesses and would be neither desirable nor workable – it must be sufficient that he should have good reason to doubt that the act was punishable .
I do not , for example , like the way this report approaches the Armenian issue .
I would like to give voice to my fear that what the government probably wishes to do is to pursue its strategy of destruction and expulsion to the very end .
Secondly – and this is something we Europeans can do – we have to spell out the fact that , under such tragic circumstances , the so-called sovereignty of the Sudanese state is very definitely negotiable .
Much as the expansion of the African peace mission to 11 000 police officers and soldiers in the Western Sudan is to be welcomed , the African Union’s continuing and collective support for UN troops shows that this can be seen as no more than a transitional measure .
That is one of the reasons why tomorrow we are not going to support the idea of a free-trade agreement at this stage .
As a first step , we demand gender mainstreaming in international trade policy , with explicit monitoring and assessment mechanisms , the latter of which might , for example , involve ranking the Member States in terms of their promotion of gender equity on the labour market .
Since there are both individual and social human rights , it follows that it is justified – to say the least – that all trade agreements should include clauses on human beings ’ social rights , namely the right to education , the right to training , and the right to free health care .
We all know that paper is patient ; so we also need to see to it that the European Union’s standards apply in these countries .
That is the form in which it must remain .
Nanotechnology is used to put on the market products such as cosmetics , cleaning materials , and textiles , which are aimed at private consumers and virtually unregulated .
The ‘European Institute of Technology ’ proposed by the Commission under President Barroso could make it its business , by means of a top-down strategy , to communicate the insights of fundamental research to the education and training sectors , or a bottom-up strategy might be employed to extract this knowledge from the educational institutions , but also and in particular from small and medium-sized businesses and to present it on such a platform as ‘eBay’ , with the possibility of the net being used to exchange ideas , express aspirations and guarantee better communication in the twenty or more European languages .
According to one approach , individual donors in a particular region should take on leadership roles in specific sectors ; not only does this come in for praise in the report , but we too could consider the possibility of making use of the financial clout that the European Union wields – greater than that of the United Nations – in taking over the leadership in respect of one of the eight Millennium Development Goals , and the one I would propose is water .
As the rapporteur said , aid from the European Union and the Member States must be coordinated in a complementary way and be consistent .
Of course , people can already obtain protection for their inventions throughout Europe , but , in practice , they have to do so in all Member States , either directly through the national patent offices or indirectly through the European Patent Office , with the bundle of patents that has been mentioned .
I take the position that we must try to link these two problems together to solve them .
As such , it is our right to hold a topical and urgent debate at each regular sitting in Strasbourg .
Let me remind the House that there was a time when the United States of America , under the Clinton administration , reached agreement with North Korea on energy supply programmes .
Germany too must understand that this sort of thing is just not on ; this is a lesson that must be learned , even by the German minister of the interior .
That is going on day in and day out .
Admittedly , the United States no longer has automatic access to the data , instead having to request them from the airlines .
The PNR agreement does not afford sufficient protection of EC citizens ' right of self-determination over their personal data , and my group considers this unacceptable .
If he does so , we shall give him our full support in his further work .
For this reason , we are making consistent calls for
