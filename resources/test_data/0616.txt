the creation of new , and more , jobs .
We must debate the future Employment Strategy now and over the next few months and , as Mr Herman Schmid stated , we must arrange for the national strategies to fit in with the European strategies , for it is in this area that we can reap the considerable benefits of our combined efforts to promote employment .
Madam President , might I be permitted to emphasise that the signing of the association agreement really has signified a turning point and opened a new chapter in our relations with Algeria .
That ought also to find expression in political and social reforms .
It is primarily a question of intergovernmental relations , but the agreement also provides a framework for the commercial world and civil society .
The agreement is also of significance for the EU 's entire Mediterranean policy , and it is a further step towards setting up a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area .
The purpose of the agreement is also to promote that sub-regional cooperation between the Mediterranean partners themselves that is so important to a positive outcome of the Barcelona process .
This provision must find expression in the implementation rules for the agreement .
With regard to respect for human rights , the Council is monitoring very carefully the issues relating to respect for human rights in Algeria , and specifically within the political dialogue with Algeria that has taken place at ministerial level since 1997 .
The association agreement will now provide greater opportunities for following up this issue and for supporting the Algerian authorities in this connection .
It also provides an institutional framework for regular political dialogue at different levels , and specifically at Association Council level , concerning all subjects of common interest .
As soon as the agreement has come into force , that will apply both to the political dialogue , established in 1997 , and to the bodies concerned with the agreement , namely the Association Council and the Association Committee .
However , the Council looks favourably upon the important decision taken recently to give the Tamazight language the status of a national language .
In June 2001 , the Gothenburg European Council made it an urgent matter generally to call upon all those in responsible positions in Algeria to make efforts to bring the present confrontations and violence to an end .
It encouraged the authorities to launch a political initiative to solve the crisis with the aid of dialogue between all Algerians .
The October local elections will also be able to provide an important indication of the situation in the region .
We are supporting these by means of the Meda Regulation , providing EUR 240 million for the period 2000-2004 , and by means of the loans from the European Investment Bank , amounting to EUR 620 million since 1996 .
According to the association agreement , the Association Council can facilitate cooperation and contacts between the European Parliament and Algeria 's parliamentary institutions , as well as between the Economic and Social Committee and the corresponding body in Algeria .
We are in the process of looking into which cooperation mechanisms can be used for setting up such a Euro-Mediterranean assembly .
- ( DA ) The Commission has presented another communication on the combating of fraud .
The fact is , however , that that possibility exists already .
It is unnecessary to prepare more communications .
The Commission has only to use the 1992 directive relating to the award of public contracts , which makes it abundantly clear that it can exclude firms that have submitted false information or evaded tax from participating in the award of public contracts .
Why not use the existing legislation ?
For years , Eurostat has entered into contracts with a firm that has supplied false information .
The Commission says that it handed the matter over to OLAF as early as 1999 .
The firm , which submits incorrect figures year after year , is now on the Commission 's top-ten list of most frequently used contractors .
The Commission owes us a very good explanation .
The firm sits over there in Luxembourg and laughs at us , while the Commission issues another fatuous communication .
What signal does this send to the people of Europe ?
She was the winner of the Miss Denmark contest .
Today , she has , however , received a letter from the Miss World organisation , encouraging her to take part in the light of the fact that one of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament - and it was in actual fact yourself , Mr Imbeni - had encouraged the candidates to take part and so abstain from a boycott .
I therefore want to ask you to confirm today , or to confirm to myself as soon as possible , that the European Parliament has not come out in favour of the candidates ' participating in the Miss World contest and to confirm that we have not therefore encouraged them to participate .
I hope that I can obtain confirmation now and , if not now , then in writing in the very near future .
Mr President , I should firstly like to thank the tireless rapporteur for his work on the Charter .
I should also like to thank Commissioner Vitorino , not just for his principled support for further work on the Charter but also for pointing out that it would not be at all easy to incorporate the whole Charter into the future constitution or wherever else it is to be incorporated , the constitution 's being the most likely candidate .
What I think is important when we discuss these issues as politicians is that we constantly live in the tension between the vision and the reality .
The vision is clear enough .
The Charter is important
