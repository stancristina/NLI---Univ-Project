is worth pointing out that everything began with the fire in two train carriages on 27 February last , in which 58 people died , half of them women and children .
Urgent measures were adopted not only on the government 's own initiative but also because of strong pressure from the opposition and the Indian media .
It is being overlooked , for example , that Portugal is the Member State that has already far exceeded the objectives for reducing fishing effort , while maintaining an ageing fleet - around 40 % of its vessels are over 25 years old - and which has the lowest average yield in the European Union .
We cannot accept a purely predatory attitude as if we were still living in prehistoric times but hunting with twenty-first century technology .
Furthermore , this reform is too brutal and is being attacked by those it affects .
That is why we have reservations and are protesting .
My second major criticism is about a fundamental issue that affects all these proposals , and which relates to the way in which the various countries have complied with the objectives laid down in the multiannual guidance programmes , the MAGPs .
The issue of the sustainability of resources is very serious , but it should not be used as an excuse for doing things hastily and giving insufficient weight to human and social aspects , and above all imposing an unfair balance .
For that reason it deserves our support , regardless of any changes that may still be made with a view to achieving a better overall balance of all the parties involved , but at the same time recognising that Parliament is currently being consulted on this .
Nevertheless , we can and must accept that the entry into force of the localisation provisions should be deferred for a reasonable period , and I regard such a deferral as being very much a question of positive discrimination for small and medium-sized enterprises .
I want to draw your attention to the fact that the assessment report clearly stresses that the European Commission is most probably the most active institution in promoting the concrete implementation of the strategic partnership between the European Union , Latin America and the Caribbean launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1999 .
Firstly , we were able to successfully complete the European Union-Chile negotiations in due time to allow Mr Prodi , Mr Aznar and Mr Lagos to announce the official conclusion of the negotiations and the establishment of our much awaited association agreement .
It was also decided to strengthen cooperation on trade , investment and economic relations .
Certainly the Spanish Presidency 's hard work played a key role in ensuring the success of the summit .
Finally , we look forward to working with Member States and coordinating our initiatives with theirs in order to better implement the bi-regional partnership .
So this proposal , as presented to us , suggests an increasing lack of rationality and a growing incoherence of systems in a field of Community action which is in its infancy .
So let us say that I am allowed to speak because I have to leave for the front .
It also directly follows up to the Tampere Conclusions 43 and 45 on the subject .
If Europol were to be established today , it would probably be based on a Council decision , this being the modern legal instrument .
We have some misgivings with the proposal to have representatives of Parliament on Europol 's management board .
With respect to police studies , the Commission has on different occasions underlined its interest in advancing cooperation in an area in which knowledge at European level is often insufficient .
The Commission has pointed out on several occasions that even though it would be positive to establish contacts between the responsible authorities dealing with private security in the Member States , it should be underlined that , according to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice , private security is a service as any other service .
An important point made by the rapporteur , Lord Stockton , and shared by the Commission , is that the network should not be competent to harmonise Member States legislation and regulations .
In addition to drug trafficking and its initial powers , we have given it additional powers relating to trafficking in human beings , terrorism , money laundering , forging money and means of payment , as well as all kinds of serious international crime .
We therefore support the proposal put forward by the rapporteur , Mr Deprez , that this initiative should be withdrawn and that a new proposal should be presented with a view to replacing the convention by means of a Council decision under Article 34 , which would make it possible to integrate Europol into the third pillar and accordingly into the institutional framework of the European Union , as has been repeatedly requested by the European Parliament .
This exemption regulation is now shortly due to expire and preparations are being made for liberalisation , with a transitional period of just one year .
That is why we are not supporting this report .
That is why we abstained .
However , it is important that this modulation should be at Community level , setting maximum support levels and with the possibility of increasing support for small and medium-sized farms and for family farms , because this is the only way we can restore the balance of support under the CAP between countries , producers and types of production , which is crucial when it comes to fighting the injustice that is prevalent , particularly in Portugal .
We are therefore calling for the revision of the OECD agreement and the restoration of the Community preference for shipbuilding , so as to encourage Member States to purchase vessels built in European shipyards
