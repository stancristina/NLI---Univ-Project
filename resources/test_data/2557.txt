that arise from the enlargement process , and naturally that will apply to human resources implications of the ongoing change .
Issues such as the management of the increased cultural diversity within the Commission and an early retirement scheme that is directly linked to enlargement will , for instance , be amongst those that receive particular attention .
As with past enlargements , specific measures concerning the appointment and integration of officials from the new Member States will be adopted at the appropriate time .
Mr President , the honourable Member 's approach to these and many other matters is I know extremely constructive .
What I know on the basis of precedent , and also the Commission 's assessment of the scope and the depth of the challenges that arise from the forthcoming enlargement , is that appropriate measures will be taken at the right time not only in terms of the recruitment and integration of properly skilled staff from the new Member States but also to assist with the preparation of other areas of expertise - presumably including the Scientific and other committees .
To some extent , of course , the process will be assisted by the fact that the international science community inside and outside the European Union is genuinely international .
In addition to relying upon those casual professional relationships , I am sure that the Commission will want to ensure that there is continuity and access provided for those new incoming Member States not only in areas like those that he has mentioned - veterinary and plant health - but in many other areas where the smoothest possible integration of efforts is a matter of crucial and mutual importance .
Thank you Mr President .
As the honourable Member who raised the question will know , in accordance with the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance , each contracting party may assign means of inspection and inspectors to the NAFO scheme and NAFO inspectors may inspect any fishing vessel flying the flag of a contracting party .
NAFO inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the NAFO scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them .
Against that background , on 23 April two Canadian NAFO inspectors accompanied by a trainee carried out an inspection of the Community fishing vessel Santa Mafalda which was operating at that time in the NAFO regulatory area .
The Canadian inspectors in question and the surveillance vessel from which the inspection was carried out are assigned to the NAFO scheme .
Their inspection was carried out under its auspices .
Having been informed by the Canadians , inspectors of the Commission boarded the Santa Mafalda to verify the grounds on which the Canadian inspectors based their citation of a serious infringement .
In conducting this verification the Commission inspectors ensured the security and continuity of the evidence on board and transmitted their report to the Portuguese authorities .
Those authorities in turn ordered the Santa Mafalda to the port of Aveiro in Portugal for a thorough inspection .
The Santa Mafalda arrived in Aveiro on 10 May 2000 and two Commission inspectors participated in a thorough inspection of the vessel .
The Commission has drawn the attention of the Canadian authorities to the procedures followed by the Canadian inspectors in relation to their seizure of documentation and their continued stay on board the Santa Mafalda .
The Commission takes the view that the Canadian NAFO inspectors in question acted in breach of the NAFO scheme by taking away documents from the vessel without the permission of the master and by continuing to stay on board the vessel .
However , it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the Portuguese authorities did not oppose the prolonged stay of the Canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the Santa Mafalda were not obstructed .
Mr President , I am grateful to the honourable lady .
The only way in which we can actually ensure the proper maintenance of an international convention which has the effect of law is to demand on all occasions that the procedures required under the law are fulfilled properly in a balanced but a completely full way .
That is the position being taken by the Commission which is why I drew attention to the fact that the Commissioners have already reached the conclusion that the Canadian inspectors actually acted in breach of the scheme by taking documents without the sight of the master and by virtue , maybe , of their very prolonged stay on board that vessel .
The Portuguese authorities , as the honourable lady will know because of her interest , are now undertaking a full investigation and it would therefore not be proper for the Commission to communicate opinions beyond those I have already offered , but she can be absolutely certain that the Commission and its inspectors together with the Member States are vigilant in sustaining the proper rights of all vessels on the high seas .
Mr President , I will draw the honourable Member 's remarks to the attention of my colleague , Mr Fischler , and I know that they will be of interest to him .
He summarises the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the Portuguese authorities are reaching their conclusions .
It would not be proper publicly to pursue the matter further , but when the report of that inspection and the assessment by the Portuguese authorities are available , I am certain that they will be communicated to interested Members including , of course , the chairman of Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries and I am certain the honourable lady whose interest is manifest .
