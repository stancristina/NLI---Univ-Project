And as we move ever closer towards electronic money , even the comfort of a credit card billing address will no longer be available to e-businesses as they try to ascertain whether they should charge VAT to a particular customer or not .
The amount of revenue about which we are talking is very small at the moment .
There is no need to rush into this legislation .
We are talking about the future of Europe 's economy , the future of its e-economy , let us take the time to get this proposal right .
I would call upon the Commission to rethink the proposal and to think of an alternative way .
The preferable option by far is to zero rate European e-businesses to put them on the same playing-field as American and other businesses around the world .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his speedy work on this report on VAT and e-commerce .
I think the comments I have heard around the floor today would almost suggest that we do not need this kind of report , but of course we do .
It is tempting for us always to compare ourselves with the USA and to say that because they cannot find a satisfactory solution , we should not either .
But the fact is that VAT on goods and services applies across the European Union .
This is a tax which already exists .
It is not a new tax and it should be applied .
It should be applied to the Internet at well .
Otherwise , what would happen ?
Well of course the issue of unfair competition has already been mentioned .
Why should the retail industry be so badly affected and be made to suffer in order for another industry to grow ?
If indeed it can be affected that way by what the proposal suggests , and I doubt that .
Furthermore , this proposal is in line , as I see it , with the principles agreed at Ecofin , which in turn are in line with the agreed principles of the OECD Conference in Ottawa .
The source where the tax should apply is a matter of concern , and the discussion around the number of countries which would qualify to have companies registered in them is something which I believe will be burdensome and of course provoke the USA to a complaint in the WTO .
But I do not believe that e-commerce is going to be crushed by VAT being suddenly applied like some evil giant .
I think that the real problem is that EU retail industries will continue to suffer the disadvantages that they are currently suffering .
It is amusing to hear some of the comments being made around this Chamber today but it is quite clearly also amusing to remember that the kind of cashless society that perhaps the likes of Trotters Independent Trading Company in the UK were involved in is the kind of society that is being advocated by some over on the other side of the House .
Are we going to end up with that kind of cashless society , with cowboy e-commerce outfits being able to do what they want ?
I do not think so .
That is not how we are meant to organise society , and that is why I think this proposal is an excellent one .
Mr President , I would like to warmly welcome the report on aviation fuel tax because it addresses head-on the fact that aviation is the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and that far from discouraging these emissions , the current exemption of aviation from a fuel tax actually promotes and artificially stimulates the aviation sector and the environmental damage that goes with it .
I particularly welcome the fact that the report reinforces one of the key points that I made in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism which this Parliament voted on a few months ago , namely , that since it is undoubtedly politically difficult to achieve international agreement on an aviation tax , at least in a short term , we should look at alternative tools to achieve the same effect , including an emissions charge .
Such a charge could be levied on all flights coming into or going out of EU airports , on all carriers , and plenty of research has been done to show that this would not have negative competitive effects .
It could be agreed very swiftly without requiring international consensus , and could help make significant progress towards internalising environmental costs .
The importance of moving ahead on this issue swiftly is very clear .
The forecasts for the global growth of aviation are terrifying .
Official figures suggest a doubling of passenger numbers in just fifteen or twenty years , and if you look at what that means in UK terms alone , in order to meet that scale of demand we would be needing an extra four new Heathrow Airports or an extra eight new Gatwick Airports .
That would clearly be both politically and environmentally unacceptable .
So , instead of trying to meet projected demand we need to try to manage and reduce that demand by ensuring that the price of aviation more accurately reflects its environmental cost .
When air tickets are 42 % cheaper today than they were ten years ago , it is clear that the wrong price signals are being given out .
It makes no sense at all that I can travel from London to Brussels return for just Â£89 by Virgin Airways , for example , yet when I use Eurostar , which produces far fewer greenhouse gases and is a much more pleasant way to travel , I have to pay the equivalent of around
