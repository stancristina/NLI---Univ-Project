Although the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled in 1996 that the Community could not sign the European Convention on Human Rights , I must emphasise that it made such a ruling because there was no legal basis in the Treaties for the Community to do so .
Furthermore , I recommend that you carefully read the contribution of the observer representing the European Court of Human Rights in the Convention responsible for drafting the Union ' s Charter of Fundamental Rights .
However , the Commission would like to see rights drafted on the basis of the European Convention on Human Rights , whenever necessary , made innovative , to the extent that they update the 1950 drafting of the Rome Convention and respond to the new challenges of human rights as well as those resulting from information technology , bioethics , gender equality , as part of the fight against all forms of discrimination , and paying close attention to environmental protection .
Setting emission limits for the four main pollutants is a sure way to help to reduce pollution , combat acidification and limit the harmful effects of these pollutants on human health and on plant life .
All of this seems quite reasonable .
In other words , the Portuguese sites that already form part of the Natura 2000 network are completely at the mercy of unscrupulous groups of financiers and construction companies , because of the lack of instruments to protect them .
- ( PT ) Mr President , following the words of my colleagues which prove how necessary the resolution we are discussing actually is , I should like to use my speaking time to condemn two particularly damaging cases which affect my country , Galicia , but which could equally be taking place in other European countries .
It is worth remembering that these international legal instruments were established during the period immediately after the Second World War and at that time reflected the major concerns felt at international level following the devastating effects of that conflict .
And it is not unusual for civilians to be the particular target of military action , either in the form of terrorism or as an instrument of political pressure .
In this context , I would particularly like to draw attention to the International Committee of the Red Cross , whose reports demonstrate that specific action is needed to improve the way in which the Geneva Conventions are applied .
We are aware that in many cases we have not achieved everything we might wish , but we firmly intend to continue in future with the same determination .
These people must start to realise that the world is no longer a place where impunity is the rule .
One of these is the issue of water .
The second point that I would like to mention today , very briefly , is the situation in Angola .
.
Furthermore , it is clear that there is still no reliable method for testing the quantity of such fats used in chocolate production , whilst there is no requirement for clear , compulsory labelling which would , as a minimum , allow consumers to distinguish real chocolate , which only uses cocoa butter , from chocolate whose ingredients include other fats .
Establishes stricter limit values for emissions , in particular those of carbon oxides and particulates . 2.
Makes continuous sampling of dioxins a compulsory requirement in incineration and co-incineration processes . 8.
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , once again we are devoting part of our time in this Chamber to one of the most honourable aspects of our parliamentary work : the defence of human rights of all kinds and in all parts of the world .

In some cases there has been agreement with the form but probably not with the content .
As the Portuguese Presidency , that is the Portuguese Prime Minister , acted as a channel for the position that 14 countries of the European Union expressed as regards their bilateral relations with Austria , I would like to be very clear about the following point : we do not have any criticism to make about how Austria has behaved at international level , and in particular about how Austria has fulfilled its duties and obligations within the European Union .

When we advocate the need for political life in Austria to be in accordance with the values and principles promoted by the European Union , and which Austria has also undertaken to promote at European Union level , we are not trying to interfere in Member States ' internal affairs .
And although we may all say that we oppose xenophobia , I am not sure if we can all agree on active steps to integrate foreign citizens into the European Union and accept measures to protect the interests of foreign citizens within the European Union .
This is a task not just for governments , but also for non-governmental organisations , for social lobbies and for political lobbies .
