builders and protagonists of change .
Moreover , Parliament is neither kept formally informed nor consulted regarding fundamental documents .
At the same time , we Members of the Bonino List feel that we must not go too far and introduce extreme regulations allowing indiscriminate access to information or opinions which are of no decision-making import .
Furthermore , I feel that , as the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have requested , we also need to endeavour to outline clearly the institutional and bureaucratic stages in the process , defining the responsibilities which - rightly - still lie with the institutions , therefore without separating the different responsibilities within the organisation .
Indeed , I hope and call for an analysis to be carried out immediately of all the cattle carcasses which have been placed on the market in butchers ' shops throughout the European Union , in order to discover whether they are infected with BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) .
A check must be carried out on all the carcasses immediately , whatever the cost , for otherwise beef and veal sales will fall below zero .
It is , nevertheless , necessary for the Commission to ban the use of meat-and-bone meal henceforth and to provide for - as far as is known - safer procedures to destroy the parts considered dangerous such as the brain and bone marrow .
To restore the confidence of the citizens as well as protect their health , it is vital that the Union speeds up its decision-making , defining common rules on the matter and placing the scientific and control bodies in operation as soon as possible to monitor food safety .
For if these companies pollute the air outside , I hate to think about the state of the air inside the factories !
I am extremely disappointed and I hope that you will vote differently next time .
The cold winter days and nights of both northern and southern Europe come to mind , where , sadly , many elderly people are forced by their low income to turn off the heating to save money .
And given the remarkable scale of the disaster , the request made in the resolution which we tabled together with other groups is totally justified , despite the fact that these issues have been debated recently in this House - on 26 October to be precise - and that a Parliamentary resolution was adopted on that occasion as well .
There was a large crowd of pensioners and elderly people and they said to me : " Mr Fatuzzo , we were not able to vote for your Pensioners ' Party because , as you see , we are here in the afterlife .
When I tabled two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competition , I received clear , detailed replies .
Mr President , this is not a question - clearly the matter does not fall within Commissioner Solbes ' remit - but I take note of the statement that the examination scripts will be available as of July 2002 .
( IT ) I voted for the Villiers report on the own funds of banks , for it is imperative for Directive 89/299/EEC , which regulated the matter a good 11 years ago , to be updated and supplemented .
Mr President , this is a film which we have already seen once and which we did not enjoy .
On the other hand , we fail to understand the position of the Socialist Members .
I did not give an explanation of vote on the previous report , Mr Posselt 's report , because , with all the will in the world , I did not dream of Mr Posselt last night but of Mrs Banotti , and I was enjoying it so much that I slept deeply , so deeply that I arrived late this morning .
First , then , a new treaty .
In particular , in our written opinion at the end of January , we established the minimum degree of ambition necessary to secure a successful outcome for the Conference .
I am now pleased to say that the negotiators are close to an agreement on the provisions governing , for example , closer cooperation , the Court of Justice , the democratic values of Article 7 and deepening the involvement of European political parties in the democratic life of our Member States and institutions .
However , there is one issue on which our lack of progress causes me great concern , and in the view of both our institutions , it is the single most important issue facing us as we prepare for enlargement .
And I shall say so loud and clear to the Heads of States and Government at Nice .
The situation is then made even worse on those occasions when one of the Member States places conditions , sometimes financial conditions , on its assent .
The Commission will answer that question frankly and directly .
I would stress that this in no way detracts from the fact that , for the Member States concerned , NATO remains the basis of the collective defence of its members and will continue to play an important role in crisis management .
For example , almost all our external aid programmes are geared to supporting democracy and stability .
For now , let us look to the immediate future under the French Presidency and focus on the priority of bringing Nice to a conclusion and paving the way to enlargement .
Over qualified majority voting and weighting , there will , in all probability , be vetos from all sides which will paralyse the demands of Parliament and the public for a move towards democratisation of our system , towards making majority voting the general rule
