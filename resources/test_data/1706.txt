The introduction of a vaccination would , of course , affect the export of these foodstuffs .
This extremely small increase is explained by a reduction of approximately 2 % in the volume of expenditure laid down for the European Union of 15 .
It is important to remember that , as early as 1991 , the Council specified this legal basis in respect of the three proposals for regulations it presented at that time , on a European Cooperative Society , a European association and a European mutual society respectively , as well in respect of the original proposal on the European company .
With the proposed amendments , which I hope will be adopted tomorrow and taken into consideration by the Commission and the Council , the European Parliament is enhancing the proposal , introducing into the regulation the changes necessary to harmonise the statute and the provisions of the Directive on Worker Involvement .
Did you hear anything in that line ?
This is not an Islamic country , it is not a question of tradition ; it is a secular country where women , for better or worse - ' Mrs Anthrax ' being a prime example - used to play leading roles .
The European Union must do its part , promoting reconstruction and economic aid , the reestablishment of democracy and the access for Iraq to its own resources .
Europe is sending a specific request for much greater involvement in the immediate term .
Mr President , the success of the US operation in Iraq and the speed with which the objective of liberating the country from the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein was achieved , with a relatively low toll of victims , are confirmation of what many had thought , namely that the war was going to be the least difficult part of this operation .
We in Parliament must endeavour to be the friends of both as well .
I genuinely hope that the majority of Parliament will be of the opinion that it is possible to lodge an appeal of this kind .
What will happen in the event of conflict between the Rome Statute , in particular the obligation to cooperate with the Criminal Court , and the EU-US extradition agreement ?
I wanted to say to you , Mr President , that you have said very little about the Criminal Court .
I also wanted to say to the House that it is , in any case , important to take account of the extradition provided for by the Rome Statute .
The rules and criteria adopted will therefore serve as useful benchmarks for similar agreements with many other third countries , and that is another reason why they must be considered carefully .
We must therefore remedy these shortcomings , and the agreement will then be a model for European Union cooperation with third countries to combat international crime , with due regard for the fundamental rights which the Union acknowledges all human beings to have .
For precisely this reason , in the initial debate which took place in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , the need emerged to provide a single framework for a broad strategy which is also practical enough to propose policies for today , not for an unspecified time in the future which we are unable to foresee at this present moment but for which we can and must pave the way .
What can the countries of such a diverse area have in common ?
One of the primary objectives of the new reunified Europe , with its 25 Member States , will have to be the achievement of a preferential relationship with these neighbouring countries of both Eastern Europe , Russia and Asia , such as Kazakhstan , and those which make up the Middle East region and lie on the Mediterranean Basin .
The Conference of Versailles gave a number of European powers the task of assisting the birth of the new democracies .
Our Cooperation Committee - for which I have appointed myself spokesman - was impressed by the intrinsic feeling displayed by the three countries - Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan - of historically being part of Europe .
Lastly , I had to mention the southern Mediterranean , which is of particular interest to a country such as Italy , almost all of whose territory borders on the Mediterranean Sea and which is thus a natural bridge linking the European Union and the countries of the southern Mediterranean .
For once , at least the Council spoke a little about Chechnya , but I feel that the Council is deluding itself and I would even go so far as to say that it is lying to itself .
From time to time , he rebels and draws up a report , which you mentioned , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , in which he speaks about the daily policy of terror implemented by the Russian authorities in Chechnya .
That is what makes it impossible to break the circle of terror , which , every day , as Mr Belder and Mrs Schroedter said , pushes young Chechens to despair , young people who have seen their parents , brothers and cousins killed in Grozny or in other towns in Chechnya , kidnapped and raped by the Russian forces .
Moreover , the goal of achieving the strategy laid down in Lisbon in 2000 and the related structural reforms by 2010 has been included in what seems as yet to be a rather ill-defined fashion .
Let this be understood - and we must shout it out loud and clear - there are going to be generations of poor pensioners in Europe and we are not doing anything about it because we do not want
