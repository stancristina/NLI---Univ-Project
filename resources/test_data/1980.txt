( The President cut the speaker off )
I received its reply today .
On the other hand , however , he raises the question of compliance with the law .
The principle introduced for personal data resulted in a decision whereby the reference to a person ' s religion was an infringement of personal data .
It feels that Turkey can proceed unimpeded on its path towards the European Union , violating Greek sovereignty all the while .
But that is a matter for the Greek government .
Mr President-in-Office , I should like to be a little more specific .
My question is quite specific .
And I should like to ask you what additional measures you feel need to be taken and extended , as you have just said ?
Mr President , about four or five years ago , former Commissioner Christos Papoutsis told me at a meeting that he was considering some sort of attempt to regulate late payments .
Approximately half a million workers lost their jobs and one in four companies went bust because bigger and stronger companies got away with not paying them on time .
It is a bitter pill to swallow .
And , of course , I must thank the SMEs and Parliament and the Executive Commission , which also helped to achieve this result , and it is a good result .
( EL ) Workers cannot and must not be under any illusions here .
This summit will strengthen measures to safeguard the "internal security " of capitalism by steering and crushing the grassroots movement when the EU Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the EU.
Further dismantling of the social rights of workers , starting with the right to social security , is on the agenda of the Feira Summit .
I should like to use the short time available to me to stress how important it is to uphold the principle of additionality and express the view that , despite the development over time of verification methods , it is impossible to compare Member States on this issue , due to the lack of a common methodology .
Thus , we cannot logically adopt a proposal to impose sanctions in cases of non-compliance with this principle until a legal base has been adopted and a common methodology agreed .
Only when it came to monitoring interventions was 1998 a poor year .
Not only have we failed to achieve the main purpose of the Structural Funds , i .e . to help reduce regional disparities and achieve economic and social cohesion ; in numerous cases , the situation has worsened and the gulf between the regions lagging behind and the developed areas has widened both in rural areas , especially island and mountain regions , and also in urban areas , which are plagued by mass and long-term unemployment , poverty , and a scarcity , or in many cases , a total lack of basic infrastructures .
In fact , the Structural Funds have , on numerous occasions , been used as a means of eroding cohesion and fostering asymmetric development .
The scarcity of resources under the Damoclean sword of Agenda 2000 and persistent cutbacks in order to satisfy other requirements , such as enlargement , do nothing to strengthen cohesion or stabilize development levels ; on the contrary , they help set further socio-economic degeneration of the regions in motion .
The UN High Commissioner and the OSCE have condemned the fact that , one year on from the arrival of the KFOR forces in the area , the minorities living in Kosovo , mainly Serbs and Gypsies , are still unprotected .
Will we , as the European Parliament , ever be able to assume our responsibilities and understand that , while we talk of rights and democracy in certain regions , while we subsidize intervention in local elections in Montenegro and while we support the embargo on Iraq , condemning hundreds of thousands of children to death , we have no credibility whatsoever ?
The asylum issue is a major political issue concerning fundamental democratic rights , the safeguarding of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual and the preservation of human dignity .
We must respect and strengthen all the provisions on protecting and granting asylum to individuals or groups being persecuted in their countries by government , quasi-government or other groups on ideological , philosophical , political , religious , racial , cultural or other grounds by giving them guarantees and a dignified reception and living conditions .
We would like to highlight and draw attention to the fact that formulating even more harmonized criteria for granting asylum by gradually and effectively moving away from those laid down in the Geneva Convention and essentially replacing them with regulations such as those mentioned in the report , may have a negative and repressive impact .
We must , of course , stress that the environmental aid granted continues to concentrate on the water sector , despite the need in many other cases for other measures to preserve , protect and improve the quality of the environment and the rational utilization of natural resources as laid down in Article 174 of the Treaty , which refers to reafforestation , land reclamation , etc .
The fact that it has so far worked highly effectively should be enough to convince us of the need to continue funding to recipient countries , provided they need continuing support and depending , aside from the nominal convergence of the economies of Member States , on real convergence of both the incomes and , more generally , the quality of life of European citizens in their regions .
Mr President , the scourge of drugs and the action taken to combat it know no geographical , social or national boundaries .
Consequently , any attempt to study this phenomenon must not be contained
