people , who will be dismissed and then , once they have been retrained , will be recruited as cheap workers in new professions .
We consider that the Member States of the Union can develop education and lifelong learning without it being coloured by speculation and unilateral adherence to the so-called needs of the market and to competitiveness .
Encouraging the teaching and learning of two foreign languages and increasing grants for participants with disabilities and the learning and use of sign language are fundamental proposals by the rapporteur , Doris Pack .
They not only have contributed to the modernisation of education and training systems , but also are contributing more than anything else to the strengthening of exchanges between young people in particular , helping them to come into direct contact with the language , culture and education of other countries of Europe .
That is why it is extremely important for these programmes to be extended to as many more young and , more importantly , less privileged people as possible .
It is therefore necessary for the budget to be increased , in order to respond to the aspirations of European citizens , and for us to put the ambitious objectives of the Lisbon Strategy into practice .     . – Mr President , through the continuing Youth in Action programme , the European Union is trying to nanny young people , to create the illusion that it is interested in their participation in policy and to turn them into passive recipients and applauders of its anti-grass roots policy , which also creates impasses for young people .
The programme finances actions which will promote the so-called values of the European Union ; in other words , the creation of disenfranchised workers and scientists , so that maximum profit can be returned to big business .
The way to combat the problems of young people is in organised struggle , in quarrelling with the policy of the European Union and the European Union itself , in order to pave the way at national and international level for deep changes and reversals for the benefit of the peoples .     – Mr President , Commissioner , the Culture 2007 programme is the main means for implementing Community action in the field of culture .
Consequently we , as the European Parliament , must propose a specific amount in the budget .
Our rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , who has done an excellent job , is well versed in this subject and his report takes account of the needs of small cultural agencies and , by extension , of small countries .     . – Mr President , the report by Mrs Hieronymi on the proposed programme of support for the European audiovisual sector provides an opportunity for a brief but systematic diagnosis of the state of the European audiovisual market , on which small companies on fragmented national markets prevail , with little cross-border movement .
At the same time , investments under the programme in the stage before and after production will help to overcome the weaknesses of small national markets , in order to maintain and strengthen the cultural wealth in small countries such as my homeland .
European cinema productions are being made within the framework of one state , resulting of course in a cultural and linguistic diversity in cinema productions .
It is primarily cultural .
One of the main objectives of the proposed new regulation on shipments of waste is to ensure that the European Union aligns with international requirements for shipments of waste , both at OECD and United Nations level , in other words with the Basel Convention .
At first reading , the Commission amended the proposal and approved 43 of the 103 amendments proposed by the European Parliament in full , in part or in principle .
We need this new regulation in order to improve the clarity and application of the rules governing shipments of waste and in order to achieve compliance with the European Union 's international commitments .
The Commission considers that 74 of these are acceptable in full or in principle , but is unable to accept 16 of the amendments .
The free movement of waste for recovery has already been established in the existing regulation on shipments of waste , the provisions of the Treaty of the European Communities on the free movement of goods and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
The changes which the Council 's common position proposes would create serious obstacles to the internal recycling market and are not acceptable to the Commission .
Such objections can only be raised up to the day on which specific Community legislation enters into force and no later than four years after the present regulation enters into force .
Fluorinated gases are very strong greenhouse gases .
The Commission proposal on fluorinated gases was debated in the Council during the Irish and Dutch Presidencies and it soon became clear that it would have to be reformulated to some degree .
The change in form also reflects Parliament 's wish to address the question of MAC systems through type approval legislation .
Recent reports show that several Member States will need additional measures to achieve the objectives to which they have committed .
However , this has not been done for the new bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment .
The Commission has also accepted certain amendments in the common position , such as the new article on labelling , which goes far beyond its original proposal , and such as the article on the review of the regulation , which has been considerably strengthened and is now more specific .
I hope that we shall manage to complete the procedure on the present matter as quickly as possible
