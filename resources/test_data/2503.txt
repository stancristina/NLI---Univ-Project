the fact that the Kurds cannot agree among themselves , urges the Council of Ministers and the Commission to arrive at a common position on the conflict and suggests that they should put themselves forward as possible mediators between the Kurdish parties the PUK and the KDP.
We Liberals are glad that there is at least one party which dares to and can act .
Now Parliament is asking the Council of Ministers to try again .
Mr President , Parliament 's four conditions for acceptance of a customs union with Turkey were as follows : demands for greater protection of human rights , the peaceful resolution of the Kurdish question , constitutional reforms and democratisation , and the resolution of the Cyprus question .
Rather than improve , the situation has in fact deteriorated .
Villages have been cleared of inhabitants and burned down .
The government has not taken up the opportunity for a ceasefire proposed by the Kurds in order to reach a peaceful settlement .
Political prisoners , including members of parliament , are still in Turkish prisons , among them Leyla Zana .
Nor has there been any progress on the Cyprus question - rather the opposite .
The European Parliament must obviously call for a peaceful solution to the Cyprus question in accordance with the UN Security Council resolution .
Recent developments show that democracy cannot be achieved through leniency .
Mr President , alcohol is part of our social culture .
The European ministers of health back this programme .
High prices for spirits reduce drinking .
You do not distort the market by drinking less alcohol .
The World Health Organisation report entitled ' Alcohol Policy and the Public Good ' , for example , is based on over 700 scientific studies .
I believe the background to the attack on Nordic alcohol taxes is a very cynical one .
Lower taxes on alcohol may lead to more drinking and thus increase markets .
Each and every one may have its own model .
Mr President , I would like to take up part of the Von Wogau report , the part that speaks of the beneficial health effects of alcohol and wine in particular .
It is perfectly true and medically correct that in small quantities alcohol can be useful to certain people in certain situations .
That harm greatly exceeds the positive effects on health which some may experience .
The conclusions are completely unanimous .
It is the quantity of alcohol that counts .
Nevertheless , it would never occur to us to classify aquavit as a foodstuff .
This should be done bearing in mind the interests of users .
Disputes should in the first instance be resolved among service providers at national level , and a system of comparison should be established jointly by the various national regulatory authorities .
I nevertheless deplore the lack of balance in the resolution .
I regard this as a lack of balance .
It goes without saying that strong condemnation of the Iraqi forces ' actions in Kurdistan was appropriate but at the same time there should also be some criticism of the US intervention .
I myself have had the opportunity of visiting Iraq a number of times while Saddam Hussein has been in power and in comparison with most other dictatorships I have visited Iraq is still a special case .
Madam President , on the whole I consider this to be a good report .
After the end of the Cold War cooperation around the Baltic increased enormously more or less spontaneously .
Several of the countries concerned have membership of the EU as their objective .
We must also ask whether the European Union suits them .
This need is at risk of colliding with the EU 's plans for militarisation , for military powers etc .
The first concerns how extremely important it is that we achieve a pan-European security system which includes Russia .
Measures must also be taken to deal with the disastrous situation involving military nuclear waste on the Kola peninsula which I believe presents the greatest threat to Europe 's common future .
Consequently , the principle must be that one should take account of their natural behaviour , their need for space , and ensure that they can behave as herd animals .
What in fact is it that is persuading people not to eat this kind of meat these days ?
The issue today concerns working vigorously to ensure that everyone signs the OECD agreement on ending support for the shipbuilding industry .
It is regrettable that there has not been a clear ratification procedure in the USA and that the Commission is proposing that the EU should also continue to provide aid for shipbuilding pending US ratification , though not beyond the end of 1998 .
Obviously this support is something which should be abolished as it distorts competition .
I think it is important that we take seriously this concern and these signals which are now coming from the citizens of Europe .
May I begin by thanking the Commission for the detailed and , as I see it , very positive answer on the whole .
The continuous building of cartels between various national airlines is a further example .
This is a difficult problem for those of us living in Scandinavia - I myself come from Sweden .
I would like to see an addition to the answer .
I know that one of the projects is included and the other is not .
More however , could be done .
Thank you for your answer .
It was almost impossible because of the congestion on the railways and it was also very expensive .
Therefore , the company could not currently use the railways even though it would like to .
If the railways do not soon become competitive they will not survive
