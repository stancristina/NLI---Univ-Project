The crisis in Sierra Leone has resulted in de facto suspension of all aid programmes in the country .
Having said that , I must say that the contacts I had personally with the Prime Minister of Guinea Conakry in this regard leaves no doubt that the countries of the region are fully engaged - not just Nigeria - in trying to prevent this coup d 'Ã©tat from being a success .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , once again this Parliament is dealing with East Timor since there is still military occupation , since there is no let up in oppression and human rights are daily trodden underfoot in that territory which is still not decolonized .
Therefore in supporting , underwriting and voting for this motion for a resolution , fruit of our initiative , we wish to stress that in our view it fails to point out the fact that resistance has not ended in East Timor and that , although there is less repression nowadays than there was , it is meted out with great violence against those suspected by the occupying force of perpetrating this resistance .
With a resolution passed a month ago the European Parliament became the forerunner in a great series of statements by the international community horrified at the manipulation of the elections in Indonesia and condemning the repeated violations of human rights , in particular in the occupied territory of East Timor , the last of them passed by the United States House of Representatives roundly condemning violations of human rights against the people of East Timor .
As regards the motions for resolutions on the abolition of the death penalty , I must confirm that the Commission , having been greatly impressed by the questions presented , regards it as essential to respect the guarantees embodied in the International Charter on Civil and Political Rights and on Optional Protocol No 2 seeking to abolish the death penalty and Protocol No 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
I should also like to point out , in the same spirit , that we are still continuing to support a strengthening of the Colombian judicial institutions .
The Commission hopes , finally , that the accession of Myanmar as a full member of the ASEAN will help to make human rights and democratic principles more constant and more continuous .
So , ladies and gentlemen , there is no guarantee that this question of human rights and the situation of democracy in Myanmar will be included in the talks between the European Union and ASEAN.
Considerable progress has been noted as regards the peaceful integration of Eastern Slovenia into Croatia .
Various examples of very constructive initiatives taken by the Russian authorities could be mentioned ; however those centres are faced with an extremely difficult budgetary situation .
Well done !
But as spokesman in this case for the Socialist group , I should like to express our overall support for the joint motion for a resolution .
He is in permanent contact with the Union 's ambassadors in the country and I think that we are helping to ease the mediation referred to in the motion for a resolution .
We support the resolution .
I think that the Voluntary Service should be targeted on long-term projects so that the experience is sufficiently impressive and lasting .
That said , since in Amsterdam we are going to be debating important questions for the future of the European Union , I hope that this report can be considered by our Heads of State and Government as a useful contribution to a major debate on the European Union 's competences .
What is the role of the public institutions compared with NGOs ?
Those are just some aspects which , in my opinion , the Commission should take seriously when looking at sport in the future .
The task force will have an extremely difficult role to play .
In this context I should like to point out to Parliament that during discussions in the Council on the Commission proposals for the restructuring of the system for the taxation of energy products , the Commission will take the opportunity to come back again on the whole issue of the treatment of derogations and seek , through the introduction of a new procedure , a situation whereby no derogations exist for an indefinite period .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , basically what is known as the information society is the result of an objective process in the technology revolution which is unfolding , chiefly at the level of information and communication techniques .
In fact , it seems clear to us , that with the way it is being built , the information society is exacerbating and accentuating these chasms by creating a divide between those with access and those who are far from having access or who are excluded .
They know that there has not been sufficient control in Europe .
To be competitive ?
In any case I am even more shocked to see what the World Trade Organization panel is doing .
I hope that the Commission has the courage to tackle this problem and to rout the illegal designs of the United States .
That is what this report sets out to do .
These facts show that , contrary to what some people would like to lead us to believe , these funds made available to the four cohesion countries are highly suited to being taken up in a regular and transparent manner and that the projects submitted for funding are well presented .
On the other hand , bearing in mind that the Cohesion Fund was not set up for the specific purpose of creating employment , the report recommends that an assessment should be made of the socio-economic impact of the Fund with the intention of publishing commissioned studies to show the direct
