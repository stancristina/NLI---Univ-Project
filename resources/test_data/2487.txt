's internal control structure and monitoring mechanisms .
Finally , with regard to the budget : it is now up to the Commission to establish specific action plans and time scales for at long last bringing the development funds into the general budget .
My report on the development funds is only part of the overall discharge procedure .
In this connection , I am surprised that the rate of reform in the Commission seems to be declining in certain areas .
In view of many of the figures that we are discussing , it is essential that we have a reliable accounting system .
That is not the case at present .
We may ask whether the same thing is in the process of happening to this Commission .
A lot remains to be desired , and I must say that Mr Prodi 's wish for five more years as President of the Commission represents excessive optimism .
Mr President , firstly I would like to say a few words concerning the discharge of the Commission .
We all know that there are problems with the Commission 's accounting and computer systems .
It is no secret that the Commission should have done something about the problem long ago .
Postponing discharge until October would not change anything .
It would be much more efficient to appoint external experts to assess the proposed reform and for Parliament to keep holding the Commission to its timetable .
The Commission should also be granted discharge on time due to its admissions in the Eurostat case .
Eurostat has entered into contracts with companies that have pulled the wool over its eyes and defrauded it .
I think we should reward it for that .
It will now at last send a signal to other companies that they cannot get away with defrauding the EU in contracts with its institutions .
I would like to highlight the role of Dorte Schmidt-Brown and her incredible professional and personal integrity .
It would send a signal to other employees of the Commission that the Commission is serious when it says that swindling and fraud will not be tolerated .
The remaining agencies must wait .
It was only recently that a final decision was made to grant discharge to a further five agencies .
We need time to look at them properly before granting discharge .
There are some problems that are general to all the agencies .
An agency may perhaps have been established that later proves to have completed its role .
We must constantly evaluate whether an agency provides any added value .
That is not necessarily their own fault .
Various solutions may therefore be considered .
We could consider transferring some tasks that are currently carried out by the Commission , e.g . within education and health .
We must avoid overlaps between the work of the Commission and the work of the agencies .
We should carefully consider whether there is a need to establish any more implementing agencies .
The agencies must now also implement the new Financial Regulation , and that has already happened at the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna .
There will no longer be an independent ex ante control of the agencies .
I am concerned , however , that there is a risk of a gap in control arising .
The Court of Auditors carries out very few control checks .
The Agency for Reconstruction has generally acquitted itself well , but unfortunately there has been a very serious case of fraud within the energy sector .
Ultimately , however , the agency is responsible for control of the EU funds spent .
I have called upon the Commission to propose phasing out future EU funding of the energy sector in Kosovo if the present situation continues .
It is extremely regrettable that the agency has entered into a number of private employment agreements outside the rules on inviting tenders .
It is not unlawful to conclude direct contracts , but it must be restricted to special cases and must take place entirely openly .
These rules were not observed in several of the contracts signed in 2001 , and I would say to the Commissioner that this must not happen again or there will be problems .
I am well aware that the rules can be highly bureaucratic and difficult .
Mr President , I would like to praise the rapporteurs for the seven reports that we are discussing today .
Some of the accounts are reasonably satisfactory , but unfortunately this applies mainly to the smaller or minor units , the Council , the Court of Justice , the Economic and Social Committee , the Ombudsman , Parliament and the Coal and Steel Community .
In Mr Casaca 's outstanding report it is emphasised that , while the accounts as a whole are formally correct as far as the income , liabilities and administrative expenses are concerned , such a declaration still cannot be made in respect of all the other payments .
It is also stated that , in the past six years , very little progress has been made towards complying with the Court of Auditors ' comments on the accounting system .
It is stressed that , in connection with the closure of the accounts for 2001 , the Commission infringed the Financial Regulation , and , on page after page , we read the very weighty observations that ought to make us adopt a very different position which goes much further than we are currently doing .
The person in question is said to be 'not right in the head ' and those responsible are promoted .
I would like to support Mr Blak 's remarks .
I feel that there is a lack of will in Parliament to tackle the entirely unacceptable economic management that we are witnessing in respect of large parts of the EU 's funds .
