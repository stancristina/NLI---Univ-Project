Finland were before their membership of the European Union ?
Salmonella is part of everyday life .
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply .
There must therefore be guarantees for the right to appeal .
Mr President , as has previously been said here , it is almost seven years since the Commission presented this proposal on the protection of personal details and private lives in public digital telephone networks , i .e . the GSM and ISDN networks .
I do not think the question about the extent to which a charge should be made for ex-directory telephone numbers has really been answered ; i .e . where this kind of listing of citizens is concerned , whether people should have the right to remain outside such a list at no charge .
I also think it is debatable whether this is a question which requires an EU directive to set binding standards for the Member States at all , since the consumers ' interests are not quite satisfied and not fully protected .
Joint action is required .
People are smuggled via organizations between different parts of the world .
The plans to start a more comprehensive initiative in this area began at international level a few years ago .
It is a question of building a fence - the fence of legal security - which is so clear-cut that we still manage to take targeted and very effective measures against crime , since this strikes a balance not only between the constitutional state and integrity , but also the effectiveness of the measures .
I have even rejected some of the Council&#x02BC ;s conclusions .
In addition , I have included in the report some new points of view that were not included , that is , areas that had not been discussed .
I have endeavoured to listen to my colleagues and also to understand their points of view .
It is a question of finding various new ways of moving forward as far as evidence is concerned .
In the long term , this will help us to create an area for legal security within the Union .
We must establish compatible legal systems in Europe and we must harmonize in those areas where we cannot move forward in any other way .
We must establish a definition .
It will be interesting for us to see what actually transpires , and whether they will listen to Parliament&#x02BC ;s views on these questions .
It is also important to address questions relating to information technology .
Ninety per cent of the report was passed by the committee .
If it does not , it would , in a sense , be a shame if Parliament did not succeed in taking advantage of the opportunity Mr Fischbach is giving us to put forward our views .
That is why I also want to mention Italy .
But we have a great deal to learn from Italy , since the Italians have taken some extremely drastic measures .
I am especially addressing the Group Union for Europe when I say this .
That applies also to this proposal regarding the criminalization of participation in certain organizations .
Clearly , the European Union wishes the countries applying for membership of the Union to respect this principle .
I also wonder whether we are not perhaps extending liability under criminal law too far in the committee &#x02BC ;s Amendment No 12 , which means that people are deemed to have committed a criminal offence if they have taken part in a certain type of organization , even if they have not become a permanent or significant part of the structure of that organization .
It is therefore quite remarkable that the Cederschi√∂ld report does not say a single word about Interpol .
There are , of course , some good suggestions in the report , which we shall support .
Mr President , we all dream of an existence without war and other evils , but we must not allow ourselves to be satisfied with that .
An independent war crimes court is for those people who are struck by war&#x02BC ;s worst evil , the evil that can run riot when all constraints are set aside .
At the same time , cooperation is to be developed with respect for the individuals &#x02BC ; integrity .
We have a huge amount to gain - that is to say mankind has a huge amount to gain - from a reduction in the suffering that currently exists in the refugee camps in these countries .
I am thinking especially of one camp in Lithuania which has been noted by numerous humanitarian organizations .
People who would like to return to their countries of origin are not being permitted to do so because the administration does not even sort this out .
The improved cooperation must also include them .
Fiscalis , Karolus , etc .
In conclusion , I would like to point out that there is , therefore , a need for further horizontal regulations for financial control .
I believe this is a question that it is most appropriate to settle at national level .
Such a solution would make a better contribution to the task of developing the importance of fisheries for worldwide food supplies , boost these countries &#x02BC ; economic development and also remove the risks that may be involved in the fisheries agreements , e.g . that certain Member States&#x02BC ; fisheries activities might receive indirect support to continue operating in a situation where the entire European fishing industry is in need of substantial restrictions .
This position must not be regarded as a rejection of the rapporteur&#x02BC ;s work .
We would also like to emphasize the need for this type of agreement with third countries to be subject to improved scrutiny with regard to the budget
