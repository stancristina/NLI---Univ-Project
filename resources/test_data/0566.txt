performance and to help reduce their energy consumption .
I support the rapporteur’s proposal , which is in my view realistic and stands a reasonable chance of being implemented .
The rapporteur’s proposal is in keeping with Parliament’s original position at first reading .
I voted as I did on the amendments before us because I share the concerns – and the aims – of this proposal for a directive aimed at bringing in sufficient harmonisation to develop the internal market , whilst complying with the rules on public health protection .     .
The 2006 budget has assumed strategic importance within the aim of sustaining dynamic growth in Europe , because it is the last of the current financial perspectives and therefore constitutes a strategic framework within which Parliament will decide its priorities for 2007-2013 . 2006 is set to be a key year also in terms of meeting the goals of restoring dynamic and sustainable growth and providing for more and better jobs .
Once again , these goals require the necessary resources to put them into practice and sustain them .
In addition , the obligations of employees and employers have been laid down more clearly , with the primary aim of ensuring that they are able to be enforced more effectively .
As for the amendments , I voted for the balanced proposals that take into account the particular needs and interests of the more outlying countries such as Portugal .     .
It is also true , however , that the Lisbon Strategy needed a review , in order to make it more realistic and more geared towards genuine competitiveness .
More realism is needed , to go with the ambition .
We must incorporate these concerns into every aspect of external relations , in particular the new neighbourhood policy , and in this context the Union must have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council , as has previously been said .
It is now up to the Member State governments to lay the groundwork for this new agency to work .
In the case before us , a British cellophane factory has been enticed to relocate to the State of Kansas , purely on the basis that that State has derogated fiscal and environmental legislation .
Just yesterday the board issued the threat that without further government support 500 more workers would be laid off in August .
This is the alternative to the neoliberal order in which there will be no more Kansases to complain about .     – Mr President , Mrs Murko rightly pointed out in her speech that cultural diversity is intended to defend and protect minorities .
The resolution is very clear .
The complicated part is that hundreds of specifications feature on this non-exhaustive list of cultural goods attached to the draft ; games , leisure activities and sports , culinary traditions , costumes , cultural tourism , pottery , textiles , embroidery , baskets , glassware , jewellery , leather goods , wood , metal , furniture , interior decorating , designer goods , and the list goes on .
The Treaty prohibits any harmonisation of Member States’ legislative and regulatory provisions in this area .
Indeed , compensation also represents an incentive for fishermen to be actively involved in carrying out the recovery plan , because the main aim of plans of this nature is to ensure the sustainability of fisheries resources as a means of safeguarding the future of fishing .
I should also like to welcome the Commission ’s proposal , which recommends that reform of the common fisheries policy should set out provisions for safeguard plans , recovery plans for areas and species with sustainability problems .
I should like to say , by way of justifying the proposal tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , that we want the Member States to have the opportunity to table their own proposals and to submit them to the Commission for approval .
In the Member States in which most fishing is done , the fishermen and the vessel owners have the most to gain from seeing these measures implemented correctly .
As we have repeatedly stated , the need to preserve fish stocks must be compatible with the needs of the populations whose livelihoods depend on fishing and the needs of industries associated with fishing .
According to the proposal , at least 85 % by mass of any vehicle should be re-usable and/or recyclable , and at least 95 % by mass of any vehicle should be re-usable and/or recoverable .
In this regard , one must agree that the manufacturer has a duty to prove that the vehicle concerned is environmentally friendly and to provide disposal firms with a detailed description of a recycling strategy .
We are compelled to condemn as an act of hypocrisy the fact that Parliament has accepted the inclusion of socio-economic measures aimed at ‘mitigating ’ the socio-economic effects of these plans , while there is no legal guarantee of Community funding and the recovery plans are not dependent on the existence of these socio-economic measures .
I support the report before us in the form in which Parliament received it , because it strikes the balance sought by Portugal and jeopardised by the initial proposal , which laid down a range of measures that would have been damaging to national interests , especially in the short term , without sufficient justification .
Dialogue with third countries , international cooperation and the implementation of the 2004 EU/US Declaration are crucial factors in this regard .
The EU must be capable of , firstly , identifying threats and taking swift action by military as well as non-military means ; secondly , promoting security within its immediate border areas , but also those of the future ; and , lastly , strengthening the international order .
