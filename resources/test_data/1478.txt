The figures I have seen in the financial perspectives approved recently by the Council talk of a total sum of EUR 800 million over a period of seven years .
The difference must not depend on the continent to which the country belongs ; if that were the case , we would be giving the impression that we have one first-class neighbourhood policy and another second-class one for the non-European neighbouring Mediterranean countries .
I very much regret that , at the Barcelona Summit of last November , the level of attendance by our neighbours from the South of the Mediterranean was so disappointing .
Europe has 25 million small - and medium-sized enterprises which , in employment terms , provide no fewer than 95 million jobs .
I believe that this is fundamental to the future of small - and medium-sized enterprises .     Mr President , my group is going to give this report its full support in the form it now takes following the approval of several amendments , and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the text on which we have finally been able to agree amongst all of us .
That is intolerable .
My hope for this text is the best one can hope for a text of this nature : that it does not have to be applied .

As the report states explicitly , better coordination is needed between the policy of gender mainstreaming , on the one hand , and the Lisbon Strategy on the other , with a view to taking systematic account of the gender perspective in achieving the ambitious Lisbon objectives , particularly in the broad economic policy guidelines , the employment guidelines , environmental policy − i .e . the REACH Directive − internal market policy − i .e . the Bolkenstein Directive on services − and , finally , the policies on integrating immigrants .
The studies prior to the negotiation of the Seventh Framework Research and Development Programme , which is underway , showed us that Europe needs 750 000 new , properly trained male and female researchers .

President Daul explained this by means of a letter to Commissioner Fisher-Boel .
On the contrary , the Chilean Government and judiciary have acted in an exemplary fashion .
I am particularly pleased that the abilities of progressive Latin American women are beginning to be recognised and that they are being democratically elected as Heads of State .
These measures include implementing the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee and of the Integral Plan of Reparations for the victims of the internal armed conflict , thereby strengthening the High Level Multisectoral Commission ( CMAN ) .     Mr President , Commissioner , I am not going to repeat the arguments already expressed by the Members who have drawn up this motion for a resolution , but I really would like to emphasise the importance of this resolution , since it results from an extremely serious incident : the deaths of 27 people – officially , though the real figure is probably much higher , as other speakers have said – who had gathered peacefully outside the Office of the High Commission for Refugees in Cairo .
Only with the help of vigorous and decisive measures on the part of the European Union , the Commission and this Parliament where Cambodia is concerned might actions of this kind be reduced or eliminated .
If we look carefully at what has happened over these thirty days that I am about to discuss , we should draw certain conclusions with regard to how we cannot continue to act and how we should actually begin to act .
If you will allow me , I would like to say to the family of Prime Minister Sharon , on behalf of all of us , that we wish him a speedy recovery .
And many of them relate to the European Union’s influence in today’s world , because in relation to all of these issues that I have mentioned , all of them , the European Union has had to play a fundamental role : on the issue of energy security , which is fundamental and which will remain with us throughout 2006 ; on the issue of Iran , which will continue to occupy us over the coming days and no doubt beyond , and I will discuss this in a moment ; on the Palestinian elections and their consequences ; on the death of President Rugova and the consequences that it will have in 2006 , and let us hope that it is only 2006 ; on the final agreements on the status of Kosovo ; and on issues relating to the changes that have taken place in the African Union , our relations with which are marked by profound friendship , affection and cooperation .
