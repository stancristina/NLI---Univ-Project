What have our countries done to get NATO to act more promptly ?
We cannot lay the blame on NATO , and certainly not on the USA .
On the contrary , we must praise and thank the USA which fortunately - unlike ourselves - is able to step in when we disintegrate because of our divisions and national special interests .
One Member State would not even uphold the sanctions on air traffic , which had been agreed , and another Member State curiously maintained reservations and acted as a brake .
Because of the negative outcome of the referendum in 1992 , Denmark has limped along with a dismal reservation which even prevents our government from taking decisions on mine clearance , evacuation and humanitarian actions , so we are not the slightest bit better .
Anyone can see that the risk is exactly the opposite , that it will come to nothing - and that the best we shall manage is to sweep up and count the bodies after the accident has happened , and to receive huge flows of refugees , by which we shall be doing Milosevic the greatest service of all .
Can we be sure that it will not end with a new Srebrenica , in which those who should help merely leave their positions at the slightest threat and consign the people to their fate .
I know that some excellent work is being done down there , but are they also getting the back-up they need ?
Mr President , there is still a need for minimum directives in the field of the working environment , so I am glad that the Commission has taken this initiative .
But the Commission proposal to amend the cancer directive is far from satisfactory .
That is quite unacceptable .
I therefore urge you to vote for dust from all woods to be covered by the directive .
We should help to ensure that European employees get real protection from this risk .
Besides , it is difficult in practical work at a plant to have different safety arrangements for different types of wood dust .
The Commission does not explain why it has opted precisely for 5 mg .
It is thus not possible to set a maximum value on the basis of any assessment from the Committee .
It is therefore appropriate to refer to the maximum values applied in the Member States .
In many Member States , the limit is much lower than the 5 mg proposed by the Commission .
It can also make sense economically .
It is of course a minimum directive , so Member States with lower limits will not be forced to raise their maximum values , but we must still work to ensure that workers throughout Europe get the best possible protection , especially when such serious diseases as cancer are involved .
We have also achieved a reasonably good compromise in committee , so I urge you to vote for the report since , in many ways , it represents an improvement on the Commission proposal .
It is always important - we also talked about this earlier today - to ensure that the EU taxpayers ' money is spent prudently .
That must be our task as democratically elected representatives , and that is the approach adopted in Mr Rehder 's report .
The Commission 's report on agricultural expenditure for the financial year 1996 is in many respects an excellent report .
It gives an account of factors which have affected the expenditure on agriculture in the year in question : enlargement of the Union to 15 countries , implementation of aid during the 1992 reform and expenditure associated with the BSE crisis .
The plan involves the setting up of a database , registration of control systems , identification and more detailed registration of stocks .
There are of course some who get into difficulties , in my country too , as a result of what is called excessive bureaucracy , but it is good that we have these things .
On the other hand , I do not think that the Commission 's report pays enough attention to the way the funds are used in the Member States .
In other words , one cannot expect that people will be treated uniformly in the various countries of the Union , even though uniform rules are actually applicable .
That cannot continue indefinitely .
Of course I know exactly what the Commission will say : do you want more bureaucracy ?
Do you want to make things even more difficult ?
And of course that puts us on the spot .
It is thus clearly also necessary to ensure that the agricultural reform points in the direction of a more transparent system than we have at present .
We can see quite clearly - and the Commission 's report says nothing about this , but we can see - that 80 % of the funding goes to 20 % of the farmers .
No doubt there are many explanations , but I really think the Commission owes us an answer as to what it considers the explanation to be .
Mr President , once again the wind of history is blowing through the House , because it is a historic moment that the Commission has now decided to give the process of enlargement a new credibility and fresh impetus by recognising that Latvia should perhaps have been included in the first wave and could therefore be one of the first of the former dictatorships to become a member of the Union .
So I would ask the Commissioner to confirm that Latvia now has the possibility of joining the very first group , and that Lithuania and Slovakia will of course be able to do so very shortly afterwards .
I should like to ask Mr van den Broek whether the Commission has dealt with the institutional issues concerning the
