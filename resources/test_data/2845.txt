status of Kosovo ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission met yesterday morning and as an independent body and with the joint will of all the members of the College , it made political decisions of the utmost importance .
Moreover , the Treaties set out precise mechanisms for ensuring that these principles are respected .
These principles are the raison d ' Ãªtre of the Union and are the result and reflection of the formal commitment made by all the Member States to respect the rights of individuals and of peoples , regardless of their beliefs , origin or circumstances .
Europe already existed then : an area whose intellectual confines were unaffected by the frontiers and limits of the politics of the day ; a community of shared values , ideals and knowledge .
This is what the united Europe wishes to offer , in the century that is now beginning , to those who are preparing to join it .
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam , Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures , in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6 .
It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions .
And these are the consequences !
We are talking about us , not Austria .
Madam President , despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples , which opposes fascism , nazism or communism , both new and old , and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people , we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament .
Very well , it is a fungicide , it kills off mould .
Mr President , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament ' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council , and in the end , makes it rather irrelevant .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament ' s opinion is .
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration .
Just consider the facts : we looked at Austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock markets , Mr President : given that the euro , that great undertaking , has fallen 16 % against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , I will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues .
( IT ) Mr President-in-Office , on listening to the various interventions , you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament ' s political groups , the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency , instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference .
This effort was appreciated , even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals , and moreover , Mr President-in-Office , you also expressed different views .
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution .
Madam President , I absolutely agree with the rapporteur ' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture , Mr Gargani , for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also , considerably difficult .
Madam President , whoever has the honour , like myself , to chair the Committee on Culture , cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur , and Commissioner Reding , with whom he worked and who , even during the conciliation process , had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone .
Let us contemplate this result , derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy .
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist , adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and , all things considered , find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members , who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible .
As for the remaining vehicles , we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs , as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange , the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries , and we should therefore support them .
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens ' indifference to Europe .
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector , so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented .
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible .
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation , and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments
