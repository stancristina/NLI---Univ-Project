me is the fact that the HÃ¼rriyet , which is , I believe , the most widely read Turkish newspaper , did not meet with any denial on the part of the Turkish Government and , as we all know , freedom of the press is something of a problem in Turkey .
The government accepts this and , between the lines , I think that you accept that there are problems with the public administration in Greece .
More importantly , what is to be done about the gaping wound in the Social Fund in Greece which , in my view , is no more than a black hole which just swallows up Community funds ?
What can he do in this direction ?
But the question remains .
From what you have said , I think that my fellow countrymen in Greece should be worried , and with good cause .
In the meantime , what about public health in Greece ?
Because I know , for example , that there are also problems with the management of nitric compounds .
In capitalist societies , however , in both the audiovisual and in other sectors , the beneficial consequences of technological progress are being stifled by the forces controlling it ; to wit , by monopolies making profits not by improving the quality of artistic creation , but by controlling the markets , subjecting people to misleading advertising , dictating ideological beliefs and creating specific consumer standards , even for culture .
The whole structure has absolutely nothing to do with the needs of the people of the European Union or with culture ; on the contrary it serves those interests which benefit from the commercialisation of culture .
That is because control mechanisms have not kept pace with the increase in activities .
If the tenet of these proposals is extrapolated , the suggestion is that the European Parliament should , in the future , devote more time to these matters , which are equally important if it is to enhance its status and its right to aspire to codecision with the Council .
The third way is to strengthen and improve the role of the ombudsman , mainly by giving him easier access to all the documents needed in order to conduct an efficient investigation .
Mr Atkins ' report addresses an issue which is perhaps the most important issue which either Mrs de Palacio or we in the European Parliament will have to deal with over the next four or five years and I must start by congratulating Mr Atkins on his approach in this specific report .
Eurocontrol has proven to be inadequate as a mechanism for managing air traffic .
In the meantime , however , passengers must be compensated for delays by airlines and must , of course , be apprised of their rights .
( EL ) There are serious reservations regarding the proposal to amend Regulation EC No 1251/1999 on flax and hemp grown for fibre because of the unfair allocation of quotas between the Member States .
Secondly , it is clear from developments at the Intergovernmental Conference that we are moving towards a " two-speed Europe " rather than towards democratisation , as continual reference to " closer cooperation " and various proposals to reduce the weighting of small countries in both the Council and the Commission illustrate .
- ( EL ) Forests play a huge role in maintaining fundamental ecological balances in the ecosystem of life itself .
Allow me to bring to your attention the dramatic problem in Greece , which is at the top of the European league in terms of the numbers of acres burnt for every fire .
Only 10 % of the surface area destroyed in Greece is reforested .
Not only has the EU 's forest policy to date failed as a result of fragmented , one-off , inconsistent and incoherent action and the wholly inadequate funds provided ; the Commission has now proposed further cuts in the already minimal funds available to protect forests from fire and atmospheric pollution .
Such a policy is not merely hypocritical .
We believe that the Community funds allocated to forests were and still are totally inadequate and we call for them to be increased in line with real needs and the importance of forests .
Mr President , I should like to ask if the members could explain their vote in writing if reports are being discussed or , at least , to wait until the end if they are explaining them orally , as they are entitled to do .
( EL ) The purpose of this report is to justify liberalising the energy markets - mainly the electricity but also the natural gas market .
The report contains quite a few inaccuracies in its bid to present the liberalisation of the energy market in an attractive light .
Privatisation and liberalisation will push up prices , especially to consumers on the small Aegean islands , who pay a price per kilowatt/hour several times below cost .
It is for precisely this reason that an attempt is being made to separate sectors , thereby preventing public-sector corporations from operating with a view to optimising vertically integrated activities and become competitive .
This risk can clearly be discerned ; as the report stresses , " In a frontier-free Europe , public utilities must operate in the single market .
.
We wish to point out and highlight the risks inherent in a strict prohibition on dismissal , especially under the present , extended regime of generalised atypical employment contracts and the indirect exclusion of pregnant women from jobs , a regime in which we need not just to maintain and consolidate but to increase maternity leave , define the maternity allowance more clearly and apply strict and more substantive controls on night work by pregnant and breastfeeding working women .
