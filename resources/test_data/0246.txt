There does not appear to be any problem with this .
This is because we have often found that a member of one of the institutions has been involved in a case of fraud , and has hindered us from finding out about it .
Furthermore , it is limited to small numbers .
Mr President , we were concerned about this debate , because the debate on the state of the Union , which we are now holding for the third time , must not be either a matter of rhetorical or superficial routine .
I am thinking now of the tragic case of Vilevoorde , which was debated in this House , and of other equally important cases .
If we do a simple division exercise , however , we see that this works out at only ECU 8 for each unemployed person in Europe .
Nevertheless , we are critical of the Maastricht criteria , and we are sceptical of the view that the euro will automatically generate growth , which will automatically generate employment .
As has already been said today , it is necessary to count in all the countries requesting accession and not to classify them strictly as suitable or unsuitable .
In conclusion , I wish to say that if these key problems are to be resolved , the problems of democracy must also be resolved .
A number of aspects could be highlighted , but I shall restrict myself to referring to certain paragraphs that I believe are particularly important .
Otherwise , in my view , the essential legal protection which must be granted to all asylum seekers will be undermined .
Nevertheless , I would argue in its defence that , as we all know , no Community institution can contravene the provisions of Community law or the acquis communautaire .
As article 2 of Directive 79/111 rightly states , consumers must not be confused .
Furthermore , there is the question of labelling .
I doubt that you are interested , Madam Commissioner , but in my view that was the only rational solution .
I believe that the principle of quid pro quo in the food field is leading the European Commission down an unacceptable road , and this is why all the political groups are expressing their concern .
Thank you for your kind words to us all .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , as the rapporteur rightly said , the Green Paper on copyright and related rights in the information society is a Commission document which seeks to discuss what sort of legal treatment should be given to copyright in a dynamic environment characterized by technological development which makes possible both new forms of reproduction and new means of expression for intellectual works .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights proposes that a single , coherent legislative proposal be presented covering the main issues referred to : the right of reproduction , the right of communication to the public and the right of distribution .
In the vote on the Breyer report , I intended to vote against Amendment No 6 , but - either through tiredness or illness , or both at once - I am not sure that I did .
We must act .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the previous speakers have already referred to the enormity of the catastrophe unleashed by the forest fires currently raging in south-east , especially Indonesia .
We cannot simply wait for disasters like that occurring in Indonesia to happen , and then provide funds and send experts to put out the fire , whilst simultaneously remaining paralysed in our efforts to adopt measures to prevent global warming , which is the origin and cause of a great many disasters .
It is also true that more than 10 billion pesetas worth of damage was caused to housing , infrastructure and agricultural land .
There are two fundamental causes of the fires in Indonesia and Brazil : the interests of loggers , and the demands of farmers .
Mr President , I should like to begin this speech by saying that I am very pleased to be able to congratulate the Commission for once , since it seems that the humanitarian aid supplied through Echo was extremely rapid and effective .
I would therefore ask the Commissioner to convey to Mrs Bonino the request to increase the aid as more definite information becomes available , as has been done with other countries , such as the countries of eastern Europe .
Thus , the committee agrees with the proposed global financial framework of ECU 5.6 million and underlines the importance of the project being a financial support operation - that is , an instrument which provides financial support for the efforts of the groups concerned , thereby underpinning initiatives which must primarily be their responsibility .
Unless the professions most directly involved in the administration of justice become aware of their responsibility , the application of Community law will continue to be non-uniform , and will therefore continue to jeopardize the achievement of the internal market 's objectives .
And , thirdly , Madam President , what determines the choice of legal base to which I have referred is undoubtedly the objective .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we are examining the proposal for a Council regulation on the improvement of the Community production of apples , pears , peaches and nectarines .
It will be financed by EAGGF Guarantee funds .
With regard to Amendment No 8 , we prefer the original wording of article 1( 2 )( 2 ) .
The first question that I wish to put to the Commissioner is : does he consider that the simultaneous launch of the enlargement process and the European conference signifies approximation to the so-called "regatta theory ' ?
This is indeed a " Eurostrike ' , which is affecting countries such as Spain which have nothing
