There are at least three conclusions : firstly , we need to make it a priority to have an up-to-date policy to tackle poverty and social exclusion and global warming , then we need to stop the EPAs and finally we need the passages in the draft constitution that promote economic deregulation , privatisation and armament to be deleted .
In March 2006 , Palestinian and Israeli representatives participated constructively in the meeting of senior EuroMed officials and the EuroMed Committee , despite the disputes resulting from the outcome of the elections in the Palestinian Territories .
This development does , of course , go hand in hand with progress in the implementation of the association agreement that I mentioned earlier , which will bring in its train other challenges , raising , among others , questions as to whether the Mediterranean partners ' business operations are competitive .
