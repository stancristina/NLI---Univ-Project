from the Bureau .
An amount has also been appropriated from Parliament’s budget to a campaign concerning the new Constitutional Treaty .
It is not a campaign in the sense that we have to go out and engage in propaganda , but Parliament’s leaders have felt that we in the European Parliament have a quite specific duty to ensure that the population of the EU is informed about what this Treaty really contains and is given a knowledge it can use as a basis for the votes that are to take place in the individual countries .
It was felt that we have a special obligation , and that is something with which , in a way , I agree .
In its agreement , Parliament’s Committee on Budgets maintained the gentlemen’s agreement with the Council .
In the course of our negotiations , amendments were , however , tabled that , in actual fact , cut into the Council’s budget for administration of the common foreign and security policy and , at the same time , cut into Parliament’s budget , namely that for the buildings reserve .
However much sympathy I may have for the intention behind the proposal , I did not , as rapporteur , recommend or support it .
It is , to a large extent , the growing expenditure in this field that has led to a rate of increase of almost 5 % in the Council’s budget for 2005 , while the budgets of the other institutions have increased by a little over 3 % .
I would therefore repeat my appeal to the Council to keep a tighter rein on the budget and to ensure greater transparency .
I must emphasise that , from Parliament’s point of view , the expenditure on the common foreign and security policy does not form part of the gentlemen’s agreement .
It is obviously an area that we shall discuss further over the next few years .
That is something I believe we owe our taxpayers .     Mr President , today’s crisis shows that the rules for appointing the Commission do not work .
The prime ministers appoint people they want or , often , people they want to get rid of , and expect us to rubber-stamp their choice .
In that way , we should have a democratically appointed Commission .
It is the engine of integration .
It operates through 30 000 officials and more than 3 000 working groups , through which the Commission secures influence for itself , and through a network in the Member States that also bypasses the national authorities .
The thousands of decisions and laws adopted by the Commission are rarely made in the Commission itself but , more often than not , in working groups involving participants of whom we have no knowledge .
Only relatively few votes are taken in the Commission , and the general public is unaware of the results .
The Commission administers a budget of EUR 100 billion , but this is not controlled by the Commission ’s own accounts department , by the Court of Auditors or by the Committee on Budgetary Control set up for the purpose by the European Parliament .
In the Commission itself , the presidents cannot control the various Directors General , even though it is formally the president who is responsible for doing so .
Every opportunity must be taken to obtain more power , and concessions to transparency are made only rarely .
It is now on the Net as an experiment .
It took Mr Barroso a day to make the list of Commission working groups available .
He wanted in that way to show that it was he who made the decisions , but then transparency came to an end .
My group is not taking part in the onslaught on an individual Commissioner’s personal beliefs .
Nor , however , will we deliver votes to a supranational , anti-democratic organisation which one departing Commissioner described very precisely as a ‘monster’ .
This ‘monster ’ has a monopoly on tabling bills .
In that way , the Commission would be elected from the bottom up and not from the top down by a qualified majority of prime ministers .
The Commission would no longer be an unruly ‘monster’ , and people would stand up and applaud spontaneously if the Commission President were to pass by .
Today , he has talked with the representatives of the three largest groups .
Mr President , in connection with the vote on the other institutions , I have to say that there is an equalisation amendment , Amendment No 436 , that has been tabled so that the expenditure might be balanced in the light of other amendments to Parliament’s Budget .
If Parliament decides to follow my recommendations to amend the overall level of Parliament’s Budget – Amendment No 370 – which would reduce the Budget by EUR 40 million , the amount of budget item 209 , which is the amount of the institution’s property investments , will be adjusted accordingly .     Mr President , now that we have voted on the figures , I have a small amendment to the text on which we are to vote , namely to paragraph 20 in which the amounts are to be amended on the basis of the result of the vote concerning Euroscola .
These are the changes that result from our vote on the figures .     Mr President , we also wish to express confidence in the Reconstruction Agency’s being able to help improve the economic and social situation in the Turkish-occupied zone in northern Cyprus .
It is important to remember the background to the current situation in the northern part of Cyprus .
The background is the Turkish invasion that took place in 1974 and that meant that the population in the northern part of Cyprus now finds itself in an economic and social situation clearly worse than that which existed before July 1974
