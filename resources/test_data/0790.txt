Unfortunately , the Dutch Government failed to come up with the goods .
If the farmer can no longer acquire sufficient income from agriculture , he will look for all kinds of secondary activities .
First of all , something I am really unhappy about and that has already been mentioned by the Liberals , is that these days negotiations appear to be taking place not between the Council and Parliament , but between the Council and two groups .
All these areas are covered very effectively in the proposal - in fact in a harmonised manner - the only correct way in our digital , cross-border world .
However , I do want to take this opportunity to make another point .
It should be harmonised , Commissioner , but at a sufficiently high level .
Furthermore , it appears that a number of important assessment aspects have been overlooked .
First of all , harmful substances must be phased out as soon as possible , with the time when the new period sets in applying as the latest date .
Mr President , I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur , who has done very sound work , as usual .
It would have been much preferable not to review the annex in its entirety until 2004 , by which time the acceding countries could have been taken into account to a greater extent .
Parliament demanded this at the time of the initial decision in 1996 ; it now has this opportunity and it is not seizing it .
I should like to spotlight one project which is of extreme importance to me , as someone from Flanders and Antwerp : the Iron Rhine , the railway connection between the port of Antwerp and the Ruhr area , a railway line which already exists and which therefore does not need to be constructed , and which only needs modernising and re-commissioning .
The approach which the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has maintained in this connection is the correct one .
Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur warmly for the work he has done .
Social responsibility is what it is about .
For all these reasons , pragmatic and principled , the report that is now before us , including our amendments , is the right one .
Worse still is when the recipients themselves have to pay for the privilege of receiving unsolicited advertising .
.
There will then be every reason to invest selectively in modernising long-distance railway traffic and in removing bottlenecks on neglected waterways .
Anyone who wants to serve the privileged , however , will opt for more and larger airports and for more and wider motorways .
With an EU institute for police studies , an EU incentive for private security services and cross-border protection of eminent persons , it is starting to resemble a feudal dictatorship modelled on South American traditions .
Mr Fiori is right to mention the environment and food safety , but I have a feeling that , in practice , his main interests revolve around the WTO requirements , maintaining agricultural subsidies for southern Europe following the accession of poorer Eastern European countries , and blocking national regulations as far as possible .
What measures has it taken and what is the position of the Commission at the moment ?
The US is prepared to remove American suspects by force .
The suggestion , not only made as a proposal , but now also approved in the American Senate , that there is every likelihood that American military can come to the Netherlands to free people who are brought before the International Criminal Court , is an unprecedented provocation in respect of a NATO partner .
It seems to me to be extremely important to broach this decision in that forum too , and , as far as I am concerned , to reject it .
We , together with the Council , make up the budgetary authority .
These are ways in which we can turn into a tiger rather than a toothless lamb .
I should now like to turn to the point of urgent debates .
Mr Corbett has done a considerable amount of work and made compromises in order to reach a common position .
However , the self-same interests are threatening to undermine the whole show again .
What , then , is the source of this tendency to obstruct specifically small groups , give small Member States less say and eliminate minority languages ?
Non-European thinking is the very thing which is , in fact , threatening Europe .
The European Commission - and especially the Commissioner - deserves a show of approval for this initial integral policy document on the subject of poverty and social exclusion .
Indeed , single older women and single mothers with young children are particularly vulnerable groups .
We know that the Commission introduced the concept of social exclusion some time ago because the word poverty was regarded as too strong by some Member States .
That would be all too easy for the governments .
What we can do , however , is exchange information , set good examples and agree on common issues up to a point , but these common issues should not have a counterproductive effect .
This proposal is one of many .
Indeed , if we have to wait until a general consensus has been reached , a decision might be a long time coming .
An important line of approach for this proposal is the opportunities offered to newcomers on the market .
However , I would like to note in this connection that we must ensure that producers in developing countries are not treated any worse than European producers , particularly as this contravenes the WTO regulations .
This is why a ban on both sales
