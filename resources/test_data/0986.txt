policies in the Member States , which need to be more or less unified .
Having said that , I believe that we need to push forward with this policy , on which we agree , our criteria being that these methods must be used for peaceful applications , policies must be unified and any action taken must be integrated into a single European policy because , in the final analysis , Europe must not be dependent for its safety , communications and security on the satellite systems of either the United States of America or Russia .
In the end , it was far more complicated than I had imagined , but today we are on our way to an auspicious ending and that is what counts .
The Member States wish to harmonise these maximum lengths , at least for buses used throughout the European Union , and have asked the Commission to work out a proposal .
With the second amendment , the European Parliament proposes the same length of 18.75 metres for articulated buses , as for buses with trailers .
This amendment too was accepted .
Similarly , Member States are allowed to impose local restrictions on the use of extra long buses for safety or other reasons .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , may I start by congratulating the rapporteur on the report which she has tabled before the House today on the future of the common fisheries policy .
The House has examined the problems of the common fisheries policy on numerous occasions in the past .
Any other policy would be absurd .
It is , I think , highly significant that the majority position adopted in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy was that space activities should only be intended for peaceful purposes .
We have seen on several occasions and we are seeing more and more frequently just what the strong countries in the European Union understand by peaceful operations .
Some people are flirting with the idea of collaborating with the USA on an anti-missile shield and some people perhaps think that space is the perfect place to position weapons .
Resistance to imperialist policies , be they in the form of financial enslavement or in the form of military intervention , is growing all over the world .
( EL ) The report contains a mixture of undisputed findings and hypotheses and draws conclusions which , at the very least , force us to question the rapporteur 's intentions .
Big business is to blame for polluting the seas with sewage , dioxins and other contaminants ; it has no compunction about using any methods in the production process which maximise its already obscene profits and is totally indifferent to the environmental implications .
If this policy takes hold , it will kill off entire regions of the Ã…U which depend on fishing and will damage the interests of the small and medium-sized fishing enterprises which have no part in industrial pollution or the overfishing of resources .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
Did this happen or not ?
.
The report ascribes this state of affairs to secondary causes and avoids tackling the root cause of the problem .
Falling standards in training and further training , which have wiped out the fund of know-how which used to exist , are the result of the EU 's own policy , which has pushed for diplomas to be changed to certificates of ability to exercise the profession of seafarer and for professional diplomas to be abolished .
This sort of policy would guarantee that the needs of contemporary seafarers ' families are met , as well as guaranteeing safety at sea and environmental protection .
Mr Bush talks of an axis of evil between Iran , Iraq and North Korea and has said that he is keeping open all his options for making the USA and its allies safe .
Mr President , I should like to ask the European Parliament to oppose this policy and to put a stop , at long last , to situations which put us in danger of another world war .
As you know , the aim of the Olympic Games is to promote world peace , friendship , understanding , solidarity , dialogue and the peaceful coexistence of nations and cultures through the common endeavour of athletes from all over the world .
However , I should point out that with the proposed amendments , most of which I trust will be adopted , we have managed to extract some secondary benefit from this decision .
The Commission too has put pressure on Parliament , brandishing the fact that the Council is in unanimous political agreement on the matter , so all that is left is for us to endorse the Council 's and the Commission 's faits accomplis .
Parliament has already rejected the previous Commission proposal by a large majority .
Assuming that the only way a small tobacco company manages to get its most popular brand on to the market is by reducing the price , it immediately faces a heavy fixed tax which bears no relation to its production costs , putting it at a disadvantage in relation to large tobacco companies .
I believe that Parliament is now convinced that constantly increasing the price of cigarettes does not achieve the objective , which I support , of reducing smoking ; all it does is to reduce legal sales of cigarettes and encourage cigarette smuggling which , in some countries , has reached worrying proportions .
In addition , the Commission proposal would result in astronomical price increases in candidate countries of 200 % to 400 % .
This proposal is as follows : the Council can adopt the Commission 's initial ideas and Parliament will withdraw its opposition to them .
