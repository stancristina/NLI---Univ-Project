For its part , Hungary has set a target date of 2010 , as you have mentioned .
What I can say once again to the honourable Member — and I have said this on many occasions — is that the Commission is going to assess whether or not the criteria have been met as defined in the Treaty .
If you wish , I shall come to Parliament on the afternoon of 16 May to explain the content of the report to you , but I cannot say anything before then .     .
We do not want to apply pressure , but we cannot forget that this is an obligation for the Member States .
It is not for the Commission to change the Treaties and it has the obligation to apply them .
With regard to the preventive aspect of the Pact , the assessment of the 2005 stability and convergence programmes , which have been carried out during the first months of 2006 , have shown that the Member States have set their medium-term budgetary objectives in accordance with the agreed principles .
Over the next three weeks , by 24 April , Eurostat must analyse the figure notified by the French authorities , and will explain whether or not those figures , a deficit of 2.87 % , are correct .
But we still have difficult times ahead of us , because we must not be content with deficits of 2.8 % .
When the Member States of the eurozone decided to appoint a stable President of the Eurogroup , I expressed my great satisfaction .
Certain economies of the eurozone are facing problems with inflation of assets , there is a clear need to improve the dialogue between the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank .
The President of the European Central Bank participates in the meetings of the Eurogroup each month .
I would like to express my full support for this programme and congratulate Mr Takkula on the work he has done .
We should not be comparing different wars or quantifying a massacre according the deaths involved , but rather remembering all victims , so that by preserving their memory we can prevent such events from ever happening again .
I shall end , Mr President , by telling the Council that we are pleased with its proposal that the existing obligations should be complied with , but disappointed that it lacks the political courage to establish a genuine common energy policy , which this House and the European Commission are calling for and which the Union urgently needs , because its future depends on it .     Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I have three messages for you .
As well as preaching to others , the Commission must do its duties .
It does not give any clear indication that the Hamas government is prepared to respect the principles established by the European Union , and not just by us , but also by the Quartet and by the international community , in a very broad sense : to renounce violence as a means for resolving conflicts — and this conflict in particular — to recognise the State of Israel and to respect the previous agreements signed by the Palestinians and Israel .
It would not be appropriate for me to carry out a detailed analysis of the result of these elections , but I believe that a few comments may help us all to find formulae that allow us to carry out an analysis with a view to identifying different ways to work .
The inward-looking focus of the Israeli electorate has a parallel in Hamas’s desire to focus on Palestinian issues and to ignore an Israel whose right to exist it still rejects .
I would like once again to stress something that is absolutely clear : a satisfactory solution to the conflict has been , is and will remain a fundamental priority for us , the Europeans .
With regard to Palestine , the European Union will continue to support President Abbas and the peace programme on the basis of which he was elected by an enormous , overwhelming , majority of Palestinian voters , and we must not forget that .
In accordance with international humanitarian law , Israel has a series of obligations as the occupying power .
We must continue to work within the Quartet .
I believe that the European Union must approach it on the basis of two principles which may apparently , but only apparently , seem contradictory : rigour and flexibility .
As Mr Solana has said , all of this comes within a context of positives and negatives .
Finally , Mr Solana , we all understand the need to support the Palestinian National Authority , but , in a context such as this , is the Palestinian National Authority still relevant , when it comes to working with a government that has not recognised the agreements previously signed by that authority ?
On the one hand , I believe that we in Europe have been implementing a very self-centred policy of in the majority of universities and nursing schools , in order to guarantee employment for our students , without taking account of the fact that the prospects and needs of Europe were going to exceed our capacity to provide care ; that is why doctors and nurses from other countries are needed .
In any event , Commissioner , I also wished to congratulate the Commission on its rapid reaction to the problems being suffered by the poultry and egg market .
I am delighted that account has been taken of the fall in prices and also the fall in consumption that we are seeing in the European Union .
This is therefore the first example of co-funding of market measures
