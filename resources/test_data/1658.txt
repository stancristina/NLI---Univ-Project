He collected evidence of the events surrounding these brutalities .
The resolution that we are going to adopt tomorrow will be a very important contribution to the 18th International AIDS Conference , which will be held in Vienna later this month .
In our resolution , we state that there are still 106 countries of this kind .
It is a major task in our foreign policy and our development policy to emphasise that we need evidence-based approaches to HIV/AIDS.
It is very sad to see that many countries still criminalise same-sexual behaviour .
Theft is always theft .
We need to take a serious view of Internet piracy .
The future of the creative sector , and it is the same for any sector , depends on whether people are paid for the work they do or not .
When the fees of musicians , actors or film directors fall into the clutches of pirates , the result is cultural impoverishment , as professional artists are unable to make a living .
Another option which the report , to its credit , proposes is to evolve fair rules for the information networks to protect copyright .
Ecommerce is a new and international sector , and , as a result , the European Union needs to assume an important role in the harmonisation of standards and practices .
Bringing broadband to all EU citizens by the year 2013 and superfast broadband by 2020 are ambitious goals , but are vital for improving people 's quality of life .
The World Health Organisation has estimated that counterfeit medicines account for as much as 10 % of the world 's pharmaceutical market .
Counterfeit medicines are a matter of people 's health and welfare , and so the issue is a worrying one .
In future , the information will be more easily accessible , for example , on new national and European websites dedicated to drug safety .
Mr President , Commissioner , the compromise we have achieved in this resolution is an excellent one , so my thanks go to all my fellow Members who were involved .
This resolution will serve as a very strong plea from Parliament to the Commission to also focus special attention in future financial frameworks and the next programming period on areas that suffer from permanent natural handicaps .
I am pleased that this document highlights the importance of exploiting the potential that these regions have to offer .
It is important that we also take a look at the very precious resources to be found in these areas , and not just consider their problems .
Their traditional sources of livelihood , energy , and the areas given emphasis in the Europe 2020 strategy , such as research and development , are crucial for these special areas .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , emissions from air traffic have increased faster than those in any other major business sector .
There would be nothing whatsoever left for anything else .
That is precisely why the EU decided on its own flight emissions trading scheme .
Our true objective , of course , is a global system , but the EU 's flight emissions trading scheme alone will also have a global impact .
We must not now bow to pressure from the United States of America .
We can understand his difficulties in getting climate legislation through the US Congress , but we cannot accept a situation where the US administration tries to block EU action on climate change .
A similar problem also relates to emissions from international shipping , and I would remind the Commission of what we have agreed on in connection with our own climate legislation .
On the other hand , it also identifies the phenomenon of counterfeiting in its various forms and the threat that results from piracy .
I thought that the report was a balanced one overall , and that is why I voted against the alternative motions for a resolution .
I wish to thank my colleague , Mrs Gallo , for her very thorough report .
Countering the fears of those alarmed about the protection of privacy , for example , the Gallo report proposes no new legislation , let alone penalties , but endeavours to stress the importance of intellectual property for the economy of the European Union .
It is cruel and demeaning , and a punishment to which an innocent person can be sentenced .
Prohibition of the death penalty is one of the priority areas of EU human rights policy .
I am glad that on this day , the World day against the death penalty , the European Parliament is taking a tough stand against capital punishment , which should be banned everywhere in the world .
Thank you .
It is time for action where it concerns families .
Good examples include Sweden , Denmark , Iceland and Finland .
Women and families should not be penalised for having children .
In addition to the call for full pay , the proposed directive is also suggesting that maternity leave should count towards service in employment when pensions are being calculated .
If the directive went ahead , it would narrow the earnings gap between women and men .
Better coordination of family and professional life promotes the well-being of families , employment and economic development .
We nevertheless disagree on what sort of legislation should actually be enacted to realise this goal in the Member States .
When , in addition , we bear in mind the changes to parental leave made last year , we may conclude that protection of the family is improving in the EU.
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , however , has adopted amendments that do not respect the differences between national systems or financial realities .
Cramming them all into the same package would result in poor legislation and breach the
