Sadly , Mrs Zana ' s case is no exception !
Since the ECB holds currencies to offset liabilities in euros , it would also run a foreign exchange risk if the euro appreciated substantially against the reserve currencies it is holding .
I have not proposed what might be called a political resolution to my colleagues .
Mr President , the European Central Bank is recommending to the Council that it double its foreign reserve assets .
However , the fact that this operation is to take place so soon after the date when the single currency was launched clearly shows that the value of the reserves was seriously underestimated at the time .
Our abstention expresses our opposition to both the national and the European organisation of the banking system .
Mr Sturdy , the chairman of our delegation , was unable to attend at that precise time , Madam President , but he has written to you this morning to confirm what I am about to say .
Madam President , I should like to speak in support of this motion .
There are only two things that will cause them to shift position : pressure from the European Union or pressure from their own public opinion for , unfortunately , the United States is a vast territory and the environs of airports are less badly affected than the territories overflown in Europe , which is , by virtue of its geographical layout , affected more seriously by such constraints .
Right now , there are people held there as prisoners of conscience .
First of all , the objective of a policy of this type must be to tackle the blatant disparities between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean , which keep the peoples of the south in an explosive economic and social situation .
Mr President , while Parliament is getting bogged down with details , here we are , forced to deal with one of the key areas of European concern , the Mediterranean , in a great rush .
This visit has been an exceptional demonstration of the understanding that can be achieved between all parties .
I am going to talk about asylum .
Taken in isolation , a good number of her subparagraphs are acceptable , and some are even excellent , and my group will vote in favour of them .
We must therefore reject annual funding of the EUR 5.5 billion intended for the Balkans , an amount calculated by the European Commission on who knows what basis , by raising the ceiling for external expenditure and lowering that under the agricultural categories , on the erroneous grounds that appropriations would not be taken away from agriculture but that it would be appropriate to release the margins for 2001 and 2002 .
Mr President , I should first , of course , like to congratulate Mrs Klamt on her report .
We cannot remain indifferent to this scourge which represents an appalling infringement of children ' s rights and human rights , and we must protect these children by attacking the origins of the problem and by pursuing the paedophiles .
It is now not just sex tourists who are travelling to third countries ; we now have children being sent here , to Europe , like so many items sent by parcel post .
These are extremely serious matters , involving high-ranking personalities , but it is all still perfectly concealed , completely outside the scope of the justice system .
The development of child sex tourism flies in the face of the very idea of a human community united on the basis of ideals such as respect and dignity , and public welfare and remembrance .
The reasons for this are energy prices which do not incorporate the external costs , with the sizeable subsidies which are still available to the nuclear sector as well as the fossil-fuel sector .
I would argue that it is pointless to make cuts in subsidies to the renewable sector when there are much larger subsidies going to the nuclear and fossil-fuel sectors .
Mr Birdal had asked to be released on health grounds , after being attacked .
I expected the Council Presidency to make a statement about that .
I honestly believe that it is now too late for that .
Thirdly , what can you tell us about the role played by the United Kingdom in this system , or at least the role it intends to play in the future ?
Or if this 'Echelon ' network is really intended to combat international organised crime , Madam President , we must insist on being involved in it .
Now we find that Britain' s solidarity extends across the Atlantic and across the Pacific Ocean .
Something born of a Harvard University lecture theatre under the presidency of the American , General Marshall , is bound to end up obeying its creator .
Mr President , I have naturally voted for the Haug report on the budgetary guidelines , but I would particularly like to stress the welcome reinstatement of natural disasters , confirmed by this morning ' s vote .
And this is at a time when the Balkans is still a veritable powder keg where there is increasing evidence that trends are moving in the opposite direction to what we were hoping and the sound of tanks is more often heard than the sound of mechanical diggers .
This regulation provides for the banning , as from May 2000 , of certain noisy aircraft equipped with noise reduction devices known as 'hushkits ' .
Is the European Union really just there to serve the multinationals and big business ?
Although the Barcelona Conference gave Mediterranean policy new impetus by establishing the Euro-Mediterranean partnership between the European Union and twelve Mediterranean countries , the actual achievements have proved
