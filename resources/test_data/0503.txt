it effectively to other Community institutions which have blocked this dossier up to now .
But I will check this procedure and whatever happens I can say here and now that the voluntary plan is explicitly provided for and explicit in the Italian government 's plan , and in particular in the second sentence of the fifth consideration of the Commission 's proposal .
The Commission will only do it if it is sure the conditions for another , equivalent political deadlock are no longer there .
While expressing a certain satisfaction at the adoption of a programme of support to the Italian conversion plan for drift net fishing , I must still , on behalf of myself and Mr Tajani , emphasize our disappointment at the fact that certain fundamental principles which appear in the Italian plan have not been understood or accepted by this House .
The extraordinary nature of the proposed measure , which impacts on a socio-economic situation of grave difficulty and would have justified not only recourse to the FIFG , but also access to other Community funds - the ESF and the ERDF - where the quotas intended for Italy were not fully used .
We must therefore place on record our displeasure at the delay in the Commission 's submission of a proposal following up its proposal on organic farming and extending it to include livestock production .
Several times , we in this House have had occasion to point out how , despite all the declarations of principle , the entire CAP is still insufficiently geared to quality policy .
Our group is in agreement with this report and will therefore support it during today 's vote .
It is simply a new model of development , which is based on research , passes through a form of practice that has more to do with culture than cultivation , and eventually leads to a straightforward and transparent relationship with the consumer .
The first , as I see it , concerns a fundamental rethink about the Objective 5( a ) measures .
I am somewhat amazed by all this , and what I wonder is this : was Cork , in effect , just a weekend diversion or will it really be a strategic axis for the future of the Structural Funds ?
What is important is the incentive to promote energy saving , partly through the somewhat commonplace form , of the efficient distribution and economical use of water resources .
I would remind the House that the term biocides refers to a very wide range of products including disinfectants , insecticides , fungicides , and preservatives for wood and for the treatment of textiles and structural materials .
All these products contain an active principle , and that is what really has to be controlled , in view of the routine and widespread use of products containing such active principles .
The Union for Europe Group is in agreement with the common position and with some amendments tabled here today , but it is absolutely opposed to Amendments Nos 17 , 18 and 19 .
In his motion for a resolution , Mr Collins - to whom I offer my congratulations on his excellent work - calls on the Commission to undertake a variety of complementary activities , which we support and which I will summarize here once again : first , the codification of Community environmental legislation ; secondly , earmarking a proportion of the funds from each year 's Community budget to ensure implementation of Community environmental legislation ; thirdly , the creation of an inspectorate ; fourthly , attention by the Commission , when drafting legislation , to the process of consultation , which should be broad and systematic ; fifthly , the application of the codecision procedure to all environmental legislation , which should be ensured by the IGC ; sixthly , close co-operation between the European Environment Agency , which must monitor the efficacy of the measures approved over the course of time in the various countries with the Commission and the Member States ; and , finally , the creation of the position of Environmental Ombudsman or of a court to ensure the proper management of environmental and territorial resources .
Nor can I refrain from stressing the point that , during that same period , Article 129 of the Treaty on European Union gave the Community specific powers in the public health sector .
All this is necessary because , on the threshold of the third millennium , we believe that guaranteeing the quality of life means taking all the necessary initiatives in planning , organization , management and control to ensure complete protection for the individual against the dangers of radiation , in particular that resulting from medical exposure .
Ever since 1984 , in the context of the Euratom treaties , we have been trying to regulate this subject .
Of course , as Mr Trakatellis said , doctors have always followed the criterion 'first , to do no harm ' , and will continue to do so , but there is a need for precise standards to be laid down by the Member States .
Government authorities , for their part , have powers of supervision and guidance , and may also become important customers for applications such as public information , health , education and regional planning , applications that may involve them at both local and national level .
Finally , I congratulate Mr Hoppenstedt on his report and on his vigorous efforts to strengthen the role of the European Parliament in this decision .
Our message comprises , first and foremost , total support for the Commission 's initiative .
The Community programmes have aroused much interest and offered hope to many young people , and the Council may have to face up to the risk of disappointing them by denying them the funds to bring those hopes to fruition
