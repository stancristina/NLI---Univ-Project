to say that I have worked with many administrations in my life , and rarely have I encountered such hard-working , high-calibre employees as I have observed in the EU institutions .
We have , of course , produced an estimate of resources which does not exceed the limits of the budget - we have remained strictly within the limits of the budget - but we have estimated the resources needed at EUR 140 million for the years 2004 to 2006 , and at EUR 250 million for a multiannual cooperation programme with non-Member countries over the period 2004 to 2008 .
Indeed , the main thing is to strike a balance between security and our commitment to upholding freedoms , a commitment which we have made , which we confirm and which we can on no account go back on .
I believe that , in such a complex matter where so many different factors are involved , a report taking stock at European level could be useful to both you and us .
This is the fourth success of the Greek Presidency that I want to mention today .
The proposal adopted lays down some clear and simple conditions but avoids being overly restrictive or too formally bureaucratic , and so I feel it is a sensible measure which will have positive political effects .
There are still a number of questions on this matter which were not clearly raised at the Thessaloniki Summit .
For how much longer must they continue to be transformed into reception camps for floods of illegal immigrants ?
I am fully aware of the macroeconomic situation ; I am fully aware of the need for the European Union to adopt a clear foreign policy with regard to the developing countries too .
Nevertheless , the conclusion of the agriculture package last week is causing me some concern , for , in actual fact , we have instigated a process of dismantling our continent 's primary sector and we have , in reality , started to destroy the one genuine policy which has allowed the European Union to claim the title of Union thus far .
The first point concerns immigration .
Europe must continue to be a land which welcomes the stranger , but with strict regard for the law .
I was struck by one aspect , namely that where Europe is able to act in a united fashion - as Mrs Maij-Weggen said in her speech - the United States is ready to listen to us and to follow us .
We expected this but many sceptics did not believe it would happen : the truth is plain to see .
However , this relationship can only be maintained through dignity and strength , and we have dignity and strength only in those areas where there is no right of veto , in those areas in which we can establish our will , as happens in all other democracies .
Mr President , we Members of Parliament ourselves have adopted numerous provisions on liberalising air transport .
That is not so much because the issue continues to be addressed by 35 different reports without even the slightest attempt being made to link them , nor because , for the present phase , it has been decided to split the matter into three different regulations - one of which is not to be debated in this part-session , moreover - as because the framework which emerges is in itself highly dysfunctional , a fact which has been purposefully disregarded in the name of the urgent need to regulate the matter .
, President-in-Office of the Council .
The Italian Parliament , which has never feared the truth , has been acutely aware of the bouts of fatigue and the tendency to sell Europe short which have at times characterised our common European endeavour , and it has condemned those tendencies with frank , pro-European zeal .
As we found at the recent Summit in Thessaloniki , there is deep , shared understanding of this , set out in the very valuable document coordinated by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , Javier Solana , which seeks , in a new strategic vision , to overcome the differences that have emerged over recent months with regard to the tragic crisis in Iraq and developments in the crucial issue of the Middle East .
This ground plan has also dictated the Presidency 's goal of adhering to the timetable suggested by the Thessaloniki European Council .
Any extension of the negotiations beyond those dates would mean dissipating the precious store of constitutional wisdom developed by the Convention ; it would also involve asking European voters to elect their Parliament without knowing the institutional shape of the future Union .
The modernisation of agriculture , environmental protection , consumer protection and food safety are essential requirements for our citizens ; in these areas Italy will steer work towards the goals identified by earlier Presidencies .
Bearing in mind that situations differ from Member State to Member State , we must investigate policies to increase the level of employment among older workers and to reduce the trend towards early retirement .
In addition to the awareness-raising and information events and campaigns already organised , the Italian Presidency will endeavour to lay the foundations for legislative action to combat discrimination , for an instrument to protect people with disabilities in all aspects of daily life and give them a future of hope .
( Applause from the right ) Mr President , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union also contributes to international stability , and its responsibility in this respect starts at its immediate borders and depends on its capacity to be open to increasingly advanced forms of cooperation with neighbouring countries .
The agenda we agreed upon at Thessaloniki represents a further step forward .
