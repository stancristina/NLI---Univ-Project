There are , however , a number of issues on which I would wish to comment .
Firstly , the whole of this report is based upon innovation - and innovation relies on three very important prerequisites .
It relies on individuality , inventiveness and initiative .
We must therefore strive to avoid anything which would stifle or detract from these important three prerequisites .
The report unfortunately refers to many aspects which could be seen as just such interference and over-regulation and therefore as over-complicating the approach to the use of innovation funding .
We must avoid being too prescriptive and thus putting up artificial barriers which would prevent us reaching our goals .
We need to give incentives to enable new innovatory enterprises to flourish but we must not go down the path of over-interference .
Innovative businesses and innovative projects , by their very nature , involve risk and here , the EU , national governments , regional and local agencies can help , but , as with many innovative ideas , some are destined to fail .
Many we hope will succeed .
The trick is to know which will succeed and flourish but we should also have the strength to know that when something has failed we should not prop it up at public expense and develop a strategy that takes this into account .
I would also like to flag up that business itself should take the lead in this sort of issue , backed up , of course , with sufficient skills training provided by our universities and colleges .
All have a role to play in this important area for , in the truly global market which is now upon us , it is the new ideas - properly resourced , cogently and realistically supported - which will ensure that we in Europe can maintain our place at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and in communications technology in particular .
It is my belief that an innovative strategy such as conceived in this report and as implemented by entrepreneurs at an individual level will be the key to economic prosperity in this new millennium .
I commend the report to the House .
Mr President , as the rapporteur who dealt with the innovative measures in the former Parliament , in relation to the former Article 10 initiative , I wanted to take part in this debate to remind the new Commissioner of some of the points surrounding this which Parliament has been consistently pressing for and which we do not want to see forgotten .
We fought hard to keep the innovative measures within the new round of structural fund programmes and I am really pleased that we are here today , both confirming this and the EUR 3 million that is going to be available through agreeing the new guidelines .
I particularly want to record two findings for the Commissioner .
One is that we - and the people out there - see that the innovative measures have been a very important stepping stone for local authorities and local communities who are not really into the Structural Funds , but should be , to learn how to do it through small-scale projects and then be able to become more effective parts of mainstream programmes in future years .
We came up with a ten-point programme to say how that could be done .
When I go back to my own region , east of England , and find that not one local authority used this money in that last period , I doubt whether we have been as effective as we need to be in the future to ensure those new communities are welcomed in .
Secondly , we talked about the need to work in partnership with local government and local authorities including , for example , through the Directoria event .
Some of your officials are not so comfortable about that and I detect a moving away from it within this new set of proposals , but I warn you that that would be a step in the wrong direction .
These people are our partners .
They help us reach the people in most need within the disadvantaged regions and it is no good us making speeches about the democratic deficit in Europe and then ignoring the contribution that local authorities can make at the local level .
Finally , however , I welcome the proposals .
I believe you are trying to be flexible .
You are trying to allow regions to go away and come up with their own proposals and to come back and submit them to you .
You are right to do that and I welcome what you are seeking to do .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating my colleague , Mr Langen , on his excellent report which , as he says , was carried through the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , unanimously .
I concur with his observation that we must take account of the third report that the Commission has drawn up on world shipbuilding .
I hope that the timing of the presentation of that report to Parliament was not a ploy to encourage us to take this item off the agenda .
The committee had to vote especially to ensure that this item was on the agenda for debate today .
I am grateful that the Commissioner is here , and I hope he takes note of all the points made .
There is clear evidence of a crisis in the EU shipbuilding industry and this has been the case for some time .
The evidence is set out very effectively in the Commission report .
The conclusions seem quite clear that the principal culprit is predatory pricing from the Korean shipbuilding industry .
It is doing this to gain market share to
