be seen , as Commissioner Liikanen said , in that the question is also that we are finding ways of improving standards of environmental protection .
It really is very important in this sector because waterways , for example , lakes , are often very vulnerable and they are also stocks of drinking water .
The reasons given for protection of waters are therefore , I believe , justifiable , and the better emission norms we obtain the better things will be .
It would be very hard to tell people that they must change engines when they reach the sea .
Certain areas need special protection from noise and other emissions , and this option must exist .
This must also be a cause of concern to us when we talk about the environment and boating .
For example , boating organisations should be given the task of informing and enlightening their members with regard to what it means to be a good yachtsman , one who takes care of the environment .
Harmonisation is reasonable and necessary , as some Member States , for example , Germany , Austria and Sweden , have already decided to bring in or plan their own legislation regarding exhaust limits for recreational craft .
The rapporteur thinks it inappropriate that craft built for personal use should be included in the scope of this directive , as this would not contribute to market harmonisation .
It is a dubious notion , however , at the very least that different noise and exhaust limits should be applied according to whether a boat is meant for internal waters or the sea .
Firstly , the amendments tabled with this in mind by my esteemed colleagues Mrs Schleicher , Mrs Flemming , Mr Wieland , Mrs Emilia MÃ¼ller and Mr Bernd Lange are unrealistic in practice , as the same vessel is often taken from one water system to another , either by road or by driving it along canals or water channels .
Secondly , it is inconsistent with the idea of market harmonisation : if Amendment No 13 were approved , it would already have to be known when a boat was being manufactured whether it was to be used in fresh or salt water .
The report states with regard to vulnerable waters that the authorities in Member States may issue more stringent regulations than what is contained in this directive and that , I believe , is the correct way to proceed .
Of Europe 's hundred largest lakes , half are in Finland .
For Finland these natural features are a source of wealth that we have traditionally taken good care of , and it is therefore unnecessary under this directive to establish more stringent emission limits for our waters than for other areas .
Instead , we should urge the Commission to issue proposals for emission limits common to all waters now being decided to be made more stringent .
Mr President , I will not use up my two minutes to thank the Ombudsman - because it would be quite possible to do so - but instead I will focus attention on a matter raised in Mr Wynn 's report .
All the other institutions seem instead to be backsliding with regard to its demands , although it is the very institutions themselves these demands should be binding on .
I ardently support this view and believe that , as we are discussing opportunities for citizens to have an influence , we should at long last include citizens as participants in the decision-making process and not just as the subjects of that process .
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank Mrs Bastos and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the satisfactory way in which the opinions of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport were taken into consideration in the report on the mobility of skills .
In its opinion , however , the Committee on Culture also highlights the broader objectives of a basic education and its fundamental importance .
In 2000 the number of those who received further education at the very least varied among the Member States from 78 % right down to less than 20 % .
This year we are celebrating the millionth Erasmus student , but in reality we still have a lot of problems compensating for studies undertaken abroad .
If education systems are made more flexible it will be possible , for example , to heighten interest in mathematics and the natural sciences .
Several Member States have embarked on separate projects in these areas .
Establishing the Solidarity Fund is such an important issue , however , that more time should have been set aside to discuss it .
The threshold for the use of the aid must be kept high .
Risk factors must be addressed through insurance and preventive measures whenever possible .
It is also important that the fund should not become a new variation on the Structural Funds , to be used up on a yearly basis .
One or two questions came up after the committee debate .
I would like to say that those who have not thought about emissions trading might consider how a lobster is eaten .
The idea now of course is that emissions trading will help us find the juicy targets for reductions in emissions , ones where a reduction in emissions is cost-effective and where it really is worth the bother , and perhaps the more difficult targets can be left to last or be dealt with in other ways .
Effective means are needed to realise the Kyoto Protocol commitments .
We know that in business those that get in early often also reap the highest profits .
That way we can be sure there will be enough sellers and buyers in the market
