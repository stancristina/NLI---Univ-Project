Why can we not learn from each other ?
Nevertheless , Commissioner , I expect a great deal from your policy .
Cancer patients have considerably higher chances of survival in some countries than in others .
In that way , the European Union can make a worthwhile contribution .
Both the setting up of common platforms for donors and recipients , and the development of activities to improve safety and the quality of organs can help in this throughout the EU.
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as rapporteur of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I should like to confirm explicitly what was , in actual fact , already obvious from the previous debate .
For years , all European institutions have used Community consumer policy to illustrate that Europe is very much concerned about the care of normal people .
I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , because they are right behind us on this , and also because we managed to confine ourselves to two major additional areas of concern at the Commission ’s proposal which , incidentally , the Commissioner did an extremely good job of explaining . 1 .
It is unlikely that all Members will have a chance to talk before lunch ; as such , we will need to reach an agreement on the vote , because this is not a codecision report .
If not everyone speaks before lunch , I would suggest moving the vote to next week’s part-session in Brussels , for I think that we cannot let coincidences determine the outcome of this , and that we cannot vote on a topic of this kind with a very small number of people present .
If we , on that basis , restrict access to newcomers , the only chance Moldova has of joining is by circuitous means , according to the model of German reunification from 1990 .
For the rest , we can endorse the compromise document because , on the one hand , it does not incite violence against Transnistria and , on the other , this resolution does not seek to isolate Moldova by way of punishment for the strong position which the Communist Party has been accorded in that country by its voters .     .
The Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats propose , then , that we should make use of the cooperation between the parliamentary delegations .
Some politicians with Communist pasts may have abandoned their ideology , but are for that very reason now even less hindered than before in their manoeuvring to remain in power for the long haul or to transfer state power to their offspring .
In our relations with it , the resolution is right to insist on due account being given not only to economic relations , but also , and above all , to political prisoners , scope for opposition , democratic decision-making and human rights .     . – Mr President , African states do not owe their origins to the African people themselves , but to European colonisation .
We adopted a resolution on its neighbour Chad only yesterday .
Mr President , I have an oral amendment .
Politically speaking , that is completely ridiculous !
It is now a fact that energy policy and foreign policy are inter-related .
The present arrangements are , however , no longer consonant with the rules agreed within the WTO , in that the special treatment enjoyed by the ACP countries in comparison with other developing countries contravenes WTO rules and must therefore be brought into line with them .
The PPE-DE Group wants sufficient support measures ( for example technical assistance , capacity-building and reforms in such areas as customs and taxation ) and it wants to see cooperation on a regional basis promoted between the ACP countries .
There are emergency rules that make provision for this , and they are necessary .
I believe , though , that we are obliged to describe political parties as being , in a sound parliamentary democracy , an important link between the public and the decision-making process and that this is not to be had for free .
I would like to bring to the Commissioner’s attention the fact that this problem does not exist only in political parties .
There is no such thing as European public opinion .
It is that that will usher in a cross-border , European political debate .
Let me turn , finally , to the call for a single statute .
We believe it makes no sense to develop sanctions that affect the people of that country ; the most important thing we should do for them is to see if we can help raise awareness or make more room for pluralism in that country .
I hope that these issues will be raised at the G8 summit , but also maybe , and mainly , in the framework of the regular consultation between the European Union and Russia .
After all , Belarus ’ present plight does not come as a surprise to anyone .
Surely it cannot be considered acceptable that Putin should continue his policy straight-faced and congratulate Lukashenko , while human rights are still blatantly being violated .
That has implications for flexibility on the labour market , flexibility all through life and flexibility in working hours .
Moreover , the current budget of EUR 8.4 million that was spent last year on subsidies for European parties will be further increased , and those parties will be allowed to put these subsidies aside if they fail to spend them within the space of one year .
In many cases , politicians
