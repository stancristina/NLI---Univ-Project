and gentlemen , a parliament has many tasks .
Partly thanks to the support of the anti-fraud Commissioner , Mr Kallas , in the past year , we managed to force a number of Member States to publicise the final beneficiaries of the agricultural funds .
With respect to cigarette smuggling , I will be publishing an own-initiative report later on in the year .
I myself fear that this is only the tip of the iceberg against which the ship of the European Union is bound to shatter into pieces .
However , it would be unfair , where failing fraud control is concerned , to point the finger at Brussels alone , because the Member States are certainly just as guilty .
That is the category of very many native people who are no longer able to feel at home in their own street or their own town , and who become the victims of racist , anti-indigenous violence .
I am always impressed with the quality of the products of the European wine producers .
I would also draw your attention to other developments that have taken place in Europe .
It is moody and unpredictable in negotiations with other countries , and its people appear to be living in unimaginable unanimity and discipline , with boundless loyalty to the mysterious leader and in unrivalled mourning should that leader pass away .
The death penalty is also applied as a political instrument .
Mr President , the juxtaposition of North Korea and ‘human rights’ , words so often used by this House , is essentially shocking and should prompt us to be quiet .
People , fellow creatures of God , subject to like passions as we are , yearn for freedom of movement and , lest we forget , thought , speech and , above all , faith .     Mr President , as various speakers before me have already pointed out , freedom , our first European value , for which many of the new Member States have had to fight for half a century , is the most important human right here on earth .
Being disappointed with the level of the budgets , but happy with the quality of the outcome of the negotiations , we were able to vote in favour of the Interinstitutional Agreement .
Hours of on-going uncertainty about the Belgian Government 's voting behaviour when determining the common position on the Services Directive perfectly demonstrates the need for this .
Together with my fellow countryman , Mr van Bommel , who is a member of the Dutch Lower House , I have started a campaign to ask the Indonesian Government to be lenient and , given her special circumstances , to grant Sibel amnesty .
The first is about solvency .
The fact that the UK authorities always considered Equitable Life solvent also had repercussions on customers and authorities in other Member States .
There seems to be a large vacuum in EU legislation here .
I think that you will need to focus more on the general interest that is at stake .
The stock exchanges are an example of a sector where that is very much needed .
Similarly , the consolidation of financial institutions elsewhere demonstrates that we cannot afford to leave this matter to be dealt with at national level alone , because other interests would then come into play .
Legal uncertainty about the interpretation of competition rules is , however , something we want to avoid , and I am pleased that the Commissioner recognises this , because the Commission will , not least in the future , need to continue to take into consideration the specific characteristics of this internationally operating sector .
This is , after all , often good practice in other areas too .
Parliament would like to see guidelines drafted in the tramp sector too , because that sector , just like the other sectors , is also entitled to know where it stands .
Once again , we will be pledging our support , but the conditions are tough as nails as far as this House is concerned .     .
We appear to have some kind of blind faith in technology and that , as long as we collate as much data as possible on members of the public , we are bound to pick out a terrorist sooner or later .
Like Mrs Berès , though , I think that what we have added to the amendments for the plenary is not in conflict with that compromise .
I hope that Mr Lehne will revisit this issue – even though he does not seem to be listening at the moment – to see if he can support those .     .
The goal is , after all , to develop at the earliest opportunity a model that is as workable as possible and that can be extended worldwide .
I have taken the liberty of applying for a list of separate votes and votes in sections , in the hope of removing all Christmas baubles from the resolution .
That is why we are in favour of including NOx in emissions trading , which is what is already happening in the Netherlands , certainly if a separate system is being set up for aviation anyway .
Budget airlines already account for a quarter of European air traffic , which has , above all , resulted in the growth of regional airports .
We should , though , pull out all the stops to ensure that this trend is bucked .
In the framework of the discussion on Eurovignette , the Commission has promised to carry out a study into the internalisation of external costs for all modes of transport .
To us in this House , it would be useful to know exactly what the CO2 emission is when we travel to Brussels or Strasbourg by car , train or plane .
