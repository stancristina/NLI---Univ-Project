What we are asking for for other island regions , although they are not so far away from continental Europe , are measures similar to those provided for the outermost regions .
Firstly , education and training – and I would add mindset , since there is a huge problem here in terms of attitudes to dealing with innovation .
Others are behind us , others have been successful for a long time , but European society , or a large proportion of European society , licks its wounds constantly , it complains constantly , with the paradoxical result that those with the most wounds are the ones that end up in the worst situation .
I would like to congratulate Mrs del Castillo Vera on her excellent report and thank her for her open and inclusive attitude to drawing up this proposal .
Finally , I wish to say that innovation is green .
Secondly , I would like to refer to the need to support the research capacities of SMEs .
The fact is that a drama on this scale is incomprehensible in the present day , and I hope that the specific causes of this accident will be fully clarified so that no other family ever has to experience such a tragedy .
There is no question , however , that the Union’s greatest challenges are coming from the outside , in particular those resulting from globalisation and specifically the competition from the emerging Asian countries .
The Commission also proposes seven new extremely important cross-sectoral policy initiatives : increasing the protection of intellectual property rights and combating counterfeiting , the creation of a high-level group on competitiveness , energy and the environment and support for access to new markets for our products in a fair and reciprocal fashion .
Technological platforms are of particular importance for this objective , which are a model that has led to successes but that must find mechanisms to give SMEs access to the results of the technological platforms and to apply the latter’s innovations .     Mr President , in reality , in all of the debates on reports that have taken place today , we are discussing the same thing .
We have recently seen , for example , textiles , footwear , furniture , construction and ceramics in this kind of disadvantageous situation .
This will make it possible to harmonise river navigability , in terms both of social safety rules and of environmental rules , including the proposed non-reduction in those countries where that danger exists .
There was a text in a drawer in the Commission which was growing in the darkness , which was improving , but we did not really know what it contained .
Furthermore , the amendments voted for in committee fully conform to the proposal’s initial objective , which is to bring the legislation in force into line with the Joint Convention of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Secondly , with regard to the issue of security and the fight against terrorism , I would like to thank you for the support that you and other members of the European Council gave us at the beginning of the process of overcoming violence and achieving peace in my country , Spain .
The European Union must serve to tackle trans-national threats , such as terrorism and organised crime , and to calm the citizens ' fears about globalisation .
This seems to me to be a fundamental element in the approach we should take .
Despite what may be gleaned from the brief speech by the representative of the Council , we do not look to Washington .
We are dealing with a great jigsaw puzzle in which it is not sufficient for any State to say that no crime has taken place on their territory , if it turns out , for example , that the role played by that State in this overall plan was to give logistical support to the aircraft so that the people taking part in this great drama could rest beforehand or afterwards .
In order to be able to do this work , the investigation must continue and I would therefore say once again that we must support this report .     – Mr President , like Mr Dick Marty in the Council of Europe , Mr Fava has the courage to coordinate an investigation with a very clear objective : to establish the truth .
Thanks to the determination and rigour of the US press we know that at least 480 people are in the sinister prison at Guantánamo , with no legal guarantees .
For this year we apparently only have EUR 5 000 000 and there is no chance of any more resources until the approval of the new financial perspective next year .
So far we have just had bits and pieces of policies .
To date we have had minimal resources .
We must also consider that the flow of immigration does not necessarily have to be completely irreversible .
The countries of the South add drama to the pressure on , and the violation of , the Union 's borders .
In the mean time , Spain , Greece and the Netherlands squabble about distribution criteria : migratory pressure , kilometres of borders or the number of entries by air .
It is very important that Mr Solana go to those countries of origin and countries of transit .
The Council has not been able to reach a common position , and it does not appear that it is going to do so , while each Member State adopts unilateral measures , which are often contradictory , and then asks the Council for help , as if the Council had nothing to do with them .
I could carry on giving examples , but those will suffice .
The right to development is multi-faceted however and it means economic exchange , cultural
