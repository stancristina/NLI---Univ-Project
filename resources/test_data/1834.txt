this case , it is international companies that arrange cross-border transport from beginning to end , and this is the most attractive option for those people with a transport requirement .
We also notice that the launch of this system is far less swift than had been expected and that , alongside the new system , a second old system should remain in place .
This requires copious amounts of international decisiveness and tenacity in a number of cases .
There is also plenty to do in Europe , including the introduction of adequate infrastructure , the use of new technology , specific action programmes for market sectors and the further introduction of the polluter , that is , the user pays principle .
This is why , in my Amendment 4 , attention is drawn to this , and Member States and the Commission are urged , where necessary , to agree on a common interpretation of legal documents .
This news has brought me great joy .
You will appreciate that this has major implications for the export of these products .
What , however , will be the precise role of the EU in the near future , and when will the EU be fulfilling it ?
I would appreciate some clarity on this , which you owe us and the voters alike . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , every year , some six million people die of the effects of AIDS , malaria or tuberculosis .
Needless to say , before this House can add its signature to this regulation , which has not been workable to date , with all the underlying causes and complexities , we want firm guarantees .
The expertise is there .
In a number of other cases , we have reacted by letter and raised a number of issues .
Imagine , though , that this is done and the corresponding contracts involving the Millennium Development Goals are allowed to lapse .
I should like to draw your attention to this .
I am hoping to bid Parliament farewell on 28 August , on which day I hope to see you all again , but for now : all the very best to you all . on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , I would also like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work on this report on the statistics programme 2008-2012 .
I hope we can have a constructive debate about this improvement of governance and about these better conditions to be created instead of blaming each other and blaming the other political opposition parties for not properly providing this data .
The Commission has unfolded a number of initiatives .
That is a very positive development that should have a role to play in the area of red tape .
When we are discussing the costs of regulations , we must also concern ourselves with the compliance costs , which are ignored at the moment . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) As has already been said , Mr President , the proposal seeks to update and consolidate the existing directives and regulations on the inland transport of dangerous goods .
Why not settle for the text used in Amendment 16 , which everyone was happy with , ourselves included ?
Equally important , of course , is the role of logistics when it comes to the Union 's competitiveness .
After a lot of pleading we now have agreement on a compromise which is as neutral as possible .
Mr President , far more freight is currently carried by road than is good for the quality of our air , our protection against excessive noise , our safety and the amount of space we need .
Mr President , the importance of logistics to our society is well known .
Mr President , the European Commission puts the total economic cost of alcohol abuse in Europe at 125 000 million euros a year and estimates that it is responsible for a quarter of all crimes of violence .
There are many measures which can and should be taken .
I am very loath to announce legislation which we cannot then carry through , because that does nothing to increase confidence in our institutions .
Mr President , I talked about foetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol abuse in juveniles .
If we have those results and it appears that labelling works , I think we should consider similar action at European level .
I should also like the Council to inform us during the course of the debate whether there are any particular measures it believes are missing , particular measures it now considers necessary that have not yet been taken .
Supposing your name appears on these lists .
I should like to hear what lessons the Council has learned from these court rulings , and whether it is prepared to amend or evaluate the decision process regarding the composition of such lists , and also to look at opportunities for individuals to obtain justice .
Let me take passenger data and the agreement with the United States as an example .
I would take as an example the storage of traffic data for up to two years , which was opposed by my group but supported by the majority in this House .
It is also important for Parliament to ask questions about progress in the cooperation between Member States in a high-priority area , the fight against terrorism .
It is important in this regard to find ways of reaching out to young people who are susceptible to this kind of radicalisation .
An appropriate policy here is one of repression : tackling those who incite others to violence , tackling virtual Internet networks that incite young people to extreme behaviour , and also containing groups via a preventive policy .
