I feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will , there is a way .
It has taken six years to achieve today ' s result and it is the first major conciliation decision in the social sphere - and I say major because it affects some 5 million workers .
I would like in particular to thank the Chairman of the Committee , Mr Rocard , the Vice-Chairman , Mr Provan , who used his great experience to guide the conciliation procedure , and of course , Mrs Smet who , with her wealth of ministerial experience , helped achieve such a difficult conciliation .
One of the Commission ' s fundamental duties is to monitor the implementation of directives .
Here I should like to ask the MEPs to cooperate with us and closely monitor any underhanded plans in Member States , so that the Commission can intervene immediately .
Secondly , as for road transport , the Commission tabled a proposal in 1996 , but it was blocked by the Council in 1998 .
With regard to the issue of fisheries , the matter was raised once again by Mr Hudghton .
So I would like to repeat that the issue of self-employment in fisheries is not included in this directive .
Mr President , we do indeed appear to be having problems understanding each other in this Chamber .
Will an improved intervention system providing rudimentary protection for producers be reintroduced ?
In this spirit , does the Commission believe that this phenomenon can be tackled through guile , i .e . , by increasing the quota for Italy , which is the main country responsible for mixing oil , and reducing the quota for Greece ?
The first is that in 1970 , the railways had a 20 % share of the freight market , whereas today they have just 8.5 % .
Before such a response can be given , we first need to understand the problem and we need the corresponding political will .
We need to consider the entire railway liberalisation package and combine this with interoperability .
So if we want to examine the problem in its entirety , we need to have , and to provide , the necessary responses .
This is certainly an issue which merits special mention and regulation so that the European harmonisation we are working for does not prove to be detrimental to the cross-border rail networks of countries such as Greece .
( EL ) Mr President , broadly speaking , the report tabled before plenary by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs contains a particularly positive appraisal of the Commission ' s recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States .
These results , provided that they are realised , offer a window of opportunity , a springboard from which the European economy can launch on to a course which will lead to a permanently high and ecologically sustainable rate of growth .
It goes without saying that permanently high rates of growth are the sine qua non for improving the employment situation and strengthening the competitiveness of Europe in the global economy .
The Committee on Economic Affairs takes the view that quantitative economic targets may be useful , but insists that the fixing of such targets must not undermine the goals established in the stability pact , which are the fundamental guide for the economic policies in the euro zone .
As far as financial services are concerned , having reached a broad consensus of agreement , we shall be tabling a joint amendment calling for the action plan for financial services to be applied more quickly , i .e . by 2003 rather than 2005 .
It therefore calls upon the Commission and Council to seriously consider the need for a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind the general guidelines .
I should like to stress the general acceptance of the feasibility of the objective of achieving full employment within the next decade .
This percentage is a familiar figure .
There are margins for all this , especially through the window of opportunity , if the main risk to our economy is from the probability of a crisis on the American money markets which could paralyse the private investment mechanism .
- ( EL ) Mr President , the Commission ' s recommendation for the broad economic guidelines for 2000 may well accept a return to full employment , but it has stood by the basic approach of previous years .
As far as we are concerned , the basic policy objectives should be to support public investment , stable , permanent and full employment , protect and improve the social security system and the system of social protection in general and strengthen active demand by improving the purchasing power of the workers .
- ( EL ) Ladies and gentlemen , the Pomés Ruiz report has the good fortune to assess the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes at a time when the economic climate has helped these programme achieve success .
To try and balance the budget solely by cutting expenditure , while , at the same time , wanting to reduce taxation , is something which goes beyond economic restructuring and the spirit of the Stability Pact , at least in my understanding , to limiting the involvement of the public sector in the economy .
If Mr Pomés Ruiz ' s group wishes to change the policy on the social state , it should table it clearly and not tack it on to the Stability Pact .
To say that Greece will be unable to sustain the criteria , I am sorry , but that is prejudging the facts .
- ( EL ) Mr President , the report under discussion contains accurate information and an objective assessment .
Greece is being judged , just as the first countries in EMU
