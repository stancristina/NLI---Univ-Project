So we need to find a way to introduce a measure so that every ship which calls at a European port employs a number of European seafarers .
A civil servant , obviously serving certain interests , failed to pass it on .
That is what justice means and I would like the Commissioner to find a way for the work of European seafarers to be secured and not to disappear .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the importance of the development of short sea shipping has been stressed by the European Commission , culminating in the White Paper in 2001 on European transport policy , while the European Parliament , for its part , has always been an ardent supporter of all these initiatives .
The unanimous approval of the present report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism demonstrates precisely the huge interest of all of us in the development of short sea shipping .
As an elected member for an island region of Greece , I experience the acute need of island inhabitants for better and more frequent short sea communications and transport on a daily basis .
It would be a pity if islands which have been inhabited for over 3 000 years were to be abandoned .     – Mr President , despite the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council has left and the President of the Commission is engaged in conversation , I shall say what I have to say .
Only with a series of radical measures , which also include other levels , could Lisbon become a pro-grass roots strategy .
For so-called flexible working times , which rot the social fabric , to be abolished .
This can only be achieved through radical changes to the Stability Pact and to the Lisbon Strategy .     – Mr President , the Luxembourg Presidency is , I believe , a good presidency , which already counts among its achievements the creative compromise on the Stability Pact , which allows the Member States in the eurozone to move forward on the basis of the rules of financial prudence but with the necessary degree of flexibility .
This is a very major and difficult issue .
Already the pre-accession procedure and the process of restoring capitalism have resulted in worsening unemployment , starvation wages of EUR 61 a month , inflation , poverty and drastic cuts in social services , with painful consequences for the working and grass-roots classes in the country and , on the other hand , increased profits for Euro-unifying big business .
On the contrary , arm-in-arm with the Lisbon Strategy , greater impetus is being given to big business and the demands of the Franco-German axis are being satisfied .
European policy to date has been typified by its fragmentary character , scattered actions , lack of coordination and the fact that it is out of step with the development potential of the area .
The plan will articulate the priorities of each country , seek out areas of cooperation and mutual benefit , lay down priorities and lines of action , set out and quantify requirements in basic sectors and make provision for resources to implement it .
As a minimum sign of institutional and political responsibility , I consider that all the members of the European Parliament and of the other institutions of the European Union should use the official names , the United Nations names , as Commissioner Rehn in fact did .     – Mr President , the initiative by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposing amendments on the question of the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and calling for the country to be recognised by the European Union with its constitutional name force me to take a stand from the outset on this issue alone .
This stand creates a real problem , when today we should be debating and should be helping to shape a joint , integrated European strategy for the major challenges and dangers of renewed confrontation and instability in the area of the Western Balkans .
It is the first European country when it comes to investments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , investments which have created more than 20 000 jobs .
It has demonstrated a real sense of responsibility , realism and a willingness to compromise at the UN in order to resolve the problem of the name and find a logical compromise which leaves both countries ' dignity intact .
One of these is terrorism , but it is not the only one .
I emphasise this , because even the United States did not imagine a few years ago that it would be able to tolerate them , but we can see what is happening .
Let us keep it that way , with the UN always with us .
Parliament has instituted proceedings against the Commission on this and will , I hope , win its case .
It has not reached a decision and I thank and congratulate Mr Kuhne for the importance which he attaches in his report to cooperation between our committees .
They set as an immediate priority better preparation of the European Union for new strategic interventions , jointly with ΝΑΤΟ and the United States of America or independently .
They will resist and they will not allow the implementation of this policy .
I would merely remind you that the first initiative by the European Parliament on doping was the resolution of 7 September 2000 on the Commission communication on a Community support plan to combat doping in sport and that the last major initiative was the public hearing organised by our committee just last November , entitled 'Drug-taking in sport : obstacle to the ideal of athleticism' , at which a large number of invited
