Since the start of the crisis , the unemployment rate has increased by seven million .
If the European Union needs a severe electric shock to get the economy and employment back in a virtuous circle , it must do so with similar objectives but using a method that is completely different from that of the Lisbon Strategy .
Should we not change our perspective on labour relations and the creation of the added value from which society as a whole benefits ?
The Member States , for their part , must work even harder to defend a strong position and must commit themselves to keeping up these demands on their Israeli and Palestinian partners .
It would also be a good idea to evaluate the extent to which a tax such as this could help to stabilise the financial markets .
Whether in terms of the method or in terms of what we know of the substance , I am opposed to the way in which the ACTA negotiations are being conducted .
I am also thinking of the scandalous MAI , the Multilateral Agreement on Investment , which sought to exempt multinationals from the laws in force in the countries in which they were operating .
It is regrettable that , during this vote , an amendment calling for an investigation procedure to be carried out in Colombia concerning the numerous killings of trade unionists and the mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in the region of La Macarena was not passed because of opposition from the right .
Lastly , a strong gesture from the major powers could perhaps convince countries that are currently acquiring nuclear knowhow to abandon their projects .

The criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied , and the Commission must ensure this .
I have a feeling that , in four days , certain Members of the Council have done more damage to the European project than all the Euro-sceptics put together have done in four years .
( Applause ) That is why Europe must intervene .
The debate on how to make this more evident by means of the labelling system is useful and welcome , and the report contributes certain elements and certain ideas along these lines .
As regards the European quality logo , we must also discuss and decide in this Chamber which objectives we want it to achieve .
