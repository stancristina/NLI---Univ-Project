I do not want to be cruel to you , Mr President , by asking you to read to me , out of curiosity , how paragraph 59 could end up if amended .
It is a great privilege for which we should be proud of and grateful to all the men and women who have made this day a reality .
Nevertheless , this unification – and this is something which we should all know and tell ourselves – is unfinished ; it is also pointless to deny that the happiness that we feel today – here , we , perhaps , to a certain extent the initiated – is less intense and more superficial in the streets of our cities , among the people .
This is our challenge , the challenge of our generation : awareness of the path we have travelled must guide us in order to achieve the great dream , as yet incomplete , of a great united and democratic Europe .
Therefore , we must all take action .
Today we are commemorating two of them who were not members of a government , who did not sign treaties , who did not work in the spotlight reserved for the powerful , but who were great men of vision and exponents of integration , that is , Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli .
Spinelli wrote that he and Monnet were both stubbornly slaving away : Monnet in the hope of obtaining a fresh initiative from the governments , and he in the hope of obtaining from the movement new momentum , a new bottom-up stimulus .
The draft Constitution is not perfect , but it constitutes common ground established with difficulty between governments and parliaments .
Europe then was in prison or had been murdered .
I would like to make an appeal , Mr President : ensure that the Ventotene Manifesto is published together with the draft which we are discussing , not just in all our European languages but also in Arabic and Chinese , because today there is a great need there for that dream , that history and those role models .     Mr Roche , there is a fundamental difference between work on the Constitution in the Convention and work during the Intergovernmental Conference which , I am afraid , can only have a clear , negative impact on the result .
Mr Roche said that he does not want to go into detail .
But we cannot conceive of a federation of nation-states which lacks a fundamental law governing the relationship between the institutions and the citizens : this is why it is important for us to sign as soon as possible a Constitution based on the principles of freedom , subsidiarity , centrality of people and which promotes a social market economy .
The scenario is very demanding : in fact , the outer borders will adjoin highly problematic countries , such as Ukraine and Belarus , the latter controlled by a government so authoritarian that it warranted the suspension of all official relations with it ; and then there is Russia , a major military power which is having trouble adopting a more democratic institutional shape and above all pacifying Chechnya , agreeing without delay to work on the peace plan proposed by Mr Maskhadov , to which Parliament gave its full backing ; and then in the south we have Turkey , now on the eve of negotiations which could see it accede ; and there is the Middle East , the Gulf and Maghreb and Mashreq countries .
In my opinion , this has to be a prime objective , and in 20 years ’ time we will be remembered not just for our history , our Christian roots and the beauty of our cities but also for having created a model of relations between people which is among the most advanced in our history .
Only in this way can we fight , all together , the dangers threatening the area of freedom , security and justice : illegal immigration , trafficking in human beings , prostitution , drugs and organised crime multinationals ; at the top of the list , though , is one obligation : the fight against terrorism .
This debate , however , has always been frank , open and constructive .
In this interim period we are organising the transition between the current Commission and the new 25-member Commission , which will take office in November .
First , although it does not depend directly on us , is the long-awaited decision on the European Constitution .
As you know , we have gone beyond thinking simply in accounting terms and have given the exercise a political basis , because we have to organise the political project of an enlarged Europe in line with the resources needed to carry it through .
The political project we propose is supported on three pillars : sustainable development , European citizenship and Europe’s role in the world .
Up to now the Union has focused especially on creating an economic area in which freedom of movement and common rules apply .
Ladies and gentlemen , these five years have seen great developments , and I want to highlight a few events that I feel have been particularly significant .
Although we are still awaiting the Constitution , there is no doubt that the Convention was something completely new in the way politics is done in Europe .
Ladies and gentlemen , these years spent serving the European cause have wrought profound changes in me too .
It is a very clear-cut strategy : we hope to be able to conclude negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 ; Croatia has started its fast-track move towards the Union ; as regards Turkey we have already set the timetable , as I pointed out this morning
