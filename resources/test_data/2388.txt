to fully implement the Treaty , and they have left it to the Court of Justice to make up the rules by way of rulings in individual cases .
What we would like to see , at the European Council’s Spring Summit , is a political agreement founded upon the outcome of this House’s vote .
In both the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and our own group , it has become clear that the attempt to divide us , inherent in this Bolkestein directive , has been fought off .
Both of them have grasped – and let me stress that it is a good thing that they have – that , irrespective of what fundamental decisions they try to take , decisions that will determine the future direction of the European Union , there is no getting round the European Parliament .
What are termed services of general interest – and let me say for Commissioner McCreevy’s benefit , that by these I mean services for the benefit of all and in their general economic interest – should be described and dealt with in a separate directive , for they do not belong in this one .
The common denominator is , in the final analysis , so small that it does not justify the efforts of the past years .
What matters is the text , for it is with that that the crucial progress will be made .
The mania for privatisation needs to be stopped and reversed .
There is not one single reason to reject this directive in the form in which we will be putting it to the vote , and nor , today , is there even a single reason to demonstrate against this directive in the shape in which we will be adopting it .
We therefore need to prevent even a small number giving the enlargement process or the internal market a bad image , because the internal market and enlargement are good things in themselves .
The important thing is that there should be a large majority the day after tomorrow , not only as a matter of principle , but because we all know , for example , that there is a letter from six Member States to the Commission , that there are also still some questions open in the Commission and that a large majority in Parliament will of course send the Commission and the Council a signal that they must go along with Parliament’s opinion on this .
It is not a step forward , but a step backward for European integration .
It goes without saying that all countries must satisfy these conditions equally , without any discrimination .
The Council said on that occasion that any solution must be fully consistent with European values and standards and contribute to realising the European perspective for Kosovo and the region .
For the present , however , the process must be continued coherently and we must be prepared for all eventualities .     Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , there was a material background to the Austrian Chancellor’s criticism , namely the fact that there are problems of numbers and financial problems between Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany over access to higher education , similar to those that have arisen between France and Belgium .
As well as approving the new integrated guidelines for growth and employment , which comprise the broad guidelines for economic policies and the employment guidelines , we believe it is also important to give some thought to the mutual compatibility of the Lisbon Strategy and the Bologna Process in the ongoing debate about the future of the European Union and its institutions .
Today they form the border between Russia and the European Union .
That list also shows any votes against or abstentions , explanations of vote and the voting rules .
That is the framework in which we are moving , and the priorities that follow from that will now have to be set in the negotiations .
In its contribution to the international action plan of the June 2004 International Conference for Renewable Energies in Bonn , the Council noted that EU energy policy should aim to increase the use of renewable energy sources significantly and that increased use of renewable energy , improved energy efficiency and sustainable energy use will also contribute to security of supply as complementary areas of policy .
There are still things we can all do in energy efficiency and we can improve things there ; the new Member States normally have greater potential in this area .
Will the Energy Council give its attention to the Kyoto Protocol and with the period post-2012 , and to the impact that joint implementation will have in this domain ?
That in turn means that climate protection is of the utmost significance .
With regard to world market prices and European gas prices , you should be aware that the US buys its gas at a much higher price than we do in Europe .
By the end of February , the preparatory body responsible for examining the matter , in other words the Council Working Party on Social Questions , will have discussed the proposal in six meetings .
I am quite sure that , as part of your Presidency , you are planning further measures to increase mobility and thus job security .
I know that there are best practice examples in Austria of apprentices in training having the opportunity to spend time abroad .
We are not talking about raising the drawbridge .
Many of the slogans at today 's demonstration were not up-to-date .
Threats have been issued and boycotts imposed .
Austria has also , therefore , invited the High Level Group on the alliance of civilisations – which is under the auspices of the United Nations – to hold its next meeting in Austria
