All credit to the Commission for a well-structured communication which for the first time sets out a European strategy for gender equality in development cooperation , in keeping , moreover , with the demands put forward by vast groups of women who refuse to be victims .
Defending life is sacrosanct .
The founding principles of the European Union , of respect for human rights and life , have not yet been abolished .
Secondly , the appalling crisis of the last few days should make the international community strive to find a negotiated solution which - with due respect for the UN resolutions that do exist even though no one refers to them any more - enables the Tibetan people to see their culture , their language and their religion being respected .
I think it is wrong to say that the Dalai Lama cannot do otherwise , because that implies the man is insincere , whereas he has demonstrated that he is not ; such statements can only weaken him .
We should be saying , through Mr Solana , 'sic stantibus rebus' , we are not going , rather than continuing to present this shameful spectacle .
We did not await the Olympics to express our firm condemnation of the Chinese Government for failing to respect human rights and democratic guarantees .
I would recall that we recently voted in this House against the proposal from the right and the conservatives to annul the embargo on arms sales to China .
That is why the earth 's major powers believe they should rely on China as a safety raft for their economies and tolerate its infringements of fundamental rights .
However , there is feverish external activity on the part of the Prime Minister , Fouad Siniora , and the Speaker of the Lebanese parliament , Nabih Berri .
A general strike has been called by the trade unions for 7 May , in a bid to raise minimum wages , and according to UN data , one million Lebanese out of a population of four million are living below the poverty line on less than two dollars a day .
We therefore can - and must - certainly pay attention to the diplomatic dimension , but unless we remember that in today 's Middle East , as in Europe in 1937 , 1938 and 1939 , what is being faced is on the one hand an assassination policy and on the other the political reality of victims in the name of freedom , even of enemies , I do not believe we can find the right direction , a direction that can only be given by Europe if it remembers that it was itself delivered from having to renounce national sovereignties , for which reason we have not had wars in Europe in recent years , except in Yugoslavia and elsewhere .
As Europeans we need to do what we can to try to keep Lebanon politically united , by protecting its sovereignty and encouraging dialogue between the government coalition , Hezbollah and General Aoun , starting with the presidential elections .
I believe some very significant progress was made in Bali from this point of view , given that it was decided to provide finance for the Global Environment Fund , specifically earmarking a share of the CDM to financing adaptation projects in developing countries .
The key point over the next few years will of course be dovetailing these policies with others , which calls for political resolve on the part of all players at all levels .
I am thinking of large-scale regional bodies such as the Alpine Convention and the Carpathian Convention , which are developing some very worthwhile initiatives and can be used as a model for international cooperation .
Certain African states are already thinking along these lines , and this principle of equity also indicates that we , the countries primarily responsible for the phenomenon , are shouldering our responsibility for carrying mitigation forward .
We must at the same time invest in policies to guarantee access to common goods such as water , food and healthcare resources in the areas most at risk .
The Commission is therefore called upon to review the Agency 's fee structure to bring costs and revenue for certification activities into balance .
The Commission must explain how it will ensure this money will be recovered , especially in cases where projects have not been accepted through the use of tendering procedures .
Finally , the internal report on the management of expenditure for assistants : I believe it was wrong to keep it confidential , because this has led to a whole series of articles in the press that are damaging transparency and the proper functioning of Parliament .
Will we listen to him ?
As a Group we welcome the Council 's approval of a negotiating mandate which will at last enable the Commission to negotiate the inclusion of all Member States - I repeat all Member States - in the new Visa Waiver Program as amended by the US Congress last year .
We wish at the same time to express our regret that the Washington Administration decided to launch bilateral negotiations with the countries having recently acceded to the European Union : that decision cannot be endorsed on grounds of either merit or method .
These are new instruments , and now it is not even mandatory to have authorisation from a country 's dictatorship to be able to disburse the funds .
This attempt to combine the various aspects of the problem and handle them together has to begin with the acknowledgement of a fact known to us all : 60 % of migrants arriving in Europe come by sea , and ' Fortress Europe ' has issued an approximate estimate , by default ,
