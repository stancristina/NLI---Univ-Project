Above all , we must not isolate Belarus and its people .
Regarding the situation of the media in Croatia itself , I should simply like to say that there is wide variety of printed media but that I am very seriously concerned -and this is where my criticism is aimed - that the bias of Croatian television in favour of the government is simply unacceptable .
Unlike Mr von Habsburg , I am of the opinion that we cannot just gloss over things .
The staleness of the debate is , indeed , apparent from the fact that tactical elements alone now dictate events even in supranational institutions such as the United Nations Security Council - basic political considerations are a thing of the past .

Well , this is the point we have reached : just a few days after this year 's European Disabled People 's Day we are finally getting round to addressing a subject which is very serious in both senses of the word .
Thirdly , however , I should like to point out that this is also a question of special regional features .
I advocate approval of the Commission proposal as it stands .

The words that came into my mind at the time were different : very different indeed , and more honest .
No one can be obliged against their better judgement to protect the environment or to defend social and democratic rights .
I have no time to mention many other issues , and in particular the progress which was made on prioritizing thirdpillar policies in the area of foreign affairs and security .
It will contribute to prosperity and encourage free trade ; we can all see it as something extremely positive - and we should be saying so .
