least 10 % as a European minimum level .
The level of interconnection is already 20 % in some countries , however .
The Commission is proposing that financial support for the trans-European networks must be stepped up .
This point of view is also contained in the report adopted by Parliament on cross-border exchanges in electricity .
Network operators , however , have no interest in removing bottlenecks in the supply to their neighbours .
For that reason , state intervention and EU aid to promote competition is well justified .
Concentrating EU aid on priority projects will encourage the removal of bottlenecks and boost competition , giving consumers greater choice .
We also have to ensure networks are developed in island , peripheral and remote regions .
We have to ensure that decentralised renewable energy can access the network at a reasonable cost .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for this report .
It is about a logistics system in the European Union that we are trying to build .
At the same time the production of electricity and other forms of energy will go down in relation to consumption .
This practice has worked well in the Nordic countries , and even Norway , a country outside the European Union , participates .
We must be on our guard against the emergence of monopolies and reliance on just one supplier , which would cause huge problems .
They are in Russia .
Now while the relevant Commissioner is listening attentively over there I would propose that , at the next summit between the European Union and Russia , an attempt at some sort of concrete agreement is made on energy , both gas and electrical energy , because we are very interested in both and we will be dependent on Russia for gas within 20 years or so .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , I too should like first of all to offer my heartfelt thanks to the Chairman of the Committee , as he was able , in very special circumstances , to create a unanimously agreed and comprehensive basis on which to work such as this .
For that reason , it is very important for us to be able to establish a very stable agricultural policy , one that trusts in and has faith in the future , especially as enlargement is also now a key issue .
The programmes need flexibility , for example , in determining levels of financing , so that Member States can decide how much funding they need for different actions with reference to their own individual circumstances .
Measures to achieve economic balance have been inadequate .
Differences in levels of prosperity between regions have even increased to some extent .
Commitment on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises to projects , and targeting structural actions at the most disadvantaged regions are important areas of emphasis .
Permanent handicaps due to difficult natural conditions must equally be taken into account .
If Union enlargement is to take place , cohesion policy will need to be strengthened .
As Mr Caveri said , the simplification and clarification of regional and structural policy also remain a continual challenge .
The administrative load must be lightened , for example , by switching to the 'one fund ' principle .
Together we must ensure that the whole of the area of the Union is included in the single market and enjoys the benefits which that brings with it .
Some of them regret that they will be unable to participate in the debate on the Medina Ortega report on tobacco sponsorship and advertising .
Mrs Malliori , the draftsperson of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , is on that bus and it would be regrettable if she were not here for the debate .
That is twenty-first century dictatorship .
If a country 's leader has influence over two national television channels , for example , and therefore virtually all viewers , and under his or her control there is a continually present , manipulative and mesmerising force oozing out of those channels , what we have is an information society oligarchy .
When the media drip in every home continually feeds a touted leader 's achievements by means of the results of massive Gallup polls then it is a matter of a new machine , a kind of perpetual motion that keeps itself going with a sense of its own legitimacy .
It is also wrong to say that a public service is always a monopoly .
Competition and markets do not always engender freedom or pluralism either : sometimes it is the opposite .
The markets may be self-regulating , but they just apply other sets of rules that are based on a mutual understanding and are undemocratic .
Commissioner Reding , we are calling on you to draft a directive on the concentration of media communications , and its effect on culture , diversity , freedom of speech and the rights of journalists .
Finally , Commissioner Vitorino , please look into the matter of whether or not our citizens ' democratic and cultural rights are being implemented .
We must proceed in such a way that the Commission 's original proposal is approved in its entirety as far as is possible , and I was very glad that the Commission has shown its support for the cross-party amendment to Recital 1 which we have proposed in this House .
It is with great sorrow that it has to be said that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have watered the Commission proposal down totally .
It is also to be hoped that every single amendment accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs will be rejected in this House , because they complicate the issue in many ways .
