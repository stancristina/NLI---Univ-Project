Is it not important for the Italian Presidency to find a solution that satisfies everyone ?     Mr President , Commissioner Kinnock , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , life and the world do not stop at the European Union’s external borders .
A dialogue between cultures and civilisations is , now more than ever , of crucial importance when it comes to guaranteeing peace and stability in the world .
Dialogue between cultures and civilisations must promote the generally applicable and universal value of human freedoms and rights and the defence of human dignity .
According to the Commission ’s proposal , the activities should consist of those in keeping with the annual work programme of a centre , institute or network .
Publication of the Commission ’s evaluation report is accordingly to be moved forward to 31 December 2007 , and the appropriations after the year 2006 are subject to an agreement of the budgetary authority on the financial perspective beyond 2006 .
The EU is now already providing financial and technical aid to other parts of the world .
Now already , there is a spectrum of bodies and associations engaging in regional cooperation and dialogue .
I shall start with the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulous report .
Even I as a liberal can say that it is a question of identifying structures that present obstacles to women being given the same opportunities as men .
It is therefore clear that we especially welcome this action programme and the legal basis that give the women’s organisations financial opportunities to do better work .
I think it important to say too that the activities engaged in by the European Women’s Lobby , which was founded by Mrs Lulling , is at present represented in fifteen Member States and has more than 3 000 members , should be prioritised and supported by us in this House today .
I should like to say to Mr Kinnock that it is important for the EU also to guarantee that the organisations working on gender equality are treated equally and are given financial aid for longer than the two years you propose .
Mr Sacrédeus , who unfortunately appears to have left the Chamber , has done a good job concerning the programme covered by his report .
The aid must be easy to administer and apply for ; it must be unbureaucratic ; and it must be obtainable quickly .
We want to see a limited and efficient EU dealing with cross-border problems .
There is still unfair treatment when it comes to distributing financial aid between those organisations that are part of the European Women’s Lobby and those that have chosen not to join this umbrella organisation .
The same reasoning naturally applies also to the EU’s development work and reciprocal cooperation with developing countries .
If people’s perception is that politicians and administrators are producing propaganda-style material , this may damage the European idea .
Originally , that was an amendment I tabled in the committee .
Taxpayers would thus get more from their taxes .
Certainly , international terrorism and other worldwide crime constitute an extensive threat to the Western democracies and to human dignity .
What , however , I cannot support is increased expenditure and investment in the defence area .
I am also opposed to the idea of Community support programmes to review defence equipment .
Defence issues are , and should be , ones about which the national parliaments have the sole right to take decisions .     Mr President , when the Convention was set up , it was a unique historic decision , based on the idea that – in broadly based dialogue with the people – elected representatives , governments and EU institutions should , in an open and thoughtful way , prepare the EU for enlargement and the future .
What is going on now is embarrassing .
It must grow , reform itself and engage in deeper cooperation .
They deserve a democratic , dynamic and energetic EU.
We can see how , in practice , there are quite different rules for large countries such as Germany and France and for small countries such as Portugal and Ireland .
The problem is that , in practice , the EU’s currency union and Stability and Growth Pact have nothing to offer in terms of getting growth under way and creating higher employment .
It is no coincidence that those Western European countries that are not part of the currency union enjoy , on average , very much stronger economic development than the eurozone countries .
A very large majority of Swedes voted against the common currency in a referendum in September .
There are such large areas of doubt and such major errors that , in practice , the Court of Auditors is giving the thumbs down to quite crucial areas of the EU budget .
The Court of Auditors again sets out a general reservation concerning the accounting system itself , which is obviously the most serious point on which we have to adopt a position .
There is therefore still a danger of new scandals , for the Commission clearly has no general view of the way in which the budget is implemented .
That is shown with all the clarity one could wish for by , in particular , the Eurostat scandal .
Money from the European Development Fund has been used to finance contracts between Comesa ( Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ) and CESD , the firm that defrauded Eurostat of at least EUR 3 million .
One of the main proposals by the Court of Auditors regarding the European Development Fund is that this be incorporated into the ordinary budget .
It will make it significantly simpler for people in the various Member States of the European Union to have their social rights safeguarded without administrative worries .
In the future too , it will ,
