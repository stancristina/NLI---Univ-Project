The European Parliament has always been in favour of discipline .
The report now under discussion concerns agricultural expenditure .
The ceiling for them is determined by a policy of agricultural expenditure .
Agricultural expenditure is a rather sensitive issue within the EU , as agricultural policy is the only area where the EU has a direct influence on citizens ' livelihoods .
In its practice of agricultural policy the EU has an exceptionally great responsibility .
Such a situation cannot arise , as it concerns directly a reduction in the income of individual persons and is thus a curtailment of their constitutional rights .
LFA aid and environmental aid , in particular , are important in many less favoured agricultural areas .
The environment is , however , not the main objective of an energy policy , - and should not be .
In recent years , the European Union has done much to achieve a more sustainable energy economy .
We have invested in the increased use of renewable energy resources , and we have expressed our firm desire to take account of the requirements of a sustainable energy economy in the enlargement process .
There can be no denying the contradiction there is between the speeches made here opposing nuclear power , which came from at least a couple directions , and the aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
Neither can the aim to have a common European energy tax be buried .
At the same time , we have to ensure that no model for an energy tax will prevent the very important exploitation of fuel peat in Finland in the future either .
It is , however , very general in nature , and I would like to touch on something fairly concrete in this issue .
In my own country , wood chip energy production from waste wood is now becoming very competitive and important .
It is predicted that the additional need for gas will be approximately 150 billion cubic metres in 2020 , twenty years from now .
To meet the gas consumption requirement for this region we will perhaps need four or five pipelines of additional gas .
This is precisely the problem .
At the same time , the situation in Russia is confused , though , hopefully , after the elections it will have recovered to some extent .
In other words , Russia will turn to a region where these problems do not exist .
That too has been mentioned in this report .
The recently amended SAVE and Altener programmes are the cornerstones of a sustainable and environment-friendly energy policy .
That will require research , pilot projects , exchange of experience and new technology applications .
For that reason , communications have an important part to play in the promotion of more environment-friendly production and use of energy .
This amount has to be increased if we mean to keep to our targets .
The report presents nuclear energy in too favourable a light .
In my opinion , nuclear power is not the solution to the environmental problems of energy production .
It is vital to the regions that the programmes should enter into force immediately at the beginning of the year 2000 .
Part II Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your reply .
I would still like to check that I understood correctly that these new programmes can start to be implemented , with the risk taken at national level , right from the start of 2000 , as long , obviously , as the proper applications have been made beforehand .
In fact , the leading role played by the United States is not as unproblematic as some might think .
Firstly , foreign policy must be consistent ; its different aspects must form a coherent whole that leads us in the same , and not different , directions .
I hope that you will increase transparency in the work of the Council in foreign policy also .
Keep the two operations together .
It is not necessarily a good thing to divide the tasks , with the High Representative taking responsibility for military crisis management and the member of the Commission for civil crisis management .
Thirdly , we want to lay down the condition that each operation must be independent from the others , and decisions on it must be able to be taken separately .
We cannot accept a situation where different criteria have been applied in Kosovo and in Chechnya , for example .
We have to avoid a situation where the European Union is becoming an actual pillar of NATO in Europe .
It does not imply weakness ; it may also be a resource .
To guarantee compliance with the common Treaty we should take a positive view of this kind of project .
This is not only about violations of human rights , but about barriers to equality and development .
We must also remember that yesterday , in this House , an agreement on the rights of children was discussed .
The project will focus on violence against women , a reinforcement of the attitudes towards violence , a reduction in the level of violence as well as the development and enhancement of services for victims and the perpetrators of violence .
One way to achieve these goals is to develop international cooperation , relying on an exchange of good working methods and experience , and on networking , especially within the EU.
The Russian government is also supported to the extent that we condemn terrorism in all its forms .
Our position complies with the resolutions we adopted earlier and it is also in harmony with the policy pursued by Western countries .
This is shown , for example , in the article by Prime Minister Putin , recently published in the Herald Tribune , in which he defends his government ' s action
