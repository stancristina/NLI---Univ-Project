it will never acquire a place within the European Union as long as ethnic inequality and repression continue to exist .
I have backed her in this right from the word go .
The neo-liberal model has not provided any answers in these areas , nor has it made the world a safer , or more sustainable , place .
Neither is there any room for unilateral action by transnational businesses or superpowers such as the United States or for a unilateral focus on a new arms race at the expense of public provisions including education and health care .
We , as Socialists , demand in the European Parliament that the Spanish Presidency honour this pledge .
The majority in this House has therefore repeatedly rejected the Tobin Taxes .
Unfortunately , the majority of the leaders in this world are still dictators or quasi-dictators , and it saddens me that this is sometimes overlooked .
It is in this light that we should see this , and miracle remedies such as the Tobin Tax would not be effective , because we would then be automatically funding the Mugabes of this world , which would be totally unacceptable and a waste of taxpayers ' money .
I would like to confine myself to asking the Commission the following .
I am proud that someone from my group , Rik Daems , thanks to his negotiating skills , managed to get this common position on paper at the time , which was certainly not an easy task .
We must ensure that postal companies are able and obliged to carry out this task .
The proposal that is now before us provides postal companies with the opportunity to become modern businesses within a realistic timeframe , by no later than 2009 , with a clearly defined set of tasks and with transparent accounts , businesses that put the interests of their customers before their own and fulfil a social function at the same time .
Under the influence of all kinds of developments , especially of a technological nature , these needs have changed .
In my opinion , the social dimension is useful as a guide for continuing to provide market-oriented services , even in areas where it is less evident .
Our delegation will support it accordingly .
In my view , there is a real risk that a kind of rivalry will exist between the Ombudsman and this Supervisor , because their tasks overlap .
Last night , I attended the coordinators ' meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
This is not a day too soon .
For a start , the foul methods which Palestinian terrorists use to cause death and destruction are worrying .
I concur with the Commission in terms of the priorities .
The Commission should check with all institutions whether it is still possible to find an amount of around 48 million that can be saved elsewhere .
If this is the case , we would remain within the financial perspectives and the flexibility instrument would not be needed for the time being , which means that it can be used in other areas .
For the 2003 budget , it is important to find out whether this is actually being done , whether this is being monitored and how the Commission reports to Parliament on that score .
On that basis , it is important for the Commission to take elements of this kind into consideration , to link the 2003 budget to the Green Paper and particularly to make political choices in that area , also with regard to the budget .
A common minimum framework of standards must be available by means of which the regulatory bodies of the energy markets can be granted authority and given responsibility .
We would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Commissioner and the Member States to ensure that this is achieved in Barcelona and that we do not try to frustrate the process , as we usually do - and you know which Member State I am referring to .
After all , we have seen that the instrument of reciprocity does not work .
I should like to note that liberalisation is not promoted in this way , but that new obstacles are raised , so that it is difficult for liberalisation to get off the ground .
Secondly , it is vital for long-term contracts for gas transport to be safeguarded , given the increase in demand for gas , partly as a result of the planned closure of nuclear plants , and given that important investments , for example in piping , which are indispensable to the EU 's gas supply , are necessary .
In order to achieve this , it is sometimes necessary to take measures that do not appear liberal , such as prescribing fixed rates for transmissions for all users and producers , for this is absolutely vital to grant newcomers access to the market .
Money for military ventures outside the EU territory and reparations for these wars in Serbia , Kosovo and Afghanistan is taken from previously committed funds .
As far as the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is concerned , this will not pose a huge problem since the following four points have been resolved satisfactorily .
As rapporteur Jarzembowski remarked a moment ago , there were a few minor changes submitted , including oral additions to the amendments tabled and also the change to Amendment No 12 , which have led us to achieve complete agreement .
Mr President , noise pollution around airports is always an emotive subject for the citizens who live near them , and Mr Jarzembowski who lives in Hamburg , knows this all too well .
The Commissioner had no other choice .
I do not think so
