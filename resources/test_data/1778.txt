Besides , we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is .
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers , who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries .
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued .
We are extremely hopeful that , along the lines set out by the rapporteur , Mr Swoboda , this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries , especially Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Montenegro and Kosovo and , as soon as possible , Serbia .
First , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products , on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted .
Until 1993 , the way the Commission exercised its executive powers , and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements , was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions , and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure .
Hitherto , such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically , and was of no use to our services ; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself .
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources , which it currently lacks , to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures , and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective .
Pensioners will , in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal .
Some of these differences have already been ironed out , but others persist .
These are thus extremely important questions , which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion .
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue : we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell .
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches , the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules , which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner , with this disparate agenda , with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation .
What is , on the other hand , absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community , and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible , and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement .
On the one hand , we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote , precisely so that this convention - which , I repeat , already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning , while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law .
The report contains arguments that are too disparate , which do not link together smoothly , and everything thus hinges on approximations .
He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage , and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence , both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance .
Mr President , I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom , security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become .
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account .
We need hard and fast rules .
Madam President , I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because , as I stated in this Chamber this morning , I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use .
Pensions : The document states that , ' Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems ' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy , repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments .
Agriculture and health : we see the issue differently from the Commission : in our view there are no consumers : there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health , quality and respect for the environment .
Today , we are witnessing one of these cases , which , on the surface , may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry , but which , if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union , will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole .
Sadly , in this case , he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring .
The cases we are discussing today , like many others we have discussed here -
