however , no strong arguments for implementing the far-reaching harmonisation proposed .
I am one of those who would like to reject the common position .
The European Parliament will have no insight whatsoever into , or influence upon , how this is determined .
Many companies and products will disappear and , most importantly of all , consumer choice will thus be limited .
We should encourage people to take care of themselves and take responsibility for their own health .
It has given Europe free trade , competitiveness and welfare .
There is however no need , in terms of the market , for uniform rules on the sale of vitamins and minerals .
This tradition must be respected and take precedence over the requirement for uniform rules .
I personally believe both sides are wrong .
With the help of information on the bottles , most people are able to manage their daily vitamin intake themselves .
Kidney stone patients have to be very careful about taking much more than just vitamin C and calcium .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you all for excellent teamwork for the almost a year and a half during which I have been dealing with these two reports .
The first and most important principle is that only by-products from animals approved for human consumption may be used in feed , cosmetics and medicinal products .
The common position has in fact been welcomed by the industry concerned in Europe .
Every day that passes without clear ground rules , more and more small and medium-sized companies are in danger of being forced to shut down .
We have all had to give in quite a bit , and I am a little uncertain as to what the end result of this compromise will be .
This is therefore a practical way of dealing with this issue .
The already adopted Regulation on TSEs contains clear requirements that direct risk material be marked .
Amendment No 5 is about the marking of category 2 material .
This means that we would be able to choose whether the fields were to be blue , green or purple each spring , and it would all look a bit peculiar .
It is only the final assessment based on existing rules which is affected by this regulation .
The common position contains a somewhat strange proposal regarding endangered species of necrophagous birds , namely lammergeiers in Spain .
It sounds a little odd , but sometimes nature is , by nature , odd .
Amendment 15 concerns the separation of facilities .
We are concerned here with deleting references to biogas and composting .
If we delete household waste , that is , from private kitchens , from the definition of catering waste , we are doing ourselves a disservice .
Once more I would like to thank my colleagues , the shadow rapporteurs , the Commission and the Council for excellent teamwork over the past year and a half .
Thank you for that .
I am very pleased about the principles which the European Parliament and the Council have agreed on , in other words that only by-products from animals approved for human consumption may be used as animal feed .
How can we know what mixed household waste actually consists of ?
Now we have tabled a compromise amendment , Amendment 22 , where exceptions are made for catering waste in category 3 , and we submit Amendment 25 in which some Member States are permitted to feed catering waste for a transitional period of a maximum of four years .
This means that the Council could at any time decide to permit the use of meat and bone meal once more .
Mr President , honourable Members , I would like to thank the European Parliament , and rapporteur Mrs Sornosa Mart√≠nez in particular , for the work which she and Parliament have put into this resolution .
Water quality has improved in larger rivers and many lakes but , nevertheless , the majority of Member States have either not done enough or they have acted too late .
We are currently taking proceedings against seven of the 15 Member States , and further proceedings will be brought .
This exceeds what the Commission is legally obliged to do .
It is , of course , nothing less than an historic sensation .
Who believed that we should not have to make sacrifices ?
That is why vigorous European leadership and action by the Commission is required to force the pace during these crucial months . 2002 must not be a lost year .
The oral amendment to Amendments Nos 1 and 10 is not an editorial change .
In other words , I do not approve the oral amendment .
It is national legislation that should deal with issues of food supplements , not the European Union .
Why should it be done specifically within this area ?
However , the report contains such basic shortcomings that we cannot , in the end , support it .
We believe in a vigorous civil society , of which the churches too should be a part , and do not wish to remove any right to participate in ongoing public debate .
I also think that the amendments by the social democratic MEPs extend those lines of thought , in other words in the direction of creating a little more scope for expansion and innovation .
I believe that vigorous efforts ought instead to be made to stimulate the economy and to channel public investment into education and research , something that is really needed if we are to realise the Lisbon objectives .
That is not enough .
It will only be possible to achieve a fair trade policy once the subsidies have been abolished .
