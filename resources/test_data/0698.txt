My second point concerns food .
I hope that the early warning facility , which involved a great many experts , will also be built into our ability to receive signals at an earlier stage .
The blame lies mainly with the unusually irresponsible leaders who prioritise the fight for a dry piece of land over the suffering of their own people .
Despite this , I would like to ask him what lessons he has learnt from how Europe responded this time round .
I share the Commissioner ' s view that the reproach made by Addis Ababa is misplaced to say the least .
Misplaced because this statement is made by a government which has been embroiled in an absurd war over borders with its neighbour , Eritrea , for two years now .
Mr President , in the time allocated to me , I would mainly like to focus on the Funding Conference of the Stability Pact which has just been held , because it is more beneficial , in my view , to focus attention on this than on the text of my report which , of course , was written for the Conference .
Further to this Conference , I would like to single out five key points from my report .
How are the preparations for the Stability Pact budget coming along ?
A mine-clearance programme is part of safety , is of key importance and should not be overlooked .
Who will ensure that all these tasks are carried out promptly and efficiently ?
It is precisely this cooperation which the European Union wishes to promote in the best possible way .
After all , the alternative would be that Moldavia would be in danger of finding itself in a kind of political no man ' s land .
Existing legislation , however , prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique .
Unfortunately , the Commission has not really made any headway towards fulfilling this wish .
This leads on average to higher returns .
I think he deserves tribute for this .
The fact that funds are spread over generations and risks means that the funds can invest in shares to such a high level .
Member States where supplementary schemes are under-developed compared to statutory pension schemes will feel the pinch most .
What is more , the fiscal treatment of pensions at the time when contributions are made and at the time of payout should be brought into line .
Mr Bolkestein , how do you intend to bring the discussion back to the crux of the matter , namely mobile pensions for mobile people ?
Other countries have managed to do this to a lesser extent .
Firstly , risks tied in with the second and third pillars should be sufficiently covered , because far too little has been said about this .
I hope , at the same time , to comment on the amendments which have been tabled .
Thirdly , we would propose better harmonisation for the present national consumer protection rules .
It is an important remark .
This report deals with the issue which is close to Mrs Randzio-Plath ' s heart and once again , I would strongly recommend all members attending this meeting to read it .
In fact , this is not the Commission ' s intention , even if it was authorised to take decisions in this respect , which is not the case .
In its communication on pensions , the Commission has included proposals on three fronts .
The first area is prudential rules for pension funds , and protecting pension scheme members should take centre stage .
As already stated , this does not require harmonisation ( a word we need to use with discretion because it conjures up incorrect associations in certain Member States ) so much as coordination .
Mr President , concerning the motion for a resolution , I would first of all like to remark that this Parliament ' s support is crucially important if we want to translate these proposals into specific measures .
However , I would like to point out that this issue , as is known , only and exclusively concerns the competences of the Member States and , as such , falls outside the scope of the European Commission .
I think that the European Union would not do itself any favours if the subject of the directive were to be limited to biometric risks and I can honestly see no reason why other forms of pension schemes could not be included in the same directive , as I pointed out a moment ago .
It is not up to the Commission to specify a pension product in every detail .
This is not such a bad thing , in my opinion .
It concisely outlines and highlights the key points from the Commission ' s communication on the strategy to be followed for Europe ' s internal market .
This is very commendable indeed but , rather than just creating a frame , it is more important to give substance to education .
Legislation must become simpler and must be written in a clear language .
This is , in fact , echoed in Mrs Berger ' s remarks , who stated that the internal market is not an old hat one can simply take off , the internal market is and will remain essential to European competitiveness as a forum in the world .
This is an important yet very difficult topic , which predominantly refers to the availability of risk capital , as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has also pointed out .
Moreover , I suspect that in the light of developments , which are termed the "new economy " , an increasing number of , mainly , young people , young entrepreneurs , will be encouraged to start
