We need the expertise of the Food and Agriculture Organisation , so that suitable guidelines can be issued and the importance of preventive vaccination , where possible , can be highlighted .
The transmission of epidemics is facilitated by movements of populations , environmental and social changes , globalisation and war .
It will operate in cooperation with all the existing services involved in public health , such as the World Health Organisation and the European Food Safety Authority .
For funding , Commissioner , it is vital that the Centre have its own line in the budget and appropriations which will allow it to respond to its difficult mission .
I hope that the Centre , with its small but adequate scientific operating structure , will be able to plug these gaps efficiently .
The second relates to the identification of topical public health issues and the promotion of the relevant , applied research , in order to reinforce our preventive capabilities and promote the efficiency of the coordinated action taken .
Behind it , this number conceals the abandonment of entire areas , especially in the Mediterranean countries , it conceals the increase in unemployment and migration to the towns , with all the consequential problems and with incalculable consequences for environmental protection , for which the European Commission would supposedly do anything .
He notes that agricultural incomes rose by an average of 7 % in the European Union as a whole from 1995 to 2002 .
That is because the technique of averages in a differentiated social stratum such as agriculture is the best means of muddying the waters , of hiding acute class divisions and of concealing important social problems .
Let me quote the typical example of the decoupling of subsidies from production , which the rapporteur welcomes , together with the conversion of intervention schemes to simple insurance networks and the exit of farmers from the market to become businessmen , to quote Mr Fischler .
Greek farmers in particular are anxious about their future .
We must apply a policy which secures farmers a decent income so that they can be master of their own land ; so that they have employment , prospects , a future , a productive horizon for their children .
We therefore need to follow an organised agricultural policy which will consistently and constantly lead to the strengthening of the agricultural sector .
And : - the resolution criticises the Commission on Human Rights for becoming highly politicised , obviously implying that the refusal by the majority of its members to satisfy the demands of the ΕU and the USA to condemn states and precisely serving their ideological and political expediencies ( Cuba , China , North Korea , Vietnam , Belarus etc. ) ; - it avoids firing on the USA , where executions and blatant violations of human rights are a daily occurrence ; - it proposes a 'fair ' trial for Saddam Hussein , while not only does it not propose a trial for Bush , Blair and their accomplices , it also proclaims them as guarantors of justice ; - human rights are again being 'exploited ' to pave the way for the CFSP , in other words military intervention .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , clearly the European Commission is endeavouring with its proposal to strike a balance between the increased financing requirements of enlargement and the difficulties of the short-term economy and the options of the strong Member States .
At the same time , the citizens in these regions wanted and agreed to the extensive enlargement which will be completed in a few weeks ' time .
Any thoughts of making reductions , especially large reductions , in appropriations which , it can be presumed , would have devolved upon these regions without enlargement , jeopardise the efficacy of the political cohesion which is under way and , consequently , must be treated as harmful to the credibility of the European Union .     .
As far as the Member States are concerned , we must make it clear that the Treaty makes provision during the first two years after accession for access to job markets to be the subject of bilateral agreements or national decisions by the Member States .
In all events , when we have all the information from all the Member States , we shall notify Parliament .
However , what we need to bear in mind is that any agreements will need to comply with the existing European institutional framework .
I too am extremely interested in this question .
Complaints have also been sent to the Commission and reports have been sent to the European Parliament .
When do you intend to conduct these inspections ?
Mr President , as Members said , the relocation of companies to countries with cheaper labour is a permanent phenomenon of economic history .
And I think that here it is very important to know that , of course , the final decision on a company is taken by the company 's management , but it is obliged to follow the specific directives on consultation with workers and on information , and prompt information , for them , and Community law on mass redundancies .
First , as regards direct subsidies to companies .
The question of subsidies is one aspect of the Structural Funds .
So I think that it is important in the negotiations taking place at the moment at trilateral level , between companies , workers and the Italian Government , for account to be taken of this possibility of supporting and assisting the workers via the Social Fund .     .
The demographic problem is , at the moment , at the epicentre of our three basic policies , economic policy , especially public finances , the policy on employment and the policy on social cohesion .
One relates to abolishing economic disincentives , which
