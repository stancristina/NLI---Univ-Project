Is it really necessary , in order to " supervise the supervisors " , to create a new Community bureaucracy , or would it be possible to achieve the desired objective by stepping up cooperation between the national competent authorities and between these authorities and the Commission , or by reinforcing the Commission departments responsible ?
In other words , the European Commission seems to be distrustful of the agency in advance , even though the Commission itself proposes setting it up .
Nor is there any provision for the Commission to have the right to dismiss the executive directors of these agencies .
And if my fellow members interpret this as being Piraeus , then I am not to blame ; forgive me , but Piraeus is to blame , with its impressive qualifications for the job .
The subject of our debate is maritime passenger and freight transport , which are obviously tremendously important , as our rapporteurs have stressed .
Because this sector is globalised , and has been for a very long time - it always was the most highly globalised sector - shipowners have the right to duck and dive and create conditions of immunity , frequently resulting in the terrible results which we have seen , not just with the tragic incident involving the Erika but on numerous other occasions in the Mediterranean and elsewhere , in both passenger and freight transport .
Absurd incidents based , I believe , on the fact that we do not have clear , proper , efficient , Community legislation on shipping registers .
That is why we shall pass a general vote in favour of them , while supporting certain amendments - important amendments in our opinion - which supplement or improve the texts .
Most accidents that have occurred so far are caused by tired and disheartened people , who were basically not to blame .
So we have tabled the relevant proposed amendments .
However , we disagree with the composition of its Administrative Board .
We consider this to be absolutely self-evident .
But why should this agency only be funded by persons who buy a certain quantity , 150,000 tonnes of oil or more ?
That is why we propose that it be raised to two billion .
Mr President , we have heard some interesting speeches , especially from my fellow countrymen , Mr Mastorakis and Mr Papayannakis .
What is going to be done about this ?
Neither the Greek government nor the Commission was able to say which legislation , which directives Greece is applying and if these directives are being applied for the sake of appearances - such as the directive on training - or if they are being applied in practice .
I have some doubts as to the amendments by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism on the question of the weather , which I think detract from the Commission proposal .
In all events , I think that two points need to be highlighted in Mr Sterckx 's report .
Of course , the proposal before us can - and should - act as a catalyst and encourage the relevant international agencies to take swift action on the problem in question .
The Commission communication on Europe 's oil supply , which is exceptionally important in content and most daring in form , Mr Linkohr 's report on it , the opinions of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Committee on the Environment , Public Heath and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which has done me the honour of appointing me as draftsman , are clear and , to a greater or lesser extent , all come to a number of revealing conclusions .
The present figure is 75 % and it is expected to top 85 % in 2020 .
Fourthly , the price of crude oil is expected to remain high , at least 22 to 28 dollars a barrel , and will most probably continue to rise .
Fifthly , huge numbers of people die in road traffic accidents , almost as many as the number of people who die in major wars .
Consequently , as it is a non-renewable source of energy , we should not waste it .
We also need to try and reach an agreement with OPEC on more stable prices and payment in euros rather than dollars and , at the same time , to increase our safety stocks .
However , the report under discussion makes no attempt , in my opinion , to address it from the point of view of the interests of the people of Europe .
In fact , subsequent developments proved that speculation by monopoly groups and heavy taxes in the European Union were to blame for high prices .
I think that only a fully nationalised energy agency can take charge and make proper use of existing energy sources in each country , taking account of both the economic cost and environmental protection , while safeguarding the interests of the people .
But we still have not worked out how to cut the Gordian knot around Kosovo , despite numerous attempts .
We must find a way out of this impasse .
In other words , maybe we are providing a safe haven there , from which various terrorist groups are able to organise terrorist attacks on the area with impunity ?
Perhaps we should now allow the Yugoslav army to proceed to the border with Kosovo , as provided for by the UN , perhaps this threat can be partly defused ?
So in this sense , it is good that the political efforts being made on all sides are accompanied by grim determination .
In other words , if anyone ever dreams about ethnically clean areas , they will
