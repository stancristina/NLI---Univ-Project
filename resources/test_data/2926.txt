It is normal that the allocation and use of credits should be controlled by a body that is representative and democratic – characteristics that the EDF has not , it is true to say , manifested up to now .
All those Members who have spoken have said how dear democratic principles are to them .
Change is slow , involving homeopathic remedies and often designed to bring about superficial improvements , and we cannot fail to recognise that there remain some very serious problems .
In this case , we are opposed in principle to Turkish accession .
Indeed , it is imperative that we insist on the radical reforms that the Turkish Government must implement if it is eventually to meet the Copenhagen criteria .
Even if they were achieved , how long would it then take for Turkish society to fall into line ?
It is hard to see how a country that will not face up to its history and its errors can join the European Union .
They are effectively footing the bill for the massive pollution caused during the summer by the thousands upon thousands of camper vans parked there by tourists from Northern Europe , who daily empty their waste water , infested with phosphates and even pathogenic bacteria , into the ponds of the Languedoc and Catalan regions .
New recruits will be on lower salaries and will have a lower status than has until now been the case .
The European Union could have demanded the withdrawal of all occupying forces and the transfer of sovereignty back to the Iraqi people .
Here it is at last – the long-awaited proposal for a decision establishing Regional Advisory Councils (RACs ) , which is a response to the framework regulation that provides for new ways of participating in the common fisheries policyWhile it is certainly a response , it also raises further questions .
Member States’ police forces are portrayed as ‘militias ’ made up of potential torturers ; governments are suspected of controlling and manipulating information ; there is condemnation of policies aimed at strengthening control of illegal immigration and the inexorable rise of racism and xenophobia .
We voted against Amendment No 7 , the author of which – with his outdated and chauvinistic ideas – would like to slam the EU’s door shut to Turkey .
Turkey must , furthermore , confront its past .
I voted against the report on Turkey’s progress towards accession , since , quite apart from the report’s position stating that Turkey does not fulfil the required criteria to accede , I am opposed in principle to Turkey joining the EU.
I appreciate that the House has voted in this way as part of the Helsinki decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in 1999 .
We are all aware that it has been the subject of many disagreements , but the committee has succeeded in finding a compromise .
As for the clarity and efficacy of this text , it seems to us that what Parliament is actually proposing on the subject of harmonised rates is a useful path to follow .
I admit that we are only at the communication stage at present .
The euro cannot be a complete success unless we construct the euro zone as an internal area for payment methods .
Finally , it is also necessary to have stronger Community rules to combat the funding of terrorism .
Social convergence criteria are essential in order to deal correctly with the subject of social protection linked to mobility in Europe , a subject which , to the citizens of Europe , forms the basis of the credibility of European integration .     – Alzheimer’s disease and other neuro-degenerative diseases are seriously affecting the population of Europe .

This is certainly a very sound reminder at a time when the European Union is itself becoming the world’s leading host for flags of convenience .
This has been shown clearly by the discussions of our committee .
It deplores the fact that it has been made impossible for the master of the vessel to leave Spain during his trial .
Thirdly , flags of convenience , making every effort to drive them out , and strengthening our position within the International Maritime Organisation .
The fact that even a driving time of 56 hours is regarded as an improvement for a number of lorry drivers demonstrates the greed of employers in this sector , who not only exploit their employees disgracefully but who , moreover , expose everyone to risks .
It is a hypocritical act in the face of electors who are completely baffled by it .
