Secondly , the cause .
Mr President , needless to say , airline companies , the aviation industry and tourism are the primary and most visible victims of 11 September , but let us not forget that outside tourism , many small - and medium-sized enterprises and their workers in the supply industry and in the geographical vicinity of airports , will also be directly affected by the tragedy .
DAT should also be seen as a company that is being restructured , and must have access to the same facilities which other companies would have at their disposal in the same situation .
In my opinion , the role of the Member States and of an individual approach to aviation per Member State is over .
Sabena had to restructure and do something , which happened in too painful a manner .
Member States are reluctant to relinquish this authority , and refuse to join forces at European level , and we are now paying the price for this . the Americans are able to adopt a joint policy , but we are not .
That is point one .
If that is the attitude , then we will never solve the problem , of course .
Instead of imposing a heavy fine on a small minority of payments , including mainly business payments , all payments will then attract a minor fine .
That is why the water supply should not end up in private hands .
This proves that money and prestige are still worth more than sustainable environmental management .
Riis-JÃ¸rgensen report ( A5-0373/2001 )
The European Commission remains disinclined to present fresh proposals , and the Member States implement earlier recycling agreements with a delay of years .
Furthermore , aviation firmly had the edge on railways in terms of taxes , because kerosene is still not taxed , while all forms of travel on the ground are .
Protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , before we start the debate on my report - and I hope you are also keeping an eye on the time - I should like to raise a matter in connection with the way in which we will be dealing with this report further .
That is why I would ask to postpone the vote until the next part-session .
I wanted to raise the following matter .
In addition , there are still cases where it is unclear which country ought to pay out social security benefits .
Since we are as yet unsure about the implications of this , we have to point out - as have many , as will be clear in a moment - that these days , there are an ever increasing number of categories of self-employed , including the quasi self-employed as they are referred to by some , without staff , with staff who would or would not qualify , and then especially those without staff .
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has particularly attempted to underline the legal aspects of this directive .
A moment ago , I heard Mr Pronk say that it is indeed possible that there are still a number of misunderstandings concerning amendments .
We have noticed that there are rather considerable discrepancies between them .
The request is logical in my view .
This is not the case in an increasing number of countries in the world , and that is an extremely worrying trend .
The government itself was shrouded in silence .
In any event , the dialogue with Nigeria will need to be intensified .
Increasing tension in the Middle Belt has at the same time illustrated my growing concern for the ever-widening chasm between religions that is fanning out towards the middle and south of the country .
That is unfortunate , for the Belgian Presidency could have easily played a significant role in this time of debate about Europe ' s core tasks , about Europe ' s borders and about the democratic deficit .
Overall , Nice has failed to come up with the goods , but as for the areas of competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , of whose opinion I have the honour of being the draftsman , the situation is not actually that bad .
The Council meetings must become public , allowing national parliaments to adequately monitor the Council Ministers .
We will achieve this by introducing new instruments , such as co- and self-regulation and open coordination , but , in the event of failure , we must have the assurance that we can fall back on call-back mechanisms .
That is why , on behalf of my group , I would like to convey a wish to the Council Presidency .
First of all , we must avoid a situation where the Laeken Declaration sets up scenarios whereby the competences of the European Union are cast in stone , thus not allowing Europe any room for manoeuvre where this is not explicitly provided for in the Treaty , or a scenario in which use is made of lists of competences .
Mr President-in-Office , such scenarios certainly do not meet the expectations of the citizens .
The Nice Summit , which was supposed to be the summit of truth , cannot really be described as a run-away success , certainly not in terms of its intention to properly prepare the Union ' s institutions for enlargement .
In this connection , I would call on you as Head of Government of a small country not to allow yourself to be pushed into a corner again , as was the case in Ghent and in London ,
