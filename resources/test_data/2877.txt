of true democracy in the European Union .
The wording about the principle of public access to official records looks to be very feeble .
Finally , I would like to say that I share my colleague Mrs Schörling 's criticism of the way this resolution has been dealt with .
Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference must create fresh opportunities for new internal security within the Community .
Both the exterior and internal security must be part of the new Europe .
Those who oppose more effective cross border regulations to tackle crime and keep immigration under control , create new , separate groupings which can weaken the Community 's identity and distinctiveness .
Today 's debate and our resolution is really a manifestation of Parliament 's wish for the Council of Ministers and the Commission to act .
First of all , we would like to call a conference to discuss the situation in Kosova .
During the nonproliferation conference in 1995 and the inspection conference it was decided to extend the Treaty for an indefinite period .
The work will then begin to bring about a new and effective monitoring of the non-proliferation agreement .
The Canberra Commission 's report on a nuclear free world and the official opinions of the ex-generals and ex-admirals in December 1996 as to the responsibility of the nuclear powers to work in good faith for nuclear disarmament .
These proposals could for example include combined action to be taken jointly to concentrate on the point at issue , the revision of both the agreement and its principles and aims , a new formal system for the reporting of the results achieved and any future proposals for implementing the NPT and finally that the Preliminary Conference in the year 2000 be used only to prepare for the Inspection Conference , so making it possible for the three previous preliminary conferences to discuss the point at issue .
Madam President , the European Union has so far been principally an organisation for trade , economy , markets and competition .
I was not in any way representing the Government , but a non-state organisation , Stockholm County Council , plus an environmental organisation called 'the People 's Campaign Against Nuclear Power in Sweden' .
In many areas the development has in fact gone backwards , some of these areas being the ones raised in Rio ; the question about biological diversity and the climate .
As an example I can mention that this program has been tried by the Swedish communities for every individual citizen to be able to work with environmental questions locally .
Our concern for the environment must be incorporated in all areas from transport to energy , consumption , trade and the contact with developing countries .
The European Union can become a powerful instrument in pushing forward environmental improvements within the EU and in the world at large .
This is an excellent report .
Mr President , I would like to thank rapporteur Boogerd-Quaak for an exceptional report and for the excellent co-operation while drawing up the same .
We see the costs piling up , but there are also opportunities with such a development .
As mentioned , this will affect all areas of society such as for example the pension system .
This is not the case with the current private systems which are calculated purely on a financial basis and with women often living longer than men and therefore having to pay more for their pension .
We must change society , public transport , accessibility and convert our houses to make them accessible for all people .
At the same time , society is constantly undergoing changes as a result of advances in technology .
We must of course increase the birth-rate .
In this area , different countries are at different stages and development will continue .
Finally , I would like to say this : let us not just see the problems but also the opportunities .
We are intending to discuss Ms Terrón i Curí 's report on the European Information System on Wednesday .
Instead we abstained from participating in the vote in the hope that Swedish texts would be available prior to this session .
Currently only the section covering motivation is available in Swedish , nothing else .
But from our point of view the situation is totally unacceptable , and not having access to texts in one 's mother tongue is not in line with good working practice .
I would like to emphasise one aspect of all this , namely that we did discuss whether to proceed with the debate but not the voting , despite the fact that there was no translation .
We must have the same opportunity as other nationalities to read , discuss and work .
But , a new situation has arisen since the decision taken by the technical committee on 20th March which changes the basic circumstances .
Secondly , the format of the decision is totally unreasonable , i .e . that we have a technical committee which is , in practice , creating legislation .
The Commission must also take some criticism for remaining passive on this issue and for once again taking the initiative of postponing the ban .
If the World Trade Organisation does not approve it , we can refuse to accept the decision without first attempting to fight for the introduction of such a ban on sales of this type .
It might have been thought after the BSE crisis that the matter of food safety and consumer interests would be placed very high on the agenda , but obviously this matter is not placed high enough on the Commission 's agenda .
It is in fact irresponsible of a company to release a product over which there are still some question marks and which is not totally controlled
