enabled him to achieve major , unhoped-for results - I have to stress that the present organisational model is not sustainable in the long term .
The simple , natural , effective solution is there , under our noses : the Commission , acting on a mandate from the Council , should be the voice of the Union 's economic policy .
We cannot , on the one hand , deplore the lack of effective and united European action and , on the other , be content with the weakness of the instruments available to the Community for carrying out such action .
If we are not careful to preserve the key elements of the constitutional architecture designed and executed by the founding fathers , we will reverse some of the achievements that we take for granted today such as democratic accountability , legitimacy and the rule of law .
It is now legitimate to expect a similar effort from all the other institutions .
Turning to Mr Moscovici 's questions : firstly , Mr President-in-Office , we are certainly not advocating running the risk of the Charter being rejected in Biarritz just because we are calling for it to be incorporated into the Treaties ; however , in all honesty , I cannot imagine that responsible heads of government will reject the Charter , given the high quality of its content .
Continue in this vein , speak out loud and clear at Biarritz and at Nice , draw on the wise , sensible positions adopted by the European Parliament on this matter , and this House will certainly not fail to lend you its full support .
The unprecedented method - as it has rightly been described - followed in drawing up the Charter produced rapid results , thanks to the participation of the representatives of the peoples and their governments , the involvement and achievement of consensus among all the elements of civil society which wished to express their opinions , the transparency and collegial nature of the proceedings , the willingness to listen to different positions and the acceptance of sound compromises .
The debilitating semi-secret or confidential negotiations which characterise the intergovernmental method do not produce the same results .
Only then will the citizens begin to look upon Europe as their common home .
Mr President , I have only one thing to say in response to the President of the Commission ' s speech : bravo!
It must be admitted that , after 55 years of Community life , there may well be a lack of feeling of belonging to anything other than a merely geographical Europe .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , this is an important passage in the history of Europe , in the history of the world as well as of the Union .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your kind accolade and thank you also to those who have gently reproached me for not making this speech earlier .
I would stress that this undertaking is not only legally possible but also a political necessity .
I repeat : we cannot be content with minimalist solutions .
In saying this , Mr Moscovici , I have no intention of giving the Community total control .
Everything I have said has been relevant and realistic .
I certainly do not want to go overboard on this point , but I was pleased to note that in the Sydney Olympics , the first dope-free Olympics - I am informed - and therefore Olympics which we can define in the spirit of De Coubertin , the 15 countries of the Union won 239 medals and the United States of America only 97.
Mr President , before I left for Strasbourg to come to this part-session , a pensioner from Cremona , a town in the Po Valley on the River Po , asked me to tell him when it would at last be possible to sail on the Po .
However , I would like to describe it as hope capital : it does not seem appropriate to describe as risk capital a financial initiative which is intended to improve the fate of pensioners and elderly people by making their pensions more secure .
I will always welcome and applaud support for pensioners and the elderly , from whatever quarter it comes .
In other words , we would not like the pursuance of a noble , if unsolicited goal to serve , in the medium-to-long term , not to consolidate and expand those rights which the national constitutional charters and practices fully guarantee at present , but to undermine them .
For the countries of Eastern Europe , I would say that it takes the form of a sort of compensation for all the years that they had to suffer a dictatorship , which , despite being established in Yalta , was still a dictatorship for very many years .
Mr President , Commissioner , Poland , the country for which I am rapporteur , is the largest and most important of the countries which are preparing to enter the European Union , but it is also , as we know , the most problematic , so much so that there have been rumours that it might be excluded from the first group , the group of countries which are to join the Union first .
If , for example , we place a question mark over whether it will be possible for the citizens and workers of candidate countries to move freely across the European Union right from the word go , if we want to continue to deny the citizens of Eastern Europe recognition of that right which is one of the fundamental principles of the Union , then we are further diminishing support for the difficult reforms which must take place before they can join the Union .
