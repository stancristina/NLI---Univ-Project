could of course have done a lot more , but we certainly would not have achieved what we have achieved without the Barcelona conference and without the process that came after it .
One result of all that has been deeper mutual understanding , which should lead to broader , more open contact and a chance to correct any mistakes that have been made , so that stability , peace , democracy and progress may be the outcome for us all to share . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate Mr Arif on his complex and well-structured report .
That is why I believe we need a policy of real partnership in the free movement of goods and people . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the question that we are debating , the content of which I support , is a strong appeal to the European executive to ensure that , without going back on its commitment to revive multilateral dialogue , to open markets and to lay down rules that encourage development rather than blocking it with non-tariff barriers , the Union does not take unilateral action that penalises us more than we would wish in relation not only to emerging countries but also to the major developed nations , primarily the United States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I confess , in a minute and a half , that , every time this House is asked to debate human rights , one has the worrying feeling that the debate will end up being nothing more than a rhetorical exercise .
The own-initiative report on islands in the European Union and their undeniable constraints , presented by my highly esteemed colleague , Mr Musotto , is a milestone in recognising the importance of islands within the context of Europe 's regional development .
If the islands are sustained within the undeniable constraints on their development that they still face in the shape of obstacles associated with island status , and if due consideration is taken of this in the guidelines on the Structural Funds , the European Union will be making a significant contribution to removing inequalities , or , in fact , discrimination , which is not only unjustifiable in terms of the Community acquis but antithetical to the established objective of fair and consistent development of Europe 's regions .
There is no benefit in this , but just more burdens for European taxpayers . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that we should answer the question from Mr Gahler , who wonders and asks us if there are more serious and more important issues outside and inside Nigeria .
In our complex , multicultural and multi-ethnic society , with different ideas on the concept of democracy for achieving peace , which goes hand in hand with the universal recognition of respect for human dignity , there is a need for dialogue between cultures , and in order to recognise others one must first recognise oneself , from the everyday life of individuals to that of States .
If possible , it should do so with a large majority tomorrow in Parliament and , possibly , unanimously in Council a few weeks from now .
I find it interesting that the assessments we have heard so far from Mr Lagendijk , the Council and the Commission are largely along similar lines .
Thirdly : independence is the final result which the entire population of Kosovo would like to see and to which the Lagendijk report also refers , partly as a result of the amendments which we have tabled .
With regard to labelling , on the other hand , we believe that there must be an absolute guarantee that products are organic and that therefore there must be no accidental contamination by GMOs at any stage of the production process .
An organic product where a 0.9 % threshold is allowed makes no sense and , equally , consumers would see no point in buying and spending more money on a product which no longer gives them the necessary guarantees and is not free of pollutants . on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I reject the attempt to remove a clear indication of the country of origin from product labelling , in favour of an EU label that would solely serve to hamper traceability .
Maritime safety is an issue that is too serious to be the object of tactical manoeuvres : too serious for the experiences we have already had , for the accidents that we have already suffered , and too serious for us not to predict that increasing maritime traffic will lead to greater risks in the future .
Instead , it would have been more useful to limit the scope of the directive just to copyright infringements concerning the commercial production of counterfeit multimedia products , an area in which organised crime operates .
The most worrying thing is that half of new cases involve persons under the age of 25 .
This is a directive that I believe to be very important , partly in the context of other directives , such as the directive on water , the directive on waste and the directive on soil , which is yet to be debated .
Parliament has rejected the so-called 'ethical amendments ' by a large majority ; in actual fact they were anti-science and aimed solely at delaying and preventing the adoption of legislation to make European scientific research more functional and competitive and to give patients hope
