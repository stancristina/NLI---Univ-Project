If there is to be decentralization in Brussels , each rule should include an automatic lapse after , for example , five years .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Mr President , I am very pleased about this initiative from the Commission .
Profit sharing can make employees more satisfied and motivated , put more in their pay packet and create a better psychological working environment .
Profit sharing can appear in an infinite number of variations .
Favourite children have many names .
The model which is chosen in the Member States will depend on how the labour market is set up in the country concerned .
When the Commission 's report states that there is no profit sharing in Denmark , that is incorrect , Mr Flynn .
That means in fact that wage-earners have a large stake in capital in Denmark .
We should start with the countries ' different traditions and learn from each other 's good and bad experiences .
It is also a good idea to set up a working group which should include the social partners .
In Denmark we do not believe that European legislation is necessary , but we are pleased that in this way we can put the subject on the agenda in the EU.
It would be wonderful if we could make businesses aware of the advantages of profit sharing through the exchange of experience and studies , but decisions on the introduction of profit sharing should either be left to the individual business or be made the subject of agreement between the social partners .
It is extremely happy news which has come from the Council .
The pressure which Parliament , among others , has been involved in putting on Belarus has thus helped Mr Novikov to perhaps get his rights and also his office back .
But the President-in-Office also mentioned the harassment of journalists , and I would like to ask whether he knows how many legal actions there are against journalists , because freedom of expression is being grossly suppressed in Belarus .
Madam President , this Eurodac Convention is essential in order to get the Dublin Convention to work .
The current , tragic situation of the Kurdish refugees is an example .
The issue is not who should have a right to asylum in the EU.
It is simply a matter of getting better tools to decide which Member State is responsible for dealing with an application for asylum which is submitted within the EU.
There are many tragic examples of cases where asylum seekers wait for years to get their applications processed , or are sent back and forth between different European countries because no-one wants to accept responsibility .
On the other hand , we should prevent too much cheating .
It is important that every country is obliged to take fingerprints .
That is the only way that we can prevent asylum seekers changing identity after being turned down by one Member State .
This would also be beneficial for genuine asylum seekers .
Asylum seekers have a right to data protection .
There are unfortunately many other forces aiming for that .
The changeover to sector-specific analysis means a necessary focusing which also shows the priorities in the recipient countries more clearly .
Furthermore , it is absolutely necessary to have good pilot studies , increased involvement of NGOs and recipient countries and improvements in capacity in the recipient countries .
Nor should the Commission 's problems with undermanning be doubted .
Cohesion in the EU 's policies and coordination between the Member States also promote effectiveness .
EU aid should be a supplement to aid from the Member States , even if it has its own justifications .
The evaluation requirements are too different and so the Member States should not subject themselves to the EU 's methods , even if a rapprochement makes sense .
The organizational problems have to be solved in another way , as has already been started .
On the contrary , these management committees are a quality check .
Furthermore , the reference to food aid in paragraph 7 is unfortunate because the assessment of this was highly critical and will lead to this kind of aid being restricted .
Mr President , the HIPC initiative on debt relief in developing countries marks a new approach on the part of the IMF and the World Bank .
People have recognized that debt problems are a serious impediment to healthy development in the most indebted countries .
I can only give my unreserved support to that .
Therefore debt relief should also be followed up by other forms of help to fight poverty .
Instead of allocating extra money for debt relief , people have only been able to agree to use funds from the existing budget .
We therefore need to find new funds when the remaining six countries are approved for debt relief .
Of course there have to be structural adjustments in developing countries , possibly with the inclusion of environmental and political considerations .
It is precisely in these countries that a lightening of the debt burden will make structural programmes easier to implement .
Both structural reforms and debt relief are preconditions for what really matters : relieving the poverty and the poor economic outlook .
Madam President , as is clearly apparent , the Social Democrats have also had difficulties getting to the vote concerned here .
But despite long familiarity with the matter , I am still disturbed by the way in which it has been conducted .
More and more people around Europe believe the Commission to be a closed system that refuses to adjust to its surroundings and citizens ' requirements and that it is an enormous bureaucracy where half the officials cheat and deceive while the other half endeavour to
