and helpful .
This assumes that the work on railway axis No 23 – the said Gdansk – Warsaw – Brno/Bratislava – Vienna axis – will be completed in the 2010–2015 period .
Indeed , we have tonight agreed to provide EUR 500 million more direct funding for the TEN projects and an additional EUR 500 million to obtain EIB loans .
The financial resources have already been mentioned .
The access of millions of people to health services is being restricted or complicated , and is by no means being improved or safeguarded .
From your perspective , what should the EU do to boost its contribution to global health , to overcoming HIV/AIDS and epidemics , and to combating the effects on health of hunger , shortages of drinking water and environmental degradation ?     – Mr President , the day after tomorrow , 7 April , is World Health Day , which this year is devoted to health workers .
It is important to provide sufficient resources for promoting reproductive health , which is also the reason for my appeal for majority support from the House for Amendment 5 .
In this connection , I would appeal to the Commission to adopt Parliament’s position on the Working Time Directive .     . – Mr President , let me start by extending warm thanks to Mr Cornillet for his comprehensive report on our activities over the past year , in many of which I have of course participated as first European Vice-President of the Assembly .
It is of course mainly those who sit by the fleshpots in these countries who are criminally active , but it very rapidly becomes apparent that embezzled funds have to be deposited somewhere , and that is where we in Europe come into the picture very quickly .
I would like to start with the very same aspect to which Mr Gahler referred – the highlighting of the need for action on our part even when it hurts us the most .
Were Switzerland to join the EU , that would be something I would very much welcome , since Switzerland is a byword for high standards and has distinguished itself , , by a transport policy that many Member States should take as an example of how these things are to be done .     – Mr President , speaking on behalf of the delegation of the Austrian People’s Party , I should like to make a statement of vote in relation to the Doyle report .
But at the same time , we vehemently denounce the provocations by the PKK , whose leaders deliberately stir up violence and riots .
For as long as Turkey tries to resolve this problem by military means , suppressing the civilian population and suppressing the free expression of opinions and ideas , there will be no peace in the land and hence no basis for a democratic state .
We are currently mounting sad commemorative events to remember the beginning of the genocide in Rwanda and Burundi – and we averted our eyes from those , too .
We must , then , demand in clear terms that the occupation of Iraq and the human rights violations in its prisons be brought to an end , and it is the European Parliament that must make that demand , and in very , very clear language .     . – Mr President , I have to say at the very start that I think it a scandal that Mr Pflüger had nothing whatever to say about the plight of Christians in Iraq , although that is perhaps understandable if one is aware that his party still lives off the money of another state in which Christians were subject to great persecution , that state being the GDR.
On this point I wholeheartedly endorse the line taken by Mr Cohn-Bendit .
December 1997 saw the setting-up of a fund for the sheltering of the Chernobyl reactor , the intention being that the population and the environment would be protected from further radioactive contamination .
I believe that there are three fundamental reasons for scepticism about atomic energy .
There are states around the world that are only now beginning to make civilian use of nuclear power , and it is because the risks are so great that those , too , who are opposed to nuclear energy as a matter of principle have an interest in our investing as much money as possible in the highest possible safety standards for it .
These are questions that we have to consider objectively if this process is to be of benefit not only to the two countries in question , but also to the European Union .
It is possible that we will be left with no other option but to delay this enlargement by a year , or in any case by a certain period of time .
Secondly , the Commission cannot recommend that an accession be delayed ; so it says in today’s , and the newspaper is right , for what would happen if its recommendation , for want of a few votes in the Council , was not complied with ?
You said – with specific reference to Bulgaria – that the independence of judges was not guaranteed , and that , while the first steps to combat corruption had been taken , nobody was being sentenced for it ; that not enough was yet being done to combat organised crime and that trafficking in human beings was a problem .
At the same time , though , the Council does have an interest in the continuation of support for the Palestinian people and their basic needs .
We supported the Palestinian Authority with USD 600 million a year because we wanted to influence the peace process .
As long as that ceasefire holds there is hope of bringing the two sides together again for dialogue and negotiation .
