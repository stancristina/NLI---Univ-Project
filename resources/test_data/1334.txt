Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her usual very good report .
I thank the Commissioner , whose timing is very good and so is his idea of launching this debate .
There is indeed a growing feeling of unease at the lack of coordination in European science and research .
The response has been positive , as the Commissioner knows from his contacts throughout Europe , including a recent visit to Cambridge .
We are looking forward to seeing his analysis of the results of the consultation .
There is a growing awareness in Europe of the dimensions of the threat from the very well-resourced , very well-targeted United States of America .
Frankly , the EU is not punching its weight in research , although some Member States are very good .
I would name Finland , Sweden and countries like the Republic of Ireland , which have made good progress .
Apart from industrial competitiveness , of course , as Mr Desama says , we have serious environmental and social problems which need research to put them right .
A target of 3 % of GDP on research is realistic and essential , as is the recruitment of far more scientists , including women .
Please do not underestimate the potential of the Joint Research Centre , which is itself a scientific centre for policy - a reference centre for policy - and is ideally suited to the role of networking the centres of excellence .
It is itself a centre of excellence in many areas .
I strongly support paragraphs 16 and 17 , which call for informing the European public about scientific achievements and looking at ethical questions .
We look forward to regular reports from the Commissioner about the implementation and realisation of this very exciting and essential project .
Madam President , it is totally unacceptable that a building that cost millions of pounds , and which was officially opened less than six months ago , has thousands of faults and is now found to be a potential threat to the people who work in it .
I trust that this problem will be raised in the negotiations for the final price of the building , which should strengthen Parliament ' s hand in reducing the cost for the taxpayers of Europe .
Madam President , maybe at long last we will decide that the Medical Services should not be placed in the basement .
They would prefer to be on the same floor as the plenary session and maybe we could actually look into that .
I speak as the coordinator of the ELDR Group on the Legal Affairs Committee .
The House should realise , from the fact that this matter has occupied our Committee for a period of three very long and exhaustive meetings , that it was felt to be a very complex and difficult issue to deal with .
I for one would feel it wrong for this House to try to look at this matter in a hurry , which seems to be the proposal being put forward by Mr Bar√≥n Crespo .
This is a case for absolute objectivity and attention to the rules .
As I understand the rule in question , which , Madame President , you are carefully trying to construe , there is at the moment an opinion before you from the Legal Affairs Committee but there is not a proposal as such .
The rule talks about Parliament having a right to give a view on a proposal , but it seems that you have merely an opinion , not a proposal .
If we were to take a view as a full Parliament , then we should have something more in front of us and a great deal more time and careful consideration before we enter into such a hasty vote on an issue such as this .
The debate on this dossier in the committee I have the honour to chair has been an excellent example of cooperation between different committees in Parliament and indeed of cooperation between Parliament , the Commission and the Council presidency .
When it was voted in committee on Monday night , the text and all 200 amendments were available in all languages .
I would like to repeat Mr Cox ' s call and ask if you will give this House an assurance that there will be an inquiry into why the final text was not available in French until yesterday afternoon , more than 40 hours after it was adopted in committee .
The fact is that the debate on this directive has been exemplary - it has been a credit to this Parliament and any attempt to delay that debate or to delay a vote would be a sordid political move for reasons of party political advantage .

Mr President , there was to have been a debate on the question of football violence .
The events last night in Copenhagen underline the importance of the European Parliament having this debate , as it decided to do earlier in the week .
Because of the natural difficulties about the location of the matches under Euro 2000 , the PPE-ED Group as a whole has decided not to support this resolution and to withdraw it .
On the other hand , the British delegation , which is now 36 members , has retabled the resolution in its original form .
Mr President , I ask you to rule it admissible for this debate to now take place , as was the wish of the House earlier in the week .
Mr President , I am very surprised at the order of voting
