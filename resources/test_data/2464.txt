genuine instruments does the Council wish to implement in order to respond more satisfactorily to Chinese economic pressure , which is genuine pressure ?
It is , therefore , a priority to respond within Europe , in the manner described , to the various points of view which currently exist .
I have already said that the Council has urged the Commission to put forward proposals as quickly as possible in order to take note of the necessary information , and once those proposals have been introduced to take into account the European Parliament 's opinion on this subject .
The Council cannot act independently on this subject since , according to the normal procedure , we must submit a request of this type to the Commission which the Council may consider to be of extreme urgency .
We know where the powers lie .
Excuse me if I gave that impression but this is a question of support from States themselves within the limits granted by the Brussels system .
Briefly , let us not directly link the relocation of jobs to the aid policy .
That is why I gave a very detailed reply concerning the various aspects of European Union strategy .
Because a various number of possibilities are allowed for .
All partners have approved the European Union 's coordination vis-Ã -vis the Ottawa process .
I go along entirely with your point of view and I too hope that this situation will not arise .
I am sorry that I forgot European taxpayers even though I have just visited Spain in order to discuss in detail this subject with my colleague there .
We do defend our interests on the WTO panel , but the WTO panel is a precious instrument in this area , not only for those who are accusing us today but also for the European Union .
I am afraid I cannot satisfy your demand , because I am not here to represent my country .
I told you that the interest of these two stages is first of all to ensure that there are equal competition opportunities , the so-called 'soft rights ' , before turning to a more extensive regulation which should enable us to reach an 'open skies agreement ' .
However , for the time being , I stand by the answers that I gave in respect of the support that might be given to the country .
I fully agree with the rapporteur when he declares that women should be involved in working out employment evaluation systems and collective bargaining negotiations .
Given the importance of the ICTs for creating jobs in Europe , my report contains recommendations aimed at stimulating a climate likely to help new ICT products and services develop and , does so in keeping with the fifth framework programme due to run in this sector from 1999 to 2004 .
We could , for example , learn the following lesson : development does not only have to have a technical aspect .
What important role can Europe and the Member States play ?
Only once this condition has been met can a European market come into being .
Mr President , the rapporteur rightly emphasizes the importance of a European sustainable research and development policy .
My Group attaches considerable importance to the conclusion of this report .
However , the report still presents me with a problem .
First of all , at what rate should changes be made ?
I will be supporting the amendments tabled by Mrs Plooij .
It is very annoying for Commissioner Bjerregaard that Commissioner Brittan should be here .
I should therefore like to ask if and when I can expect a reply .
I visited the pilot project in the Molenbeek district of Brussels , and found that to be an excellent example .
This is a vital component in Europe 's policy of integration .
She said that it was to be published in three languages : French , English and German .
If we look at the Union 's information policy - and it is something we need to talk about , it is such a disaster - there is little point in allocating more money for improving information in general if , in disseminating information about this programme , we just end up bringing disappointment to so many young people .
The rapporteur , Mr McMillan-Scott , is to be congratulated on the way in which he has drawn together the prevailing views in the European Parliament to produce a most interesting blueprint for a European policy towards China .
We must prevent individual countries from abusing the work of the ECOMOG , and any military intervention must be properly orchestrated to ensure that the Union 's credibility is not undermined .
What is even more important , of course , is that the violence should be stopped , and this is why we need to bring pressure to bear on the government to crack down on the paramilitary groups , to protect human rights and to strengthen the power of the judiciary .
That is where the solution lies .
The European Union has ended the system of preferences for Burma , which is a positive move .
Is this not a sign that we should review what is obviously a counter-productive approach ?
Just when President Clinton announces sanctions against Burma , ASEAN does the complete opposite .
The rule of law is not some kind of luxury or idealistic goal , but the very basis on which society and the economy are to be reconstructed .
The PPE Group would like to propose the setting-up of a central office in Bosnia with powers to deal with the refugees , since it is such a complex issue and so closely tied up with the return of refugees to Croatia and Slavonia that some kind of joint clearing-house is needed to organize the whole thing , otherwise there will be chaos
