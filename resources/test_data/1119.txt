we can stop ecological deterioration , because the greenhouse effect is the reason why fires are increasing .
We have a duty to protect the environment and man .     – Mr President , according to articles in the Greek press , the six biggest Greek banks , which account for over 80 % of the Greek banking market , reported net profits of EUR 1.6 billion during the first six months of 2006 .
As the European Union has rightly identified this sector as a target sector of its unification policy , I should like to point out – and this observation is directed at the European Central Bank – that specific and effective measures need to be taken to achieve greater convergence of retail interest rates in the eurozone .     – Mr President , I wish to condemn the arrest of three journalists from three different channels in Cyprus by the occupying forces occupying 40 % of the Republic of Cyprus .
I would mention in passing that the journalists were brought before unrecognised courts and sentenced and that the fines imposed on them were paid by the Turkish Cypriot press associations .     – Mr President , on 8 September we shall be celebrating International Literacy Day .
In coordinating their efforts , the Member States and the European institutions are helping education for which the Member States have jurisdiction .
That is why the proposal formulated by the European Parliament , as contained in the rapporteur 's report , should aim both at obtaining consent to the completion of the internal market and introducing fiscal convergence on passenger car related matters .
The Commission proposes gradual abolition over five years ; the European Parliament proposes ten .
Consumers cannot be charged high annual circulation taxes due to high pollutants .
It is a huge issue .
However , is car safety not also a correct way forward ?
I should like to mention the situation in Greece .
They earn EUR 1 000 and we earn 500 ; they pay EUR 20 000 for a car and we pay 40 000 .
The poorest country in Europe , with its deficits , cannot have the most expensive cars just because certain people cannot find a different ratio .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur on his work and his efforts to achieve this resultant agreement between the institutions . Τhis result gives us all satisfaction because it expresses the will of the European Union to give visibility to the European Maritime Safety Agency for combating pollution , to give it suitable means and adequate funding .
As far as operational support is concerned , the Agency has – as already mentioned – already chosen the way in which it will act to prevent and combat pollution .
According to information from the International Maritime Organisation and other competent agencies , tens of thousands of tonnes of oil leaked into the sea and have spread along the shores of the Mediterranean to a distance of over 170 kilometres .
The murderous attacks by the Israelis caused the death of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians and caused incalculable repercussions on the local environment in general .
I do not mention this in the sense that the cleanup operation will be covered from the Agency 's reserves , but so that we have a better understanding of the real cost of this sort of pollution .
The Agency must help with additional measures rather than replace the infrastructures and activities of the Member States ; it must complement their action in dealing with disasters .
That is why it is important for us to give the EMSA , which provides the Member States with important support , the necessary financial security for it to do its job .
Finally , let us not forget that the Agency 's action complements that of the Member States .
Both Lebanon and Cyprus requested intervention by the European Union on three issues : Firstly with the provision of humanitarian assistance for refugees and displaced persons .
Firstly , we mobilised the civil protection mechanisms in the European countries , coordinated the aid mission and addressed the more specific problem of transporting humanitarian aid , given that certain countries offering aid did not have any means of transportation , which is a specific problem which needs to be examined in future .
I should also point out and emphasise the exceptional efficiency with which the Cyprus authorities and a great many volunteers dealt with this crisis , with our participation , of course .
Of these countries , Spain asked for help from the European Union and , within a few hours of the Spanish Government 's request , fire-fighting 'planes , fire engines and firemen were offered by various European countries and , with the help of the European Union , action by the Spanish Government and a change in the weather and rainfall , the fire was finally put out .
I should like to say on the subject of the fires , given that this is an issue of great interest , that the Commission is not competent for all forest-related matters : these are matters for the Member States and it is the Member States which determine the policies used to protect forests , prevent fires and address all associated , forest-related problems .
I know that in matters of civil protection from natural disasters we can never be satisfied .
On this matter I should like to thank the European Parliament for its constant support , for strengthening the civil protection mechanism , and I am certain that this evening 's debate will help in this direction .     – I believe that today 's debate is not being held so that we can express our sorrow about the phenomenon or to emphasise our support for the victims
