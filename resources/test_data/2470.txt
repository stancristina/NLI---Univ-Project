This is a category Z berth , a berth for nuclear submarines where nuclear submarines can be repaired , provided the nuclear authorities give permission .
And the independent nuclear authorities have given permission .
There is no permanent change to this berth .
This is a temporary measure to repair this nuclear submarine , and I will recall that there are three category Z berths in Spain designed for the berthing , and presumably the repairing , of American submarines .
And , of course , any repairs will be to the same standards as they are in the United Kingdom and in 40 years of having nuclear submarines the United Kingdom Navy has never had one incident .
There is a public safety plan , to which the Commission has drawn attention .
The experts say that we need to have a public safety plan for a two-mile radius which does not come into Spanish territory ; and yes , the public have been informed .
There have been meetings of trade unionists , there have been meetings of the public , there have been public statements , there have been meetings with ministers of the Government of Spain and the Government of Gibraltar and they have entered the submarine ; and our experts have gone off to Madrid in order to give information .
Never in the history of the Ministry of Defence has there been so much openness in the United Kingdom .
And on that my case rests , Mr President .
Mr President , my Group wishes to associate itself with the other supportive remarks made following Mr Galeote Quecedo 's shocking announcement of the latest murder .
We are fully in sympathy with the Spanish people and very sorry to hear about it .
This problem with the submarine has to be settled calmly and with full cooperation between all interested , relevant authorities .
Calm cooperation is the method which our Union uses .
Hence I am happy to support the call by the Commissioner for as much transparency as possible and the publication of the British Government 's letter .
I felt , listening to the Commissioner 's excellent report , growing confidence that the matter is being handled in the proper way .
The two major criteria which we have to study are the question of technical safety - a number of Members have spoken about that already - and gaining the full confidence of the public that everything is being handled in the way it should .
I am a Member who once used to represent Gibraltar as well as the constituency which I was elected to .
So I would like to say something about the overall problem .
We are all democrats here by definition .
In the Union we all try to look forward and not back to disagreements in the past .
We all support the right of self-determination .
I count my very dear Spanish colleagues among my best friends in Parliament .
Mr Galeote Quecedo and I shared a delegation earlier this year and got on very well .
So I should like to say to them that the way is open , in my opinion , for Spain to regain the sovereignty of Gibraltar if it really wishes to .
All they have to do is to gain the confidence of the Gibraltarian people who live on the Rock .
At some point there may be another referendum among the people on the Rock asking : " Under whose sovereignty do you wish to live ? "
The key is to win their votes .
The way to do it is to make the Gibraltarian people feel entirely comfortable with the idea of being part of Spain .
So do not create difficulties at the frontiers and slow things down ; do not create difficulties with air transportation ; let there be free movement of people by road , sea and air and let us solve this problem in a calm , cooperative manner and not - as one has seen in some of the resolutions tabled by the smaller groups - in an emotive manner .
I am full of confidence concerning what the Commissioner has said so far and look forward to his winding-up remarks .
Mr President , obviously the best way to avoid the threat of radioactive pollution is to do without nuclear installations entirely .
However , given that the submarine exists and is facing repairs after having undergone an extensive refit which finished just over a year ago , it is obvious that a number of important issues have been raised for the Union , not least within the context of the development of a common foreign and security policy .
Setting aside the operational purpose of the Tireless being in the Mediterranean when the leak in the pipe work of the reactor cooling system was discovered , let us look at some of the issues .
What duty of care and information is owed to a neighbouring Member State when such an incident occurs ?
Do we have the effective protocols in place ?
Should there not be a principle of access to information and the supply of information for populations potentially at risk , whether in one Member State or across borders ?
It is no longer sufficient for an educated public to simply be reassured that all is well .
They want to know on what the information is based and the nuclear and military industries have a history of paternalistic reassurance which means it is not surprising if they are not believed .
Information on this has eventually been forthcoming and independent assessment permitted , but that has been forced as a result of public intervention and the actions of the Governor of Gibraltar rather than of a feeling of responsibility due .
How are our governments to cope with their wider responsibilities in this new European
