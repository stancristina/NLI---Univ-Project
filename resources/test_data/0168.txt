The basis on which the selection was made , as I said earlier , involved no criticism of , or disrespect for , the high qualifications of the woman candidate who came before us ; it related , as I said , to the fact that the candidate chosen had a profile more particularly suited to the tasks of the post in question .
No preference on gender grounds was shown towards a man .
Mr President , following on the discussion , would Mr Kinnock like to confirm to the House that career development based on performance and merit is going to be the foundation of the reforms that we approved in this House last year ?
Will he also take the opportunity to tell us what progress he is making in introducing structured performance appraisal throughout the Commission and in his moves towards a linear career structure .
Mr President , this question , as Mr Harbour will be aware , has direct relevance to the question raised by Mrs Theorin because we believe that amongst the many other justifications for making changes , as regards appraisal and the advance towards a more linear career structure , will be to give fairer treatment to women officials , and indeed to make the Commission more attractive for the employment of women , particularly women who have family obligations .
So far as progress is concerned , on 28 February 2001 the Commission will give consideration to a series of eight detailed draft proposals which will then be submitted for consultation to all the staff , and for formal negotiations to the staff representatives , as well as to two orientation papers , one of which relates to pay and pensions and the other to the more linear career system .
We are therefore at the point - on the linear career system , on systematic appraisal and on a host of complementary activities - of making formal proposals , and of beginning detailed consultations on them .
This is with a view , by the summer break , to compiling finalised proposals either for Commission decisions - which have the force of law - or proposals to this House and the Council where amendments to the Staff Regulations are required .
The support and interest of this House is invaluable in all of these reform activities , both those relating to improvement in the gender balance and , much more widely , those seeking to ensure improvements in the efficiency of Commission staff and in professional support for them .
I hope that this support and understanding will continue .
Mr President , the Commission seeks to fulfil its obligations to maintain a reasonable gender balance , not only in managerial roles but right throughout the staff of the Commission .
The reason we do this is because this is a unique multinational and multilingual Union , and it is essential that the executive administration of the Union reflects the diversity of cultures and languages in the staffing of the Commission .
The same applies to trying to secure a much improved gender balance .
I can honestly say to the honourable gentleman that no preference is given on the basis of the sex of a person or the flag that they happen to be born under or the passport that they carry .
Consequently we will strive to maximise the premium allocated to merit , whilst trying at the same time , by a variety of practical means , to maintain an improved gender balance and also to sustain a regional geographical balance as befits our multinational organisation .
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Mr President , can I ask the Commissioner specifically : are bones for soup stock other than the vertebrae and skull perfectly safe and all right to use ?
Is osso buco , which I think is made from the shank of cattle , all right to eat and is oxtail , which is actually I suppose an extension of the vertebrae , all right to eat ?
Mr President , after three years ' work on this report it is difficult not to be a little emotional .
Having heard what has been said by my colleagues tonight , I want first of all to say how much I appreciate the kind words about the work I have done in the last three years and how delighted I am with the final outcome : a set of legislation which will provide the toughest laws on GMOs in the world .
There is no question that this House and the other European institutions will be taking their responsibilities to the people of Europe seriously when they approve this legislation tomorrow .
There is one point of confusion which I wish to clear up .
Many speakers have spoken about the problem of a moratorium .
This is an informal gentleman 's agreement , as it is called , between the Commission and the Council .
Approving our legislation tomorrow will do nothing to lift this moratorium or change the situation with regard to the moratorium .
That is a decision that has to be taken between the Member States and the Commission .
What they do will decide what happens to the moratorium , not what we do tomorrow .
What we must do tomorrow is support this piece of legislation because without it we do not go forward , we go backwards .
Without it , we do not go forward into a strong regime of legislative control , we go backwards to the old directive , the discredited directive , which is of no use to any of us .
It has caused the Commission and the Council to halt the approval of GMOs and has caused this Parliament to work for nearly three years on replacing it .
We know very well that this is just the first step in the
