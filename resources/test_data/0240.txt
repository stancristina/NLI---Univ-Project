However , it can be concluded from these repeated references to health that health protection has to be an important component of European policy .
Naturally , the individual professional organizations should then participate in deciding on appropriate training standards .
There are different situations in the different Member States .
On the other hand , we have to recognize the fact - and I know this from practical experience - that many people do not find what they are looking for in conventional medicine .
However , there is a key problem which we cannot get round , even with the best of compromise proposals .
Traditional Western medical science would be in difficulties if it could not convince people through its high quality , but had to assert its position legally through a claim to be the sole legitimate representative .
It has been my experience in the Committee on Petitions that we frequently discuss the recognition of diplomas at European level .
Although I am unable to endorse every paragraph and amendment , I broadly support Mr Lannoye 's report , and I also fully agree with the substance of the comments made by Mrs Heinisch .
What did the Council do ?
It is unacceptable that in setting up information systems such as those I have been describing this evening , the aim of which - fighting organized crime effectively - is undoubtedly a good one , the fundamental requirements of democracy should go unobserved , and civil protection and the lawful establishment of the legal foundations should not be guaranteed .
The protection of the Community 's financial interests is therefore not taken specifically into account .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have had the single market for quite some time .
Mr President , I should simply like to say that we always play by the same rules in this House , and you have restated those rules quite correctly .
The chairman of the committee and the rapporteur also agree that there has been a misunderstanding .
We shall also be supporting this report , since it is moving - albeit slowly - in the right direction , so as to eliminate the present legal uncertainty and the actual lack of safety in all EU waters .
The Commission , thank goodness , has finally complied with our request and is trying to process petitions very rapidly , but they are still being held up at the level of the Member States and the Council .
However , we are also aware of the fact that media developments are driving us as we move into the future .
One important subject - and I believe this was also a satisfactory result of our conciliation procedure - is the question of how we can make sure that , even in future , consumers continue to have access to important national , cultural and sporting events .
Therefore we must do something .
Businesses that operate across frontiers have to have a detailed knowledge of the VAT systems of the other 14 Member States and familiarize themselves with the different procedures .
Uniform and binding rules for all are essential to fair compensation .
Every opportunity must be taken to make matters easier and save costs .
Mr President , European Monetary Union is constantly being hampered by talk of postponement which , in turn , inevitably leave citizens feeling uncertain .
However , if , at the same time , it is to promote growth and employment , the Union is going to have to tackle the budgetary and fiscal policies of the individual Member States , as these inevitably have a considerable influence on the Union 's general economic position .
The roof is build out of the single currency .
A vote was then taken on the original text .
I want therefore to take up what has long existed in a peripheral region of the European Union , the Canary Islands , namely a hive-related premium .
But honey is a natural food that reaches the consumer 's table without being processed .
And so we should attach great importance to this incidental effect on the natural environment and , above all , we should attach greater political value to apiculture .
The commercial application of new techniques , which have previously been tested in European research programmes , and the measures to improve logistics and staff development reflect the fact that the programme of support is forward-looking .
That is why , in addition to this sound programme of support , we need a political effort to improve the policy framework , be this in relation to the monitoring of driving and rest periods or the implementation of external costs which we have just begun to discuss .
Funding of ECU 35 m has been made available but , in my view , that is far too small a sum .
In Austria , for example , 17 % of GDP is earned from tourism .
One thing is absolutely clear : LEADER I has already expired and we now have the LEADER II Community initiative .
That is for my colleague , Commissioner Monti .
I cannot therefore see how the attacks are linked to the new organization of the market in vegetables .
It is up to the market operator which system he chooses .
The Commission does not share that view because what is currently provided for under Spanish legislation is in fact a monopoly , with only one system being accepted .
In Germany too , we brought the warring factions together , and they reached agreement .
We have reserved for ourselves this ultimate weapon , if I may so describe it .
We are doing our best to arrive at a balanced and sensible solution .
The Spanish legislation is not doing that , it is prescribing
