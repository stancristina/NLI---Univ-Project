Afghanistan , I feel , Commissioner , Council representative , that both Europe and the United States are mistaken in their analysis of the situation ; in my view , having won the war , we are in danger of throwing away peace ; if we do not step up the UN forces ensuring the country 's security , restricting ourselves just to making Kabul secure , quite frankly , we will be paving the way for another war and fresh instability in Afghanistan .
Mr President , this is a directive which combats noise , and I was very happy to vote for it because I am against noise .
Orlando goes to the moon to search for his lost wits .
The actions carried out within the framework of the Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development 2002-2006 will , for the first time , be implemented in line with the general research objectives set by the Treaty establishing the European Community , namely : strengthening the scientific and technological basis of European industry ; encouraging it to become more competitive at international level ; promoting research activities in line with principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
I am sure that many of our number are enjoying typical , traditional regional dishes : the Italians , for example , will be eating gorgonzola , lardo di Colonnata , parmigiano reggiano , spaghetti with pesto , fettuccine with truffles , devilled chicken and so on and so forth , all traditional regional products which , I am glad to say - I know that your mouth is starting to water but be patient just a moment longer - are protected in the Schnellhardt report .
Why should we breed them just to kill them and serve them up at table ?
Nevertheless , the rapporteur also poses the question of whether - our food security system having been described as one of the most rigorous in the world - there are not too many gaps in Community legislation or whether , on the other hand , it might not impose too many rules .
Mr President , I certainly could not vote against this European Parliament document calling for greater consideration to be given to the enclave of Kaliningrad , which will soon be completely surrounded by European Union territories .
It would be possible to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and pay and increase all the pensions , giving the poor people who have nothing the means to live , but reducing the State 's less useful outlays .
That would greatly help to further improve the already excellent relations between the European Union and the United States of America .
Mr Solana , you have assured us that Europe will continue to call for a more democratic Palestinian Authority which shows greater respect for the rights of the Palestinians .
Indeed , we can delete the word 'greater '. However , this means acknowledging that the principle cause of the tragedy we have witnessed in recent months and years was the denial of freedom and democracy to the Palestinian people and all the other peoples who live in that region under the yoke of tyrannical regimes , satrapies and dictatorships .
Mr President , I too feel that it is appropriate in this debate to assess the new developments in the current tragic situation .
I , like General Morillon , would urge you to express your opinion of the Israeli government now , for it is important that Shimon Peres has made the statements you quoted , Mr Solana , but Shimon Peres must also tell us the position of the government of which he is currently part .
In our view , this is not the case , for , in terms of both effectiveness and democracy , the Council 's role should be that of co-legislator .
Now , I would just like to make one brief observation since you have mentioned transparency .
There are countless examples of this : just now , a Member mentioned the excessive expansion of our agendas , but we will not go into the details of specific cases .
Mr President , I must start by expressing my surprise and regret and , if I may , by making a formal protest at the fact that such an important subject and such a demanding report are being debated in an evening sitting under these appalling conditions .
Well then , the Lamassoure report puts forwards solutions that will bring greater consensus in all our countries on the further development of European integration .
For that very reason , I will focus in my speech on a desire I was nurturing .
Mr President , the idea that the Union 's competences should be fewer , much fewer in number than they are today but greater , much greater than they are today is one I support .
From this point of view , like many of the previous speakers , I believe that we need to acknowledge that we cannot just define the principle of subsidiarity in terms of its application to the Union/Member States relationship but that we need to go further and apply it to that relationship which we have undertaken to create as a further contribution to the Convention 's work .
The objective is to create a new Europe which will be increasingly close to the citizens .
Europe can help Albania by launching negotiations leading to the signing of an association and stabilisation agreement even before the year is out , if possible .
The world summit due to take place in less than four months ' time in Johannesburg in South Africa is certainly an opportunity for the entire international community to give practical effect to its efforts and keep its promises in the field of sustainable development
