I would like to thank all those who have contributed their work and ideas .
It would be disappointing if we were to continue to fund roads when we have decided that fewer cars should be on the road ; it would be disappointing if we were to continue to fund vehicles designed without taking account of interconnection or passive safety , or consumption not only of fuel but also of the environment ; it would be disappointing if together we were to plan to go down one route and the money and resources for which we are responsible were then to end up going down another , being spent without coordination in terms of time . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , in principle one must agree with the general objective of the directive .
Madam President , honourable Members , I believe that we should look to the future with optimism , because as far as approval of the directive is concerned , I believe that in addition to strong cooperation on the part of the Czech Presidency , there is a willingness from the Swedish Presidency to conclude a positive agreement between Commission , Parliament and Council .
In particular , they deal with the use of ITS for the safety of users , as for example in the case of intelligent signs for the visually impaired .
I therefore believe - and it looks as though Parliament shares my view - that the time has come to amend the regulation , to change the rules on access to this project , or programme , which must be granting funds that are not always used .
Let me say again , this is not just a matter that concerns Marco Polo ; it is a much broader issue .
In addition , the possibility of ensuring consistency between the Marco Polo Programme , the Logistics Action Plan and the TEN-T programme by taking the appropriate measures in order to coordinate the allocation of Community funds , in particular for Motorways of the Sea ; and the need to take into account the specific characteristics of the inland waterway sector and its small and medium-sized enterprises , for example by way of a dedicated programme for the inland waterway sector .
I would remind you that 50 % of freight services are now international , and that this is set to increase in future .
The first principle is the identification of corridors and thus of the network .
In this case , the word 'terminal ' is used in the widest sense , to include rail yards , port terminals , logistical platforms , roads , railways , and so on , which are indispensable for the proper functioning of freight corridors and the transport system as a whole .
For the rest , Parliament is sovereign .
It is an issue that concerns a huge number of citizens : a recent Eurobarometer survey showed that today 50 % of European citizens are prepared to travel to receive treatment abroad , in the hope of finding better , faster treatment for their illness , and 74 % of citizens feel that when they go abroad for treatment , this should be reimbursed by their own Member State .
The area is currently governed by national laws , and citizens are poorly informed with regard to the options , reimbursement and possible treatment abroad .
Road traffic congestion , increased CO2 emissions and road fatalities are identified as the major challenges that Europe 's transport has to overcome and I feel that ITS is a key instrument for making transport more efficient , safer and secure and environmentally cleaner , thus contributing to the development of sustainable mobility for citizens and the economy .
Previous Parliament resolutions have inspired a significant number of the initiatives introduced in the communication .
Our goal remains to focus our work more on actions that will yield more effective results in the interests of all citizens and businesses .
The negotiations that have been conducted in recent weeks have made it possible to obtain a very rapid agreement concerning these two issues .
The new directive should promote genuine and effective competition between all market participants , and at the same time ensure equal conditions for all payment services providers and a high level of consumer protection .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today Parliament will be asked to vote on a common position based on the proposal for a new regulation on animal by-products presented by the Commission .
There will also be a reduction in administrative costs , and this will enable operators to be more competitive .
For this reason , the Commission agrees with the decision by the legislator to extend the terms on the feeding of animal species protected in their natural habitats with by-products of animal origin ; whereas the current rules refer to vultures and eagles , the new regulation will also make it possible to find appropriate solutions for wolves and bears .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Commission has made a strong commitment to assisting the transition by Sierra Leone from a post-war situation to a situation of growth and development .
Furthermore , in 2008 the Commission adopted a project , funded by EUR 1 million , under the 10th European Development Fund , conceived together with the Special Court and the Sierra Leone Government .
The reason why we have requested the application of the urgent procedure is to prevent this small town from being attacked as a whole , for its fundamental rights to be swept away and for it to be consigned to the hands of the Iranian dictatorship .
