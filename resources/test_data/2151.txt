about it .
Madam President , the Structural Funds are an increasingly important field of EU expenditure .
It is up to the Member States to use these funds .
This lack of centralized administration already makes it more difficult to take proper care of the funds .
All this helps to make it unclear how it is being used .
At the same time , structural funding is used in small , scattered amounts in various areas of society , which further impedes auditing of its use .
They seek to promote cohesion and regional equality .
Only in this way can legal certainty be ensured for the Member States , citizens and the EU.
The Commission has just announced that accession negotiations are to begin with Hungary and the Czech Republic ; the third country to which the decision under consideration relates , Romania , will likewise undoubtedly join later .
The Council decision to open up the Socrates , Leonardo and Youth for Europe programmes to those countries is therefore certainly welcome and should be supported .
However , there is still a problem , at least at this stage : funding , especially in the case of Socrates .
The widening of the programme should be approved on condition that this additional funding is provided .
From the point of view of the budget as a whole , the required increase in funding for Socrates represents a small amount , but to young people both in the existing Member States and in future Member States , it is important .
I hope that these programmes can be used to assist the development of education systems by meeting the challenges of information technology and more generally improving the life of children and young people .
I support the rapporteur 's call for the programme committee to carry out a precise analysis of the measures initiated and their impact on the development both of education systems and , above all , of the situation of the young .
The challenge is a major one , so measures need to be correctly targeted and effective .
I would like to draw your attention to two matters .
Secondly , if we are going to be able to undertake comparative advertising , we will also need a comparative study .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , the European Union programmes for culture have been problematic and slow to start .
Lack of unanimity has proved a hindrance .
The Raphael programme has gone through the same difficult process and it is with that in mind that we must obviously be pleased with the results of the conciliations and with the commencement of the programme , and we thank Mr Sanz Fern√°ndez for his excellent work .
When we consider what unifies us and the underlying principle of our mutual co-operation , is it not just that common European cultural heritage in all its rich variety ?
Training for professionals in the cultural heritage sector , both in the area of new communications services and the administration of traditional professional methods is also one of the main aims of the Raphael programme .
I would like to emphasize the need for broader cooperation in all areas of culture , so as to achieve maximum benefit and synergy from the process , for example , in cooperation with the Council of Europe and UNESCO .
Mr President , all too often regional authorities fail to make use of cultural opportunities as a source of employment and innovation .
From Mr Azzolini 's excellent report it is clear that culture does not feature as part of the region 's development strategy in objective 1 programmes .
In fact that happened only after the Venice meeting .
The new applications of information technology and their use to enhance cohesion and regional equality are part of today 's culture .
The dissemination of culture and the products of culture to all people , irrespective of where they live or their social background , will require public funding .
And so I think it would be an excellent idea if , in the November conference , prominence were given to the subject of culture as a force for the creation of jobs .
Accordingly , it is society 's duty to ensure civil rights are observed .
We must ensure that the rationalization and growth of the postal markets do not supplant the postal service as a public civil and regionally equal service .
It is quite clear that the general move to enter the mail markets is not meant as a guarantee to the public and companies of a better , more competent mail service , but as a chance to engage in lucrative business .
It follows that the main interest will be large cities , where they can operate more profitably .
It will prove a costly business and a drain on revenue resources .
The transportation of post as a business purely and simply also carries with it questions of responsibility , which have not been adequately discussed .
Mrs Kokkola 's report gives a thorough and lucid description of EU policy on equality and the current , highly essential concept of mainstreaming .
Technical and rational issues have been emphasized in the aims and methodology of regional and structural funding .
These are areas where men are well entrenched through traditional career choices .
To achieve equal opportunities , areas of particular interest to women must be included in the process .
Women 's opportunities to work or receive education or training therefore undeniably depend on social services such as child care and care for the elderly , school meals , and public transport .
Mr Commissioner , this action should be undertaken right down the line from the Commission to regional cooperation panels .
This ensures that the principle of better representation by women on various bodies is safeguarded .
