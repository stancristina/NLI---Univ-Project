prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers .
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest , as required by of our government bonds , made returns of 5.2 % a year , barely half the 9.5 % annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996 .
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses .
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off .
This is what we should be concerned about here today .
Mr President , this is a vital issue for Europe .
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings .
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt ' s report brings us .
UCITS are a success story within the European Union .
They are a safe product , traded cross-border .
But it is time for the legislation to be updated .
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here .
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt ' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament .
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue .
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives .
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation .
We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans .
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives .
We must not be afraid to go forward , to react to changes in the market .
Yes , we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers .
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers .
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives .
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts , which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings .
I salute Mr Schmidt .
Mr President , I see two problems with this morning ' s debate .
Firstly , when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal .
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are .
Firstly , I welcome proposal No 1 .
It simplifies things and brings things up to date .
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report .
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1 , but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks .
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward .
Secondly , we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused .
It is difficult to understand , and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again .
If further regulation is needed , we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive .
In particular , we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether .
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals .
Finally , we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements , because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry .
Madam President , I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started , to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar .
I should like you , Madam President , to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future .
.
I welcome Mr Brok ' s report supporting with amendments the Commission ' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership .
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year .
It is , however , regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis .
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending .
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis ' .
Given the already advanced state of these two countries , compared to other applicants , this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively ' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme .

I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers .
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002 , everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro .
