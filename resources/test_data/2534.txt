I really do think that we need to have a special report on this area , and I think that instead of going on talking about these things and employing expensive consultants and a good deal more besides , we should employ people ourselves and send them out there to start the necessary process .
I know that is difficult , but we must do something about this .
All the other small-scale fraud which is happening round about should also be addressed , but it must not be our top priority .
Mr President , when I read the Commission 's Social Action Programme 1998-2000 and the Hughes report on it , an expression which is often used in Denmark came to mind : this is the thin end of the wedge .
Well , the fact is that when someone says ' A ' in the European Union , it is not long before the whole alphabet has been used .
And when a concept like 'the European social model ' is used from time to time , then in my view we have taken far too many steps in the wrong direction .
It does not exist in reality , although it certainly does in the imaginations of most of the Members of Parliament .
There is a huge gulf between fantasy and reality in this system , and everyone should face that fact before the next step is taken .
There are great differences between north and south in the EU , and these are both cultural and economic .
There is a different basis for social policy in the individual countries .
In some , it is largely geared to families and private schemes , whereas in others it is based on the public sector .
In Denmark and the rest of Scandinavia , the dominant principle is that of solidarity - and continues to be , I have to say .
This is a new and not particularly welcome trend , in my opinion .
This is a foolish and mistaken development , and one which is dangerous for democracy in our individual countries .
I refuse to accept a social principle which is based on the principles of the internal market , where it is reasons of competition which determine what kind of social policy is pursued .
And in conclusion , I would say that it must continue to be the individual Member States that decide for themselves what kind of social policy they wish to pursue in their countries .
Mr President , when you look at a report , it is important to realise that you have to read what it actually says .
However , I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Hughes on what is a very fine report .
It focuses on the challenges that we are facing in labour market policy over the coming years .
The new social action programme is different from the previous action programmes in that it does not contain any specific proposals for directives on such things as the working environment and social protection .
We do still need to improve matters there .
There are some shortcomings , for example the fact that the Commission does not mention home workers .
We should ensure that the seven million people in the Community who work at home are not treated in an inferior way to the rest of the labour market .
The section dealing with employment could also have been a little more ambitious .
That will not bring many people into work .
The Commission should therefore act to set a minimum rate for corporation tax .
Work is currently being done on drawing up a code of conduct for business taxation .
That is not enough .
So there is a need for a more ambitious and binding form of cooperation on social and labour market policy for the future .
Madam President , the common agricultural policy was established in the 1950s , when there were only six Member States .
The Commission has submitted its proposals for specific changes to the agriculture policy , and we are currently studying our attitude to the reform of the CAP in several parliamentary committees .
This will mean that prices have to fall into line with those on the world market , and that will put an end to milk quotas and stocks of surpluses .
On the contrary , future agricultural support needs to be much more targeted .
Support will also continue to be provided for areas and sectors which have special problems .
The present form of agricultural support is based on quantity rather than quality .
It takes no account of animal welfare and environmental considerations , and in my view is in fact totally out of step with the growing importance which most consumers attach to these values .
And the CAP currently swallows up more than half the EU 's total budget , and with enlargement things will become even worse .
They want to have natural systems of production which protect the welfare of animals and do not harm the environment .
This should be seen in connection with the fact that Russia depends on imports for 40 % of its food supplies .
However , it is absolutely vital - not least in the light of the discussions currently taking place on the discharge - that this measure is implemented properly .
Finally , I should like to ask the Commissioner to appreciate that the implementation of this food aid measure will be closely followed by Parliament and also by the European public , and it is crucial that these things are carried out properly .
Mr President , the world economy has changed fundamentally over the last decade .
The agreement on financial services that we are discussing today is , in our view
