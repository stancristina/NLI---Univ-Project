( EL ) Clearly the plans for the future of the EU are predicated on the intention of serving the interests of big business even better and consolidating the new imperialist order .
The broad involvement of national and European agencies being proposed does nothing to reverse or overturn this policy ; on the contrary , it ensures that they will be on board to aid and abet its implementation .
However , the results of this method have been tested in practice and proved that broader involvement did not help to consolidate or widen individual and social rights in line with modern-day requirements ; on the contrary , these rights were curtailed in line with the dictat of big business , giving rise to serious grass-roots reaction .
Madam President , I should like to change the subject and get us off this tack .
I think it is a very good sign that we shall be debating the question of refugees and immigrants during the urgent debate on Thursday , and I would be most obliged , Madam President , if you would convey these views to the Council in Laeken .
So we would be well advised to respect the institutions on the basis of which the fifteen Member States work together , to respect the independence of the judiciary and to respect the laws which apply in the fifteen Member States .
Let us be clear on one thing : there are fifteen countries here , represented by numerous parties and numerous persuasions , all are equal and of equal value , and no one has the right to tell other countries how to act , as if they were countries which did not belong to Europe .
Our farmers are fighting against the policy of quotas which limits dynamic arable farming , even of products in which the European Union and Greece are nowhere near self-sufficient , such as oil , tobacco and cotton , for which the Council even ignored a resolution by the European Parliament calling for a 50 % increase in quotas .
They are protesting about policy to date .
Particular attention is therefore quite rightly being given to making access easier for people with disabilities .
So we need to focus on measures for minority users , such as providing public telephones at fixed locations or equivalent measures for deaf or speech impaired people .
( EL ) The policy being applied by the European Union and the Member States is forcing hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) into bankruptcy every year , because they are unable to withstand the onslaught of the monopolies .
Thus , in the final analysis , no one apart from the European Investment Bank , knows which SME is being supported and what funding plans and jobs will result .
The unequal geographical distribution of this aid is also typical of growing regional inequalities between the Member States , in that over half this funding ( be it in the form of start-up aid or the guarantee mechanism ) will go to France and Germany , while in Greece , for example , this aid is non-existent because there is no venture capital market to speak of .
Mr President , Mr Alavanos 's question refers to the fatal accident in Perama , which was a most tragic incident and I should like to express the Commission 's condolences to the families of the workers who were killed .
There is a huge number of deaths every year at European level .
I ask because this is not the first time accidents have happened .
Surely these directives have a bearing on the matter ?
I have to say that it is extremely difficult for the Commission to intervene on its own and control and monitor the application of directives in all the Member States .
However , where specific charges and reports are filed , it is obviously obliged both to investigate them and to act accordingly , from nagging at governments through to bringing charges before the courts against the Member State in question if it finds that legislation is not being applied .
That is all the legislation which relates specifically to the health and safety of workers on ships .
The Greek Ministry of Labour has tabled a business plan for reforming the employment agencies .
One very important aspect of the reform of these agencies is the improvements which will be made to how statistics are collected and to the modus operandi of the employment agencies , which are the counterpart of the statistical office .
My question is this : you originally told me - I have all the information here and I do not suppose that you will question it - that it would be all done and dusted in 2001 .
Now you tell me that you have been informed , but not assured I hope , that it will be all done and dusted in 2003 , with a few extras 'tacked on ' in 2005 .
This is no longer acceptable .
There were procedures which the Greek government had to follow in terms both of social dialogue and parliamentary deadlines .
The European Commission has repeatedly made recommendations to numerous countries , wherever statistical offices have failed to harmonise with common European standards and there are problems with the statistics which they supply , and a new method is due to be introduced in 2003 , in collaboration with the EU Statistical Office so as to ensure maximum harmonisation between statistical methodologies relating specifically to the question of employment and unemployment .
As I said earlier , the European Commission has put the strategy on health and safety on its list of priorities and harmonised statistics from the EU Statistical Office will be the basis for the proper development of this strategy .
