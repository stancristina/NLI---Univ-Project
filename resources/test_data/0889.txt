The point is that if new Member States join us they may not have existing arrangements which conform with what we are proposing , and they may well need time to come into line with our arrangements and to bring about the sort of harmonisation we are proposing .
In view of the changes that we will very likely be undergoing , it would not be a very good idea to introduce permanent arrangements now , with no opportunity for a review .
That is the strongest argument in favour of having a review and therefore supporting the amendments to that effect .
There are other issues we would still like to look at , issues like energy consumption and health and safety , as they relate to summer time ; but the strongest argument is undoubtedly that we want to allow new Member States the opportunity to come into line with the arrangements .
So , I would ask Parliament , when the vote takes place , to support all these amendments so that we can have the best possible arrangements for the existing Member States and for future Member States .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the Portuguese initiative and Mrs Cerdeira 's first-class report and thank her for her open and consensual approach .
The Liberal Group feels that a very good report has emerged from the debate in committee and we will be supporting the committee amendments when we vote .
We will not be supporting subsequent amendments from either the European People 's Party or the Party of European Socialists , with the exception of Amendment No 59 .
We feel that to call on Member States to sign the European Convention of 24 November 1983 on the compensation of victims of violent crime fits better in the legislative resolution than in the body of the report on the framework decision .
It is quite clear that if we are to create and to realise the area of freedom , security and justice provided for at Tampere then we will need legal aid in cross-border cases .
I know from my own constituency of a lorry driver who was assaulted by his employers in the Netherlands and found himself unable to take them to court to gain access to justice .
Therefore , Amendment No 4 is essential .
We know , too , that we need the assumption that a victim of any nationality will be treated in the same way as a victim of the nationality of the country in which the offence takes place .
I have a constituent whose car was broken into in Brussels and who found that the Belgian police wanted to know nothing about it .
This is why we will be supporting Amendment No 14 .
We clearly need civil liberties safeguards and the recognition of the special needs of minorities and these are covered by Amendment No 25 and others .
I had in my own constituency a Swedish family attacked ; it was a xenophobically-motivated attack , their attackers believed them to be German .
I would be very interested to know whether they found it as easy to gain access to justice in Great Britain as they would have done in their own country .
Somehow , I doubt it .
So , Mr President , Liberals support this report .
We feel it is a major step towards the creation of a European legal area and will benefit millions of our citizens .
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Haug for her hard work and her success in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises .
That has been a high-order issue for the Committee on Industry , and we are very pleased with the success that she has achieved .
However , it is not just a success for the Committee on Industry and for Parliament ; it also reflects the priorities of governments in Europe .
That is the point that causes me some consternation in relation to the position adopted in this process by the Council .
My committee is very interested in the research area .
We praised Commissioner Busquin , who has exceeded our expectations in that area .
We have heard the Council say on many occasions that it wants to ensure that Europe becomes pre-eminent in research .
Then we see the Council make a significant cut in payment appropriations , so that Mrs Haug then has to make some changes .
We have heard from the Council today that it is prepared to improve the record by 3.5 % .
That is the context of the process we are engaged in .
I congratulate our rapporteur .
However , our committee is somewhat disappointed by the approach of the Council .
Mr President , first of all I support the overall budget .
It operates within the financial perspective .
We have no more important obligation than to live within our means .
I speak on what is probably the smallest line in the budget : EUR 2.9 million for the Ombudsman .
That is a very small sum of money .
It constitutes less than one cent per inhabitant of the European Union .
Let us regard it as the " citizen 's cent" .
We have to make sure that we listen to the citizens and if they have complaints , that there are procedures to redress them .
That expenditure is well-spent .
The Committee on Petitions very much hopes that its budget will now provide for a proper database so that citizens who are interested in pursuing their petitions will be able to see what progress is being made .
We hope that will be achieved .
Finally , information is an important concern for this Parliament .
We must see that we keep our information programmes .
In particular I would cite Euronews so that people can see in the media what Parliament and the Union are doing .
Mr
