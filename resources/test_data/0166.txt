I would like to briefly comment on the Commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
It is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .
Consequently , I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
On the shores of the Mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report .
She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .
We are badly behind now in this matter .
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned .
While the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the Union ' s regional policy in general .
The report shows that growth has been uneven , despite all our efforts .
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences , long distances , climates that are too cold or too hot , sparse populations and austere conditions ?
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union ' s more remote areas .
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced .
In this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development .
Mr President , Commissioner , my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report , because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work .
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided , I would say quite magnificently , the development of poor countries .
The EU really deserves such a gesture , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .
Consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .
We must give them this opportunity .
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have .
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .
Many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .
For example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this .
The form the aid takes is important .
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights : we should not just be emphasising its social dimension .
In my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .
Mr President , you said during last week ' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery , but you did not mention what that periphery was .
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner .
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production ?
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this ?
Madam President , although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support , introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union , as the first area of the world to do so , would sound the death knell for the European currency markets .
It is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax
