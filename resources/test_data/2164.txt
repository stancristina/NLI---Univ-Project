It will also further strengthen the bases of democracy .
The use of only one language , the enormous competition between university institutions and the enormous variation in quality , the constant concern to attract and retain the finest brains to which I have just referred , and the great variation in the cost of enrolment and course fees , which are as a rule quite high , characterise an education system that attracts many more students from other countries than the European university system does .
This relative scepticism , Mr President , is not a reason to vote against the excellent report by Mrs De Sarnez , or to fail to applaud the excellent initiative by the Commission .
Our first priority is the modernisation and upgrade of the Community accounting system ; this modernisation must apply to the medium and long-term objectives and in relation to the crucial and immediate correction of its worst anachronisms .
If the legislative and budgetary authority wishes to submit to the Commission proposals that it considers unfeasible , the Commission simply has to enforce its right of initiative and refuse to enshrine the proposal in law .
We shall examine the results closely .
This externalisation , however , needs to be supervised more actively , more coherently and not in a way that merely goes through the motions .
The common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics ( NUTS ) - has , since the 1970s , provided a single coherent method for the geographical division of the European Union 's territory .
As to the doubts that have been raised over the legitimacy of such Community action in an area of taxation , I think that the problem is definitively resolved with the selection of a legal basis , making it clear that this is an administrative approximation for fiscal control and to improve the internal market , and not any kind of fiscal harmonisation .
Similarly , I agree with the priority the rapporteur attaches to appointing an EU-Macao Cooperation officer to the MSAR , reiterating the position already adopted by the European Parliament and which I have called for in various questions to the Commission .

Furthermore , and in this approach of genuine subsidiarity , a while ago , I advocated in this House , the creation of a Committee on Subsidiarity in the European Parliament , to improve our ...
In 2001 alone , there were more than 42 500 accidents , with around 5 800 causing death and serious injury .
It is extremely important that the entry into force of this directive should not be retroactive and , consequently , that no provision derived from this act can be applied to drivers already working in the profession .
( PT ) The adoption of any measure intended to improve road traffic safety is greatly to be welcomed .

Scholarships that are awarded must enable all categories of candidates to participate in these exchanges .
I also wish to emphasise that this programme must genuinely enable us to create a European higher education system that is effective and recognised for the quality of its training and of the reception it provides .
This is the conclusion we are bound to draw when we see that the programme seeks to : prepare the citizens of third countries as well as Europeans to live and work in a global society based on knowledge ; strengthen Europe 's position as a centre of excellence for higher education ; promote mutual understanding between peoples and cultures through exchanges and structural cooperation .
In addition to opening up within the Union , European university education must therefore also open up to the world of third countries , thereby contributing to establishing European universities as centres of excellence for higher education .
- ( PT ) The overall aim of the eLearning programme is to encourage the integration of the new information and communication technologies into Europe 's education and training systems , to foster : greater intercultural dialogue language learning the development of lifelong learning and the exchange of good practices .
One only has to look at the data supplied on schools ' connections and the use of the Internet by teachers to understand the enormous discrepancies and major inequalities that remain in the European Union .
Under this programme , I would also highlight the importance of teacher training , without which , it will not be possible to develop an effective education policy , and of extending this programme to cover primary schools .
It will provide the financial contribution for pilot projects , for research and monitoring , for strategic actions by European networks and partnerships , for European organisations aiming to set up 'platforms' , and for technical and administrative assistance in various sectors .
The effects are already beginning to be visible .
I must stress , however , that this broad initiative by all parties in the field of criminal procedure must never neglect the common good , in its aspects of public order and social peace , for fear of sacrificing the ultimate aim of the rules of criminal law .
You all know that the Community is not party to the 1961 and 1971 Conventions and is party only to the 1988 Convention but , in this case , with its mandate restricted to the question of chemical precursors .
There are few people , if any , in Europe who do not know somebody - a family member , a neighbour , a friend , a workmate , someone close , an acquaintance - who has been through the experience of taking and being dependent on drugs , with the effects that has in terms of personal and social dysfunction , human degradation , deteriorating health , poverty and , all too often , crime and death .
In recent years it has become fashionable in some quarters to say that
