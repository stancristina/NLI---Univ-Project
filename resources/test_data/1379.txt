question .
As is well known , the EU has expressed this view on quite a number of occasions .
China is now an economic and political giant which is increasingly also becoming a global player .
On the contrary , the fact is that China ’s economic progress is partly based upon its systematically denying its own workers their most basic rights .
Policy on China is therefore a test of the EU’s credibility on human rights issues .
It would therefore be quite absurd to do what is now proposed , namely to lift the arms embargo on China .
The lights are going out in Belarus , and the prospects for development are ever more receding .
Belarus is now a country that is becoming ever more isolated in Europe .
At the same time , we should perhaps conduct a still tougher policy of sanctions against those who now govern Belarussian society .
Thinking back , for example , to the prevailing mood and spirit when we voted through the action plan to combat organised crime , it is noticeable that there is , in any case , a different rhetoric present today than there was in the nation states at that time .
The European Parliament’s views cannot just be sidelined , leaving us to work on implementing the Treaty precisely as it stands .
Even if the Luxembourg Presidency has the best intentions , many in this Parliament wonder in what direction the objectives and priorities of the Council as a whole are actually pointing .
I myself have followed the cases both of a British citizen in Sweden and of a Swedish citizen in Greece , both of whose right to have the proceedings interpreted in their own languages was not complied with .
There is detailed case law from the Court in Strasbourg .
A lot remains to be done when it comes to access to defence lawyers , legal translation and minimum standards generally , as well as to the protection of suspects in trials .
Instead , further measures will be required .     Mr President , I welcome the outcome of the spring European Council .
Allow me to point out four things .
Thirdly , I welcome what is said about the Services Directive .
We need to be able to have high environmental requirements and robust consumer rights .
Allow me finally to say that not everything is , of course , just negative .
We have every reason to be optimistic about the future .     Mr President , unfortunately , I have to say that the European Council was a unique display of bad leadership .
There will , it is maintained , be no end to all the misery that will be suffered by European consumers and employees if the Services Directive goes through .
It is a natural consequence of the enlargement by 10 Member States that occurred in May 2004 .
According to the Commission ’s and the European Parliament’s benevolent assessments , only the political criterion is being fulfilled .
The process of negotiation and of adjustment to the EU has been going on for approximately eight years , which means that Bulgaria’s and Romania’s membership is more or less a .
Moreover , we believe that issues concerning social legislation need to be dealt with in the individual Member States and thus are not issues to which the EU should apply itself .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is not a lot that can be said in two minutes , especially if the subject is as big a one as that of the Western Balkans .
We who have experienced Communism also know how long a period is required to build up democracy .
When we talk about Macedonia voluntarily participating in the negotiations concerning its change of name , there are not many in this Parliament who know that that is only a part of the truth , for only Greek representatives are present at the negotiations and not Macedonian representatives able to put forward their views on the matter .
I also wish to emphasise that all the decisions of this Parliament are interpreted and analysed carefully by both the negative and positive forces in the region .
It was not , however , really an answer to the question I asked , which was not about disarming various organisations in Lebanon but about ensuring that the Middle East peace process could continue under stable conditions .
In what way , moreover , can it be made clear to Iran that it is not permissible to support terrorism ?     Mr President , I note with satisfaction that we have this evening debated issues that really ought , in fact , to be debated and decided upon in this House .
Parliament therefore has strong reasons for monitoring compliance with the rules governing global free trade .
I agree with the other speakers in the House who have demanded that the Commission as soon as possible take measures against countries and EU Member States that breach the WTO’s regulations .
That is called tax dumping .
That is known as environmental dumping .
Allow me to offer a very short but extremely frightening and , unfortunately , far from unique example of the way in which trade unions and authorities together deny the EU’s new Member States access to the internal market .
The company had recourse to the authorities , and the Labour Market Tribunal , on which the union sits , obviously adopted a position in favour of the trade union movement .
As a result , we have school children without a school , taxpayers with additional tax to pay and unemployed Latvians .
It is a modern form of colonialism .
This development would lead to the EU being given substantial resources that could be made better use of by other organisations
