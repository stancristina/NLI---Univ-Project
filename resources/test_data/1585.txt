Bold Community funding is more than needed in order to avoid all this .
The people of Guatemala , like other peoples in Latin America , have been tragically tried by foreign intervention and exploitation by the local oligarchy .
Together with my condemnation , I should like to ask you to approach the Guatemalan authorities so that this heinous crime is fully investigated .     MrPresident , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , perhaps it is a happy coincidence that the final word from Parliament today will be heard on the content of the Constitution for social Europe .
The Intergovernmental Conference will need to respect the Convention 's text .
However , the disagreements are about completely secondary issues which do not change the reactionary nature of the text .
In other words , everyone is fighting their own corner .
The reason is that the translations into various languages of paragraph 13 , which will be incorporated into the report , arrived very late and the political groups wish to have the possibility of tabling amendments or calling for a separate vote .
Alongside proposals for mammography screening for women aged 50-69 , for faecal occult blood testing of people aged 50-74 and for cervical smears for women aged 20-30 , other urgent actions are needed .
One of these is special programmes in selected workplaces in which , because of the environment , there is a serious risk of cancer .
Can we reduce all the countries which surround us to the east and south to a common denominator ?
But I see that , in the proposal made by the Commissioner for external relations on the Ukraine , we are discussing the possibility of its future integration .
That is why I fear this uniformity .
As regards Egypt in particular , I want to say that there are a great many European citizens shut up in its gaols today and who are paying this price with their lives .
Our basic priorities are predicated on good relations , peace and economic and political cooperation .
However , as the European Parliament , we too can take initiatives by stepping up our efforts .
Of course , I noticed the repetition of the objectives and commitments we have heard numerous times , together with an impression of the tragic situation in the area .
Madam President , within the framework of the second report on the stabilisation and association process for South-East Europe , the opinion of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy supports the Commission proposal and I should like , of course , to congratulate the rapporteur .
The rate of integration into the European Union will obviously depend on the countries themselves .
Within this framework , the report – correctly in my opinion – stresses the serious importance within the priorities of the European Union of preparing the countries of South-East Europe for future integration into the European structures .
Allow me to take this opportunity to refer to the particular subject touched on in paragraph 21 of the report and to expressly state that the European Parliament regrets the flagrantly unacceptable manner in which the recent local elections were conducted in Albania .
Already , Croatia has applied to join the European Union .
None of us should entertain any false notions .
The Stability Pact is being applied to an area which continues to be politically fragile and unstable .
Insistence on democratic procedures , human rights , regional cooperation , respect for minorities , the return of refugees , the jurisdiction of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague and , generally , the full application of all the UN Security Council resolutions is the only way forward .
They must realise that the constitutional and state regime , be it in the FYROM , be it in Bosnia-Herzegovina , be it in Serbia-Montenegro , is based on fine balances , with concealed nationalisms , and that time is needed for the new institutions to stabilise and mature .
All the states should protect their minorities living within them .
We must prevent the mobilisation of forces by neighbouring countries to protect national minorities inadequately protected by the countries of which they are citizens .
On certain sides , the official name of the FYROM is not used correctly .
That is why we are calling in our amendments for funding to be directed not at special actions which cannot guarantee the permanence or standard of the programmes or the viability of organisations , but at funding operations , as is the case with the European Women 's Lobby .
We can continue to extend it after the evaluation .
Especially at a time when the European Women 's Lobby has other priorities within the framework of funding .
As regards our amendments to do with transferring the European Women 's Lobby from the articles to the Annex , this is for technical reasons at the Council 's suggestion , precisely because we believe that we need to try to achieve a uniform format for all Community programmes which fund action by non-governmental organisations .
Standards are changing , women 's aspirations are constantly becoming richer and broader .
We recognise that the role and the work of the European Women 's Lobby need to be safeguarded but , at the same time , other organisations also need to be given the opportunity to have a viable action programme .
We believe that it constitutes a basic support for our democracy and our political group will continue to work in this direction .     . – EU policy towards the other countries of the Mediterranean is becoming more and more aggressive .
As if that were not enough , it is trying to force through immigrant expulsion agreements .
Under these circumstances , talk of dialogue between civilisations sounds
