We are talking about general , overall positions .
As a result of these two factors , total demand is therefore being stimulated to the tune of 1.6 % of Irish Gross Domestic Product .
I would turn now to a third factor .
That argument makes sense and might lead us - like many economists - to conclude by asking why , if we did not have any other types of commitment , we should take action over Ireland if that country does not affect monetary policy .
I very much emphasised the fact that , when I speak of a recommendation , I am not referring to sanctions .
That is the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment and , like yourselves , I believe it must be accorded due importance because , if it is indeed an important milestone in applying our model for coordinating economic policies , we ought not to attempt to draw conclusions of a kind which the Commission never of course intended .
In the 1999 recommendation , a reminder was issued that , in spite of the efforts made , these were still not enough and , in 2000 , after it was pointed out that the budgetary policy adopted by Ireland needed to be more restrictive , there followed a clear expansionist budget on Ireland ' s part .
My duty as Commissioner responsible for these matters is to apply the broad economic guidelines , which are compulsory in a way that the Stability Pact is not .
We are talking about consistency with the model we had duly established .
Reference was made to a greater degree of understanding .
And this is not inconsistent with good behaviour in terms of growth and inflation .
Moreover , it is justified in spite of the limited impact Ireland has on the overall European economy .
I would ask you whether you believe that policy assessments of this kind exempt the Commission from its duty to apply the Treaties in the forms in which they are established .
I am not talking about a sanction but about a recommendation , and I believe that we cannot draw any conclusion which takes us farther away from the content of that Council decision suggested by the Commission , namely to apply a standard which is there in the Treaty for the purpose of resolving a series of practical problems raised in the model we have established for coordinating economic policy .
Madam President , I believe that this requires an explanation from you and that you should also approach the very august members of the Council to tell them that , if they want to speak with civil society - in this case the pupils of the school - they must take account of the Parliaments , as they emphasised in the fourth Annex .
Madam President , Rule 6( 1 ) of our Rules of Procedure lays down that , in relation to petitions , the President must announce them to Parliament and refer the issue to the competent committee .
Madam President , I simply say this to illustrate the legal complexity of the affair .
Now , at the very moment when the Colombian President is meeting President Bush to discuss pursuing peace talks with revolutionary guerillas and when Zapatista supporters are marching through twelve states to Mexico City to discuss with President Fox a bill that would grant Mexico ' s Indians self-government , legal status for their language and rights over natural resources , the Spanish Government , on the contrary , is making a new aggressive bid to crack down on Basque independence campaigners .
But what I wanted to refer to , Mr President , was the issue which Mr Bar√≥n Crespo , President of the Socialist Group , mentioned , in other words , the event of the seventh .
As a Spanish Member of the European Parliament and as Socialist coordinator in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , this case falls within my competence , and to some extent I am obliged to raise the matter , because it seems to me absolutely shameful that seven months after the president of the Spanish Supreme Court sent a petition to this Parliament , nobody has even had the courtesy to reply to him .
It appears that the European People ' s Party wishes to discount any Socialist intervention by accusing it of harbouring electoral or party-political motives .
The accusation of electioneering applies to autocratic leaders , not to democratic leaders .
We need this extra EUR 900 million in order to implement the plan which the Commission has drawn up to combat BSE.
There is still one outstanding financial issue : will there be sufficient money in Category 1 for additional measures when they become necessary for the month of May ?
Emigration is an ancient phenomenon but it has recently taken on some new characteristics .
In the majority of cases they come without sufficient information .
We therefore call for offices to be set up in order to resolve these problems so that these women may come fully informed about the work they are going to do .
I would like to ask you to reconsider so that , by removing these terms , we can have a report which is approved by the whole House .
This means that we need to evaluate present and future migratory flows in all their categories : humanitarian reasons , family reunification and economic reasons , as the rapporteur already mentioned , and demographic changes , the situation of the labour market and of the immigrants ' countries of origin .
The Mediterranean , the birthplace of civilisations and culture , must be a factor for integration and not for exclusion .
Secondly , because we believe that the principles of solidarity and cohesion on
