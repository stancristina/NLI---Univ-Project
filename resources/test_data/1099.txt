Mr President , today there are four reports on the agenda which have a bearing on the position of European small - and medium-sized enterprises in the internal market .
Parliament increased this budget heading for 1996 to ECU 50 million .
This would enable us to estimate the credibility and liquidity of this future pan-European exchange .
Mr President , small - and medium-scale businesses should be pleased about the enormous interest of the authorities , at both national and European levels in recent years .
It is worth recommending that local and national employers ' organizations should be involved in the information process .
Paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution calls for a directive .
It would also be a good thing if small firms were allowed to deliver their VAT return quarterly or were allowed a longer time for returns .
In the organization for independent employers and SMEs for which I worked for years it was our slogan that SMEs are not just pocket-sized big business .
I am glad to note today that that promise has been kept .
Late payments are not infrequently the cause of one or a series of bankruptcies .
Is a proposal for a directive already being prepared , or are there other plans ?
The businesses quoted on NASDAQ , it is true , constitute only 0.4 % of all American businesses , but they created 16 % , or 300 000 , of the total of jobs created between 1990 and June 1994 , whilst with the 500 biggest businesses in the United States 850 000 jobs were lost .
I think it is absolutely crucial for the credibility of the House that we should reach a decision this week .
I am taking a risk in proposing this , but I am convinced that we have to do everything we can to protect Parliament 's credibility when it comes under attack .
What is banned is banned , and the only possible exceptions , as far as I am concerned , are bunches of flowers and cups of coffee .
( Applause ) Madam President , the Greens in Parliament are certainly in favour of debating the Nordmann report , provided that it is done with great frankness , such as we have already heard from Mr de Vries .
His engagement is something which has come up quite unexpectedly .
And if we look at nuclear power plants , it is clear that although radioactive hazards are already regulated by the Euratom Treaty , the other hazardous substances found at nuclear installations need to be covered by the directive for the sake of public safety .
The protection of workers and the public in general is important enough to warrant legislation of the very highest quality .
Do we know how great this extra burden will be ?
That is not to say that the compromise before us is exactly ideal , and I should like to hear whether the Commissioner is prepared , now that he has heard all the objections from both sides of the House , to examine how further improvements might be made , because I think - and the Commissioner knows - that the ministers were also not entirely happy with it .

I also did not hear about it until Friday , since no one took the trouble to inform the chairman of the committee responsible .
Madam President , this debate concerns one of the fundamental aspects of the European Union : the free movement of persons .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party supports the proposal for a directive on the right to travel of nationals of non-member countries who are legally established in the Union .

There must also be fair competition with other measures .
We must not panic .
At the beginning , he was firmly behind a number of Parliament 's demands , but now he is putting tremendous pressure on us to agree to the compromise that he has come up with .
I think it is important to have an answer from you on this .
I think it will still take a long time before we get the genuinely lasting and coherent European transport policy that we want .
Mr President , the conciliation procedure on the trans-European networks has produced little in the way of results , particularly on the subject of priority projects .
I should like to make one further comment about the air crash at Eindhoven .
We are pleased that the European Parliament is stating its position in this report by Mr Pelttari .
However , I would draw your attention to the fact that the EU Treaty clearly provides for protection and respect for human rights to be one of the aims of the common foreign and security policy .
A clear case of male morality .
If we approve biomedical techniques such as in vitro fertilization , then we also have to accept the consequences and give parents the right to self-determination when it comes to the preservation of embryos .
Lobbyists should also be required to submit an annual report in order to have their passes renewed , giving details of who they have lobbied , on whose behalf and using what financial or other means .
