rather disappointing .
The effort has been focused on the economic section , where progress has been made , mainly thanks to the MEDA programme , the partnership ' s principle financial instrument .
There are still many social challenges to be faced .
Why , then , are so many Members critical ?
From south to north , from east to west , across Europe , these ceaseless waves of migrants destabilise the economic , budgetary , social , urban , religious and cultural balance .
We must never forget that every individual ' s childhood and the particular circumstances of their family and social circle in large measure determines their adult life .
The sex industry destroys the prospects of children who pick up the AIDS virus and sexually transmissible diseases .
Our respective states must take the necessary measures to prosecute and sentence those found guilty .
This type of challenge is not appropriate in an area which has not yet officially ceased regarding the Member States as independent nations , freely implementing policies of their own choice .
Just recently there was the statement by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair on free access to the genetic heritage of human beings , plants , animals and genes have been patented , and Craig Venter claims to own 97 % of the human genome .
There is no problem identifying the parties involved in trafficking child pornography , who are often repeat offenders .
The action proposed by the Austrian Government is heading in the right direction , which is that of strengthening the prosecution of anyone deliberately producing , selling , disseminating or owning materials relating to the sexual exploitation of children .
This is what happens , and that is why those people who , in France in 1987 , for example , thought it right , in the name of freedom , to strenuously oppose the common-sense measure of removing pornographic magazines from display in newsagents ' shops , and keeping them under the counter , as it were , have to bear some responsibility for the measures which they are condemning today .
We therefore do not want a situation where you cannot see the wood for the trees .
Very few resources are allocated to the Fund , considering the scale of its activities - improving reception conditions , integrating persons benefiting from international protection , encouraging voluntary return by facilitating reintegration in the country of origin .
The answers to these questions cannot be found anywhere in the reports passed on to us .
We are setting up a European Refugee Fund for an initial period of five years .
In this area , however , what worries me more than the figures - because , unfortunately or fortunately , the necessary funds cannot be provided to respond to emergencies such as Kosovo - and what we are looking for is some financial and also administrative mechanism sufficiently perfected to fulfil needs efficiently in an emergency situation .
Cooperation of this type with the candidate countries would duplicate the action of other programmes , especially the PHARE programme for transposing the legislative acquis and bringing the competent authorities in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into line .
A survey of the current situation shows that 307 additives are authorised within the European Union .
The usefulness for the consumer is that the grated carrots will appear to be 'fresh ' even though they are actually not .
I think it is important , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , to reverse the trend in the current legislation on additives .
On the one hand , do the additives meet a technological need ?
I would ask you , therefore , to be a little more circumspect before rejecting all the amendments out of hand , since I can also claim to have made a scientific study of the situation .
We have to assess a budget two years after it has been implemented by the Commission , while taking into consideration the budget which is currently being framed , the improvements needed for the implementation of the budget and the practical realisation of the political goals of the European Union .
Mr President , as the Commission is well aware , I am not accustomed to being an easy-going , meek or lenient speaker when it comes to the Commission in its role as executive .
This gives us grounds for concern .
Obviously , this is extremely reprehensible and even irresponsible !
The technological need for the additive to be approved , for example , is obviously determined by the industry itself , which argues primarily in terms of reducing production costs and winning markets .
As I stated during the previous part-session , in our debate on child sex tourism , there is nothing that arouses more horror and disgust than the sexual exploitation of children , and we have to admit that the Internet facilitates such 'practices ' by enabling all manner of perverts to consult illegal sites anonymously .
In this area which is cross-border in nature , it may be useful for the European Union to make its own contribution .
The Fund is to establish a financial redistribution system in order to balance out the financial expenses incurred by Member States in receiving refugees and to enable those with the least developed systems to bring them up to speed .
Some political forces within this Parliament nonetheless appear to wish to turn the Lisbon Summit into some sort of Socialist International 'happening ' .
I therefore advise all the Christian Democrats , all the Liberals and all the Democrats in general who want to see a social market economy , to vote in favour of the resolution proposed by the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
The second point relates to employment
