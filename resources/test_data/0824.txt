Mr President , this proposal has a long history .
I can understand why the rapporteur and Mr Papayannakis are weary of further controversy .
However , we are almost at the end .
As the rapporteur , he has quite properly had to tell the House that the Environment Committee voted by a substantial majority - I think 33 votes to 13 - in favour of the excision of the provisions relating to category of animal .
We have , on the committee , made a number of compromises , as regards both the timetable and the substance .
The Committee has always kept a clear priority and has insisted upon it both to the Council and to the Commission : namely to have the sharpest , best-defined route of traceability on safety grounds that we can get for mince as well as other forms of beef .
It was for this reason that it threw out at first reading the superfluous requirements about maturation times , much as chefs might have wanted them , and category of animal , which did nothing for traceability , added cost , and increased the disaffection of many Member States and of those who will have to implement this proposal .
As a result of that , we thought the matter was resolved .
Indeed , as Mr Papayannakis has said , there have been counter-concessions from the Commission .
Now , to our amazement , category of animal is back , and once again the Environment Committee has voted to remove it .
The Commission knows why .
It knows we cannot be bullied with threats that our timetable will slip .
We have made concessions including a full month ' s delay on the implementation of the second phase of this proposal already .
We have done that with a good grace .
I urge the House to reaffirm its position at first reading and to exclude a form of compulsory category labelling which is entirely optional for Member States , - a form of labelling we should point out which we do not have in detail .
We have to surrender to the secret harmonies of comitology if we are going to leave it to Commission to advance the precise definitions .
We are not prepared to do that .
We want traceability , we want surveillance , we want this proposal and we want it quickly .
We want the best and most economic route to achieve it and Amendments Nos 3 and 5 do that .
The various amendments on mince add to surveillance and traceability in the way we propose .
Conciliation , Mr Papayannakis , does not take very long .
It consists of two words from the Commissioner this afternoon : ' We accept . '
Let us hear them .
Mr President , yesterday we heard Mr Chirac set out his objectives for the French presidency .
In his conclusion he said " Europe will be dynamic if we make it loved by those it serves " .
This is the sweeping rhetoric that occupies the high ground but the detail of the debate today occupies the low ground .
It is precisely this sort of detailed , petty interference that drives the people served by Europe to distraction .
If anything was more calculated to make Europe unloved it is its determination to control every nook and cranny of our lives .
We all , I am sure , have letters saying that these regulations are impracticable , cumbersome , costly and far too complex .
Above all , my correspondents tell me that they are fed up with the EU 's mania for bombarding the consumer with information .
Soon labels will no longer suffice .
If we keep going at this rate , shopkeepers will have to issue owners ' manuals with every pound of minced beef - not , of course , that we are allowed to use pounds any more .
Perhaps even Macdonald 's might be forced to protest .
I know from my short experience here that nothing I say and nothing that involves common sense will have the slightest impact because , like a mad elephant out of control , this legislation will crash on regardless .
I will make a prediction .
When this legislation finally goes through we will hear paeans of self-congratulation .
Everybody involved will tell themselves how jolly hard they worked .
Well , they may be pleased but they certainly will not be loved by the people of Europe .
Mr Chirac is going to be disappointed .
The people are despairing .
Mr President , Commissioner , in speaking previously to this House I have pointed out that there is a tension in the proposed regulation between ensuring traceability for public health purposes and providing useful consumer information .
I am grateful for recent assurances from Commissioner Byrne that the new European Food Agency will consider how such information can best be provided .
Making it compulsory to include the category of animal on the label is not justified on public health grounds , nor is it obvious why it should be obligatory for the consumer to have this information .
The Environment Committee 's amendment makes it clear that it could be provided under the voluntary scheme where there is a demand .
Further , if the labelling scheme in relation to category were to be implemented , as the Commission has earlier suggested , it could add 8 to 10 % to production costs .
In my own country this would mean GBP 45 - 55 or EUR 70 - 90 per animal without any benefit in return and , as Mr Goodwill has already said , the scheme could have the effect of reducing the market price of certain categories of cattle , particularly of young bulls .
I very much hope that Parliament will follow the
