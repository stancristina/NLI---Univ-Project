Therefore , an attempt was made during the complex negotiations between the Commission and the United States Department of Commerce to find a solution which would allow the transfer of data to those private companies which voluntarily submit to a self-regulation system known as the 'safe harbour ' system .
The company responsible for processing the data also has the option of recourse to a private dispute resolution body of its choice , but this right is not available to the person whose rights may have been violated .
Mr President , we fully support Mrs Paciotti' s report and its conclusions .
Europe has already taken great strides towards its goal of economic regeneration during this first half of the year thanks to the Lisbon and Feira European Councils .
Progress has also been made towards an extraordinary enlargement of the Union - enlargement which you have described , Mr Chirac , as a 'fine and necessary project ' - and towards strengthening its institutions in preparation for enlargement .
Just a few days ago , the Commission adopted a social policy agenda outlining what needs to be done over the next two or three years to ensure that the conclusions of the Lisbon and Feira European Councils are translated into practical actions .
At Lisbon , an action plan was adopted which now needs to be implemented , and I know that the Presidency will be taking strong measures to ensure that all our young people develop the abilities they need for integration into a knowledge-based economy .
I am confident that this opinion will be given by the first October part-session at the latest .
The first is a Green Paper on the common transport policy and the second is a strategic document on different energy sources and the security of energy supply .
At all levels of society , the citizens are calling throughout Europe for an improvement in social , ethical and environmental quality .
This procedure applies to a greatly increased range of legislation , yet there has been less need to resort to conciliation .
We are all aware of how essential it is to reinforce our institutions and make them function more effectively .
Because they are so essential we must work to improve them , and this is the task to which we are all committed for Nice .
It is therefore important that the debate on the future structure of the Union has been reopened following the positions adopted by Minister Joshka Fischer .
There would appear to be a choice between developing the supranational components - strengthening the role of Parliament and the Commission - and enhancing the intergovernmental aspects .
President Chirac once again expressed French support for the German application for a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council , confirming his intention to strengthen the French-German axis in the context of a purely intergovernmental vision of the future structure of the European Union .
The success of the euro will not be sufficient on its own for us to hold our ground against the United States and the China of tomorrow .
This historic event must not be dismissed by replacing the Berlin wall with another wall , the wall of specific interests , egoism and bureaucracy .
Mr President , less than 5 % of lorries that arrive or pass through the port of Dover are stopped , and even less than that 5 % are searched .
Where there is no legal immigration integration policy , when it takes months to obtain work permits , when United Nations reports tell us that our societies , our countries in Europe need a regular influx of hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year , immigrants which are not permitted to enter , not only in the highly-skilled new technology industries but also in the manual labour industries , restaurants and services , when we are under the illusion that we are banning everything and preventing all harm , we find ourselves overtaken by a flood of illegal immigration which is only illegal because it has , in actual fact , been banned by these laws .
Moreover , the very fact that the Council is setting a precedent by including Special Envoys and all our special interventions in its own budget lines is a serious matter .
Does it not also feel that a U-turn of this nature would have serious consequences for the credibility of the future International Criminal Court ?
The objective of improving competition and lowering prices for all consumer groups , including the end consumer , must be pursued assiduously .
Moreover , I would remind you that liberalisation does not just mean privatisation , where a company continues , in practice , to be managed in the same way as before : liberalisation must mean opening up , interchange and competitiveness .
And the situation is all the more serious if we consider the unemployment levels in Europe .
The demagogic generosity of these systems has a very high cost which someone is going to have to pay very soon , and its effects will soon make themselves felt on the stability of the euro .
Hiring and firing must be liberalised , for the simple reason that controlling dismissals only serves to limit the possibility of hiring new staff .
The monetary policy is certainly a lever which is capable of determining a country ' s economic performance , for better or for worse , but it is for this very reason that we must not give the ECB responsibilities which cannot fall within its remit , either under the Treaty or in the light of the basic rules of economic policy .
Of course I am in favour of this measure , for I love birds .
Before I set off for Parliament , I saw Lul√π , my pussycat ,
