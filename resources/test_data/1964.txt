people and , on the other , the issue of health .
I therefore support the inclusion of private medicine , because we have hundreds of clinics that are treating and assisting the Germans , the British and the Swedes who are in the South and in the Mediterranean .
That is what we must support : the creation of a genuine common political project amongst everybody which must include — and in this regard I agree with something that was said a moment ago — young people , and the young people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and their relations with Europe , and we must therefore make the flow of students between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the European Union very much easier .     Commissioner , I would like to thank you for your explanations .
I therefore believe that the future European forest plan must opt clearly for a policy for preserving our forests and enhancing and making the best possible use of the immense resources obtained from forest soil .
Furthermore , because it makes particular mention of fires and the management of disasters , which are the two great problems facing the Spanish forests , and because it supports the general approach and the results of the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe , which is a process in which Spain plays a very prominent role , since it is one of the four States that are leading it .
Furthermore , this care of the soil will allow us to maintain good agricultural and environmental conditions .
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are calling upon the competent United States authorities to seek a resolution to this unjust and inhumane situation .
What we need is a European industrial policy .     .
This cannot be achieved through concrete or through large building schemes alone , but through complex and integral policies .     .
Mercury is a toxic element which has a negative impact on health , and the Commission is therefore proposing its safe storage and , at the same time , a reduction in its use and an end to the trade in it , but , as point 9 of the Communication states quite rightly , there are many gaps in our knowledge of its effects on human health , of how it is disseminated and accumulated in the environment , of its toxicity and of the sensitivity of ecosystems .
Out of interest , I simply wished to say that I have lived in the region of Almadén , that I have held mercury in my hands on many occasions , that I have had mercury dental amalgams , which I no longer have for aesthetic reasons , and I can assure you that I have not had any health problems , and nor have the people who live there , nor the animals nor the plants , because , as the toxicologists say quite rightly , the poison is in the dose .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to congratulate Dr Matsakis on his report and on the draft resolution that he presented to our Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , and I would like to thank the Members in that Committee for their contributions , which have improved the text that we are currently debating .
Let us hope that it ends as soon as possible , so that all Europeans may be equal and so that we may make the mobility of workers an important tool in terms of our competitiveness , our employment and the construction of the European Union .
We have seen the same thing happening over the last two years with the workers of the new Member States : not only have they not created problems , but they are in fact resolving labour shortages , improving their skills and enhancing the global concept of Europe .
For all of these reasons , it is essential that we have reliable data , broken down by gender , and a legal framework that deals with the gender perspective and allows us to identify and tackle the causes of discrimination .
For example , with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme , we must not forget the essential and decisive role of the information and communication technologies in the Lisbon Agenda .
Where there are problems , they do not need the same thing to be repeated twenty times , but rather they need something serious and decisive to be done once and for all .
This is something that we must all bear very much in mind at the moment in the negotiations that are taking place amongst the different institutions with regard to funding .     Mr President , I would of course like to congratulate the two rapporteurs and all of the members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality , who have done so much work on this report .
I call this demagoguery : saying one thing but doing another , and that is precisely what we must avoid in the European Union .
Last year , the average increase in imports in terms of value and quantity exceeded 450 % and , in some cases , it was as high as 900 % .
It should be pointed out that , given the unit value of the products , this measure cannot be seen as extreme .
Certain aspects of the Community’s investigations indicate that , in this case , China has clearly not complied with WTO obligations , either in the field of subsidies , whether hidden or not , or in the field of counterfeits .
Public objections have been expressed to the 'creativity ' demonstrated by the Commission in its application of the well-established rules and practices in the field of antidumping .
