legislation being formulated is also creating and inflating the sails for the dismissal of thousands of workers .
When the law prevents the enforcement of court judgments , will the Commission again remain inert ?     – Madam President , my question is not a supplementary question on this matter ; I too merely wish to express my surprise , because I had question number 54 ; this is my second term of office at the European Parliament and this is the first time in my experience that the list setting out the order of questions has not been adhered to as announced .
However , when it comes to the workers ' problems , we see deliberate filibustering ...     – Mr President , I consider the Commission 's systematic and analytical approach to the matter to be very important .
I also consider that the report by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy has made some important points .
Evaluation : systematic evaluation of initiatives , such as by high-level groups , innovation panels and working parties , can give us useful conclusions . 3 .
Point two : I consider it necessary to link training provided with the dynamic needs of the market both in terms of the number of trainees and the subject of training courses .
It is a well-known fact that the exhausting working times of cabin crews increase flight safety risks .
For goodness sake .
Its first choice is cooperation to resuscitate the European constitution , even though it was condemned and rejected by the people of France and the Netherlands .
As for relations with Russia , they are the much sought after counterpart to competition with the USA .
The cause of the tragedy is the Israeli occupation .
We demand their immediate and unconditional release .
The international community , the ΕU and the Quartet must insist on returning to the negotiating table and must demand respect for the roadmap by the Israeli Government and respect for all the agreements signed on the promotion and safeguarding of peace by both sides .     – New measures to strike at the grassroots struggle at national and European level are proposed in the report on the strengthening of cross-border police cooperation at international EU events .
Every day they have to deal with restrictions on their most fundamental rights and freedoms .
The investigation to uncover this international parastate must proceed and be extended , despite the reactions of all those who wish to play down and cover up this scandal .
It is clear from the information that the heads of the secret services knew about the activities of US agents and possibly certain people in positions of responsibility in the governments knew and turned a blind eye .
In the first instance , of abductions by the CIA , over 1 000 secret service flights landed at and took off from European airports , but were not subject to the slightest check by the competent European authorities which , even if they did not cooperate directly with them , opted for the 'see nothing , hear nothing , say nothing ' approach .
In the second instance , in a rare case of hasty cooperation between governments at European level , an agreement riddled with holes was signed with the USA , known as the transfer of Passenger Name Records or PNR , not only without adequate proof of the need for the measures , but also with barely any fundamental safeguarding of binding American obligations for the secure and legal use of our data .
I thank you and , on behalf of all of us , I especially thank the rapporteur , Mr Fava , on his excellent work .     – Mr President , the SWIFT scandal , in conjunction with the problematic recital of the recent decision by the European Court of the otherwise correct rejection of the transfer of Passenger Name Records agreement , highlight an exceptionally dangerous grey zone which is starting to arise around the use of sensitive personal data to combat terrorism .
PNR , SWIFT , data retention : in all these private individuals are collating data and the police are using them on the pretext of terrorism .
However , I should like to express the particular concern that , three years after the decisions by the Thessaloniki European Council , there has been no progress in changes to the visa system .
It is a problem of the strategic credibility of the European Union .
I understand what you said now , that they will not apply if agreements are signed .
The over 40 million immigrants in the Union today are , in terms of population , a twenty-sixth Member State .
However , reality still by no means reflects the expectations created .
Nonetheless , integration is pan-European in its implications , especially when it fails .
Prime place among the report 's proposals is held by the need for us to start consultations to end the political and social marginalisation of immigrants and encourage their social – and more importantly – their psychological integration , so that they do not feel condemned to marginalisation in advance .
It stresses the importance of making provision for naturalisation rights for all long-term resident immigrants , especially for the children of immigrants born and raised among us .
By contrast , the reply to the question of whether we should pursue the smooth integration of immigrants already living and working among us is self-evident .
In other words , it would be wrong and would benefit no one .
Thank you once again .     – We have all recently witnessed the failure of numerous European societies to integrate immigrants .
We have lived through the explosive consequences of the breakdown of the social fabric .
