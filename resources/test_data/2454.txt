Precisely because it is a small piece of legislation , though highly political and with the potential to intrude extensively into people’s private and business affairs , this Parliament has wisely and rightly decided to ask in earnest what needs regulation , what is worth regulating and what constitutes an appropriate response .
We are creating transparent legislation that is clearly understood by the people of Europe , reliable legal provisions , not unilateral declarations by individual states in this world that seek to induce private companies – even international organisations with cooperative property rights – to do things that may or may not be compatible with national law .
This is an extremely significant report , because it makes clear from the parliamentary perspective the priorities we still wish to pursue in implementing the rump of the old action plan on company law in this legislative term and shows how far we intend to push the Commission to present concrete proposals in the course of the present term .
Jobs can only be created in really large numbers if SMEs receive special support .
We should , however , be careful in our choice of instruments for this purpose , so that we do not create new distortions of competition .
This has a considerable impact on the competitiveness of the other modes of transport .
In addition , emissions trading must not become an end in itself , but must primarily create incentives for investment in improved technologies .
A separate scheme would be counterproductive and would stall the growth in air transport .
The additional bureaucracy that this proposal entails is hardly acceptable .
Behind Franco and his regime was contempt for mankind and deadly propensity for violence .
Nothing better could happen to Europe !     Mr President , I would like to avail myself of the option of making personal statements at the end of debates .
People must have access to the ‘Lifelong Learning ’ Programme .
Commission President Barroso was looking for money to pay for the Lisbon Strategy , so he helped himself from the Structural Funds .
In view of the fact that Parliament has emerged from the negotiations with great success , we recommend acceptance of the Common Position without further amendment .     Mr President , the Cohesion Fund is an ideal way of putting across one of the European Union’s most important basic principles , solidarity between Member States , to people where they are .
Initial and further training and retraining in promising occupations will continue to be supported in the future .
As in the case of the smuggling of migrants , the European Union also signed an additional protocol on trafficking of persons .
Many people in the EU nowadays ask themselves the same vexed question every day : when will it hit me ?
Whoever still believes that other issues take precedence is out of touch with the world of today and its challenges .
Those who would drive industry out of Europe are playing with the futures of the people who work in industry , the futures of the people who work in industry-related services – sectors that employ not only millions of people but many tens of millions – and the futures of the small and medium-sized enterprises all the way up the supply chain ; in short , they are playing with the future of Europe itself .
There will be consolidations .
I want to see companies in Europe that are constantly striving upwards , that take innovation to new levels , that can alter their profile , that train their staff to cope with new tasks too .
It is symptomatic of a wrong choice of course in European industrial policy .
We must consider how we can use national and European legislation to curb that kind of corporate policy .
Surely that means they are competitive !
This case therefore needs to be assessed rather differently from those that Mr Schulz , for example , had in mind when he referred to certain forms of modern capitalism which do indeed have socially damaging effects , as no reasonable person can deny .
On the level of the European Union we have recently set out a great number of initiatives , all of them aimed at promoting innovation : from the subsidy rules that as was specifically requested earlier in the debate are specifically directed towards innovation , through to the general financial tools for setting up new and innovative businesses , all the way to means to enhance the use of intellectual property and to develop capacities for research and development .
In doing so , however , we are quite clearly creating more bureaucracy .
The low proportion of graduates in technical and scientific disciplines , combined with the brain drain towards competing economic systems that offer the temptation of self-led research should give us cause for concern , as should the problems that our universities have in retaining qualified lecturing staff .
I fully share the rapporteur’s opinion on the problem of qualifications , and I am very grateful that he has highlighted this so clearly .
We see one problem with this as being that democratic controls are being weakened in this field , and another as the virtual lack of any say whatever in these high level groups for small and medium-sized enterprises , which employ 50 % of all workers in the processing industry .
Every one of these cases must be assessed separately , for they concern very different things , all of which , of course – as you so rightly say – have to do with universal human rights and people’s fundamental freedoms .
That is why it is so very important that we find , in future , a solution to energy supplies that is both market-based and transparent , for we
