be a hopeless one as far as European cooperation is concerned if religious views and private moral opinions were to be presented at European level for judgment in this Parliament .
We have to ensure the success of the enlargement that has now taken place and to negotiate successfully with new candidate countries , especially Turkey .
Those are not the EU’s values , and they are unacceptable .
These are facts and not just words , as you said in your introduction .
The agreements should not be aimed at strengthening the EU’s foreign policy and the EU’s efforts to become a global player .
The United Nations is the international organisation through which the Member States have the opportunity to coordinate their aid efforts .
The June List believes , however , that we should not adopt positions on the more specific proposals affecting the work of the ECB or the way it is set up , and we therefore choose not to adopt positions on the amendments before us .
We wish to emphasise that it is especially important for new countries strictly to comply with the requirement that the public debt ’s share of GDP should not exceed 60 % .
A lot remains to be done , especially on developing measurements of results , but progress has undoubtedly been made .
We have therefore proposed changes to the distribution and , of course , also additions to the Council’s proposals , both to strengthen efforts to combat HIV , malaria and TB , and specifically to allocate more aid to Asia , the region in which far and away the largest number of poor people live .
We also propose a new budget item totalling EUR 10 million to enable us to be proactive in efficiently tackling diseases other than HIV , malaria and TB that claim many millions of lives each year , especially among children .
On the contrary .
We do not understand why efforts to combat poverty in Asia and Latin America should be given a different heading and position in the budget than corresponding efforts in Africa .
We believe that the expenditure is too high , with the commitments amounting to 1.14 % of gross domestic income .
There are many instances of re-prioritising for which there are good reasons .
We argue in favour of a percentage of gross domestic income as our objective .
That is not the route to increased growth .
We need a much clearer link between those who propose expenditure and those who have responsibility for arranging the funding and collecting taxpayers ’ money .
The reason for the question is that not only the issue of pharmacies but also that of the Swedish state monopoly on the sale of alcoholic beverages , Systembolaget , is mentioned in the Advocate-General’s opinion .
This means , of course , that it is still directly prohibited to mention this historical fact , namely that hundreds of thousands of Armenians were murdered in the last century in what is now Turkey .
For many years , we have talked about development , aid and solidarity , but in practice far too little money has been made available .
In and outside Europe , poverty is particularly widespread among women living in the countryside .
When people can produce their own food , they have made at least a little progress in the fight against poverty .
A large proportion of the world’s farmers are , in actual fact , women , and the EU has a crucial role to play regarding the developing countries ’ food supply .
Our agricultural policy is a disgrace to the EU.
Yesterday , Commission President-designate Barroso received a rebuff .
Only then shall we be able to say that the European Union is doing something to combat poverty .     Mr President , as speakers in the debate in this House have pointed out , poverty is increasing within the EU.
Patriarchal power structures permeate the whole of our society , in both the Member States and , above all , in the European Union .
Women are hit hardest and are most exposed to poverty and to the consequences of living in poverty .
With the right political and economic decisions , this state of affairs can be changed .
The gap between words and action is still worryingly large when it comes to women’s rights and , as a result , poverty has been feminised in the world .
The award of the Nobel prize to Wangari Maathai is an example of what can be done .
I want to know what work the Commissioner is doing in this area .
Wage discrimination is increasing , as is female unemployment .
Women have worse health , and they are poorer than men within the European Union .
Who cares that more than a billion people live in poverty in the world today , the large majority of whom are women and girls ?
Who cares that , every minute , a woman dies from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth ?
I just wonder when Europe and the world will begin to care seriously about these issues .     Mr President , naturally , our group too supports this resolution and the demand for a moratorium on using this technique .
It comes from the other side of this House and was tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
We are also concerned with sound waves that , in themselves , can travel for hundreds of kilometres .
This forms the basis for the long-term financial framework .
It should be up to the individual countries to ensure that the farmers affected successfully switch to other forms of production . - The subsidy for information efforts can be reduced because we believe it to be difficult , politically , to provide objective information prior to referendums on the Constitution
