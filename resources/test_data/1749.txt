And if you irrigate you must also fertilise because unless you do you will have no harvest .
How can the two be made compatible ?
In some cases , these are particularly vulnerable areas .
This idea is not explicitly tackled in the report but is one that , we hope , will be introduced through an amendment that we have tabled .
Let us hope that it will work in practice .
The European Parliament is inevitably involved in this strategy , and in terms of fixing priorities its hands are tied .
On the subject of the reserves and the overall strategy of which they form part - creating a 'virtual ' or 'reference ' budget - we feel that they should be adopted , in view of the current situation and to avoid the failure to sign a new interinstitutional agreement .
Even so , we consider that the tripartite agreement reached means we can salvage something of significance that would otherwise have been lost .
As for the ECU 500 million reduction in payments , although that is technically understandable , at first reading we would have preferred it to be limited to the ECU 250 m placed in reserve .
But , in doing so , it renounced any means of exerting pressure in the future on this vital matter .
For our part , we done our best to help the various bodies of the European Parliament to resolve this matter .
Nonetheless , I should like to make the following points .
When negotiating the next interinstitutional agreement and Agenda 2000 we should bear those results in mind .
In effect , the European Parliament has done what the Council was loath to do .
Just another couple of points : we wish to support the amendment tabled to restore the ECU 50 million to be spent on tropical forests .
I hope and predict that there will be no more journeys back in time like this .
In any case , I have to say that if we deepen the European Union we must respect what the different States want .
Unfortunately this report makes no substantial reference to the role of the national parliaments , contrary to what is specifically said in the De Giovanni resolution already adopted by the Committee on Institutional Affairs , to be voted on tomorrow .
If we are to strike an institutional balance , then we must definitely transfer certain powers from the Member States to Community bodies , voluntarily and in an acceptable way .
Otherwise , we run the risk of reforming for the most efficient farmers while putting the European farming model at risk .
We must stop vacillating between Keynesian and monetarist solutions and find a policy mix to overcome this crisis.Thirdly , the economic recession .
Mr President , there is one aspect of this debate on the Paasilina report that I find especially important and should like to highlight .
We congratulate him on this as some of those amendments suggest that we are on the same wavelength , although we would not have chosen to word them as he has .
I shall begin by congratulating Mr Giansily on his magnificent report with which I agree .
A strong euro might be attractive for prestige 's sake but we must also maintain the competitiveness of the European economy .
Figures quoted range from US$ 50 billion to as much as US$ 300 bn .
Maintaining a significant volume of currency reserves in dollars and yen will undoubtedly be the best safeguard for preventing the speculative turmoil that might hit international financial markets in this stage of transition towards the euro .
We welcome any initiative taken to achieve that and this is one such initiative .
It was against this background that we tried , with welcome help from other Members of Parliament , to reconcile workers ' inalienable right to health with the desirability of financially healthy businesses , with special emphasis on SMEs , the main job creators , but also not forgetting the major industries in this sector .
The choice of 5 mg/m3 is not based on any scientific evidence but it seems to me to be pitched about right .
Not only are they necessary but greatly improving them should be one of the EU 's priorities .
But let us not exaggerate .
That sector is now bereft of the resources and legal basis needed for Community measures to be taken .
Nonetheless , the proposal by the Committee on Institutional Affairs contains some good points which , if they are taken into account , could just enable the 'summit ' to reach the kind of conclusions to give a fillip of a proactively European political nature to the fight against the root-causes of the crisis and the upsurge in reactionary nationalism .
These are further reasons why we are voting in favour of the motion , denouncing the small-minded interests of those who confuse politics with accountancy and are defending come what may the anti-Community theory of the so-called juste retour .
Fortunately , although history writes justice in crooked lines it writes it nonetheless .
The Iversen report , of course , reveals extensive knowledge , especially of those agricultural areas with the luxury of being able to carry out more intensive forms of agriculture .
In others development only harms the environment .
We all know that this is not enough to solve the forestry problem in Europe but it can , at least in countries like mine , withdraw certain marginal areas from production .
There is no doubt that he is much closer to Commissioner Fischler 's land of yodelling than he is to the country of Italian ballads .
But I think that they should be paid more attention because , as a rule , science pays attention to the rich areas because it is paid to do so .
Mr President , first of all , I should like
