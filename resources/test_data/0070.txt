shall never again be able to table proposals ourselves .
The only realistic democratic solution is to construct the EU from below as a Europe of democracies .
Every country must have the right to elect its own Commissioner and send him or her to Brussels as our voters ’ representative .
Our Commissioner must come home every Friday and say what he has done in the past week and how he will vote during the following week .
One fine day , we shall be able to unite the whole of Europe in equal cooperation between free nations gathered together to carry out the tasks we cannot successfully discharge in our own democracies .
In that way , we should gain a share of influence when , otherwise , we should be without influence .
Welcome to the fight for a Europe of democracies and diversity .
I have read Monnet’s memoirs with great pleasure , but nowhere found references there in support of the undemocratic , super-centralised EU state heralded by the Constitution .
I sat beside Spinelli in the Committee on Budgets during my first ten years in Parliament and came to have great respect for his consistent , federalist thinking .
Federalism is a sensible form of government in the United States , Canada , Switzerland and Germany .
It is also a splendid dream for Europe , but it is a dream that could turn into a nightmare if there were no community of people that felt at home in a federal state .
The turn-out at elections to the European Parliament has fallen from 63 % to 49 % over five elections and will scarcely be more than 40 % in June .
I am not an anti-federalist but a realist .
If there were 87 % participation in the elections to the European Parliament and 49 % participation in national elections , the federalists would take over from those of us who are working for a Europe of the nations and for a Europe of democracies and diversities .
In return , we should accept the federalist model , or retire , on the day that participation in European Parliament elections makes the national elections less representative of the voters .
In that way , we should obtain the first common European debate on our common future , and we should be able to see whether federalism could defeat our mission to bring about a Europe of democracies .
Until then , I prefer the Danish to the EU Constitution .     Madam President , Commissioner Dimas , how do we turn enlargement into an economic and social success ?
We shall do so by releasing initiative and energy , by continuing the work on creating an internal market involving free competition , by guaranteeing an internal market for financial services so that businesses have adequate and cheap capital to work with and by guaranteeing that , through free competition , consumers and taxpayers are supplied with a diverse range of products and services of high quality at reasonable prices .
The lesson to be learned from the bitter experience of Communism’s command economy was , of course , that economic and political freedom belong together .
Those of us in the new Europe must not , therefore , be afraid of economic freedom .
These concepts are not a threat , but the key to economic prosperity .
Indeed , even those countries that , like my own , are , from day one , opening the borders to workers from the new Member States have introduced monitoring of the labour market and restrictions on access to social benefits .
I have to admit , moreover , that delight at the fall of the Berlin Wall and EU enlargement has turned too quickly into anxiety about the changes that may follow in their wake .
Too often , we forget our experience of previous enlargements involving poorer countries , which have of course produced good results .
Rapid economic growth and the dynamic in the new Member States will act as a breath of fresh air for the economies of the old Member States .
EU aid of up to four per cent of gross domestic product per year is a large amount for the new Member States , but a modest amount for the existing ones .
There is some justification for putting a question mark over whether it will be at all possible to use the large transfers at the rate we should like to do .
These are matters we shall work on : simpler administration and greater opportunities for having the money used as intended .
As the Commissioner pointed out , we must also do a lot of work on developing the social dialogue .
Very loyal relations have been created between the group chairmen .
At that time , we had a large coalition , in which it was not much fun representing a small group .
People have been listened to , including minorities , and I hope that we can continue that tradition .
We had never before had an election campaign in the history of Parliament , says he who is now celebrating 25 years of being an MEP.
The election was a result of constructive debates , in our groups too , and I hope we can continue that tradition so that , before the President is elected , there can be debates on how Parliament’s work is to be organised .
When we arrive in Parliament on Mondays , ordinary Members can now take the floor , as they could not previously .
That is a small , practical outcome of an election campaign .
Thank you for your constructive cooperation and good luck in your new life .
Never before have Europeans in one go faced having to lose so much power .
