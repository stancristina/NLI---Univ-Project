The vast majority of them are not members of any party .
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality .
There is indeed economic recovery , but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe .
But let us not forget that there is another one , a new handicap , with the single currency .
It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea , which is immense and without borders , it is not easy to manage fish on the move .
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water , etc .
We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution , to development , to the urbanisation of coastal areas , etc .
If I may , however , just make a few comments on the method .
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection , and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority , and also , in particular , of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory .
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution .
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vend√©e and Loire-Atlantique regions .
Our resolution calls for this .
It was all perfectly avoidable since the same causes produce the same effects , and we had identified the causes .
What decisions has the Commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take ?
The settlement process must proceed by the only possible avenue , i .e . that of dialogue .
Secondly , nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the frontiers of the State of Israel defined .
In addition to the extremely high cost of such a proposal , the cumbersome nature of its management may cause some administrations to use its complexities as a pretext not to provide the information in due time and may give rise to a certain feeling of suspicion among the people working in the sector if they have onerous additional bureaucratic constraints foisted upon them in this way .
It is a water-borne virus and is transmitted via organic substances such as blood , faecal matter , mucus , etc .
Since the Canadian strain differs from the European strain , this vaccine cannot be used in its present state , but may be used as the starting point for the development of a vaccine against the European strain .
It gives political parties an important role in building a democratic Europe .
This may , for example , involve implementing positive action and promoting parity within our political parties .
Finally , in order to enable everyone , men and women , to become involved in public life , working hours must be drastically reduced .
Some measures such as retraining , in the form of lifelong training , seem particularly relevant .
Confining oneself to deploring the disaster and expressing sympathy for its victims without applying some restraining measures in order to oblige Total to make good all the direct and indirect consequences of the pollution for which it is entirely responsible is tantamount to doing nothing .
Fishing and tourism , as the two chief resources in most of the regions on our Atlantic coastline , have therefore both been hard hit .
All the same , States must clearly not shift their own essential responsibility onto the Union : the safety of all concerned is conditional upon the standards and effectiveness of inspection by the port State ( and the resources made available for this ) .
Transhipment has become common practice and frequently fish products from one Member State which cannot be sold within the Union due to exceeding the TAC are sold as imported products or as originating from another Member State .
Mr Prime Minister , we would like to believe , along with you and the Portuguese Presidency , that Europe should be built as a civilisation whose economic and social prosperity is founded on the cultivation of knowledge , cultural diversity and cohesion , and which plays an active role in promoting a world order that is more balanced , more peaceful , and less fragmented .
In short , we have heard nothing to suggest that the citizen will be anything more than a customer .
Your globalisation of the economy is neither necessary nor inevitable .
Nevertheless , the predominant rhetoric always centres on wage restraint .
One sees references , albeit only in chapter headings , to the Europe of innovation and knowledge , structural reforms , competitiveness , the European social model , employment , social cohesion , macroeconomic policies and sustainable growth .
The contempt that ABB/Alsthom and their ilk have shown for the most fundamental interests of society is appalling .
You will thus have to encourage your colleagues to see to it that the proposals you make to us are going to be financed .
Lastly , this knowledge society hinges on research and development and I would like to applaud , at this juncture , the Commission initiative that aims to create a European research area .
This calls for hard and fast objectives , but we are aware that these will not be attainable unless we base our proposals on genuine social dialogue , and I feel that we must also move forward in this respect .
Much has indeed been said of pollution and the effects of pollution , but this proliferation of natural disasters was evident in Central America and Venezuela at the end of last year , and can now be seen in Mozambique and Madagascar .
Besides this , future Community actions must take into consideration every facet of sustainable forest management .
Mr President , I shall not repeat the
