is that we shall also need legislation on electronic money transfers and credit and payment cards .
That is not covered .
Can he tell us a little more ?
It still has a credibility problem .
Whether or not the elections can succeed is one of the big questions .
In view of recent political developments in Guatemala I wonder if now is the right time for the European Union to draw attention to political conditions there .
Special extraneous circumstances are more concerned with special economic circumstances and not so much with external threats .
But what happens is that with a budget of some 70 billion ECU you find in the course of the year that here and there the funds are not fully used up , and these can then be used to cope with special unforeseen emergencies like the BSE crisis .
The question is whether , if Schengen is ever integrated under the third pillar , it will still be possible to differentiate .
The issue you raise of how exactly the relationship between Norway and Iceland will look once freedom of movement for individuals is regulated within the European Union is a question which also needs consideration under Article 7A of the Union Treaty .
I would suggest he waits to see the mint directors ' report to the finance ministers and the conclusions which the finance minsters draw from that report .
I have taken due note of the honourable member 's concern about the hostage affair .
We believe that the Monitoring Centre merits our wholehearted support , given the scale and seriousness of the problem we face in Western Europe with drug addiction and trafficking .
Membership will as far as possible be based on objective application of the criteria set by the 1992 European Council in Copenhagen .
I said just now that the Dublin summit resolved to set up a group of senior representatives who will shortly come up with suggestions to counter organized crime ; they will of course be examining large - and medium-scale drug trafficking and will make a point of looking closely at relations with third countries .
As for controlling demand , because we are talking here about great cultural differences between countries and widely differing approaches , I think we need in future to acquaint ourselves a lot better with each others ' experience , and I touched on that partly in my reply to Mr Stewart-Clark .
This is not an area in which the European Union has any powers .
I am thus especially happy with Mrs Gebhardt 's report , happy because I now have something positive to tell our young visitors here in Strasbourg and Brussels and especially happy now that in 1997 , the year in which the Maastricht Treaty is to be revised , we have an instrument with which to counter the creeping Euroscepticism apparent amongst our people .
I compliment Mrs Gebhardt on it and I think we shall be voting in favour tomorrow .
That does not apply in the European institutions .
I have two clear questions for the Commissioner .
Everyone accepts that , except the employer , the European institutions , when it comes to officials who cannot or do not wish to marry .
Please , Mr President , will you see to it that Parliament receives answers to these three specific questions .
With regard to what universal service covers , with the development of a liberalised market with European telecom firms which must be able to develop as fully competitive parties on the international market , means on the one hand that very close attention must be paid to the new responsibilities they will have to assume .
My group is of the opinion that for the time being mobile telephones should not be included in the universal services because of the major differences between the EU countries , but we must keep that door open because of convergence .
But I do not think that is wise , for not every disabled person is the same .
It strikes me that private telecommunications firms are in favour of liberalisation and state firms are against this process .
Either that or the Commission is running the risk of a parliamentary inquiry in the future into they way it is dealing with the telecommunications and post sector .
The seriously speech-impaired opt for a private text telephone .
If the European Parliament approves today the amendments we have tabled , then we shall also be celebrating a victory for at long last , after many years of messing around with directives on licences , the European Union will have a framework for telecommunications licences in the Member States .
This is also where telecom companies in the European Union have problems .
After we have completed our work the national parliaments still have to pass this legislation .
It preferred to start with a restricted directive rather than dragging its feet or running the risk of this directive being blocked in the Council in the second reading .
There are still too many opportunities for national regulatory bodies to put through their own desiderata .
I shall personally ensure via the interconnection that it also happens .
When is enough enough ?
At most it may only be used as a threat .
On the contrary , it is precisely arms supplies from Europe that have prevented the people from participating in power in those countries and so helped to create this chaos .
At last there is a wise African leader who realises that the disintegration of Africa will mercilessly drag the rest of the continent down with it .
