in the future , we can obtain a budget reading that better takes account of the agencies ' different structures and different needs .
Mr President , on very solemn occasions , those of us in Parliament and in the other institutions of the EU talk about how we should go about bringing the EU closer to the people .
The prerequisite of people 's being able to take on that role is that they be able to obtain a feeling for what goes on before the decisions are taken .
As my fellow MEP , Mrs Malmstr√∂m , said , we are all of us aware of there being confidential documents that are difficult to make available .
The European Parliament has , in my view , embarked upon a slippery slope , however .
We find ourselves in a position which we should not have occupied .
In this way , we are complicit in considering our own interests or , more accurately , those of a small group of MEPs at the expense of the interests of European citizens and their opportunity to be players in the democratic process .
That is in itself a problem when we specifically talk about transparency and public access to , and scrutiny of , documents .
All the important political forces therefore support the transparency placed on the agenda when the Danes voted against the Treaty of Maastricht on 2 June 1992 .
The Commission now publishes its agendas and the minutes of the meetings at which decisions are taken .
The Commissioners must be accountable to the public .
The Council has issued minutes relating to the working party 's discussions on transparency .
We must have similar access to other working parties ' working documents and minutes , and we must have access immediately so that we can follow developments before the laws are adopted .
I believe we could make more progress by going to the Court of Justice , as has been done with great success in connection with proper agreements .
If truth be told , the European Parliament has never negotiated anything in the way of progress .
It is before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg that we have achieved most progress , not in negotiations between the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
The European Parliament is always ready to make demands , but it becomes silent whenever , as now , there is the possibility of a framework agreement 's being entered into or a regulation on transparency 's being negotiated , entailing the danger of documents at present publicly available in Denmark and Sweden being regarded as secret as soon as they are forwarded to the EU.
The screening reports are very good examples of documents it should be possible for everyone here in the Chamber and in the candidate countries ' parliaments to read .
I cannot imagine the Court of Justice preventing us from obtaining documents that are a clear part of the legislative process .
I believe we can obtain more progress by putting up a fight than by entering now into a poor compromise .
We are all of us concerned about the fact that far too many people receive lasting physical injuries in the course of their work .
It is against that background , Commissioner , that we had hoped that the Commission might have been more ambitious in its working environment strategy and , in any case , when it came to following this up .
As the rapporteurs have emphasised , the situation in the area of the working environment is such that , since 1992 , there have been swingeing cutbacks in the resources available to the Commission in this field .
We are concerned here with cutbacks at a time when problems in the working environment have become more complicated and extensive and when , as a matter of fact , we face new working environment problems .
There are many very complicated tasks that have to be carried out , and the challenges we face in terms of directives cannot adequately be described in a three-minute speech .
We know that small and medium-sized enterprises require special attention .
There is an urgent need for a directive on the whole range of muscle and bone problems .
Stress and harassment require concerted action , and we are also aware of the possible need for a general recognition of occupational illnesses in a minimum directive .
When the Commission says that it would like to be involved in timetabling , our answer must be that timetables should be made still more binding , and we must propose that a proper action plan in actual fact be prepared .
We know , of course , that this would be more binding upon the European Parliament , the Commission and , especially , the Member States .
We need an action plan covering the working environment .
Mr President , I want to thank the Commission for a sound report .
Danish employers often maintain that , unlike their opposite numbers in many other countries , they have to comply with the regulations governing the working environment .
I should like to be able to repudiate such assertions in the future .
That is why it is important for us to obtain more focus on the practical implementation of working environment legislation so that a good and safe working environment really is created at all workplaces in the EU.
That being said , we must also give careful consideration to the type of regulation with which we can best make the working environment safe .
Sometimes , improvements are better achieved through training , the sharing of experiences and the development of the social dialogue .
That is why I also think that the combating of stress and harassment is a matter for the two sides of industry
