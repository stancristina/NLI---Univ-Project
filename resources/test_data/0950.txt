There are two aspects , however , on which I feel I should enlarge .
One of the greatest triumphs of European integration has been freedom of movement without people being subject to internal border controls .
At the same time , immigration is one of the political questions that we must address seriously and with cool heads .
Commercial relations and cooperation with the countries involved in the programmes covered by this regulation are of major importance to the Union .
The plan to improve the European statistical system goes hand in hand with the attempt to restore credibility to the SGP , following cases of statistics being manipulated and numerous examples of creative accounting .
The report by Mr Gauzès forms part of the efforts that need to be channelled into reforming the Community’s statistical system , within the crucial context of the Stability and Growth Pact .
Nor can we stand by while all manner of atrocities are being committed .
There is no national interest that comes before peace and human rights , and nor must there be .     .
This was not the case .
The reform of the SGP calls for more emphasis to be placed on debt and for comparisons between statistics provided by the national central banks to the European Central Bank and the data provided by the Member States to Eurostat to be taken on board .
I also wish to highlight the key role played by OLAF , a body that is at the Union’s disposal , in facilitating the exchange of information .
I therefore endorse the report by Mr Gahler , which points out that fully untying this aid could make it USD 2 to 3 billion more effective .     .
I refer specifically to the reduction by 20 to a 5 % margin of tolerance between the estimation of the quantities retained on board and that of the logbook figure .
We welcome Parliament’s proposals improving on points on which we disagreed with the Commission ’s proposal : - the fact that fleets of EU countries that are bigger than other fleets working in the same waters do not impose their own limits ( it is impossible to understand why the Commission seeks to be ‘holier than thou’ in adding further measures to the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation , and as such we object to a unilateral limit of tolerance margins ) ; - the guarantee that TACs can be adjusted upwards if that fish stock is deemed to have been restored .     .
They also continue to promote projects such as the Stability and Growth Pact and the flexibility of labour , to which we are opposed .     .
In fact neither is true , at least on my part and on the part of the group to which I belong .
The aim is therefore to step up research in areas such as the gathering and storing of information , vigilance , spying , security and ‘crisis management’ .
The ESRP will involve relevant security research stakeholders and will enjoy appropriate funding , so as to secure the greatest possible continuity over time and the best results .     .
I feel that issues of Internet governance and mechanisms for financing the new technologies should be at the forefront of political debate in Europe and the rest of the world .
What Parliament is set to adopt or reject is Mr Lauk’s report , and we must therefore give our opinions solely on Mr Lauk’s report .
We therefore hope , in contrast with the rapporteur’s call , that these mistakes can be corrected in plenary .
To criticise the minor amendments made to the Pact by the Council , as the rapporteur does – and this places him alongside the most hard-line critics of those amendments – is , in my view , to overlook the wider picture in Europe and the EU’s economic and social problems .
This crucial market will also be incapable of growing stronger unless there is a shared vision of the use of the various forms of energy production .
Mr Chichester’s report takes these points on board and , accordingly , represents a positive step towards improving upon the Commission ’s proposal .
As we said at the time , it is wrong to award patents to ideas , to knowledge and – who knows where it will end – to life itself .
As we have seen , software has contributed towards the development of economies and has made it possible to make many tasks automatic and simplified at relatively low cost .
What this boils down to is that software patents are simply legal mechanisms for concentrating the development of knowledge and the capacity for innovation into the hands of large multinational corporations such as Microsoft and others .
The latter is an issue that should be very close to our hearts , in terms of the benefits that individual Member States can derive from their environment and , politically , in terms of the legacy of protection that we will pass on to future generations .     .
Although the report states that its objective is to set up a framework in which the Member States will set out general , transparent and non-discriminatory policies on security of the electricity supply , this objective is in fact lower down the report’s list of priorities than the need for compatibility with the requirements of a competitive single market for electricity .
Hence our vote .     .
The solution cannot be more of the same acceleration of the so-called structural reforms , namely , making the labour market more flexible , the policy of liberalisations and the privatisation of social security .
In this respect , I endorse the report before us .
What is more , it stresses that the popularity of the euro is
