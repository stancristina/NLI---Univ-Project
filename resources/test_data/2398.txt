the United States delegation .
I shall continue with regard to the death penalty on the basis of the comments made by Mr Alavanos .
In other words , if some current bilateral agreement is more advanced , this acquis is not affected .
I should like to finish by thanking Parliament once again for giving us the opportunity to update and listen to you and to assure you once again that we shall listen to the views of the European Parliament with particular attention before the completion of all the procedures .
This debate , which has been given the name ' Wider Europe - New neighbours' , was basically inaugurated last year with interventions and contributions from the Member States .
This approach is based on the principle of differentiation , taking account of the conditions which characterise each country , its political and economic power , its performance and the Union 's objectives for each .
These thoughts were debated in depth in April , when the strengthening of cooperation between the European Union and its eastern and Mediterranean neighbours and how to evaluate their progress was examined .
It does not , of course , concern candidate countries or potential candidate countries , the countries of the western Balkans .
As regards the political values , these constitute the basis for improving political relations and are a necessary component for internal political stability and economic prosperity .
On the contrary , we need to find ways to bridge the communication gap which different languages , religions , customs and behaviours create , so that we respect cultural diversity at the same time .
That brings me to common economic values .
The integration of Russia and the Ukraine in the global economic system is of particular importance .
Nor should the prospect of establishing a regime for the free movement of people be completely excluded today , even as a long-term objective .
The liberalisation of trade will also prove to be a catalyst to economic reform .
The Petersberg tasks and reinforced cooperation with Russia and the Ukraine are an important tool in the direction we want .
It is advisable to strengthen this dialogue both on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the Barcelona process .
First element : the establishment of a free trade zone and environmental protection are complementary , not incompatible .
Third element : the development of cross-border cooperation and the integration of our neighbouring countries into the trans-European networks , especially the transport , telecommunications and energy networks .
Fifth element : adequate criteria for progress with reforms .
Often , symbolism can prove to be a useful tool and incentive for essential reforms .
This position must become the position of all of us , peoples and governments alike of both the 25 and the 27 , and that is because , in certain cases , sometimes overt and sometimes concealed , opposition is being expressed on the basis of historical atavism or by reviving past antagonisms and/or enmities .
On the borders of Europe , following enlargement , interesting tasks are under way , tasks that are often of wider geopolitical and strategic interest , including for countries which are not located in this area , which means that they intervene in developments .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the opportunity given to me today to refer to the relations between the European Union and Russia is exceptionally timely , given that the summit in St Petersburg , which will be held at the end of May , has given occasion both here and in Moscow for an integrated examination of the framework for cooperation between the two sides .
At the same time , enlargement will increase the points of contact , the common interests and the common challenges even more .
As I just said , the Russian economy is still in a transitional stage .
Its political system presents a similar picture .
And although the means we use are different , essentially the objectives , in other words the dissemination of the Union 's values to its surroundings , to its environment , both geographical and political , always constitute the basis of our policy .
May I remind you that this is the type of agreement which the European Union has kept for all the countries of the former Soviet Union , with the exception of the Baltic States , which we recently welcomed as members of the ?U.
This cooperation was implemented in a series of ad hoc initiatives .
On the other hand , neither the ? U nor Russia appear to be ready to proceed with a radical reform of the framework , a reform that would also presuppose time-consuming procedures for new negotiation and ratification .
We hope that Russia will respond positively and that this will be reflected in the summit 's decisions .
Beyond the medium - and long-term prospects of our relations with Russia , we have also focused on achieving tangible results on a series of outstanding issues .
Fourthly , we are optimistic that the mechanism for resolving differences within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement will have been set up by the time the summit takes place .
Thus , we have focused our efforts on the environment , by which I mean Russia has to agree to ratify the Kyoto protocol , on nuclear safety , on issues of safety at sea and on issues of justice and home affairs , with the emphasis on progress with negotiations on the readmission agreement .
There has been another such attack today .
At the same time , we need to encourage Moscow to move towards the application of an integrated policy on Chechnya , the aim of which will be the establishment of peace , the consolidation of a climate of trust and the economic and social reconstruction of the area .
