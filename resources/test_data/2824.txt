The media are taking the view that , in the present situation , the disappearance of Ariel Sharon presages disaster and that the outlook is quite frightening .
Indeed , Sharon seemed to be the only person capable of seeing through the astonishing process of unilateral partition that he had devised as a preparatory stage to peace .
We know that .
You also underline that we all have a duty of good governance , involving in particular proper coordination between different policies , partnership between institutions and with the competent players , and statistical and analytical monitoring of our policies .
How can we continue to aspire to making the European Union’s economy the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 without eradicating the continuing disparities between men and women ?
That is the perspective in which the Commission intends working on this problem .
The Commission is currently preparing a roadmap for equality between men and women , which will take over from the framework strategy starting in 2007 .
The gender dimension is of course included in the statistics .
To that end , it stipulates that the Community will promote social dialogue and social protection .
The question is therefore settled and for my part I am therefore against referring it back to committee .     ) .
This report comes from a pen of considerable scientific authority in parliamentary law , and it is clear from reading it that he has used the great authorities in the discipline , such as Eugène Pierre .
I doubt it .
This report tries to strike a balance between protecting the income of European farmers and that of farmers in the ACP countries .
For every tonne of sugar they do not produce , they will be paid EUR 400 , 500 or 600 .
The failure of the Constitutional Treaty is less a problem of text than of context .
We must not draw premature conclusions , on behalf of the citizens of our Member States .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I supported Mr  Tannock 's report on the European Neighbourhood Policy , which was adopted on the same day as the Duff-Voggenhuber report on the future of the constitutional process .
I have held political dialogue with the DRC and certain local associations on programmes which will be funded with a view to combating this phenomenon .
I hope that , in April , I will be able to show you that the work of Parliament and the initiatives you have taken have not fallen on deaf ears : your proposal will be given the full place it deserves , since I am convinced that this is a just cause .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the European Parliament for offering me the opportunity to take part in this debate on a possible resolution on the extradition of former President Fujimori to Peru .
The HCR must also bear some of the responsibility .
Following the recent release of two hundred and fifty refugees , we do not have any precise information about whether there are still women , children or refugees from the region of Darfur in prisons .
Mr President , Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , Mr Solana , Mr Winkler , ladies and gentlemen , – Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Solana , ladies and gentlemen , the present situations in Palestine and Iran are indeed difficult , and I envy nobody who tries to intervene in them .
As a Green , I am not in favour of nuclear power , but we cannot have a situation in which some states will use nothing else , while , at the same time , telling the Iranians that they may not use it ; that is immoral , nothing but immoral .
Has the world become a safer and fairer place ?
After the high hopes of ten years ago , the feeling is now one of extreme exasperation in the face of the continuing occupation , the development of settlements , the construction of the wall , the ‘targeted ’ assassinations , the arrests , the detention of prisoners , the daily violence and the worsening living conditions as a result of the territories being sealed off .
You had to guide me through some difficult decisions .
The third challenge consists of making a distinction , irrespective of the circumstances , between the Palestinian Government , which will have to face up to its responsibilities , and the Palestinian people , which cannot be taken hostage on account of the choice it has made .
We have to set a date – a schedule – so that Hamas faces up to its responsibilities , because it has become a legitimate party in a democratic country .     Madam President , I will be quick as I only have one minute in which to express my disappointment at seeing that , in this Chamber , our Parliament has chosen carefully to avoid ‘speaking the truth’ .
That is why our Parliament had been unable to reach an agreement during the previous legislature and why Mr Lisi’s report had resulted in an admission of failure .
Moreover , we want to preserve small-scale fishing , which is so very important in the regions concerned , where it provides a livelihood for thousands of people , as has been said .
There is a big difference between serving a very dense population , like that of the Netherlands , which is concentrated on very flat territory , and serving , on the same terms , the same population spread over thousands of islands , as in Greece , or over a very diverse territory , as in France .
Finally , because better lawmaking does not mean no lawmaking at all .
It is not enough to dress up the policies
