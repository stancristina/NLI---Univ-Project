This is , in my view , entirely unacceptable .
Most important of all is the issue of discharges of nitrates .
As far as we are concerned , this is the absolutely critical issue .
This will become clear , for example , in the case of the Baltic Sea , where we have great problems with eutrophication as a result of emissions from agriculture .
I welcome the setting up of Excellence Networks and the simplification of bureaucracy .
I believe that there is a problem with the uncertainty that still remains in respect of the European Research Council .
Where women are concerned , we know that discrimination still occurs in every Member State in the field of research and development , both in relation to content and to participation .
The research that is taking place on the basis of this technique is extremely important for the work of coming to grips with the big endemic diseases , diabetes , rheumatism , Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s , these being diseases that affect a large number of Europeans .
Thank you .     Mr President , by agreement with the rapporteur , Mr  Hughes , who cannot be in the House today , I would like to request referral back to the committee for further discussion .
Thank you .     We believe that , in the light of the principle of subsidiarity , an EU policy on floods is only justified in cases involving cross-border watercourses .
Although the groups involved are important ones , such as students , participants in organised programmes and business travellers , the question must be asked as to what the situation is for other groups , in other words for the great majority who really would benefit from seeing something of the world .
This is because the jungle-like mess of requirements relating to invitations and mandatory registrations is not going to be overhauled .
There is no legal recourse for bringing the children back home to the other parent .
The agreement makes a difference to too few people and does not sufficiently simplify the actual visa process .
That is the task for which we were elected .     Mr President , it is , of course , excellent that we have regular fora and mechanisms to develop and deepen our partnership with Russia .
On the other hand , it is better that we do make slow progress and attempt to achieve quality in the relations that we do have .
It is gratifying that Russia is on the same side as the USA and ourselves in respect of the negotiations with Iran , but it is less pleasing that Russia is playing solo when it comes to Belarus , Hamas and other matters .
As many of my fellow Members have already pointed out , we must be extremely clear when it comes to any evaluations we make of our relations with Russia .
Foreign Minister Lavrov visited the Committee on Foreign Affairs a month ago .
It is incredibly important that we are clear when we bring up the situation of voluntary organisations , the increasingly dwindling freedom of the media and the concentration of power in the hands of Mr Putin .
The first criterion is that funding is only supposed to be given to projects that cannot otherwise be funded in a simple way .
Yet , if this is so , what we have here is a case of building first and worrying about monitoring things afterwards .
Seventeen organisations were against what was proposed .
I would like to say a particularly warm thank you to Mr Varvitsiotis for his constructive work .
In Sweden , we have discovered that our prisons are regarded as having a very strong international ‘force of attraction’ .
Quite simply , we need a flexible mechanism for carrying this out , something which this framework decision will certainly contribute to .
I deeply regret the fact that the Presidency is not present .     Mr President , Commissioner Špidla , in Parliament , we very often talk – and quite rightly so – about non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all .
The fact that various forms of discrimination are often debated here in Parliament is due , I believe , to the fact that such issues are very important and complicated , but perhaps it shows , above all , the very large amount there is still to do .
As long as this continues to be the case in political assemblies , industry and training , as well as socially and economically , I believe that special measures must be implemented .
It is my view that discrimination has continued , all along , despite all the talk of change .
It is absolutely not a question of equal conditions applying .
The EU might listen , but is it concerned about what people are actually saying ?
Instead , what was referred to as a period of reflection was introduced , with the unexpressed but clear aim of having the same Constitution smuggled in later , notwithstanding the will of the people .
If the desire is for an open debate on the EU’s future , the democratic ground rules must be respected , and it must be made clear that the Constitution has been rejected once and for all .     Mr President , typical statements contained in the Presidency’s draft conclusions concern the EU’s need to listen to people and need to conduct a dialogue with them .
This means that political representatives do not in practice see themselves as representatives of the people but as a group or establishment in opposition to the people .
Europeans cannot vote for their own parties and , at the same time , communicate their deep euroscepticism .
It is in principle a good thing to help speed up the transfer of sentenced persons
