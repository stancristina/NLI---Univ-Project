the Industry Committee 's position .
It seems to have been overlooked by many that these amendments , if carried , would leave the European Union in a much weaker position with regard to ozone targets than is enjoyed by the United States of America .
We are aware of growing problems of ozone across Europe , but if we are not even prepared to match the standards being set by the USA , one of our great commercial rivals , this would indeed be a great shame and a sorry reflection on our commitment to environmental improvement .
I ask Parliament to support my proposals , to give its backing to the Commissioner and to let her play her part in negotiating a common position which is both ambitious and politically realistic .
Mr President , the industry committee , after much discussion and serious consideration , is overwhelmingly opposed to the Commission 's proposed ceilings , and this is across all groups and nationalities .
The UN ECE ceilings were agreed by all our Member States , by the applicant countries and globally , in a protocol signed at Gothenburg as recently as November 1999 .
Why did the Commission come up with these even stricter and substantially more expensive ceilings only one month later ?
I understand that the groups , the whole Parliament , are split on this issue , between supporters of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and supporters of the industry committee 's line .
Members of Parliament should be aware of the serious implications for our industries and agriculture , for our competitiveness , for jobs and - yes - for people and our constituents if the Commission proposal wins through .
The industry committee urges this House to vote in favour of the amendments which are tabled in my name and in the name of Mr Bowe .
These are the amendments passed by the industry committee .
The UN ceilings are quite ambitious enough for us to reach our internationally agreed targets in reasonable time .
The industry committee wishes to see these limits fully and properly implemented across the European Union and globally .
The Commission can then concentrate on ensuring this occurs , on perfecting the models that are used and perhaps come up with new proposals in two or three years ' time on the basis of much more convincing arguments regarding the relevant costs and benefits .
Support the Purvis amendments and the United Nations Gothenburg table of national emission ceilings .
Mr President , my congratulations to Mrs Myller who I know has thought long and hard about this report .
It seems to me that the debate comes down to this : do we believe that the Gothenburg Protocol was the best Member States can realistically achieve ?
I recognise that the Commission and environmental groups believe that in practice much more can be delivered but nonetheless some Member States have committed themselves to significant reductions in air pollution - though that is certainly not true of all of them .
Some Member States seem to have gone into the negotiations with a few calculations on the back of an envelope and refused to compromise in any way to set themselves any realistic targets .
Others have not even used the same methodology , the same basis of calculation as others .
So the protocol in many ways is a nonsense .
It can give us no confidence whatsoever .
It is a messy political compromise and nothing more .
I do not know how much more the Commissioner can achieve but we should be seeking reductions in air pollution and we should be giving her our support in her efforts to negotiate them .
We should support this report and give her our backing .
Mr President , I certainly welcome this report and I gave it a lot of support in the Environment Committee .
I creates a proper framework in which we can work in the long term to reduce emissions .
The vast majority of the amendments I can support .
There are one or two that went through that I have some doubts about , particularly Amendment No 7 , which I cannot see as being environmental at all , or as contributing to the overall attempt to reduce the amount of ozone-depleting substances at ground level anywhere in the Union .
I want to come to the issue which Mr Davies has addressed , namely , where we should start from .
With what targets are we to start ?
Mr President , a series of quite practical and well-argued and debated figures were arrived at just before Christmas at Gothenburg under the UN/ECE protocol , and it seems to me that is the logical place to start .
It would not to my mind be the right place to finish , but it certainly would be the right place to start and it is the reason why I was convinced when I was there in the debate in the Industry Committee , as none of my colleagues from the Environment Committee were , that it was the right place to start .
It seems to me that the Commission figures are aspirational .
Yes , we could go there - we should be trying to go there , but I do not think we should be starting there .
We should be starting with the UN/ECE figures , with the Gothenburg protocol and revising them as is proposed by Mrs Myller in her report .
Mr President , I would like , on behalf of the committee , to move at least one of the oral questions .
First of all , I sympathise with the Commissioner 's desire to get better implementation of European Union law .
That is something which the committee as a whole is keen to see
