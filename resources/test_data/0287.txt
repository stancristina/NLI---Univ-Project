one is to create a training network by means of a Council act , another is to create a Community agency for this purpose and the third option is to keep the existing network operational and at the same time increase the support given to it by the Union .
This will benefit the mutual recognition of decisions in both civil and criminal law cases , which is ultimately the cornerstone of judicial cooperation .
To be precise , I do not believe that the solution lies in a form of harmonisation that is tied to the lowest common denominator .
In fact , adopting legislation is an important part of creating a common asylum policy ; the management of asylum policy can benefit from the open method of coordination , from convergence and from the harmonisation of the practices , measures and guidelines implemented by national administrations in the field of asylum .
The Commission maintains , in the document that we forwarded to Parliament on the relationship between safeguarding internal security and complying with the obligations and instruments of international protection , that it is possible to achieve an equitable balance between improving internal security in Europe , especially following the events of 11 September 2001 , and ensuring that the rights of refugees and other values that are crucial to Europe 's democracies are protected .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , asylum policy is one of the hottest and most sensitive issues on the Community agenda .
We agree with the comments that Commissioner Vitorino has just made to the House underlining the need for legislative measures to be adopted at Community level .
Mr President , I should like to make two brief remarks following this most interesting and stimulating debate .
Since Amsterdam , it has been quite clear that the development of European asylum policy will take place in two stages ( 'generations ' ) .
If this was achieved in the field of chemistry it would probably merit a Nobel prize , having one rule with 15 different exceptions , one for each of the 15 Member States .
This is the best way to respect the principle of subsidiarity .
Under our proposal , Parliament will be joining this exercise .
I respect your disagreement , but I do not think that I am wrong .
It is unacceptable that someone who has been the victim of a crime should be victimised once again because the system provides them with inadequate or non-existent protection .
The Santini report is based on the observation that the exercise of the freedom of movement will lead to a huge increase in cross-border cases involving individuals with such modest incomes that they might not be able to access justice or benefit from adequate legal aid .
The first component was the regulation on TSEs adopted last year .
The Commission is greatly encouraged that all three institutions are in general agreement on four key principles .
The solution permits a temporary relaxation of the ban on the use of catering waste in feed for some Member States , under certain highly controlled conditions to be established by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health .
The Commission is proposing a reduction in the minimum number of compulsory scrutinies for commercial and industrial undertakings which have received an agricultural subsidy from the Community budget , for the disposal of agricultural surpluses from the internal market or for other purposes .
Given these circumstances , we again insist , as we have done over the last three years , on the Commission 's significantly increasing its direct action to monitor fraud and falsification in the food trade and industry .
I must highlight once again that the idea that only the falsification of milk products directly subsidised by Community funds can be considered to affect the financial interests of the Community is unacceptable .
The Commission in particular and the European Union in general can only gain by disseminating all available information to the citizens and primarily by the public 's understanding of the relationship between the main beneficiaries of common funding policies .
It is absolutely crucial that the proclaimed reform of the CAP can incorporate these and other principles .
Commissioner , this is not the first time that I have heard the Commission say this , but I am tempted to say that perhaps the Commission needs to take a closer look at Article 280 .
Secondly , the Commissioner says that the performance of this regulation has been satisfactory .
We are now in 2002 , and we still do not know which undertakings are involved and what the Commission intends to do to these undertakings .
In these circumstances , however , I do not understand why it is that when we reach this point , the Commission and , therefore , also the Commissioner , are no longer calling for transparency .
What aspect of this needs to remain secret ?
This is what is happening to milk producers .
I cannot go to the farmers of the region that I represent here and tell them something like this , because there is no possible explanation for this and therefore I should like the Commission to clearly explain the reason for this incongruity .
.
This economic internalisation , which is already taking place in the industry and energy sectors , specifically under the European Directive on Emissions Trading ( on the first reading of which this Parliament will shortly vote ) , must be extended to all economic sectors and to all activities .
Travel agencies and tour operators outside the EU will have to pay VAT when they provide services to European customers , and conversely , European travel agencies will be exempt from VAT when they provide services to customers residing outside the EU , thereby re-establishing healthy and fair competition in the European internal market .
