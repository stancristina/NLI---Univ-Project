are to increase the rate of employment and fund our social security systems , we will have to have a longer working life and , above all , we will have to have more and better trained women in work .
In order to achieve this strategic direction , there must be an institutional alliance which transcends the natural differences of political opinion .
I also would also like to see everyone receiving professional training , whether they are unemployed or not , to be able to gain a kind of "driving licence " for the information society , which will enable them to operate computers and navigate the Internet .
Much has been said in today ' s debate about the fundamental concepts of modern life , such as globalisation , the knowledge society and the relationship between the old and new economies .
But in addition to investing in people , public authorities , be they individual Member States , the European Union itself or international authorities , must be equipped with regulatory powers to ensure that business and personal initiatives are compatible with social justice and fairness .
At such times of profound change , problems , particularly those concerning employment in the old economy , have been resolved by turning to the new economy and its resources .
Lastly , I would like to answer a question that I have been asked , which is whether I am speaking here on behalf of 15 or 14 countries .
Because , if modern societies have one enemy today , it is irrationality in political behaviour .
It also condemned the trials they are constantly subjected to and the consequent lack of free speech and absence of a free press .
I also invite the President of the European Parliament to express to the Angolan Government , through the appropriate channels , this Parliament ' s most vehement and indignant protest at the insult that was also targeted at this House , and which represents , apart from anything else , an intolerable abuse of the principle of independence that Members enjoy in carrying out their duties .
Mr President , we all have the right to express our opinions in this House and in a democracy .
- ( PT ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , the only really fundamental thing about the idea of a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the Union is an attempt , under the guise of appearing to be generous , to take a step towards the so-called constitutionalisation of the Treaties , or even more directly , towards a European constitution for a European State .
We do not think that it would be correct , and certainly not appropriate , to impair and disturb the balance of the Treaties at present .
Secondly , because it would give rise to an overlapping and potentially disruptive conflict with the protection afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights , under the tried and tested institutional framework of the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights .
If the EU really does want to take symbolic steps in this field , it needs to go down a different path .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the current presidency of the European Union believes that the plan to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is an extremely important step in creating a Community of values which will act as a focus for taking the process of political union further .
This culture is in fact part of a tradition of tolerance which has been cultivated in this continent and which now , in turn , is at the heart of the European project itself .
This is not the case , and that is not the purpose of all this .
I would like to emphasise that in making these comments , I am speaking on behalf of the Council and not necessarily on behalf of my own country , which has adopted a rather , shall we say , ambitious position on this matter .
This also brings us to the issue , which has surfaced once again following Amsterdam , of the Union possibly signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights .
Are we to be content with a body of basic principles , a kind of lowest common denominator in academic European terms , or should reach out to more ambitious territory , and deal with the modern aspects of today ' s European Union ?
If we create a Charter of Fundamental Rights which is merely a declaration of intent , will we not simply be taking refuge behind an issue which may be politically correct , but which does not reflect to the essence of the European Union as it is today ?
This is also why we feel - and we said so in Cologne when the idea of a Charter of Fundamental Rights was approved at the European Council - that this Charter is a vital element , central to the Union ' s future .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is for all of these reasons that the Council is taking a special interest in the resolution that this Parliament has just adopted on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and will continue to attach the greatest importance to this resolution .
This composition , which I believe to be a wise choice , covering both the Community and national domains as it does , will help to strengthen the legitimacy of the draft charter in the eyes of the general public , as well as guaranteeing the success of the work currently being done .
The truth is that the Commission , as stated in Paragraph 14 of the resolution tabled by the European Parliament , takes the view that the legal force of the charter should be determined by the Nice European Council
