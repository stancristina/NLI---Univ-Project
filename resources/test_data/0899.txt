by doing so , put the mind at rest of the 23 NGOs that will be presenting President Barroso with an urgent note on this matter this weekend .
I would wish the President , Mr Mitchell , the Council and Commission good luck with this success .
The objective , a limit value for nitrate , has already been laid down .
This House has managed to make the notion of 'protection against quantitative decline ' legally binding .
Human rights for others are more important than the economic benefits accruing to us from cheap imports from countries where human rights are trampled underfoot .
We are now trying to cushion this with EUR 500 million annually , which will not be enough .
Even if a disaster were to strike in my region , this Fund can be used to enhance further employment .
Secondly , I also have mixed feelings about the content .
Considering , however , that these standards will not take effect for a number of years , I wonder why we are in such a hurry now .
This is why I have re-tabled Amendment 59 of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety in order to spell out the fact that Member States may take more far-reaching measures in order to achieve the air quality standards .
I do not intend to mince my words when I say that integration capacity is not an argument in favour of enlargement , or , indeed against it , but we must all be clear what we are talking about .
In my country too , I have noticed that those in favour of accession two years ago are suddenly against Turkey joining , because that is the way the opinion polls are tending to go .
Negotiations with another candidate country , Macedonia , have not even actually got off the ground yet .
We owe it to the many residents of our Member States who hail from the former Yugoslavia and Turkey to take seriously those regions ' desire for accession . on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , the Stubb report is disappointing for more than one reason .
In that way , the enlargement process will become more transparent and Parliament will be able to actually add substance to its responsibility of parliamentary control at all the crucial junctures of the accession process .
I cannot possibly be upbeat about the REACH proposal that has been rushed through Parliament .
Even a little more healthy is still ill .
Research shows that advertising impacts greatly on consumption and buying behaviour . 2.
Since the Television Directive is being tabled for first reading , it is not yet a final legal document .
We shall leave it up to the Member States to decide on this .
That , finally , the fund is constructed in such a way that the contributions cannot be intercepted by 'other players' , but are of direct benefit to the workers can only serve as an example to other structural funds . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Mrs Lehtom√§ki gave me an amazing piece of information when she said that she has been aware of the automated targeted system since 2005 .
You rightly inquired of the United States authorities how this ATS relates to the PNR Agreement .
Finally , on PNR specifically , could the Commission and the Council confirm that the push system will be tested , as agreed , before the end of this month ?
I wonder whether this agreed deadline applies to them .
Will you check whether this is possible ?
As I see it , though , the system makes no provision for this whatever .
Even more alarming is the situation when somebody who has lost their driving licence following a serious traffic infringement or reckless driving , is given the opportunity to sit another driving test in another Member State of the European Union .
There is also another side to this : motorcyclists and moped riders are right in believing that car drivers own the roads , which is why the latter would prefer to ban the two-wheelers from them .
The alternative upheld by Mr Bradbourn may work well in the splendid isolation of the United Kingdom , but not for Member States with national borders that cross densely populated areas . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , 10 years ago , the idea of tough measures to put an end to single-hulled oil tankers was not yet a realistic one .
The freedom for existing single-hulled tankers to continue to transport heavy types of oil until 2015 could well cause major problems .
This is how railway companies are given the freedom to curtail the sale of tickets for , and information relating to , far-away destinations , and , to an increasing degree , to restrict passenger-friendly offers for travelling abroad .
Not only the advent of cars and a widely available motorway network , but also tax exemption for aircraft fuel and the advent of price-cutting airlines has meant that rail transport is considered expensive in relative terms .
This can be done by adopting Amendments 33 , 34 and 36 , which have been drafted with that in mind .
The climate problem is so extensive that it will be necessary to keep it on the agenda for decades to come .
Secondly , I fully agree with the remarks made by Mrs Roure on the need for global standards on data protection .
Would it not make sense to first evaluate how this one works and how effective it has been before we start talking about the next one ?
It does not reassure me and I would like further reassurances about profiling and data-mining .
