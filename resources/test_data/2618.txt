Let us hope that this cooperation between the Member States leads to less bureaucracy and equal procedures and criteria .
The same applies to the amendments with a trade-political content tabled by Mr Herzog .
I should like to single out a number of elements from the report by Mrs Figueiredo that is before us .
Can the Commission give assurances that it will draft a political analysis of the state of implementation by the Member States of the equal treatment acquis and of its intentions to amend this legislation , if necessary , or to start treaty inbox procedures ?
In the explanatory statement , the rapporteur points out that the local labour market is stable and less sensitive to the economic cycle .
It is not sufficient to draw attention to the special significance of high-quality childcare .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the communication we are debating today contains the strategy by means of which the European Union attempts to make a contribution to social development .
It is true that gender forms part of the ILO 's core labour standards because the non-discrimination principle and the principle of equal treatment are , after all , enshrined in it .
Respect for core labour standards in an ever more globalising economy is a matter whose importance has to be continuously reiterated and driven home .
I am grateful for this .
Another quality of the ILO is that it combines legislation with very practical , technical support on site .
We hope that Johannesburg is a turning point .
It almost always leads to social exclusion of the weak .
Mr President , I should like to offer my sincere congratulations to the Commission and to Mrs Gillig , and also to all the Parliamentary committees that have , in actual fact , drafted excellent reports .
I have written an initiative report on this domestic slavery .
In fact , the same question could be asked about the introduction and follow-up of clauses concerning human rights and women 's rights .
I am concerned that this very much applies to agriculture .
The first defect is that self-certification is considered to be the greatest good .
It appeared to be an attempt to cast the entire European Union back into the nineteenth century , the era before the rise of the labour movement and the environmental movement , and before the introduction of universal suffrage .
The above is partly substantiated by Commissioner Byrne in his replies during the debate and is therefore worth considering when drafting the requested evaluation or new legislation .
Since , due to their long-term absence , they cannot manage the holiday home themselves ; somebody has to do it for them .
Large , profitable companies can buy up other companies .
Twelve years of Regulation No 4064/89 have not managed to break this cycle , and neither will the forthcoming review and cooperation with national competition authorities .
Since the control mechanism is applied differently in different Member States , fishermen are not treated in the same way .
Where one country has a surplus of speed controls , the other only monitors serious offences .
Surely it is too crazy for words that we do not know whether all European fishermen keep to the quota or not .
The question is whether an invitation to the European Commission , the Council , the Member States and the employers ' organisations to follow the International Labour Organisation during the forthcoming WTO negotiations is all that is required , or whether we are also prepared to protest against a permanently unwilling WTO .
It means that we in Europe , and other countries in the region , will be receiving many refugees from Somalia , and I do not know whether they will be welcome everywhere .
In the light of their past , do they really want Somalia to be reunited ?
We think that other means should be employed .
In any case , I think that the emergency aid you are planning to grant will remain necessary in any event , and that Europe must back the peace process with vigour and in a spirit of solidarity .
Somalia has sunk into oblivion , while the threat of international Muslim terrorism requires the involvement of the United States , the United Nations and the European Union as a matter of the most pressing urgency .
So far , none of our punitive resolutions have achieved anything .
If we want peace restored in the Congo , he must leave that country .
It is unfortunate that Zimbabwe is once again on the agenda .
I am in complete agreement with Mrs Maes regarding the situation in the Congo .
Imagine too the improbable situation which white cattle farmers are facing thanks to Mugabe .
Mr President , could I draw your attention and that of the services to paragraph 12 of the proposed resolution ?
Mr President , last year , Parliament discussed an Association Agreement with Egypt .
Thank you , Mr President .
This is on top of our own experiences .
Although I am sensitive to this criticism , I think one could claim that Lukashenko is mainly isolating himself and that we are actually waiting with bated breath for a sign on his part , an essential concession to democracy , so that we can respond by opening up a gateway for his country .
Parallel to this , the authorities in Minsk are working towards ever tighter government control on people 's basic constitutional rights .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European packaging directive has had a considerable impact .
Secondly , the environmental yield is not always obvious .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have discussed this topic at great length .
Producers opt for product packaging on the basis of essential functions , within which there are various options .
This is how an incentive is created to achieve
