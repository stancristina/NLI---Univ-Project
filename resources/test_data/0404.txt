The United States should be left to wage the wars until the Americans themselves are consumed in blood and fire , just as the Romans were .
The first way is intended for human beings and the second way for wild beasts .
Can the conflicts of today and tomorrow really be resolved using military methods ?
The EU should state that the reconstruction of Iraq must take place under the auspices of the UN.
A belligerent party is not impartial and cannot be entrusted with such reconstruction and take responsibility for it .
Nor do we support the idea of certain countries ' being able to take the lead in common defence work , or the introduction of a collective defence clause .
As long as two thousand years ago , Cicero knew that only wild beasts try to resolve conflicts through violence .
Certain parts of it are likely to influence the Convention .
The current system is inefficient and expensive .
Do European taxpayers really think that having to pay for the development of three new ultra-modern war planes is rational and efficient ?
Let us now focus upon what is constructive and build upon common definitions and methods .
If the EU wishes to have influence , the EU Member States must cooperate .
Some hours ago , the vast majority of us voted in favour of a major enlargement of the EU.
That is a fact of which we must take account in developing the common security policy for the EU.
I do not believe that the purpose of the EU 's security policy should , in the first place , be to develop strong , joint military power .
Mr President , the report and the proposal for a directive are important from health and safety points of view .
The rapporteur , Mr Liese , has added some important dimensions by also choosing to address the ethical aspects of a number of points .
Secondly , Amendment No 79 proposes the compilation of a code of conduct , if possible at UN level , for the protection of human dignity .
Fourthly , Amendment No 31 contains requirements for regulating , in particular , the use of germ cells , embryonic stem cells and foetal stem cells .
There are important clarifications of what should apply in the case of persons who cannot legally give consent themselves , as well as in the case of deceased or , as the case may be , living persons .
My answer is that a much more stringent statement than the one that has now emerged would of course have been desirable .
The Commission 's proposal states that if a surfactant passes the test for ultimate biodegradability , no further tests shall be required before the substance is released onto the market .
It is therefore not enough just to examine biodegradability .
It is consumers who , through their choices , have given impetus to this development .
Existing chemicals legislation states that , as soon as a substance or preparation has been classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic to reproduction , it must be included in this annex and not released onto the market .
We believed that we did not need to wait for the new chemicals legislation and wanted , for the sake of public health , to make amendments more promptly .
The second deficiency led to our naturally wanting a ban on the use of CMR products in cosmetics .
The Council has since rejected Parliament 's amendments .
It can therefore be stated that Parliament 's proposal concerning cosmetic products has been accepted .
There has also been a proposal from the Commission to the effect that , since the use of chemicals by consumers cannot be controlled , safety can only be ensured by prohibiting the general use of substances and preparations that are carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic to reproduction .
As I see it , that is a completely baffling argument .
That is very commendable , and I am really pleased about it .
I have chosen , however , not to do so , and my colleagues in the committee were of the same view .
We have come to the end of the road where the proposals relating to the second type of product are concerned .
Just as he says , the price of coffee has fallen dramatically in recent years .
That means that he or she - it is often women , by the way , who work on the coffee plantations - would have to labour for a week or more in order to afford a single cup of coffee in a bar here in Strasbourg .
Competition has become tougher .
One problem in this connection - also addressed by Mr Liikanen - is that cultivation is too often unbalanced , and this naturally exacerbates the consequences of the crisis .
I shall not attempt a more detailed scientific analysis , but allow me to give an example .
The coffee bush cannot at present be used for animal feed .
These mushrooms , for example shitaki mushrooms , are of high nutritional value and produce a much higher price per kilo on the market than coffee does .
As everyone without exception will surely appreciate , this presupposes , however , knowledge derived from a variety of research disciplines and not a one-sided focus upon a single crop .
It should be possible to make use of the major surpluses within the European Development Fund to step up our efforts in the field of rural development - rural development that would then become more diversified in form than it would by focusing solely upon individual crops .
We support a drugs policy based on preventive work , treatment and a policy of criminalisation and control .
Each country should cooperate in reviewing the options for
