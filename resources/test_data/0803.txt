The UN should also be guaranteed resources for military crisis management .
It shows amazing arrogance towards Europe’s voters .     The Commission ’s proposal is aimed at getting to grips with unduly high fishing mortality rates and the problems of obtaining adequate reproduction in these areas .
I have therefore chosen to vote against the two above-mentioned reports .     We are in favour of Croatia , Serbia-Montenegro , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Macedonia and Albania being more closely associated with the EU.
In certain crisis situations , it is natural to use both military and civil resources .
It is so important that , in each and every one of the Member States , it needs to be handled by the national parliament .
One of the reasons for opposing the draft Constitution for Europe is precisely that , absurdly , it regulates matters that the Member States themselves should decide about .
We have therefore voted against this resolution in the final vote .     Mr President , imagine that , in one of our Member States , bomb attacks were to take place against former ministers , journalists were to be killed and opposition politicians murdered , and people were to be imprisoned and tortured by paramilitary forces .
It has not grappled with these problems in time and with sufficient vigour .
I think we must do everything in our power to help solve the problems and improve the situation in Bangladesh .
Its people need our support , and that is what we can offer them today .     Mr President , Commissioner Špidla , fellow citizens in the public gallery , ladies and gentlemen .
The EU’s seven to nine million Roma , a number equivalent to the Swedish population , are to be found in the majority of EU Member States , but no country properly recognises the group as its largest ethnic minority .
Worryingly enough , discrimination is also on the increase .
We must join with Roma women in integrating them and their children into our gender equality policy , particularly as it relates to the protection of reproductive and sexual health , promotion of family planning , education for children and girls and increased participation in political decision-making .
In the year 2000 , when the report on modernisation of the social protection systems was being debated , I myself was the rapporteur .
You pointed out some of them , two of which I want to address .
That is a good thing , but it also puts a bigger strain on health services .
Being familiar with the working environment and able to intervene early is important for health care .
The Services Directive is , in the first place , about commercial services , while this is a service of general interest and should be debated in that context .     Mr President , I wish to make a few comments on the resolution before us .
I therefore wish to limit legislative ambitions in future and slow down the process to some extent .
Technical development is taking place so quickly that competition from new players is breaking down the old monopolies .
If Britain wants its own rules , it too must have them .
There should be no devising of a common code , regulated by some directorate of the European Commission .
The terms harmonisation and level playing field have been the gateway to a suffocatingly legalistic system .
Scope should be provided for the mutual recognition of each others ’ systems .
I do not wish to see a new super-finance inspectorate in the EU.     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
It is easy to understand why people assume that the EU should make vigorous efforts to promote freedom of movement , especially since visa policy is harmonised and falls completely within the Commission ’s area of competence .
For example , Poland and Greece can issue a notification to the Commission to the effect that , in their cases , reciprocity is not being respected by the United States .
The EU should have recourse to other sanctions and not just automatically introduce a visa requirement .
Citizens of the Member State concerned must have a guarantee that their cases will be referred to the highest level and that this will result in a decision .
The report also has a new element , and one that I believe the Commission and the Council should ponder carefully .
In the same week that a shipping company was to begin operating ferries to Saint Petersburg , the visa rules were altered , with the result that the shipping company had to withdraw the service .
A very large majority of the committee believed that the Member States should be able to refer such cases to the Commission if the requirements introduced led to substantial limitations upon people’s opportunities to travel .
My report contains a proposal that may serve as a point of departure .
The furore surrounding Germany ’s Foreign Minister , Joschka Fischer , emphasises the need for this .
This is a third pillar issue concerning legal and police cooperation .
It is for the Council , not Parliament , to take decisions about these issues .
When groundwater is polluted , the consequences are longer-lasting than when surface water is polluted .
Groundwater is not , however , identical throughout the EU.
The groundwater issue is partly a cross-border issue .
It would , however , cause problems if the review were to be undertaken by the whole of the European Parliament , since few MEPs are aware of how the Foundation operates .
It is not , however , the EU’s task to guarantee human rights globally .
The resolution is largely , however , about strengthening the EU’s foreign policy role .
The Cabrnoch report is about modernising social protection and developing good quality healthcare
