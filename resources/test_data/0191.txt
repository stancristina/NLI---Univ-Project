The second part of Amendment 24 concerns the amount of the charges made , which does not necessarily apply in all cases .
I shall subsequently forward a full list of the Commission 's positions on Parliament 's amendments( 1 ) and I would like once again to thank the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done .     Mr President , I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament and especially the rapporteur , Mr Seeber , and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety for the excellent report which they have drafted at first reading .
This will safeguard for the citizens and for businesses a feasible and commonly acceptable level of protection .
Following a series of extreme floods in the past , numerous Member States and regions have already made significant progress in flood management .
Finally , it should be noted that the proposal for a directive on flood risk management is closely linked to the framework directive on water resources approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2000 .
This directive established a new policy for water resources , a policy that introduces the principle of integrated management of river catchment basins .
Indeed , floods must be managed by regional and central governments in such a way as to reduce the risk of floods both at river estuaries and sources .
Consequently , the link with the framework directive on water resources is very important .
I shall comment first of all on the amendments which the Commission can accept in full , in principle or in part .
As regards the impact of climate change , the Commission agrees that this parameter must be taken into account , especially when reviewing flood risk assessments .
Material and effective application of the directive depends on cooperation and coordination between the main flood risk management agencies in catchment basins that cross the administrative and political borders of several countries .
Consequently , certain types of floods cannot be exempted , which is why I accept Amendment 28 .
Secondly , certain amendments add superfluous references or overlap with other elements of Community legislation or create legal obscurity .
Of the 20 new amendments , the Commission can accept 14 either in part or in full .
Both citizens and businesses demand the same level of protection and flood risk management , irrespective of the type or geographical location of the catchment basin .
To conclude , I am pleased to announce that the Commission accepts 71 amendments , 16 of which are accepted in full and 55 of which are accepted in principle or in part .
With this oral question , therefore , we want to highlight the potential which tourism has to contribute to the development goals of the European Union and to the challenges which we are addressing all together .
I am delighted that the Commissioner agrees with us and we trust that he will exploit all the possibilities which the European Commission has through working groups and fora so that we all become aware of these challenges .
Members have quite rightly spoken about regeneration issues and about Euro-Mediterranean cooperation , employment policy , education , training and transport and consumer protection policy .
Measures which can be taken in order to strengthen tourism are the protection of alternative forms of tourism by developing the natural and the historically built-up landscape and strengthening it through existing programmes by tourist companies promoting thematic tourism ( ecological tourism , rambling and so forth ) in unsaturated tourist areas .
Our debate today on the Seventh Framework Programme is particularly important .
It is , of course , a question of the governments ' credibility , when they blithely set important objectives for the development and competitiveness of the European economy and then fail to express the political will to finance research and technology policies adequately .
I should also like to emphasise that it is important to safeguard the potential for all regions of the European Union to access and apply the programmes under the framework programme as a basic policy of long-term development , convergence and social cohesion , with the core objective of combating the digital divide , the research and innovation divide within Europe .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I consider that Parliament has done a very good job .
The fact that , over the period from 2000 to 2006 , 50 % of public and private money in research went to just 30 of the 254 regions of the European Union bears witness to the fact that excellence is trapped .
This is to the detriment of research itself , in that it restricts it to stem cells either of inferior quality or of limited potential and will force our researchers to go to other countries outside the European Union which have stocks of stem cells of these specific dates .
Having said which , I have tried to bring this report to a conclusion in close cooperation with the European Commission , the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , the European office of the World Health Organisation and various other national health departments , including the health department in my country , Cyprus .
There are five important points which I would like to expound : efforts to intensify coordination , the existence of 'flu vaccines and anti-viral drugs , information , transparency and public awareness , financing and financial aid for countries that need it .
As far as anti-viral drugs are concerned , plans to acquire them and the way in which they are used does not appear to be satisfactory enough .
With regard to the African and Asia countries , which are also considered to be the countries with the greatest need , we must ensure that they are provided with technical , economic and financial help .
