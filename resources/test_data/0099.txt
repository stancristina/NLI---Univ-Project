favour of this report .     .
That being said , the likelihood of it happening is open to question .
Accordingly , its objective and its substance fall under the competence of Community action programmes on the environment (EC Treaty ) and not under the provisions of the EU Treaty on police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters .
I particularly welcome the call for the Member States to take due account in their legislative practice of the various reasons for discrimination , with a view to bestowing a credibility on the Charter which has hitherto been weakened by the fact that the Charter is not legally binding .
On the other hand , this process has been successful due to the positive effects of the prospect of accession .
This has been borne out by the progress made by Romania during the past year .     .
Greater attention should have been paid to social problems and to finding an across-the-board solution for the aspirations of the people , with a view to improving well-being , development and economic and social cohesion .     .
I feel therefore that the solution lies in a fresh debate when the societies that are most hostile to this proposal show that they are ready .
As we have pointed out , inshore fisheries make a considerable contribution to the socio-economic wellbeing of coastal communities , contributing to local development , job preservation/creation both upstream and downstream , supplies of fresh fish and the preservation of traditional local cultures .
That being said , the report falls short of what is required as regards the immediate response to the problems associated with the current crisis and the new instruments needed to carry out a proper assessment of the specific nature of this sector of the fleet .
In this regard , I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and of the Members of this House to the reality of life in outermost regions such as the Azores and Madeira , where there are no continental shelves and where the coastal equivalent is effectively the coastal banks , which are sometimes a long way from the islands , but which to all intents and purposes represent exactly what the coast close to the land represents for other continental situations .
What we must do is condemn a whole series of investigation procedures carried out by OLAF , which failed to comply with any of the rules that must be followed under the rule of law , which failed to uphold the principles of exemption and impartiality , which failed to give the accused any opportunity for defence , and which , lastly , ensured that an investigation – an absolute fiasco – was directed against people who had absolutely nothing to do with the affair , rather than against the true culprits .
Investment in research into climate change and its impact on natural disasters and into energy sources other than fossil fuels must be stepped up .
I wish to lend my unequivocal backing to the establishment of a separate heading for fisheries , sustained exploitation of the oceans under the Seventh Framework Programme , and all of the other measures contained in the report .     .
We are therefore very disappointed with the rejection of a number of proposals aimed at safety at work and the prevention of work-related diseases , and the use of ICTs for sustainable development and social and economic inclusion .
Lastly , the importance of this programme in the context of regional development comes to the fore , insofar as it provides for involvement with the Structural Funds and refers to the need to take account of the ‘Convergence ’ objective regions , which covers almost all of Portuguese territory , when awarding funding .
We wish to draw attention to the fact that the EU still has high levels of unemployment , poverty , social exclusion and income inequality .
There is therefore no reason whatsoever to include this case in such an important motion for a resolution , on an issue of such importance .     .
Who will bear these costs and how will the burden be spread among the Member States at a time of restricted Community budget ?
At a time when the fleets need modernisation and the workforce related to the sector needs a boost , solutions must be found to reverse this trend .
It is a country that began life destroyed by the occupation .
Genuine solidarity and cooperation with East Timor should be promoted , as this will contribute towards the country 's economic and social development , and the well-being of the people .
The important thing at the moment is that the military forces stationed in the area should remain only until the situation has stabilised .
The Timorese authorities also demonstrated unity and convergence when two days ago they submitted to the United Nations Security Council requests to strengthen and extend the remit of the United Nations Office in East Timor ( UNOTIL ) from being a police mission under UN supervision to being a peace-keeping mission under the mandate and leadership of the UN , should the need arise .
As Kofi Annan said this week , what is happening in East Timor is especially painful because the country is , and I quote , ‘a child of the international community’ .
The situation can be rectified and nobody should question the viability of the independent , sovereign State of East Timor , which also enjoys independence and sovereignty over the country ’s significant natural resources .
We hope that the efforts of Nobel Peace Prize winners President Xanana Gusmão and government minister Ramos Horta will succeed in overcoming the political crisis , in such a way that the mission can focus on European aid for development in East Timor .     – This oral amendment has obtained cross-group consensus .
