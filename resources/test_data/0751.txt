and at increasing the UN’s ability to intervene in time .
We must naturally help demilitarise and neutralise Hezbollah .
In combination with this , conscious , systematic and long-term faith must also be placed in all the democratic forces in the region as a whole if we are to achieve results .     Thank you , Mrs Lehtomäki , for your detailed answer .
I therefore wonder if there is any possibility of the Council taking the initiative of supporting the women’s organisations that exist .
Parliament recently adopted a report on women in conflict management , at which time we talked about how we could take the next step in this area .
The EU’s relations with China have , of course , become ever more extensive , and not only in terms of trade policy .
Trade also leads in the long term to increased openness , better regulations , less corruption and in time , we believe , to democracy .
We believe that China can play an important role in relations with North Korea , but we cannot accept China making use of its UN veto to prevent global intervention designed to put an end to the genocide in Darfur or aimed at putting pressure on Iran to open up its nuclear power programme to international scrutiny .
We cannot accept China ’s censorship of the Internet , and we view with great concern the reports now coming from right around the world – and most recently from a respected institute in Canada – on trade in organs from , for example , Falun Gong sympathisers .
In the same way , all of us as politicians , entrepreneurs and consumers must demand that Chinese companies permit trade unions and allow their employees to enjoy security and fundamental rights .
We have an election in Sweden .
Those who buy eco-labelled fish also want to know that the stock is not threatened .
I wish to emphasise two aspects of Mrs  Fraga Estévez ’ report .
We must therefore ensure that it can be exploited and puts small-scale fisheries in a fair competitive position .     Mr President , Commissioner , the fight against terrorism has been stepped up .
Unfortunately , there will be no input from Parliament , meaning that citizens will be unable to influence issues concerning the way in which they are kept track of and their behaviour systematically monitored .
I would therefore call on Mr  Frattini to make political innovation his goal in the necessary cross-border dialogue .
Otherwise , we are unlikely ever to make any progress on this matter .
This dialogue should progressively contribute to an increase in quality , including where content is concerned .
I really do support her call to the Member States to stick together and not to conclude bilateral agreements .
The EU and China have had a close trading relationship over the last decade .
We are in favour of the EU establishing common minimum rules for the eco-labelling of fisheries products and in favour of their complying with current international standards .
However , I question the need for the EU to introduce centrally an eco-labelling scheme for fisheries products .
The conflict in Lebanon is a text-book example of the way in which violence begets violence , and we strongly repudiate all forms of violence perpetrated by both sides .
We believe that the issue as a whole is one for the UN and not for the EU.
Such aid must not , however , give rise to a situation in which forest fires lead to financial benefit .
It is mainly the responsibility of the Member States to take measures to reduce the likelihood of , for example , fires breaking out .
The idea of creating a legal framework at EU level for protecting cultural heritage in rural regions is unrealistic .
This would add new costs to the EU’s budget .
Paragraph 24 of the draft report proposes efforts to establish a European Cultural Heritage Year .
I am voting against the report as a whole .     Air pollution causes major public health problems within the European Union .
There are clear reasons in terms of health and the environment for placing a strict limit on these emissions .
The level of ambition is very low .
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have therefore tabled a number of amendments with a view to making the proposals for directives more stringent .
When it comes to the concentration cap for particles , we wish to reduce this to ten micrograms , so putting it at the same level as that recommended for industrialised countries by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
Mr President , I want to use the last half-minute to say a personal thank you .
I also wish to thank Parliament’s services and , above all , the interpreters .
Her work has made it possible for us to quickly achieve a solution and for this solution , in contrast to what happened on the last occasion , to come into effect very quickly indeed . is an important programme , a combined programme for dealing with employment and social issues , promoting equality and combating discrimination .
There was a certain degree of discord in relation to the issues of equality and social integration , but these issues have since been resolved .
I believe that this will be a very good solution and I believe that will play a role in the construction of the social Europe of the future .
There are , however , some elements in the report to which we are strongly opposed .
Clearly , we remain solidly behind our view that aid should not be managed at Community level .
On the whole , however , we believe that the content of the report is sound
