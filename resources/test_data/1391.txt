.
It is therefore possible for new cases of the serious Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to emerge , against which we are still powerless to do anything .
Infection is caused through the feed and is passed on down the breeding line .
The attempt to conclude an agreement with the Clinton/Gore administration in The Hague at the end of 2000 failed .
As far as the content is concerned : 8 % less in Europe and 5 % less in the industrialised world , is far from good enough .
Bush will probably proclaim a national climate policy soon : a modest , partial disengagement from economic growth and energy consumption .
One per cent less per annum is a very good start , and I hope that the Commission can confirm this .
This is why I regret that the European Parliament was not involved in drawing up these objectives , was not consulted and can therefore now only react to the programme which the Commission has in mind for developing the objectives .
The Commission is thinking of education too much in terms of the economy and the labour market .
That is why I am pleased that consideration is once again being given at European level to the objectives of education and training , and that concrete testing criteria are also being formulated , with due respect for subsidiarity .
Mr President , the Group of the Greens and the European Free Alliance is pleased with your speech because , in it , you remind Parliament of its political role and do not dwell on technical details , although I am certain that it will take a lot of time to regulate these .
I arrived in this Parliament having had experience of many parliaments before , sometimes parliaments which were usually better attended than this one , a phenomenon which I regret .
The debate must not stifle pluralism , quite the contrary .
We must clearly establish the legal basis for our actions once and for all , and not let our legal basis be taken away .
We welcome your instruction to prepare the future in consultation with public opinion and with the parliaments in the candidate countries .
We want a Convention that knows the direction in which Parliament wants to guide it .
Communication is about bringing news .
How will we tackle this ?
First of all , I should like to give you a random example of this lack of clarity .
And you need not be frightened .
Thank you , Mr President , the date of 11 September has made it even clearer that a tough battle against terrorism and organised crime is what is needed in order to guarantee the free area of peace and security in the Member States .
Do the existing extradition treaties not offer sufficient scope in this area ?
Firstly , Parliament was consulted about superseded proposals and , secondly , Parliament was allowed to have its say on completed proposals which were already set in stone .
I want to warn against a new international doctrine according to which the western world , having turned its back on these one billion people fighting for their daily existence , withdraws behind barriers made up of weapon shields and expensive technological defence materiel .
This is why Europe , as the world ' s largest donor of development cooperation and as the largest international trading power , must be prepared to throw its weight into the balance , building on the successes achieved at Doha , with a view to reaching authentic binding agreements in Monterrey about aid , education , health care and far-reaching debt relief .
The problems involved in granting aid should not be an excuse for doing too little .
Report Martens ( A5-0017/2002 )
This was the case during the BSE crisis and again with infections caused by foot and mouth disease .
In addition to the composition of the committee , the procedure - notably the system of majority voting - also raises questions .
The credibility of the Human Rights Committee in Geneva , and of human rights policy full stop , is at stake today , and I believe that , in this connection , the European Union bears a very heavy responsibility .
In addition , they must check up on their Ministers when they leave the Council , they must ensure that the European directives and regulations are implemented correctly , and they must also ensure that European programmes are executed correctly , both in terms of content and in terms of finance .
Mr President , the forthcoming enlargement of the Union gives this debate on economic and social cohesion a special dynamic .
The reports of the Commission have also proven that the current system works .
These fatal accidents are often caused by speeding .
It could contribute to greater safety on the roads , less irritation and a greater sense of security on the part of drivers .
Mr President , I should like to make a comment on today ' s agenda .
It strikes me that today ' s debates will finish around 5.30 p.m. , while the votes will not start until 6.30 p.m.
I should also like to emphasise that we were pleased with the constructive manner , namely by cooperation between the groups , in which this report came about .
In this respect , Europe should function as a driving force .
I should , at any rate , like to thank the Commissioner for the opportunity we have had , together with the coordinators , of obtaining current information about the Commission ' s intentions , and of making our concerns known regarding the state of implementation of the Social Agenda .
This also applies to the action plan to improve health and safety which Mrs Hermange introduced a moment ago .
