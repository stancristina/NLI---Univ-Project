Let us continue the work that we have developed thus far with a new Commission , but without ever forgetting all that we have constructed together .
Liberalisation and privatisation in essential sectors such as energy , postal services , telecommunications , essential public services and financial sectors continues apace , to the extent that more and more legislative proposals have appeared in areas that jeopardise fundamental human rights and workers ’ rights , such as the proposal for a directive aimed at creating an internal services market – in other words , more privatisations – and the retrograde and unacceptable proposal for a directive on working hours .
We must therefore set clear priorities within a clear strategy .
I still believe that the aims of the Lisbon Strategy are neither utopian nor impossible to achieve .
They are the last to gain access to permanent work and the first to be laid off .
Everything is linked : poverty , disease , illiteracy , lack of academic success , infant and maternal mortality , urban and environmental decay , social discrimination , lack of professional qualifications , unemployment , promiscuity , domestic violence , trafficking in human beings .
Poor women pay with their health and even with their lives for the monstrous laws that prevent them from gaining access to a safe and hygienic voluntary termination of pregnancy .
Some figures indicate the seriousness of the situation , which , incidentally , varies considerably from country to country .
What is needed is a root-and-branch review of Community policies , with priority given to jobs , social inclusion and the fight against discrimination .
This is clearly inadequate for the serious aims of economic and social cohesion of a European Union .
Such a move would hold back the recent accession of ten new Member States and , indeed , attempts to advance institutional Europe .
These activities will subsequently influence the human resources and finances to be allocated .
The key aim of the exercise has not been achieved .
The 2005 budget will be the first to cover the 25 Member States for a full year and the last before the next Financial Perspectives are presented .
Bosnia Herzegovina is committed to moving forward along the road to economic stabilisation reforms .
I voted in favour .     .
Progress has been made in privatising socially-owned companies , which has taken place on the basis of auctions and tenders , and the restructuring of the industrial and financial sectors has got underway .
Consequently , a fresh deadline must be set as a matter of urgency , one that enables this payment to be made effectively and beneficially , thereby helping to ensure that the balance of payments can be sustained and that the reserves can be bolstered in Serbia and Montenegro .
I naturally welcome this initiative on the part of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety in an area as tricky as spongiform encephalopathies , particularly given that this issue has become public knowledge and as such it has had an enormous impact on the European public in recent years , with people becoming alarmed and making radical changes to their diet .
I feel that the EU’s relations with India are crucial , due to that country ’s geo-strategic importance and its potential role in a multilateral world order .
The world’s largest democracy is the driving force of the sub-continent in which it is situated and , with its human and cultural wealth , it is of major interest to a European Union that seeks to be more open to the world .
I voted in favour of the proposal for a recommendation before us , although I wish to make it clear that upgraded EU-India relations must neither replace nor dilute existing bilateral relations with the Member States ; rather , they should complement them .     .
I am appalled by the climate of coercion and repression prevailing in Belarus , where freedom and democracy are being violated on a daily basis .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the forthcoming elections in Ukraine .
It must first meet high standards and adopt practices that are consistent with respect for the individual , for pluralism and for freedom .
These proposals are all the more unacceptable given that , once again , double standards have been applied in assessing events in third countries ; the logic of ‘double standards ’ means one rule for ‘friends ’ and another for the ‘others’ .
International agreements , which have yet to be drawn up , aimed at regulating noise levels in the world’s oceans , may prove to be a key measure in regulating and limiting the adverse impact of anthropogenic sonars on marine mammals and fish .     .
I refer to the overwhelmingly urgent need to remove the name of the ‘People’s Mujahedeen’ from the list of terrorist organisations .
On the one hand , we are aware of the threat posed by terrorism at the moment , of the horrors of global terrorism , of the challenges that it presents and the fact that , as I have often said , it is the greatest current threat to human rights and to fundamental rights .
We regret the fact that we must vote in favour of this resolution but , given the testimonies that have come to light , we have no alternative , because we must always show consistency when we affirm our values and rights .
The intention , as far as I understand it , is to have this letter distributed to all of the Members of this House , which would be extremely useful , because we are going to debate the Cuba situation tomorrow .
Thank you very much .     , Mr President , I should like to
