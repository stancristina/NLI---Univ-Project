They condemned unemployment and social exclusion and demanded more high-quality employment , better salaries , more social rights and a change of direction in European policies , in order to achieve economic and social cohesion .
We know how difficult the real world is and how difficult it is to get the European Union to agree on a strategic objective .
This is a very important time for Europe to assert its identity : we have managed to control inflation at European level and in the Member States .
Do you remember ?
This is the first time that the European Union has set goals in the field of overall employment by trying to raise the overall employment rate from 61 % to 70 % , and employment amongst women from 51 % to 70 % .
This ensured that all issues of common interest to the European Union and Africa were addressed , and on an equal footing , since both sides had the opportunity to express their concerns and also their common objectives .
This report will then be studied at ministerial level , under the summit ' s monitoring mechanism .
One fundamental area of dispute between Europe and Africa is returning stolen or illegally exported cultural goods .
Mr President , first of all I would like to emphasise that I consider the fact that this summit has been held to be extremely positive .
I am referring in particular to external debt relief for the LDCs .
I say "must " because , contrary to what has just happened , I hope that in future the European Parliament and the NGOs will be part of this process .
Firstly , the question of linking parliamentary bodies , such as the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and the European Parliament .
Firstly , because this was seen as the first major rapprochement between Africa and Europe and not all Africa ' s countries are ACP countries .
We have held lengthy discussions on this summit and on the fact that its effectiveness rested on two pillars : one is the European Union , and the other is the OAU.
Another important point is debt .
This is unprecedented and has never been done by any other group of countries .
This had an important effect in terms of synergy and precedent .
I should tell you that the aim of the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union was to do something for Africa , not just because we had done something for other continents or regions , such as Latin America and Asia , but also because other countries or groups of countries , such as the United States , Japan and even China had begun to do so before us .
We also finalised negotiation of the ACP agreements for the second Lom√© Convention and we finalised the free trade agreement with South Africa .
Of course , we did not resolve all the problems of the African continent overnight , but a step needed to be taken , a step towards including Africa in the European agenda .
We , that is , Parliament , the Commission and the Council , are all working towards this .
In the area of police cooperation , the Commission wishes to remind honourable Members that in 1996 Europol was given a mandate by the Council to combat trafficking in human beings , with the basic aim of ensuring that all networks of traffickers working in Europe would be closed down .
Lastly , concerning the specific situation in Albania , the Commission acknowledges that networks trafficking in human beings originating in the Balkans represent a major concern , due to the increasing number of cases being seen in European countries .
In fact , establishing normal economic and social conditions throughout the Balkans is an essential instrument in combating social exclusion and thus combating trafficking in human beings .
This requires an improvement in Europol ' s cooperation with police forces in the applicant countries .
There had been no meeting of the Association Council between Turkey and the Union for three years and nor had there been any meeting of this kind after the deliberations and the criteria laid down in Helsinki .
This is progress in the right direction , progress which is still of course experiencing delays and interruptions , and only seeing the process through will ensure that this progress meets with complete success .
Now , however , the delegation is also guided by the spirit of a diplomatic rapprochement , which has been seen in relation to its neighbouring country since the earthquake that devastated Turkey and the consequent expression of solidarity by Greece .
( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their contributions to this debate .
I considered the speeches to be demanding ones , calling for the whole process to be scrutinised thoroughly .
The Copenhagen criteria are clear and Turkey must not be discriminated against , either positively or negatively .
We have not even moved to the negotiating stage in which the assessment will be undertaken in a multilateral context , with the participation of all countries .
It is obvious that the Turkish political process is a complex one .
Paragraph 15 of the motion for a resolution is a symptom of this aggressiveness towards Europe .
These are the elements particularly under threat in this report which wants to interfere with and discriminate between the statutes of the political parties .
This is evident in both the injudiciousness of this regrettable paragraph and the fact that 222 , I repeat 222 , amendments were tabled on this report .
This reinforcement also stems from the direct information of this House and its debate in plenary , which have no precedents .
It must enable the next holder of the Council presidency , which
