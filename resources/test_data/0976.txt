is extremely severe in its criticisms .
It must be more effective , and there is a need for uniformly consistent application of the TEN rules in all the Member States .
I am sincerely in favour of enlargement , and I am sincerely in favour of the Member States participating in all the EU programmes as rapidly as possible , but the new Member States are not always as good at controlling EU funds , and the Commission is not always that good at keeping the new Member States up to the mark .
In Slovakia , for example , a motorway project designed to link Katowice to Zilina and not in any way complying with our standards was approved .
Unfortunately , we see far too many examples of projects being approved without proper investigation , without cost/benefit analyses and without account being taken of their environmental consequences .
The TEN programme is a success , but we must not build motorways and bridges if there is no need for them .
We must ensure that the controls are effective and uniform in all the Member States .
If the finances are in order , we make it easier to attract private venture capital .
Only once these things are in place will we be well on the way to giving impetus to a great many of the necessary infrastructure projects , and that will take us closer to our common objective of creating a coherent EU.
This is the fixed link between Denmark and Germany across the Fehmarn Belt .
On the Danish side , a lot has constantly been done to ensure that this major project can be carried out .
Once the project has got under way , and it will hopefully not be very long before that happens , the EU will be stronger and , at the same time , the regions on both sides of the Fehmarn Belt will find that employment has been given an economic boost .     Mr President , to start with , I should like to thank my fellow MEPs here in Parliament , particularly the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups , for their sound and constructive cooperation on the POP proposal , and I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Irish Presidency , which is unfortunately not here this evening , for having worked so energetically to get this proposal implemented .
You will notice that there are a total of 121 amendments to the report , but that is not the basis on which we shall be voting tomorrow .
We shall vote in three blocks , and I hope that Parliament will adopt the first block straight away , thereby making the second block superfluous , and finally vote in favour of the third block .
If we do this , we shall have an agreement with the Council at first reading .
This is an important victory for Parliament on this issue in particular , but also in more general terms , since there is an ever increasing tendency for the Commission to deal with environmental proposals in terms of the internal market .
We have managed to get a ban introduced on the production , use and placing on the market of POPs .
This is a complicated matter .
We have achieved a ban on lindane with immediate effect , so that it has been moved from a list of restricted substances to a list of banned substances .
The exemptions that are otherwise contained in the regulation are quite clearly exceptions that must only be applied in quite extraordinary cases , and a high level of scientific evidence is required before they can be applied .
That too is important , I think , especially since progress is now unfortunately slow in the work on REACH.
We have drawn up provisions stating that all stocks containing POPs must be destroyed and treated as waste .
We have also had some very restrictive monitoring provisions introduced for POP stocks , so that the limit value at which a duty of notification comes into effect has been halved from 100 kg to 50 kg .
We have had a number of general provisions introduced , stating that those producing or storing waste must prevent the waste becoming contaminated with POPs .
We emphasise that it is an exception that can only be applied if it proves that this is the best possible solution for the environment .
It was our wish that it should not be possible to extend it automatically , and I think that Parliament must send a clear signal to the Council of Ministers and industry , since Parliament listened to the Council’s arguments .
Money must be put into research and development so that methods are continually improved .
Time will , of course , tell , however .
We reject the limit values initially put forward by the Council of Ministers .
We believed they were too high .
Instead , we have now agreed that they will be set in 2005 and we shall ensure that a high level of protection is afforded in this area too .
Information must also be drawn up that is directed particularly at vulnerable groups , and we have a requirement that infringements of the rules must be published .
Perhaps it is fortunate that I only have time to say something about the successes , but I hope and believe that Parliament will adopt this proposal with a large majority .
That will not happen as a result of the Commission ’s proposal .
A much more radical plan is needed , however , if we are to experience a noticeable phasing out of harmful chemicals , including the highly toxic POPs .
I therefore wish to submit it in relation to the debate on the Commission ’s proposal on chemicals , known as the REACH programme .
