the programme lacked all mention of the urgent institutional problems or supranational issues .
This period of adjustment could not have been more difficult .
And encompassing all these circles is the joint and strengthened leadership with the United States of America .
What is the point in having ensured free movement within one border yet maintaining fifteen different laws on immigration and political asylum ?
I must say that I and the pensioners who sent me here to seat 270 of the European Parliament were pleased by the comment made by Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou .
I have tried to group together the most important problems , namely those which may sway votes or determine a change of course by an institution .
The problem is that it is not easy from a technical point of view and we are using all the organisations which currently have direct access , including the United Nations , the Red Cross and others .
Consequently , it is also a very serious problem from a political point of view .
On the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam , we are being asked to legislate on the question of public access to documents .
This means better links with the Commission ' s decision-making process , not only at the planning stage but also as regards information and the decisions which each Commissioner - Commissioner-designate today and confirmed Commissioner tomorrow - takes and which must be distributed in an appropriate pre-established way .
Another series of questions dealt with the issue of assigning and modifying portfolios .
The distribution of portfolios raises questions for me too .
I should like to make a distinction between two aspects : one is Parliament ' s loss of trust in an individual Commissioner and the other the relationship with an individual Commissioner accused of criminal offences .
Finally , it is clear that in any case I will have to offer an explanation for any decision I take and I must of course offer it to Parliament .
And let us not forget also the fact that our legal systems , which are so diverse throughout Europe , provide for different procedures between which it is often impossible to draw a meaningful comparison .
We are heading in a wholly new direction , and one which has never been taken anywhere in the world .
If we do not succeed , it will obviously not take long for the grudging vote in favour to become a quite deliberate vote against .
He is organising and co-ordinating the report on this subject , so I have not mentioned it now but I have taken steps in the meantime .
We would also like the area of freedom , security and justice to aim to increase the guarantees for everyone - be they citizens of the Union or people from other countries - and that it does not stop at declaring formal guarantees but also aims to put substantial guarantees into practice , such as those concerning work , social security , personal freedom , equality between men and women and many others which nowadays are being sacrificed on the altar of competition - global competition - so close to the heart of the Commission and its President .
I think that nowadays , the lack of a European strategy on immigration is unacceptable , with regard to dealing with both legal migration and illegal immigration In conclusion , the concept of Europe as not only a single market and currency is very appealing , especially as an area of freedom , security and justice , but it is important for this challenge to become reality through progressively strengthening the Community institutions and developing the collaboration and co-operation between the Member States , rather than resorting to decisions taken by qualified majority , which in itself does not constitute the solution to the problems .
The Union ' s policy must draw on this principle .
We will have to discuss the nature of the Charter , its contents , the relationship between the Charter of Rights and the process of creating a Constitution for the Union .
As for immigration and asylum , the best basis is the document resulting from the Austrian Presidency in autumn 1998 .
Emma Bonino will have the time to explain .
I have been given many occasions to stand before you recently and present both my policy ideas and the key guiding issues of our future relations .
I have already repeated , clearly and honestly , my position on this matter .
And one of my first major tasks is to present , in January , my policy guidelines for the five years of the Commission ' s mandate .
Together we must give a high political profile to the consultation in January .
In view of this , the dialogue that has started between us is very important .
Firstly , you are asking for a Member of the Commission to be suspended from office where a serious charge is brought against him or her .
Let me add a further comment on this .
These codes are not unchangeable .
You also mention foreign and security policy and the Third Pillar .
I have to issue one caveat in relation to internal documents on fraud .
Mr Kinnock has already given you a commitment in this regard .
It is fundamentally important because we have been preparing for a second goal , a goal which in some way really will change our policies : the goal of enlargement .
Ladies and gentlemen , I hope that this vote will allow us to make progress in what - rhetoric aside - truly is a great historic task .
Then there are those Members who are not respectable , that is me and those of us who are simply independent of your bureaucracies and party politics
