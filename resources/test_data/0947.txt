not increase the fishing effort , particularly not in Community waters ; it is possible to cooperate with the development of third States while maintaining our employment and supplying our markets .
Lastly , I would like to thank and congratulate my colleague , Mr Jové Peres , on his excellent work in what were - as our chairman Mr Stevenson has acknowledged - difficult conditions , racing against the clock , with a certain amount of pressure and a great number of misunderstandings .
What I have just said relates to Mr Jové Peres ' report because the Galicians , in the face of the Prestige disaster , are working courageously to mitigate the terrible social , fishing , economic and environmental consequences .
The removal of state aid for the modernisation of boats will be positive , as it will contribute to maintaining jobs on-board boats ' .
We are now rich in oil and the lack of action by our leaders has struck a glancing blow to what we love most , our way of living .
So far , Galician fishermen associate your name - and this must be said - with the non-agreement with Morocco , fleet scrapping and a whole series of measures that might turn out to be good or they might not .
However , Mr Fischler , do you not believe it is now time to explain , in this House , in Parliament , here and now , what the European fishermen , the Galicians , can expect from their Commissioner at this time of disaster ?
Since 1986 , Spain and Portugal have not enjoyed rights equal to those of the other States over the seas that belong to us all , as Community seas .
This principle is not being applied .
I do not want to say too much because a great deal of data already appears in the report .
In conclusion , this seems to be a good agreement : an achievable agreement is always the best one .
I am not asking you to take four Commissioners , as you did when you went to Germany , to wade around in the mud , but I would ask you , Mr President of the Commission , to make a clear gesture of solidarity .
One of them is that the President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament , something which I believe a large majority of this House advocates .
This would ruin the balance between the institutions .
Mr President , with regard to the Penelope document , I believe we must work like Penelope but in shifts .
I also believe , Mr Prodi , that what you have said here , what your communication seeks - efficiency , democracy and clarity - are good objectives .
The Community method , however , also means something which I learned many years ago from a person who I admired , Émile Noel , which is institutional balance .
I therefore believe we should give this some consideration .
Mr President , this has been voted on and I have no problem with that , but I had asked for the floor .
Mr President , I know you are in a hurry because we must follow our timetable , but we are reforming the common fisheries policy and we have been waiting 20 years for this reform .
I am rapporteur for these reports , I am a professional lawyer and I am producing a legal and political report .
I do so , Mr President , as a Galician in particular , because Galicia is currently experiencing a great tragedy .
Mr Cox , President of the European Parliament , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , it is truly an honour to be here , in a place that sets the standard for democracy in the world .
Equally , because it is our responsibility to bequeath to future generations an inhabitable world where our children and our children 's children can enjoy not only democracy but also a healthy environment , where the factories that produce wealth cannot destroy the cleanliness of the environment that future generations will inherit from us .
Being part of the new CNN culture or the Internet culture that enables us to navigate the world cannot separate us from our languages , our food or our cultural characteristics .
If you do not want to consider the matter in terms of social fairness , look at it in terms of a business opportunity .
We now find ourselves with a dilemma which North Americans would define by saying we need to reconcile Wall Street with Main Street .
Something , however , must be done .
Furthermore , some are now saying that under Fujimori 's dictatorship they were better off .
Our hearts bleed when we see a sister nation such as Argentina .
Why should we faithfully comply with the recipe of the International Monetary Fund ?
I was born in a small town 4000 metres above sea level , in the Peruvian Andes , up in the clouds .
Please , I beg you , do not sell us planes , boats or tanks .
( Applause ) With the affection and admiration I have for this House , allow me to tell you quite frankly that the time has come to build a two-lane highway for trade .
If we cannot market our products we will have more unemployed men and women .
( Applause ) Ladies and gentlemen , it has fallen to me to govern a country following ten years of cruel dictatorship , associated with corruption and trafficking in drugs and arms .
We have the responsibility to restore faith and confidence .
The business of knowledge is low-risk , long-term and extremely mobile .
