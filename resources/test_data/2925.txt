in some cases - is to turn to the insurance compensation consortium .
In order to achieve this objective , the Community has taken various initiatives and has recently made proposals .
The Commission hopes that this study of the Irish rail system will take account , naturally , not only of general transport policy , but also of the investments made during recent years with Community funds in the Irish railway .
I would like to thank the President , Pat Cox , and this Parliament , which represents many of the peoples of Europe .
We were all convinced of this , but there were times when it seemed that that truth was not so evident to many people in the world .
This would represent the true exercise of self-determination for our people .
In that way we will build a true peace .
They are not exclusive .
In the same way , a democracy is not a true or complete one unless it is able to begin and sustain a process of increasing the quality of life of everyone .
While we talk today about globalisation , we declare that if we do not globalise solidarity we do not only endanger human rights , but also the right to continue as a human race .
We place our hopes in the Lord , who was laid in a humble manger , and this is our homage to Him .
It is now up to us , as Members of the European Parliament , and all the members of Member State Parliaments and those in countries that are already part of an enlarged Europe , to take the next steps , and we must not underestimate the importance of dialogue with public opinion , as well as fulfilling our duties .
Are these consultations on consumer issues or is it an interinstitutional agreement ?
Those of us who are in favour of Turkey entering the European Union continue to maintain that what is needed in Turkey is a democracy in which civil power takes precedence over military power .
I shall end , Mr President , by saying that now that Denmark has taken this historic step , please , move closer to us , and remove the barriers that still exist in terms of citizenship and the common currency on Denmark 's part .
It means asking the Commission to present a proposal to bring forward the deadline for banning single-hulled vessels , single-hulled oil tankers , for oil transportation , from our waters and then supporting this proposal when it is on the table at the Council of Ministers .
I must stipulate that , following the Erika disaster , it has been extremely frustrating for me to see that we in Europe have been unable to do what the United States did after the Exxon Valdez incident .
This solidarity has also been demonstrated with regard to funds ; reprogramming funds ; direct access to disaster funds ; economic contributions , but also providing resources , people and efforts by the various countries of the Union which , in different ways , have helped to mitigate the disaster we are currently facing .
We hope that the Council and Parliament will respond similarly and with the same political and practical commitment , so that we might avoid having to hold another debate such as this in years to come .
I therefore believe that today we in Parliament should remember the measures she proposed at the time with the support of the European Parliament , which the Council did not support .
I shall end , Mr President , by calling upon the Socialist Group in general , but more particularly my fellow Spanish Members .
The delays in transposing the legislation , or in applying the Erika I and Erika II packages , speak volumes , as do the failures to comply with this legislation , concerning inspections and controls of vessels , for example .
The issue we must now address - as elected Members of Parliament - is the people 's feeling that they have to tackle a disaster with small-scale means and great sacrifice , while the State , to which they pay their taxes , remains either impotent or implacable , I am not sure which .
For more than a month it has produced a day-to-day falsification of facts , failing to adjust itself to circumstances .
Since day one , therefore I have insisted both here and there on the need to provide a clear and simple European response , as we did for the floods in Germany , which takes account of two aspects : prevention and mitigation .
They are the ones who are enduring this , and their cries for help have reached this Parliament , and we cannot deny this fact .
What my people in Galicia cannot understand is why , if all of Europe recognises the lesson that we as a people are giving , the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament continues to deny us the opportunity to clarify what has happened , assess the damage and propose emergency and crisis management programmes at European level that could serve all Europeans .
Prevention first , cure second , it was said here .
The European Commission has learnt its lesson .
Of course .
There has been talk of a temporary committee of inquiry , in accordance with Rule 150 of the European Parliament 's Rules of Procedure , which must be justified on the grounds of non-compliance with European legislation .
The fishermen are being paid , aid is arriving .
Having said this , however , I would also like to say to the honourable Members and to everybody , let there be no mistake , that out there in waters off our coasts and other coasts of the world , there are currently more than 400 Erikas or Prestiges .
