particular to the various private , opposition-controlled television stations ; indeed , the European Parliament delegation was a victim of this .
In this regard , the open method of coordination is undoubtedly the most effective instrument in the current circumstances , although we are aware that measures of this kind are mainly geared towards the citizens as health care consumers .
The prime objective , which is at the moment still a utopian dream , is to provide every European citizen unlimited access to good quality services , regardless of age , sex , nationality and financial status .
These systems must operate on the basis of non-discrimination , benefiting people on low incomes , guaranteeing equal access for all to good quality public services and safeguarding human rights .
Efforts must now , therefore , be channelled into ensuring that the necessary implementing measures are transposed into national law , and , in particular , that the operation is monitored , transparently and effectively , for a certain amount of time .
Mrs Van den Burg’s report addresses the whole question of financial services sensibly , coherently and intelligently and I therefore feel that Parliament should support it .     – Mr President , Mr  Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , we are in favour of reciprocity as a fundamental principle of visa policy and we feel that a common European policy on visas should always be founded on the principle of solidarity .
The situation has deteriorated since the enlargement .
This is an alarming problem , not solely from an economic point of view , but more importantly because of its links with other forms of crime such as drug-trafficking , arms trafficking and the trafficking of human beings .
It is necessary to check quickly and efficiently whether vehicles presented to them for registration have been stolen , misappropriated or lost .
We want to maintain data protection and our citizens ’ privacy .
My report , which tabled ten amendments to the Commission ’s initial proposal , was approved at first reading in April 2004 and the Council common position was adopted in December 2004 .
The conditions are thus in place whereby this legal act can finally be adopted and this useful measure can enter into force .
The ignorance of the past and the negligence of the present have come at a high price – environmental costs , financial costs and costs in terms of human lives .
Being resistant , POPs are passed down from generation to generation and contaminate the food that we eat , the air that we breathe and the water that we drink .
In 1995 , negotiations began to control the use , production and release of POPs . 12 pollutants were identified .
It does not make sense if elected Members of the European Parliament are not able to take part in all initiatives , all conferences and all meetings .     .
I believe that appropriate instruments must be created with a view to substantially extending the current level of cooperation , within the framework of the activities that fall under the sixth framework programme for international cooperation with developing countries .
The European Research Area is the perfect environment in which to enhance and step up cooperation between Mexico and the EU , given the importance of science and technology in economic and social development and given the desire on both sides to broaden and strengthen cooperation in areas of shared interest .     .
I voted in favour of Mr Coelho’s recommendation for a second reading on ‘access to the Schengen Information System by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles’ , as it reflects the need to combat vehicle theft , in an EU in which internal border checks have been all but scrapped .
The precautionary principle must be applied with regard to protecting groundwater against pollution , and this is currently laid down in Directive 80/68/EC , until 2013 .
It must be revised in such a way that more of the available data on groundwater quality in Europe can be gathered .
The regulation that set up the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in 1975 is being revised , to follow up the results of an external audit .
We welcome any attempts , provided they are workable , to improve safety and health at work .
Following an external audit to assess the functioning of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work ( Bilbao ) , the Commission has tabled a number of amendments to the regulation establishing it .
I wholeheartedly support any amendment aimed at making this Agency more transparent and more efficient .     .
I therefore feel that we should support the solution that has been reached .     .
It also fails to address the need to set out measures to support the running of the markets in such a way as to promote economic and social cohesion .
I could write a great deal about this annual report by Parliament , which , in common with previous years , has been used as a means of political pressurising and meddling , in which countries seen as ‘friends ’ are exempt from criticism , and the ‘others’ , those countries deemed targets by the USA and EU , are criticised .
I am concerned at the fact that it is not clear to many European politicians – albeit not only European politicians – that terrorism is the greatest threat to our societies and that it is a threat to our citizens ( I shall not point out that they are innocent citizens , because that would suggest that there could be some sort of justification even if they were not innocent ) , to our societies , to the model that those societies represent and to democracy itself .
