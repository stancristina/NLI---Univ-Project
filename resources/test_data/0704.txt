towards a complete package of measures in favour of food safety .
However , it would be unfortunate if , for example , Amendments 39 and 40 were adopted , for this would mean that the opportunities for Member States to intervene quickly to combat newly discovered dangers would disappear .
I support the rapporteur ' s proposals but shall vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats .
This date must be based upon negotiations with the country concerned , in which account is taken of the major difficulties the candidate country has in making the required adjustments .
Under no circumstances can we accept a situation in which new Member States are treated as second class members . 4 .
In adopting our position , we have proceeded only on the basis of the main part of the report .
The EU' s Member States have an historic task which consists in welcoming the countries of Eastern and Central Europe into European cooperation .
Europe ' s leaders must therefore begin to show the political will to accept the challenge posed by enlargement .
One of the most important reforms which must be implemented is a thorough reorganisation of the common agricultural policy .
The current system of subsidies , grants and quotas must be replaced by free trade and adaptation to the market .
If Europe is to become whole , the objective must be for all Member States to participate in all areas of cooperation .
We did this first with the proposal concerning discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin , and now we are moving on to the action plan and discrimination in the workplace .
We then looked at unemployment , which at that period was generally very low in Sweden , and compared it with unemployment specifically among the disabled .
They are discriminated against at the present time .
What opportunity do they have to work in the internal market , to study in different countries and to pursue their personal development ?
The disabled are also discriminated against when it comes to gaining access to restaurants and cultural institutions .
Because organisations are important in this process , I hope that the amendment which I tabled , to the effect that more than one organisation should have a share of the grants , and which was adopted by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs will also be that amendment which is finally adopted .
Recital R of the report talks about the ...
Sweden does not believe that activity within CFSP can be described as a defence policy because it does not involve any common defence obligation corresponding to NATO' s paragraph 5 .
As is well-known , Sweden is not a member of NATO .
I should like to thank Commissioner Liikanen for that answer , even though I am not entirely happy with it for obvious reasons .
The second thing I want to ask about is whether you believe that the matter has been handled in an acceptable way .
It was an important activity , and I value the work she did .
I nonetheless believe that we have to find a partner who operates internationally .
At the same time , it is important to do so at a more political level and to concentrate on the Stop programme which covers the same area .
That cannot reasonably be the EU' s policy .
Support for ECPAT is incredibly important .
The World Tourism Organisation acts globally , not only in industrial countries but also in the developing countries where these problems exist today .
Most people who hunt use the meat themselves .
It is consumed within their own families or by friends , acquaintances or relatives .
If these rules were to be applied to meat consumed by people within their own households , this would constitute a bureaucratic disaster for elk hunting .
By adopting a number of reports , we in Parliament have embarked upon the long road towards making food in Europe safe .
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , I should like to start by thanking our fellow MEP , Mrs Dybkjær for an excellent report and welcoming her back to Parliament after her recent weeks ' campaigning .
Sometimes , some people - even colleagues in this Assembly - seem to believe that they do have equal opportunities , but they do not .
More women are needed in decision-making positions , because it is quite simply unacceptable that so much human ability is being lost .
Some problem areas : women often have two jobs , unemployment is higher among women , childcare has deteriorated , there are too few women in decision-making positions , violence against women is on the increase in many candidate countries and several candidate countries are at the centre of the increasing trade in women .
There must be no transitional periods .
The EU should pursue a campaign to combat violence against women throughout Eastern and Central Europe .
On the basis of my own experience , if I may speak personally , I am convinced that Paragraph 15 of the resolution - stating the importance of men ' s involvement in , and access to , good childcare - is the most important paragraph by far if equality and equal conditions are to be achieved for men and women .
Mr President , welcome back to Parliament , Mrs Péry .
I would just like to raise a couple of issues which I believe should , as a matter of urgency , be a part too of the Council ' s thinking and of the work it is doing .
