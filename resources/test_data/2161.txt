security and affordable social services , in particular cr√®ches , nurseries and support for elderly people . rapporteur . - ( PT ) Madam President , I firstly want to thank my fellow Members and also the Commissioner for their words today and for their contributions which have enabled this debate to assume even greater consequence .
We must also fight stereotyping , as highlighted here today , and we must ensure that the organisation of working hours , working time and jobs better responds to women 's rights , and also to the right to maternity and paternity which are recognised as fundamental social values of the European Union . rapporteur . - ( PT ) Mr President , this oral amendment is supported by female Members from five political groups and also by one male Member .
I was there and I put these questions to him and obtained some answers from the Minister .
This recognition is limited to transit through the territory of these three Member States for a period of up to five days .
This report contains some contradictions and positions that we do not endorse .
Private sector investment in research is lower than the socially optimum level .
Yet it is worth recalling the Portuguese case , and others , which demonstrate that universal public service can be provided perfectly well with resources from the reserved area , a transparent and neutral method that does not involve state subsidies .
The reason for the serious threats of military aggression , provocations and so much haste regarding Iran 's nuclear programme , is that the country has the world 's best reserves of hydrocarbons , and the United States and the EU are trying to create the conditions , even by manipulating public opinion , to control its energy resources and the whole Middle East , as we are seeing in Iraq .
Therefore , in the light of the above , but also on account of what I have stood for in the past , I agree with the essence of the adopted resolution , and emphasise the European Parliament 's insistence that the Council and the Commission comply with the European Court of Justice 's ruling by removing the Iranian resistance , the PMOI , from the list of terrorist organisations .
Most of the jobs created are insecure , and part-time work involves women in particular , who continue to be discriminated against in access to jobs , training and career progression , and in terms of wages .
I voted in favour of this report and support the respective resolution .
That is why our group tabled some motions for resolutions which were , unfortunately , rejected , specifically motions expressing our opposition to the Treaty of Lisbon , underlining some of its more worrying aspects , such as the trend towards the militarisation of the European Union in close liaison with NATO , imposing an increase in military spending and providing for the conducting of military operations in order to protect the Union 's values and serve its interests .
That is why we abstained .
Two years away from the expiry of the Lisbon Agenda , we must acknowledge that the objectives outlined - ambitious objectives - are far from having been achieved ( and our comparative speeding up in the face of the slow-down in the American economy is not a matter for celebration ) .
The existence of public policies in fundamental social areas , in particular universally accessible public services , especially in the areas of health and education , has made a decisive contribution .
That is why we need to replace the Lisbon Strategy with a European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development that opens new horizons for Europe , of decent jobs with rights , in particular for women and young people , reduced working hours with no reduction in pay , better salaries , an end to discrimination , particularly wage discrimination against women , greater economic and social cohesion , adequate protection , and public and universal social security , guaranteeing a better quality of life and greater social justice .
The EFF must therefore be financially reinforced .
As a result , these projects must not be subject to a policy which has , as its priority and dogma , the competition , deregulation or so-called adaptability and entrepreneurship which are priorities of the Lisbon Strategy .
We must be alert to any manoeuvres which , in light of these events , may aim to justify further outside interference and which may threaten the independence and sovereignty of East Timor .
Finally , this resolution ignores the fact that the solution is political and lies solely in the hands of the people of East Timor .
We hope that President Ramos-Horta will fully recover and we call for a thorough investigation into what happened and into the necessary response to this .
However , the main responsibility obviously lies with the East Timorese people who must try to achieve a cross-party compromise for lasting peace and respect for the rule of law and judicial decisions , without hesitation , without prevarication and without complacency .
All Europeans should not take their liberty for granted , and young Europeans should follow the DEMYC example in showing solidarity with their neighbours by standing up for democracy and human rights .
( Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment ) - Before paragraph 1 draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - ( PT ) I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , and informing him that the Environment Committee believes that various measures must be combined to ensure a sustainable transport system for future generations .
However , this fisheries agreement is not one that seeks to purchase fish
