congratulate you on everything you do for agriculture , I have to say that , normally speaking , a Commissioner should be here for industrial policy and social policy who can reply to the questions .     .
At the end of my speech I would like to ask a few questions which we would like the Commission to answer .
We have already let it be known that we believe that consultations have been going on long enough , including in the area of social dialogue .
The partners have had more than enough time to exercise influence on this .
The Commission should take the initiative on this point , and it should do so quicker than is currently the case .
Taking all this into consideration , we would like to ask the following two questions : How does the Commission intend to use its right of initiative ( in other words its right to take active steps ) to implement the social policy agenda , both with regard to the old points and with regard to the points we have put forward on behalf of the European Parliament ?
If we have to choose between the priorities , then for me , enlargement is the top priority .
It is extremely important for social policy to develop in the enlargement countries .
The whole policy surrounding employment must be stimulated and supported .
This social group still has a difficult time accessing the labour market .
Finally , a word of warning .
Not because there are no capable women , but because there are always other people who are more important and who have to take priority .
If we leave it to a change of mentality , then we could still be having this discussion when our great-granddaughters are MEPs .
The quotas are often criticised for not being justified , for having to leave everything to the spontaneous evolution of democracy .
This development contributes to greater equality between people .
In this report , the Commission is being asked to distribute information on the concept of parity democracy .
Interestingly , the best results have in the past been achieved in countries in which political parties have taken the initiative themselves by putting more women on their candidate lists and where the dogma of ( legally enforced ) parity democracy has virtually no support .     .
We have only one aim : to accept a definitive regulation in the near future with consensus between the various standpoints .     .
We take the view that the President of the Commission must maintain a certain political neutrality , that he must be above party-political wrangling .
First of all , in the framework of the country strategy paper on Thailand dating back to May 2002 , the European Union should turn its attention to legal aid , so that the seriously overtaxed legal system is relieved and the rights of the suspects are better respected .
It is , in the first place , all very well for people to travel to The Hague especially to demonstrate in favour of a totalitarian dictator , but then , on top of that , they refuse to write the placards in a language that is intelligible to Dutch people .
I therefore hope that the Commission will give this due consideration .
Finally , as you indeed already indicated , we will need to give a great deal of attention to the new Member States .
This was also a request that was made by the European Disability Forum .
This Commission proposal is now before us and I urge my fellow MEPs to give it their backing .
That is what this is really about .
However , and this is where , in my view , the issue of ethics comes in , this research should not be at the expense of other human life .
Human life , at whatever stage of development , should never be used in a merely instrumental manner .
Another example from my Amendment 55 : no funds for ethically objectionable research if less objectionable alternatives are available .
Unfortunately , this 3 % is currently not being achieved ; it is only 1.9 % .
However , an investment climate requires clear and transparent legislation , backed by sufficient and well-trained researchers .
In addition , I regard the proposed harmonisation of excise duty on fuel as an undesirable measure in view of the Member States’ sovereignty in the area of taxation .
We want to speed up the process of adopting directives in the area of the European works council and on working times , which have to do with social dumping .
The Commission failed to take any action in the light of that information .
He knew nothing of the Falklands war , he was not sufficiently informed and despite this , he assumed the political responsibility for it .
I find this incredible and , I would follow this up by saying that the Commission is also politically responsible for Eurostat .
Legislative programmes were said to be reduced by 35 000 pages .
What is irritating is that those achievements are sometimes at risk of being cancelled out by incidents such as Eurostat .
There is no need for an electoral handbrake ; this is not about winning the battle of Italy , but the battle of winning the hearts and minds of the European public .
Those countries will first need to prove that they belong in the European Union .
That amendment has been adopted and we now need to vote on it first .     – Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , thank you for the dynamism you have injected into your work .
It is worth noting that America , which forced this package through in the context of IMO , does not do this itself .
