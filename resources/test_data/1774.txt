and disarming militias , the maintenance of the political process and use of the instruments of European security and defence policy , with any additional resources used coherently to achieve a single goal , namely a democratic , peaceful and prosperous Congo , in control of its resources for the people’s benefit .
It is not only Azarias Ruberwa and Jean-Pierre Bemba who retain private armies .
These women deserve the EU’s support , and I trust that the Commission ’s delegation and the committee chaired by General Morillon , whose outstanding work thus far I wish to commend , can support these people who are bringing peace and dialogue .     – It is extremely important that this report by Mrs Gröner be adopted , and I wish to commend her on her work .
Preventative action must be taken in the form of awareness-raising campaigns , for example the European Year against violence against women .
Although this report considers ‘multilingualism ’ a ‘key feature ’ of the EU , its overarching perspective is one of budgetary restriction , argued on administrative grounds , which may undermine this right enshrined in the Treaties .
These activities are defined as being additional to , and in support of , the work done by coastal countries in the fight against , and prevention of , marine pollution .
The measures proposed by the report strike me as the most appropriate way of improving the functioning of the European Maritime Safety Agency .
It is necessary to inform , and raise awareness among , the citizens regarding the problem of violence , for example by promoting the European Year against violence against women in 2007 .
Zero tolerance of violence entails greater political involvement , constant endeavour and consistent action in all Member States .     .
Secondly , the binding of the value to CO2 does not take account of the car 's cylinder capacity and value .
We are talking about peace that is rooted in freedom , democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law .
Hence the need for timely reforms ; either the European social model will survive if we take action , or will die if we do nothing .
As elements that inform all political action , these values are needed now more than ever .
The Finnish crises of the early 1990s were overcome by investing in people , in a similar fashion to the Danes during the time of Bishop Grundtvig .
The underlying thrust of the report is that social security systems hamper economic development and are unsustainable given the demographic challenges posed by globalisation and world competition .
This is what we had in mind with the proposals we put forward , which we hope will be adopted .     – It is undeniable that the European social model was a crucial factor in the rebuilding of democratic Europe during the post-war period and that many millions of people have benefited from its success .
I voted in favour of this report on the conclusion of the Partnership Agreement between the Union of the Comoros and the European Community .
Accordingly , it has become essential to adapt the current agreements to the philosophy adopted and enshrined in the conclusions of the 2004 Fisheries Council .
We also regret the rejection of our proposal for a macroeconomic framework to support sustainable development , with stronger internal demand that is environmentally friendly and compatible with full employment , in such a way as to deliver economic and social cohesion .
We must not flinch , therefore , when it comes to taking decisions aimed at improving our citizens ’ lives .
We must achieve our targets on employment , education and training .
I shall be voting in favour of this proposal .     .
We are opposed to this because we feel that it should fall to the Member States , as part of sovereignty over their exclusive economic area .
I welcome the gradual adaptation of new technologies on board fishing vessels and the undertaking to grant Community aid for the development of these technologies and the specific training required .
Reconstruction must be supported , it must be made difficult to restart the war and time must be allowed for dialogue among the Lebanese , because this is the only way in which the problems of defending the country will be resolved .
We must first thank the Finnish Presidency , the Commissioner and the Commission for succeeding in this regard , or for at least enabling this to happen .
We must ensure there is no discord in the EU and must act quickly if the situation changes .
This is our responsibility .     – Mr President , 2005 saw the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona process , a relatively lengthy process aimed at establishing sound ties with the other side of the Mediterranean .
Is there nothing we could have done earlier ?
The EU’s role in this process is a vital one and demonstrates once again that the political strength of the EU is crucial to the world’s stability and balance .     – Nobody can turn a blind eye to Israel’s latest war against Lebanon , which was bombed for 34 days , with the support of the USA and the passivity of the Council of the European Union , causing the acknowledged deaths of 1 084 civilians in Lebanon and 41 in Israel , and with thousands more injured .
The USA actively pursues a policy of interference and shows scant regard for sovereignty and international law , and its ultimate goal is the geostrategic control of the region and control over the region 's ample energy resources .
All States in the region must be guaranteed their sovereignty and security , and the region must be demilitarised and rendered free of nuclear weapons .     – There is no such thing as a perfect report
