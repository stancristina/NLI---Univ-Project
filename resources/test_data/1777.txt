of economic freedoms , which measure the level of fundamental human rights , which measure , in short , the quality of life .
Is the idea , put forward in recent days by Mr Giuliano Amato , the former Italian Prime Minister , of far-reaching innovation leaving the European Commission power over major strategic investments and decentralising regional development actions really so unrealistic and impossible ?
Mr Mastorakis has already quoted some Greek to you and I am going to quote some Latin : errare humanum est , perseverare autem diabolicum .
Linked to this is the point that it would be beneficial if the Commission were to provide clearer , more comprehensive information of an essentially social and economic rather than accounting nature on the evaluation of projects , highlighting whether the aim of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions has been achieved ; the European Parliament needs to receive this information in due time , not - as has happened this time with regard to the Cohesion Fund - two years late , for that clearly makes it impossible to correct shortcomings and reprogramme operations in useful time .
In addition to the various education and information , humanitarian , social and health initiatives and initiatives supporting non-governmental organisations , in particular , our committee feels that it must single out one in particular : the appeal to the Member States to ensure that female genital mutilation is prosecuted through the rigorous application of existing provisions laying down the right to health and personal integrity as a fundamental right , and the rigorous application of the provisions of the penal code which ban any deliberate action violating this right .
I would , however , like to make one point to Mrs Avil√©s Perea , for whom I have great admiration .
I am convinced that , if such a brutal form of mutilation as this had been forced upon our male fellow Members , the issue would have been resolved long ago .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this own-initiative report and on the thorough , comprehensive document before us .
Here is an example from my country : it was only in the mid-1980' s , after 15 years of campaigning , that a pay rise was at last obtained in the textile workers ' pay agreement for the category of workers 'packing supervisor ' , which exists in the textiles sector .
I do not want to go into the legal and philosophical concept of what constitutes being manifestly unfounded , but on matters which are now more sensitive than ever such as that addressed by the Watson report , we must show our determination to build without putting up obstacles , and to help without negative or even destructive effects on our social systems .
Another reason for rejecting this type of formulation also derives from the lack of uniformity in the assessments made by Member States in their procedures for granting refugee status .
As I said at the beginning , here we must not confuse humanitarianism with strictness : the two things can go together .
Mr President , do you know the difference between sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide ?
This directive too , Mr President , deals with the emission of harmful chemical substances into the air we breathe .
I want to confirm that I voted for it , like many of us , not only because this will enable us in future centuries to have a less polluted atmosphere that is less damaging to our health , but also because I believe that , if everybody knows that we in Europe breathe healthier , cleaner , less polluted air , we shall have more tourists in Europe who , as well as coming to see the beauty of history and nature that we have throughout Europe - in Scotland , for instance , where you come from , or in Genoa and Liguria , where I come from - if there is cleaner air as well , will come in even greater numbers !
Mr President , the institution of political asylum is part of the most noble legal tradition of our peoples , but the Watson report , in my opinion , makes a serious mistake in extending its scope , in expanding it to embrace a number of cases that lie outside the historical nature of this important and noble institution of public law .
What would you have done ?
Because I want to uphold in this Chamber the view that it is fair , precisely for this reason , that women in many European Union states draw their pensions five years before men do .
This is because there are too many young people and they get lower wages ; we , however , are slow to understand progress and earn more . "
Madam President , it is a matter of great surprise and regret to me that the Chairman of a major political group such as the Group of the Party of European Socialists should get caught up in the false , subversive controversy which originated in the Italian political debate and which it is absurd to think could be continued in this House .
Madam President , I do not wish to waste Parliament ' s precious time on an issue which has already been addressed by Mr Santini and which has already been quite satisfactorily resolved in Italy .
That , Madam President , is why we will feel more reassured if you too , as President of this Parliament , particularly following Mr Santini' s words , were to confirm a clear message of open dialogue , such as Parliament has already had occasion to send to the Muslim Arab communities and countries with which we intend to work to combat terrorism , together , openly and resolutely
