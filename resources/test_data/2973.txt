We do not believe in the law of the jungle .
This implies many new decisions , of which one of the most urgent is certainly the establishment of a directive on the mutual insurance system .

I would have preferred , personally , that the Community support the setting up of a new tribunal in Hamburg , or at least show its confidence in the International Court of Justice .
You cannot state , as does the report , that the European Union 's purpose is to create primary international law to be imposed on all the States and their national law .
To ratify this agreement now under these tragic circumstances would be to give our approval to the coup and all the acts of violence that it has given rise to , which are still multiplying throughout the Cambodian territory .
Well , if our values are real , it is through them that we will put in place the co-operation that we want .
What is unfortunately certain is the phenomenal corruption that is running through the country like gangrene , in accordance with the process current in all socialist regimes where , after the eradication of men and the natural structures of the market economy , they are left swarming with mafia , like bad undergrowth in a field long ago laid to waste .
While the wider principles which governed the drafting of the Lom√© Convention in 1975 , its contractual character , partnership , security , forward planning must be maintained , it is also desirable that more appropriate and substantial means be made available by the European Union in order to satisfy the real needs that are appearing in the negotiations .
On this basis , we must set out to reorganize ACP-European Union cooperation within the framework of a responsible partnership .
Thank you !
Here is the way out of poverty .
Mr President , this discussion regarding what a new partnership between the European Union and the ACP countries must be the opportunity for the European Parliament to stand firmly by a certain number of obvious facts .
Nevertheless , I do not believe the problem can be solely examined in the light of romanticism and moral indignation .
The Europe of Nations Group participated in the adoption of the group of reports on the agenda for this period of additional session which deal with relationships between the European Union and the countries of Asia , notably with the Member States of ASEAN , with whom we have longstanding and deep relationships .
The surprise is even greater when one notices that the whole of this hotchpotch document is co-signed by the Commission , when it only has the authority to negotiate certain limited parts of it .
The debate , however , must not end there .
This would be an open door for a two-tier system of social security and for a long term swing towards capitalization , a system which is more unjust .
It confirms that Community law is not applicable in cases where it oversteps the delegation of power agreed by the German people .
Consequently , national constitutions and laws passed by referendum must be clearly recognized as the superior standards of the Union .
The 5th Convention will need to provide a global agreement applicable to all of the ACP countries , suited to unique institutions in order to promote interparliamentary dialogue and including tools adapted to the different levels of development of our partners .
Everything is being done , within this very Parliament , to destroy the unity of European agriculture and agricultural policy .
This issue concerns me too .
She too has signed for 500 Florins .
I simply wish to make the point that there is perhaps a way of adding to the justified indignation a necessary response which , in my opinion can only come from the President of the European Parliament , for it is he who defends the Institution .
This decision is extremely clear and it happens to be the case that in our system we may be condemned by virtue of a decision of a court and that , naturally , the practical consequences of this may be slightly painful .
First , if we persist in holding these part-sessions in Brussels in November and December , will it not be possible for any person to contest the votes taken there before the Court if it is in their interest to do so ?
With regard to the second matter - that of 1996 -, Mr Campos at that time accused Mr Da Silva of fraudulent misuse of community subsidies , of favours which had been granted him by a friendly company , of conflicts of interest , and so on .
There would be ECU 11 , 700 billion , and then ECU 700 million would be refinanced as things went along .
So it is highly desirable to conclude with the Council 's balanced version , because going through the conciliation stage would imperil this delicate construction and above all could lead to the final collapse of the entire text .
A price which appears to be low actually represents a higher final cost , because of problems with quality , safety and adaptability .
