That is also why , when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact , an issue already raised with me today by Mr Rasmussen , Mr Rossati , Mrs De Vits and many others , I said and can repeat this : it does not seem sensible to me to consider revising the Treaty that created the Stability and Growth Pact , we really are not going to do that .
The help we can give to the new Member States is good for Europe , and what is good for Poland , the Czech Republic , Hungary , the Baltic states , for Slovakia or Slovenia is good for Europe as a whole .
Your questions relate to a Commission initiative .
I am convinced that this system should now be applied with firmness and determination , because our credibility is at stake here .
But I would ask for the support of all those who wish to carry the European project forward , and I shall take the liberty at this point of taking issue with those Members who said that as my views fall into one particular part of the political spectrum and theirs into another , they intend to vote against me .
I have strong non-negotiable convictions , particularly when it comes to freedom and the rule of law .
But as President of the Commission , I shall certainly seek compromises , because I am not here just as a representative of one political family , and I am convinced that the President of the Commission should work with the PPE family , with the Liberals and Democrats , with the Socialists and with other Members in various groups who essentially agree on making progress with the European project .
There is no modern aviation system that holds the secret to doing that .
What has it become today ?
I would like to say to all my compatriots that I certainly take great pride in being Portuguese .     – I should like , at this point , to bring to the attention of the Members of this House and to your attention , Mr President , the reality of relocations by multinationals .
Sadly , little has been learnt and this year forest fires have tragically hit my country again , with more than 100 000 hectares of forest burnt .
In my country , Portugal , this is partly because last year , around 11 % of Portuguese forest territory was destroyed .
We are aware that there are environmental reasons , related to climate change and to global warming .
Lastly , Mr President , I should like to mention something to which we alluded last year and to which we shall probably always allude whenever such circumstances arise : the dedication of the fire-fighters , the dedication of the people who , through their acts of courage , generosity and even heroism , proved what we already know – that in times of tragedy that demonstrate the worst in human nature , there are also many people who demonstrate the best in human nature .     Mr President , Commissioner , I am grateful for your speech and for the solidarity that you have shown .
The Mediterranean forest is part of the common heritage of the people of Europe and must therefore be preserved .
I voted in favour , although I remain opposed to not holding plenary sessions on Fridays of Strasbourg weeks .
The social fabric of our lives is made up of employers , workers and representatives of specific activities such as agriculture , craftsmen , SMEs and industries , the liberal professions , representatives of consumers , of the scientific and teaching community , of the social economy and of families .
What I would like to know in greater detail , however , is its position as regards issues that concern it directly .
Is it because of the Stability Pact ?
In practice , the aim of the proposals on the table is to implement a new kind of ‘British cheque ’ for other financial contributors , given that it is not possible to cancel a ‘British cheque’ .
It is a regime that is accustomed to living with sanctions , adept at exploiting the rivalries within the international community and capable of mobilising countries to which it sells oil or from which it purchases arms , such as China and Pakistan , under the protection of the Security Council .
There must also be a clear mandate from the Security Council to protect the civil population at risk .
Almost everything has already been said on the subject of terrorism , following 11 September , 11 March and now the Beslan tragedy .
The firmness that we demand , as has been mentioned , must never , however , be at the expense of what makes us strong and what we strive for , which is democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
I applaud the work done in the Commission , in particular by Mr Vitorino , and this work should be carried on even more thoroughly .
I feel that this process must make use of internal coherence comprising all of the institutions ’ assets and that all efforts must be channelled not only into the negotiations themselves , but , most importantly , into placing greater value on the aims of the Lisbon Strategy , and on an energetic economic and social cohesion policy that will continue to enable convergence in levels of well-being among the peoples of the various Member States .     .
We therefore welcome the fact that an agreement has been reached to increase the size of this committee to 50 members , provided that this representation is guaranteed .     .
On the contrary , this temporary committee must at least adopt the Commission ’s proposal on the financial
