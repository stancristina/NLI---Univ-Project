On the one hand , this is a result of the Community legal system itself – and of the current division of powers – but , on the other , today offers better safeguards for the experience acquired by each Member State in performing these tasks ( whether at air , sea or land borders or at all three ) .
Giving families more subsidies , vouchers or tax benefits is pointless unless the necessary infrastructures are in place .
These include financial assistance for childcare and education , vouchers for the recruitment of home helps for families with disabled children and vouchers to help low-income families with three children or more .     .
I would also highlight the aptness of the reference to the need to provide specific allowances for situations including large families , for children with disabilities or for multiple births , and also the idea that the Member States must develop forms of cooperation and networks for exchanging good practice .
As regards migrant women , the report draws attention to incorporating the equality dimension into policies , programmes and actions designed to combat racism , discrimination and social exclusion .
The rapporteur has produced a report on minority women’s groups , specifically women with disabilities , migrant women and Roma women .
These are situations that occur across the board and affect men too .     .
These are the reasons that have led me to vote against the report .     .
Anyone arguing the other side of the case finds themselves increasingly isolated , and sharing a stand with President Bush and his ‘Mexico City policy’ .     .
I voted against .     .
For this reason I support the rapporteur’s idea to increase the EP’s involvement in the spheres of co-regulation and self-regulation .
When it is finished and has been translated , it will be sent to Parliament and the Council .
That is not the position of the Commission .
It will not be easy , but I am determined to follow that path .     .
In any event , I wish to ask you expressly whether the Commission has already received the proposal from the Spanish State to ensure that the Agency’s headquarters are established in Vigo and when you think it will be definitively established there .     Mr President , I am sure this is an oversight , Commissioner , but you did not refer to Article 15 of this Regulation , which is very specific as regards revoking the system that currently preserves Azorean waters .
You have just said , however , that these appellations can now be used by third countries provided that they fulfil a raft of criteria , a set of requirements that you have just listed for us .
I shall focus , however , on the consequences of this proposal for Portugal .
With regard to cotton , a sector which has expanded substantially in recent years , the Commission proposal penalises production by around 30 % which , when taken together with the inadequacy of production-related aid , makes this crop rather unattractive and provides few opportunities to reconvert it .
The vast majority of Mediterranean production is located in the cohesion countries and in the least-favoured regions , and is extremely labour-intensive .
Equally serious is the Commission ’s proposal for the tobacco sector , which loses part of its current aid in conditions that jeopardise the continuity of production and industry , resulting in unemployment and an increase in exports from outside the Union .
Unless these measures are adopted , it will be impossible to implement a policy to boost the economy and to sustain demand in the short- and medium-term .
We must indeed maintain this openness of spirit , this daring and this capacity for adventure .
In other words , the agenda is enormous and I therefore support and understand the words of the President of the Portuguese Republic , whose pro-European feelings are well known , calling a week ago for more time to allow the negotiations on the European Constitution to take place .
This proposal is extremely important in two fundamental areas : it both enhances safety in the management and the use of the sea and also contributes to reducing pollution .
For this reason and because I am quite happy with the thrust of the proposal , I voted in favour     .
Another positive aspect of signing up to COTIF is the fact that the European Community does not have to contribute to the budget of this organisation , despite the fact that it does not have a say in its decisions .
The aims of this Commission proposal could not be clearer : to remove the cross-border tax obstacles that not only hamper company cross-border mobility within the European Union , particularly that of multinationals , but also to allow a policy of company restructuring and relocation that favours tax relief or , viewed from another angle , that provides the greatest tax benefits .
Directive 90/434/EEC ( known as the ‘Merger Directive’ ) already provides for a solution regarding a common system of taxation applicable to mergers , divisions , transfers of assets and exchanges of shares in cases where these involve different Member States , but the Directive needs improvement , and its scope needs to be enlarged .
These specific measures seek to solve the most urgent practical tax problems faced by companies operating internationally , until a common tax base is achieved .
I am sorry to say that they were all rejected .     .
As regards the amendments tabled by the Communist left , I voted against .     .
This report is of special importance to the area of youth .
It is a further draft resolution in the field of youth , education and training ,
