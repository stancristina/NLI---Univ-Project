Mainly , however , I am against this directive because it brings to the fore the foreign nature of the system in which the UK is embroiled .
The central fact is that it was first presented to this assembly on 17 September 1998 .
That was before the last European elections .
In other words , we have a new Parliament installed by a new electorate .
But despite that , the directive goes on .
This shows the change of Parliament was cosmetic - a charade .
All the electorate has been allowed to do is shuffle the deck chairs on the deck of the Titanic .
Meanwhile , the project continues to sink into the bureaucratic bog .
I hope I am here to see it finally disappear but , in the meantime , I have voted against this measure .
- I congratulate my Labour colleague , Simon Murphy , on his recommendation to approve the agreement reached with the Council on tackling late payments in commercial transactions .
This demonstrates yet again Labour 's commitment to create an environment for entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish across Europe .
Late payment often suffocates many credible businesses , particularly small and medium-sized companies .
Consequently , many are tragically forced into receivership , through no fault of their own .
This measure , however , will help allow small businesses to fight back .
Creditors will be entitled to charge a statutory interest rate of 7 % on their debts , encouraging debtors to pay early .
Furthermore , if debts are not repaid , creditors will also be able to claim compensation form debtors for recovery costs .
By introducing greater certainty in business transactions across Europe , small companies will gain confidence in trading , not just across Britain , but right across the European Single Market .
Membership of the Single Market the largest trading bloc in the world , is crucial for jobs in the North West .
Nearly 40 % of small and medium sized enterprises in the region have trading links with other EU Member States .
As a part of the EU Single Market , they have access to over 370m potential customers - over 6 times more than in Britain alone .
In a few years ' time , following the enlargement of the European Union , they will have access to a potential 500m customers - as big as the American and Japanese markets put together .
The Labour Government is determined to make the Single Market work for British business .
By giving UK businesses the confidence to reach into these markets , this measure will contribute to this aim and will increase trade , growth and employment across both the North West and all of Britain .
Maaten Report ( A5-0160/2000 )
- In general the Liberals support the motion , but we would have preferred a shorter and sharper text that focused exclusively on the politics of the European Council , and had clearer messages for the heads of government .
The ELDR Group has requested split votes on various items within the Joint Motion for a Resolution , as follows : in paragraph 7 we seek to delete the second half of the sentence in order to reinforce the imperative of enlargement ; in paragraph 9 we seek to remove the last clause because we know that the Lebanese government is indeed trying to reassert control over all its territory , but is prevented from doing so by forces beyond its control ; in paragraph 14 we seek to delete the reference to Nato on the grounds that all EU member states are directly concerned with this issue ; in paragraph 19 we seek to delete the reference to the Observatory of Industrial Change ; and in paragraph 24 we seek to focus the text on the political message needed for Feira .
- This resolution contains many points that I fully support on the IGC , on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and other aspects of Community policy .
However , I find myself unable to support it because of the inclusion of paragraph 8 on Austria .
I was proud of the EU when it imposed sanctions on Austria when the new coalition formed because of the views and actions of the Freedom Party : a party whose policies have xenophobia running through them like Blackpool through rock ; a leader who has praised Hitler and the Waffen SS , refused to condemn terrorist bombings against Roma and congratulates Nazi war veterans for keeping to their principles .
Since then little has changed .
Freedom Party ministers continue to echo Nazi party slogans and rhetoric of the Thirties and Forties .
It is too soon now to allow Austria fully back into the European fold .
It will send the wrong message to the Freedom Party and their fellow travellers elsewhere in Europe .
In memory of the victims of yesterday I will vote "no " to their collaboration with the criminals of tomorrow .
- The EPLP voted for the resolution on the Santa Maria de Feira European Council on 19 and 20 June 2000 but does not support paragraph 19 .
The UK Government position , which is supported by the EPLP , is that it is better to allow this type of negotiation to be undertaken by the works councils .
It is our belief that it would be more effective to advance the status of the European Companies Statute .
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that my Group supports much of what is in Mr Turco 's report and is certainly wholeheartedly behind the general thrust of the report .
However , I have chosen to speak in today 's debate because some of the issues discussed in the report are at the core of what must be addressed if the European institutions themselves are
