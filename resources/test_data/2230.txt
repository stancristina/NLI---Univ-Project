of a last-minute compromise ?
As you have heard from the honourable Members ' interventions - and the interventions which do not come from the same political family are more valuable - there is generally a feeling that the Greek Presidency was a great success .
I shall continue in German , the language of the country which I represent here in the European Parliament , knowing also that you will not therefore need to wear headphones .
However , you did not succeed in laying down a timetable .
Politically , what do we say to these gentlemen , whom we sometimes call allies and certain of whom are also members of the European Union ?
The European Parliament accused you on the grounds that this was democratic infringement .
Question : how will we safeguard the politicisation of the unification of Europe and the limited cooperation which can give impetus to those who really want to do something different against American efforts to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator ?
Mr President , I too should like to wish that a Greek prime minister will pass through the European Parliament in a few years ' time under the rotating Presidency , which is a useful institution , to thank Mr Yiannitsis for the good cooperation we had and , in the short time which I have , to wish that the President-in-Office of the Council and Prime Minister of Greece will resolve , not in the remaining hours of his Presidency , but over the coming days , an important issue to which the letter sent to him by 90 members of the European Parliament also referred , in other words , the application of Directive 70/1999 on fixed-term workers .
This sort of incident could have resulted in the break up of the European Union .
The text submitted takes historic steps , it interconnects the European institutions more firmly , it safeguards more than ever before the social state , crowned with the concept of full employment , for which Georgos Katiforis deserves particular thanks .
Finally , I would refer to the likewise historic fact that , after seven years of being unable to take a decision , common positions were found with the European Parliament so that the regulation on the operation and funding of political parties could finally enter into force .
This is extremely important in consolidating the European democratic institutions .
Your many , very many positive criticisms fill all of us who participated in the Greek Presidency with great joy .
I thought I knew Europe well .
The new Member States in central Europe are living with the past , a past of repression by the Soviet Union .
And a number of steps - either big or small - need to be taken .
The issues of the Intergovernmental Conference will be resolved by the Italian Presidency , which will convene it , as agreed in Halkidiki , during October .
We therefore said in Halkidiki that , as there is this decision , the Convention should not continue its work by changing this text or this compromise which was presented .
That brings me to the second issue raised , the issue of immigration .
The three Scandinavian countries and numerous countries of central Europe stated that , for constitutional reasons , they would not agree under any circumstances to this sort of guard and that this sort of guard is not possible .
That is not what it is about .
Similarly , as far as readmission agreements are concerned , I would like to point out , because it was said that Turkey has a readmission agreement with the Union , that it has no readmission agreement with the Union , which is why we said that the Union needs to conclude readmission agreements .
Mr Wurtz commented that this proposal by Mr Solana needs to be debated and we agree entirely .
And these dangers arise from weapons of mass destruction , because modern technology allows weapons of mass destruction to be manufactured without the technical means needed in the past .
Prevention of terrorism is monitoring these developments , controlling trade , signing agreements governing the provision of information .
We need prevention .
Mr Papayannakis said that there is continuity on major problems .
But , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that , if there is to be a follow-up , we need to talk creatively .
We wanted to create a stronger Europe and we followed up the Lisbon policies so that there would , for example , be a stronger Europe in the social and economic sector .
I believe that we progressed and we progressed thanks to cooperation with you .
As long as we stay put , there is an increasing risk of our losing what we already have .
The condemnable statements made by the member in question are intolerable , provocative and humiliating for a large group of religious people .
The content and the quality of the ideas expressed by individual Members of Parliament can only be judged by the people who elect them .
In addition , consumers are given the necessary information , so that they are informed when they want to buy a product .
Consequently , I think that the fast adoption of this regulation without proceeding to the conciliation procedure with the Council is what we are asking for .
Fast approval of the regulation in question and of the regulation on genetically modified food and feed will ensure consumers are informed about foods and feed produced from genetically modified organisms , so that they can make an informed choice of products .
The problem of being unable to keep up with the speed of developments in biotechnology was what basically resulted in reservations and I think that it is time the European Union moved in a positive way towards this technology .
