I hope , Mr Bangemann , that you will do your best , so that we shall not , at some subsequent date , have to set up a committee of inquiry on this report !
In recent decades , each of the countries concerned has had to cope with emerging industrialization against a background of very different starting conditions , and this has influenced their continued development .
This is a general problem that concerns our cooperation policy , and we have no intention of treating it here any differently from the way we treat it in other areas .
Is our position in danger ?
Bigger companies , in particular , are unfortunately sacrificing the experience factor .
Or has it ?
Mr President , first of all I should just like to say how very much I congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her report , and of course I also welcome the Commission report .
It seems to me , on the contrary , that it would be much better to think about why this phenomenon is occurring , because then we would gain some information about the effects of the political actions that we are all , together , embarking on .
It is therefore logical to assume that one can apply this rule to making provision for people 's old-age as well .
Thanks to modern technology , work in our society depends much less on the time that somebody takes to do it , and much more on the content , in other words the quality , the innovation , and all that is concerned more with creative work .
If we take a look , then we find that this is not happening in our societies .
That shows that we need a political debate here , so that we can arrive at a result that will be acceptable to as many people as possible .
Commissioner de Silguy has said that he is prepared to clarify this point at 3 p.m. , and that the press conference will not be held until afterwards .
Unfortunately , the decision taken by the technical committee on 20 March is not so clear-cut .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if we look at this affair by the light of day , we can see that the Commission has perfected the art of evading directives or regulations that have already been adopted .
It is high time that we stuck to the decisions taken by this House .
We have for a long time been in agreement with the scientific representatives that this ought to be possible and that it is self-evident .
The results are ineffectual antibiotics , increasing allergies and chemical-contaminated soil .
And how , Commissioner , do you propose to cope with the ban on imports that exists in Austria and Luxembourg ?
Unfortunately , as the Commissioner who spoke before you has already indicated , the Commission always takes its decisions as a collective body .
They would not only have been able to confirm what Mrs Roth-Behrendt has told us , namely that the genetically modified maize is not permitted in all US Federal States , and specifically not in those where genetically modified cotton is already permitted , but they would also have been able to tell us that the IPE has also prohibited the use of genetically modified maize for the production of popcorn and sweetcorn .
I would be more inclined to agree with her fellow-member of the German Bundestag , who says that there are no horror plants growing in the fields .
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , but especially you , Commissioner , to agree that the approval of such a controversial product should be made , once again , the subject of a thorough , objective investigation !
Madam President , yesterday the President read out the ratification of the appointments of various Members , following verification of their credentials by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure .
I remember last winter , when numerous people froze to death .
There are only two options : a report which tries to describe the situation accurately , without concern for sensitivities ; or one which plays down , covers up and glosses over , which treats what happens in our own countries as at most a pardonable sin , on the basis of the maxim that , compared to the situation elsewhere , things are not so bad in the European Union .
It is as if there were two different kinds of human rights : one for Europeans and one for non-Europeans !
Mrs Roth , it is quite wrong to call this a human rights abuse .
This is a report which has to draw on the human rights concepts embodied in the relevant UN Declarations , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , and lastly the whole body of non-discrimination legislation of the European Union itself : everything , that is , which the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris refer to as the 'human dimension ' .
We must get back to the facts when discussing human rights , and we should not have to remind ourselves where we are .
Furthermore , this criticism is not justified by the facts .
Some people are allowed to be here because of their nationality ; and others , whom we call foreigners , are allowed to stay because they have lived here for a long time .
The Member States have been working with the so-called broad guidelines of economic policy for over two years , without managing to develop concerted and coordinated economic policies .
It also has to be said that the investment that is being made is aimed at improving productivity rather than expanding capacity , and is therefore not creating jobs .
Perhaps this
