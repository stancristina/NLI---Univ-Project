thing is crystal clear : on 4 May , the ' Hushkits ' regulation enters into force in the European Union .
It is therefore a question of achieving new noise levels as international standards within the ICAO.
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr Hatzidakis asked me who we are negotiating with and Mrs Jackson reminded us of the meeting they have had with Mr Slater , the Secretary of State for Transport .
Only if there is in agreement on the other aspects would I come to Parliament to ask for your support for a postponement with regard to third country airlines , for a suspension of the provision of the regulation in this specific respect .
I hope that , between us all , we can reach this agreement .
Neither has the European Regulation been popular with the American manufacturers of aircraft engine silencers known as 'hushkits ' and , therefore , the United States has announced commercial , financial etc . measures against the European Union unless we delay the entry into force of our regulation .
Ladies and gentlemen , it should be made abundantly clear that our ambition must not be to conform to the ' Hushkits ' Regulation , to the regulation on silencers .
We must try to create a common transatlantic aviation area which is a regional area in which we can achieve greater integration of the markets on each side of the Atlantic , because it is a geographical area with similar levels of development and which has the highest level of air traffic in the world .
Nevertheless , ladies and gentlemen , if we could reach an agreement with the United States to act jointly , in order to obtain lower levels and greater requirements in terms of aircraft noise emission , I would be prepared to make a proposal to this Parliament and the Council to suspend the provisions of the current regulation with regard to third countries .
However , if enlargement towards the East is inevitable , how can we explain that enlargement should only happen in one direction , taking us further away from the Mediterranean , which is so near by , forgetting how near the countries of the Maghreb are , some of which enjoy a special association status with the European Union , and that our future is intimately connected with theirs .
It would certainly be cause for satisfaction , and would be a significant step in the right direction , if this debate were to persuade the Commission to promote a more active attitude to the relaunch of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement .
In this respect , this debate and the motions for resolutions tabled by the Groups in this Parliament are very appropriate initiatives .
Strictly speaking , it could be said that , in political terms , Mediterranean policy should today be the main priority of European Union foreign policy .
In conclusion , a new phase is necessary , with the Portuguese and French presidencies , a brand new start for Euro-Mediterranean policy , which could promote a 'virtuous ' circle encompassing the objectives which were correctly drawn up at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona in November 1995 .
Mr President , I believe that this debate is appropriate at the end of the five-year period for which MEDA was programmed , but I also believe that we are going to have time to discuss this new regulation , which at the moment is being debated in this House .
I believe furthermore that the Commission must have sufficient human and material resources to do so .
It is true that the situation is different to the situation some years ago , since we can see certain slight improvements in specific areas such as human rights and in the economic field , despite certain difficulties .
It should be filled with content and not emptied .
Mediterranean policy takes its name from the sea where , for centuries , European and North African fishermen have fished together .
It would be good if the representatives of the Commission and the Council present here today could answer this question .
I simply wanted to express my total disagreement with the previous President chairing this sitting with regard to speaking time , since he has not respected the time allocated to the Groups and the time which is , of course , distributed amongst the MEPs .
My report , Mr President , on the one hand reflects the critical feeling of all the groups with regard to aspects of form and substance in the presentation and preparation of the plans .
That is why one of our proposals is to create a budget line for 2001 to cover these needs .
With regard to respect for human rights , there must be greater cooperation in order to modernise the administrative structures of some of the selected countries .
I believe this is important and I would like an answer from the Council .
This would be absolutely incredible or , at least , very naive .
I believe this warrants some reflection .
The Committee requests that a programme for employment be created , specifically targeting women and , to this end , requests that a budget line be created to finance it , with the fundamental aim of achieving equality between men and women in the workplace , not only by means of measures to protect that equality but also by means of special formulae , which will allow women to integrate fully in the labour market without jeopardising other aspects of their lives .
Another amendment that we have suggested , in accordance with what was agreed at the European Council in Lisbon , refers to the fact that employment is one of the Union ' s great political priorities for the coming years and that objective is unfailingly expressed , as Mrs Haug correctly points out , through policies which favour small and medium-sized businesses .
