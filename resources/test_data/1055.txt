discuss the practical arrangements in connection with the unconditional return of the weapons inspectors .
The issue of access to the presidential areas is still unresolved , however .
The weapons inspectors will presumably not be sent to Iraq until a new resolution has been adopted and accepted by Iraq .
It is crucial , however , for an inspection regime that is effective and credible to be established .
Against that background , it is encouraging that , in his speech yesterday , the American President , George Bush , again emphasised the United States 's readiness to go down the UN route .
I should like here finally to say that it would of course have been better if this debate had taken place at a time when Mr Solana could have been present .
Since Parliament insisted , however , on debating the matter in any case , I accepted the President 's earnest invitation to take part in the debate .
We are agreed that Iraq must , as Mr Patten said , comply , like everyone else , with UN resolutions .
Can we , on the one hand , demand that a country comply with UN resolutions and , on the other hand , accept actions that are not approved under this legal system ?
Will the EU demand a UN mandate from the UN Security Council before it supports possible action against Iraq ?
There has not of course been a shred of proof anywhere that weapons of mass destruction exist .
We know that the oil for food programme means that the Iraqi people are being kept on the verge of starvation .
It will not do anything to take the Iraqi people off the breadline .
The programme has managed to eradicate the Iraqi middle class and is responsible for Iraq 's not having been in a position to repair its water supply , resulting in a steep increase in infant mortality .
Will the EU make efforts to have the embargo lifted and will it , in that connection , remember Iraqi Kurdistan ?
I should like to warn against trivialising the Iraq problem by comparing Iraq with various other countries .
Experience clearly shows that we shall not get anywhere with Saddam Hussein if the use of force is excluded in advance .
There must be unconditional access for the weapons inspectors , including access to Saddam Hussein 's extensive palaces .
That is important for the UN 's and the Security Council 's credibility and effectiveness , and it is important in relation both to Iraq and to future multilateral cooperation .
It is encouraging that the American President has recently said that war is not inevitable and that he wants to pursue the option of going down the UN route .
Turning finally to the lifting of the embargo , the oil for food programme has in fact been revised .
It is Saddam Hussein who has not so far made use of the opportunities it presents and , in that way , subjected his people to starvation .
He has other priorities .
It is a great honour for me to be given this opportunity to speak in the European Parliament on where matters stand with the revision of the European Employment Strategy .
The Bible says that we must earn our bread by the sweat of our brow .
It is in the workplace that we spend most of our waking lives .
The new areas that are to help make Europe into a leading power include an extensive labour market and social responsibility on the part of enterprises .
All too often , the labour market is comparable to a centrifuge , in which far too many people end up on the periphery .
We must therefore develop ideas about how this situation can be prevented .
Enlargement of the European Union to include a number of Eastern and Central European countries - with or without transitional arrangements - means the free movement of labour in the new and larger EU.
We in Denmark see no problem with the free movement of labour .
The primary task towards the end of the year consists in reaching agreement on the framework for revising the Employment Strategy .
As its point of departure , the Presidency has attached great importance to our obtaining a thorough debate before a new and revised Employment Strategy is devised .
To ensure there is enough time for the debate , we thought it important to give the subject a central place in the Danish Presidency 's programme in the employment and socio-political area and to begin revising the strategy no later than at the first formal Council meeting .
The authorities in the individual countries naturally have a central role in connection with the evaluation .
It is they who have been responsible for implementing and monitoring the strategy since it was introduced in 1997 .
They therefore have a great deal of valuable first-hand experience of the present strategy 's strengths and weaknesses .
Over the last few years , other actors too have , however , obtained relevant experience to which consideration should be given in connection with the current evaluation .
In this connection , I took note of the points of view published by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the middle of September .
Finally , I want to mention the national and European parties in the labour market who , actively involved as they are , also have important observations to contribute .
It is therefore an extremely topical subject to be included on the agenda for the plenary debate here today .
It contains a general evaluation of the results achieved on the European labour markets , and it outlines the most important issues in connection with a revision of the strategy
