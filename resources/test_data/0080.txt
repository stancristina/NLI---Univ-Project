Instead of free allocation , I would prefer to see auctioning .
In the 23 amendments that were adopted at second reading , the presidency , and by extension also the Council , did more than meet this House halfway .
Since the directive makes it compulsory for producers to specify the capacity on batteries , consumers can assess the price/quality ratio themselves and select the most cost-effective battery for each purpose .
Finally , I should like to mention the keystone of the directive on which we had already reached agreement at first reading , namely the ban on cadmium in portable batteries , which enters into effect in 2008 .
The Social Fund now concentrates on globalisation and on improving people’s employability .
Mrs Sommer 's report provides one of the necessary building blocks , for harmonised technical regulations for transit on internal waterways mean equal conditions for everyone and hence a fine , manageable and safe fleet .
I am given to understand that a number of proposed amendments are on the table at this very moment .
We now have to seize the opportunity to move forward two steps at once .
The possibility that we now have of concluding a compromise and to start out with a Europe-wide regulation constitutes an opportunity that we must seize whatever else we do .
If we reject the compromise , I am convinced – as are the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur – that we will be left with nothing , and that we will be even further away from the objective that we want to reach .
It is particularly disappointing to see how nuclear power , after a period deservedly spent on the fringes of the energy debate , is now creeping back on to the European agenda , for , being neither environmentally friendly , safe , nor good value , it is not an acceptable alternative , and the problem with waste is a good example of why it is not one .     Mr President , the statements made by the Finnish Presidency appear to indicate that it wishes , and I quote 'to restore the hugely deflated public confidence in the EU’s organisations’ .
I criticise you for clinging onto the rejected European constitution .
I do not often experience the pleasure of agreeing with the analysis of Mr Leinen , chairman of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
Nevertheless , now is not the time to let our hands hang low .
Do the Council and Commission share this view and if so , how do they think this may impact on European relations with Syria ?
Witnesses were sometimes accompanied by lawyers who ensured that difficult questions remained unanswered .
If we allow these things to happen on European soil , we betray those who set out to achieve European integration .
These are very serious questions that fully justify the investigation .
After all , the way suspects are treated is , in effect , at the very heart of the values in which we in the EU share .
We found the vote in committee unsatisfactory on the grounds that a number of sound amendments we had tabled were not adopted .
As in the debates held earlier today , this is yet another case of weighing up security interests against the interests of the civil liberties involved in public and corporate privacy .
We also want – and this is something that the Commissioner has already mentioned – clarification about the role of the European institutions .
In the European Union , we must , as a matter or urgency , adopt cohesive , efficient and common policy that is based on democratic decision-making and guarantees the sound protection of personal data .
As Mr Gaubert said a moment ago , this data exchange is of major importance and quite simply a matter of necessity .
The image that was portrayed to the viewing public was shocking .
Also , is it possible , on the basis of Frontex’s expertise , to actively challenge the organisations that transport people to , for example , the Canary Islands and Spain ?     .
That is why the European Union must also do its bit and pull up its socks .
Europe concerns itself with visas , with coastal surveillance , with customs policy , with combating people-trafficking , with labour market policy , and with integration : that , putting it in broad terms , is what Commissioner Frattini is doing with AENEAS.
As Bono would say : ‘Put your money where your mouth is ; make poverty history’ .
More immigration into our own countries , then , means more misery in the developing world , contrary to what the report suggests .
It can indeed be said , speaking frankly , that there are Members of this House who do not actually want terrorism to be dealt with .     .
The EU’s Member States must acknowledge their share in responsibility for this .     Mr President , no matter how much it is claimed in the Lambrinidis report that integration is , in principle , a two-way process , I in fact find in the text as approved little or nothing of the sort ; on the contrary , indeed , it was once more the same old tune of plenty of rights and hardly any duties .
This sort of report is the latest of innumerable examples of the democratic deficit in Europe and of the interference from the European level that can only erode still further Europeans ’ confidence in Europe .     .
Mr President , what we are debating this afternoon is not just what has emerged from the WTO meeting in Geneva but also the future of the WTO as an institution .
Above all else , the way ahead through
