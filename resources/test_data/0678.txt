For this reason , I staked on that objective all the political capital which I had so far accumulated .
In the economic sphere , the single market in goods and factors of production was the theme of the 1980s ; the single currency that of the 1990s .
The establishment of a broad-based , efficient European market in venture capital is a necessary condition for achieving higher levels of productivity .
I have a plan which I should like to see converted into a commitment for the Commission , Parliament and Europe 's governments : my plan is that , five years from now , young Europeans finishing their secondary education will be as capable as the best of their contemporaries , throughout the world , of using the technologies of the information society .
This analysis , now shared by all the relevant bodies , has led the European Central Bank to assume with a great sense of responsibility its task of managing monetary policy .
Demographic decline , mass emigration and doubts as to whether the European model of social protection can be preserved intact are the other major fears casting shadows over the continent 's future .
In view of the war in the Balkans , the completion of enlargement becomes a top political priority because of the message it can send to those peoples by preparing them for closer ties with Europe .
Indeed , our future life will be determined by our relations with the Islamic world .
The united Europe will be strong only if the independence of its component parts is strong .
These reforms , which will be a cornerstone of the new Commission 's programme , will require the implementation of at least three principles : greater efficiency , absolute transparency and full responsibility , or what is usually defined as accountability .
I hope that this will soon happen , and I believe that the battle of principle which I have waged will serve this purpose .
At this current stage of European politics , however , I acknowledge that my candidature could constitute not a stimulus but a cause of division .
The strength of American culture , in the broad sense of the term , is symbolically expressed through the mass media ; indeed , some go so far as to deem it the single reference-point for a Europe in search of its soul .
No single country can respond to them ; only Europe can do so .
Therefore , Mr Prodi , we look forward to the 'age of reform and change ' which you announced in your speech , but the reforms should be real ones and not just vague proposals : a political union to reinforce the economic union , so as to have a foreign policy , to address ourselves to the Mediterranean , as you said , but also to deal with immigration and crime , as well as humanitarian aid - and here I include the agricultural products which Europe is still throwing away or not producing , to the great detriment of our economy .
I definitely share the rapporteur 's demand that Commission and Council forces should be joined in a single document so that there is greater clarity and , above all , better coordination leading to more effective and rational action on drugs .
We should not wait for a disaster like BSE before promoting the consumption of European beef - safe beef , naturally - just as we should not have waited for globalisation , and hence the influx onto the EU market of wines from around the world , before deciding to promote European wine and explain to everyone that it is not harmful , especially as long as one does not over-indulge .
Almost all the EU Member States have a legal framework - be it statutory or contractual - to ensure that employees are informed and consulted .
It is therefore deplorable that the negotiations between the social partners at European level for an agreement in accordance with Article 4( 2 ) of the Social Protocol have failed , in particular because of one side 's total unwillingness to negotiate .
Mr President , I agree with Mrs Ghilardotti that there is a need for increased information and greater involvement of employees within companies , especially medium and large-sized ones , not least so as to avoid outright social injustices such as in the case of Renault .
In this case , there is a give-and-take relationship between employer and employees : joint decision making but also joint risk taking ; the profits are shared but so are the responsibilities .
Clearly , social dialogue is especially desirable for SMEs , which appear to be excluded from this document , although - as we all know - they account for 90 % of companies in the Community .
I should also like to speak in support of the amendments tabled , which restate the position of the European Parliament .
The regulation under discussion will cover the administration of the third phase of the programme for the next five-year period 2000-2004 , and funding of EUR 613 million has been made available .
Parliament and the Council reached an agreement in the Conciliation Committee on 4 February , especially in respect of the establishment of a European database on rare diseases and access to it , encouragement and support for professionals with a view to improving the early diagnosis , identification and prevention of rare diseases , transnational cooperation among voluntary bodies , networking of groups of people directly or indirectly concerned and coordination at Community level , EU support for the monitoring of rare diseases in the Member States , training and refresher courses for professionals , and the promotion of networks of experts interested in a rapid response to the phenomenon of clusters .
Allow me to stress certain key points .
This programme , along with the one on pollution-related diseases ,
