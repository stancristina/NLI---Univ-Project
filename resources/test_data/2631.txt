It is the best of the proposals now under discussion and I really hope that the Commission can support the proposal .
Finally , I would like to comment on an eternal problem : In the report herring is translated as sill in Swedish and silli in Finnish , the Baltic Fishermen will have a good laugh about this .
Madam President , Eastern Turkestan is just one of many problem areas for human rights in China .
I hope that the worthy representatives for China have read today 's agenda and realises that we interfere in internal affairs all over the world where human rights are concerned , we are not conducting a campaign against China , we are fighting a campaign for human rights .
This is why Denmark with the support of Sweden and hopefully other smaller states in the EU can carry on this justified criticism against the deficiencies in human rights in China .
There are some good examples .
We have all been able to follow the emergency situation there in the international media .
We already know that 3 000 children have been taken into the care of the authorities because their parents cannot provide for them .
It would be unfortunate if this happened .
Karelia has been affected by the chaos in Russia more than other parts of the country .
Karelia has a communist government in the autonomous Karelian Republic .
There are groups in Finland who dream about changing the borders and taking back parts of Karelia again .
By making housing accessible we reduce or eliminate the handicap .
Those aspects , which are well described in this report using the term mainstreaming , including housing policy , transport policy , labour market policy and education policy .
We have unemployment figures of more than 10 percent .
This means that when the labour market situation is even worse these people are affected even more .
Young people and employees with disabilities cannot currently take advantage freedom of movement because of lack of accessibility .
They have primarily been concerned with the exchange of knowledge .
It is obvious that current programmes , toys and games attract boys while girls back away from sitting in front of computers .
The Internet is an indispensable part of this , particularly in terms of the spread of information .
It bases itself on the assumption that the Internet is difficult to regulate , but then complements this view with practical , tangible measures against illegal and undesirable material on the Internet .
When this subject was discussed in committee there were calls for a variety of regulations such as registration of Internet users and a ban on electronic encoding .
Limiting free and global access to information through regulation of the Internet is like throwing out the baby with the bath water .
There is a huge imbalance in terms of resources .
Similarly , we cannot imagine what the information society will look like in a further ten years time .
Mr President , it is extremely important that we find a way to develop Europe 's Maritime Industry so that it becomes both safer and more competitive .
It is important in a process such as this , where the Commission is quite rightly trying to take an overall view of the maritime industry , that environmental problems are not forgotten .
The graph shows a curve which is rising catastrophically and quick action is required , which the Commission does not seem to understand .
In the short term , a simple remedy would be to do as has been done in Denmark and Sweden which is to allow the discharge of oil , free of charge , in each port .
Madam President , if we look at the statistics in the report the situation looks good but as the rapporteur has stated this is not the whole truth .
When we are considering subsidiarity I think that we should also look at individual regulations in every draft law ; this , I think , is the spirit of the Treaty .
Secondly , I share the rapporteur 's concern over the reports which we are discussing today .
We also need better investigations into specific draft laws on subsidiarity .
Despite a directive from the Commission 's leaders , investigation into specific draft laws leave much to be desired .
This would reduce the level of bureaucracy and increase people 's faith in the Union .
The principle of subsidiarity ought to be the tool for carrying out this work as it was intended .
The way the Commission has started to introduce another legal principle , the principle of proportionality , and issues concerning the technical level of legislation etc . into their reporting on the application of the subsidiarity principle does not make the situation any clearer at all .
It is also possible to use Article 100a , where values other than the purely financial are respected alongside the internal market .
Madam President , let me briefly congratulate Mr Ford on a truly excellent report and on what I believe is a significant and lasting contribution here in Parliament .
So I think that Parliament should be very grateful to Mr Ford for introducing these rules now .
In this respect , I would really like to have gone one stage further and agree with Mr Metten 's original proposal in its entirety as it also stated what should be in these annual reports .
My group will be very pleased to vote for this report .
Then I would like to pause for a moment and consider the value of these words since we use the term organic farming for something which covers one percent of agricultural production .
We are now fast approaching this level which I find very satisfactory .
This may not always be
