We condemn the political view that holds that , for the ultimate good of its peoples , Europe should be integrated stealthily by omniscient technocrats who alone can overrule our personal interests .
After all , let us not forget that the main responsibility lies with the British Government , whose attitude to this case has been unspeakable from the start .
That argument disregards the principle of continuity inherent in any authority .
The principle of subsidiarity , too , needs to be revived : each government must be able to take its own steps to protect those who elected it , imposing higher levels of protection than those laid down by the European Union and establishing its own control mechanisms in such important areas as health safety .
By voting for the censure motion we are casting a vote of confidence in Europe 's institutions and declaring our complete awareness of Parliament 's role as the protector of the citizens ' rights and freedoms .
There is the problem of the inviolability of frontiers , but there is also the problem of democracy and respect for human rights .
That is why , when the time comes , I shall also be opposing the amendment proposed to us by our friends in the Liberal Group on the subject of a military intervention force , because I fear that , having regard to the present situation in eastern Zaire , any form of military intervention - even designed to ensure safe passage for humanitarian aid - may seem to be a territorial statement in a conflict which primarily concerns the Zaireans .
I am very glad that this House , for the first time , is beginning to discuss them .
The idea is one of particular interest to certain Member States , including your own , Commissioner , if I am not mistaken .
Fourthly , there is the urgency of the situation .
Rap , hip-hop , contemporary creativity in general , all these artistic movements which have been censored or threatened with censor are shot through and enriched with the diversity of the world 's cultures , and call upon us to open our hearts and minds to welcome the foreigner in the words of Jacques Prévert : ' Strange strangers , you are part of the city , you are part of its life . '
During this phase , culture plays a leading part .
Mr Hory , I fear that I do not really see eye to eye with you on this motion for a resolution , because it seems to me to be a masterpiece of mix-and-match .
Controlling illegal immigration is the only way of ensuring that the Schengen agreements are applied satisfactorily .
I am thinking particularly of joint actions between the Council of Europe and the European Union .
Border controls can ultimately be seen as the most liberal way of controlling immigration , the way that involves least restriction on civil liberties .
Mr Schulz impugned all the members of my group when he attacked Mr Berthu just now .
Mr President , the Baldi report accurately reflects the hopes and fears expressed during the proceedings of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly during the year 1996 .
I represent a country , France , where people are more enthusiastic about bilateral aid than they are elsewhere - partly for historical reasons , perhaps , but definitely because of economic and diplomatic influences .
And , finally , we agree with the conclusions he draws from that analysis .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , I should like to ask for the debate to be postponed pursuant to Rule 131 of the Rules of Procedure , paragraphs 1 and 2 , and for it to be held on the Monday of the March part-session , 10 March , as the first item on the agenda .
Well , that was Thursday , and his report was postponed .
( Applause from the ARE Group )
What the French Minister for Foreign Affairs , Mr Hervé de Charette , said merely echoed what might be thought by any objective observer of the European Parliament who studies the content of its resolutions .
When this agreement came into force in March 1995 , that same philosophy was supposed to prevail .
European citizenship is still an objective , not a reality .
Otherwise , what would be the purpose of the laboratory ?
Police activity against criminals , thieves , the Mafia , drug pushers , illegal immigrants , must not be reduced - it must be increased and integrated into the European structures .
In the short term , we need to promote second-chance schools and help teachers .
There is a problem here with the application of the legislation by the Belgian Government , and another problem with the evaluation of nuisance and the disturbance it creates for the population .
Mr President , my name was not misspelt , for the simple reason that it does not appear in the Minutes even though I was not in two places at once and was sure I was there yesterday .
The Commission is actively encouraging the Advisory Group in this project , which ensures dialogue and transparency .
In the case of animals and humans , the real twin , known as a 'homozygote ' , which is the result of the splitting of a single egg , represents a natural clone .
Mr President , ever since the cloning of an innocent little animal has been so widely publicized in the media , we have plunged into the most breathtaking simplifications , as shown , incidentally , by the fact that some of our colleagues rigged themselves out in extremely misplaced and even grotesque masks a few minutes ago .
