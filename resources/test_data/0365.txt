political forces involved to express themselves freely in the crucial phase of the electoral campaign .
This does not mean setting itself up as a tutor , but rather showing that Europe states its resolve and acts for the benefit of all , and seeks to find solutions for future generations .
Secchi report ( A4-0228/98 ) Yet again this House has adopted a resolution on Kosovo .
This is why I intend to vote against the resolution .
We have therefore voted against the whole of this resolution .
What exactly does that mean ?
What are these technical measures ?
There is a remarkable disparity between the declared objective of the conservation of stocks and the huge quantities of fish caught for industrial purposes .
We are also restricted by the GATT agreements within the framework of the WTO because , as a result of a major political error , unlike agricultural products , fishery products have always been consolidated under the GATT.
The sardine sector , which has been virtually allowed to disappear in France , is still very important in the Iberian Peninsula .
I therefore suggest that we proceed to the vote on the setaside requirement , which will be very short , without holding a debate .
Conversely , if Asian currencies collapse , purchases of cereals decrease in the West .
My request was upheld by many of my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , and I am delighted that this was the case .
What is happening ?
They will not accept the adoption of a high set-aside , and I believe they are right .
It is my hope that the construction of Europe is a collective ambition , not just an appropriation of Community legislation for nationalistic purposes , in conflicting directions .
Finally , our group is opposed to all the amendments tabled by Mr Liese on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party , all of which is aimed at damaging the production of bananas by traditional ACP suppliers .
I think that you are going too far , because we all know perfectly well that a legal base has been missing for a good number of years and that it is essential , as regards decisions taken by this Parliament , that such decisions be implemented .
We have laws which prohibit freedom of thought , freedom to write , so how dare we pursue in Jordan , living in a state of war , something we are unable to enforce at home , where we have an intolerable thought police .
As long ago as 1995 I was very concerned by this problem and tabled a motion for a resolution on large conurbations which suffer many of the problems which beset today 's society .
Last of all , it ignores the strategy of large groups and financial bodies which have a significant influence on the planning of the land .
In fact , rural areas represent approximately 80 % of the Community territory , and a balanced regional planning policy depends on their vitality .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the ad hoc procedure born of the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 29 October 1993 on agricultural expenditure has been extended to include fisheries agreements and the common foreign and security policy .
Undoubtedly , this has enabled progress to be made , both as regards improvement of the budgetary procedure and preparation of the European Union 's budget .
Whilst not wishing to swim against the tide , it is a step which my group and myself could not take .
Contrary to what we are told , the ad hoc procedure is not a way of rationalizing expenditure , but a desire to redefine the classification of this expenditure .
The directive which was passed in 1991 formed part of an overall plan for a harmonized tax system for Europe .
The airline and shipping companies ?
I would simply like to say that , in this context , we thought it important to point out the need to find an appropriate solution for Irish architects whose training could not be recognized in time for that to be possible .
Mr President , I have two observations to make in my two minutes , .
The specific issues at stake in the transport sector are real , but no less real are the need for rest , for leisure , for respect of the biological rhythms of salaried workers .
I therefore accuse some governments of having deliberately sought this legal vacuum in order finally to do away with certain social rights achieved after a huge battle in this sector .
Moreover , the Union must strive to ensure that environmental and social clauses are included in the WTO criteria .
In fact , with such strong forces trying to hold back the mobility of persons , how can we talk about free movement of goods and persons in Europe ?
In accordance with the recommendation of our Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , I would like to speak in favour of the agreement by expressing our wishes for its future success .
Very urgent !
This can , of course , be done by means of the principle of subsidiarity , but it really has to happen .
Mr Novo Belenguer 's report aims to integrate spatial planning into the field of competence of the Community .
This affair is a fine example .
We find this manoeuvre totally unacceptable , and call on the Council to stand up to it .
The Commission 's answer is : greater delegation in simple administrative tasks .
Once this premise has been put forward , the rights and duties of the various players in the democratic process must be specified , because exercising citizenship is that as well
