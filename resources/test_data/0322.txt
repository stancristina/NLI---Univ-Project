They make bizarre interpretations of the New York Convention on transzonal species , they call into question the very regulations and functioning of the NAFO Convention and they rashly and unnecessarily flout the principle of good faith which has always been the hallmark of the European Union .
The Commission only drew up pages 3 to 8-5 pages - and then only some basic tables .
Therefore , I call on the Commission to ensure that the next report is more uniform , and that at least the information is clearer .
In other words , if we spent more , we would save money .
The truth is that the monitoring of fisheries , as we all agree , is inadequate in several respects , and this is highlighted in the report .
This is a problem which needs to be solved .
I have in mind the possible fraudulent import of cod of a different origin via Norway .
The rapporteur understands the situation very well and I wanted to emphasize that his report is both clear and accurate .
Mr Cunha 's proposal is perfectly reasonable : he calls for a quota reduction for those Member States which do not meet the Community requirements .
I would like us to concentrate on these measures rather than on others which do not directly affect the debate .
Therefore , I call on the Commission once again to provide for these embargo measures , which are of the utmost importance in ensuring that the contracting parties comply with the recommendations laid down by ICCAT.
So I too am glad that the Council , in its common position , has adopted the unusual approach of practically accepting the vast majority of Parliament 's amendments , particularly those which say the card should belong to the holder rather than to a specific vehicle and remove the address and date of birth , for obvious reasons of security .
For Europe will not truly exist until we have removed the practical obstacles which confront those people who have to cross a border every morning in order to go to work in another Member State .
Mr President , one of the main reasons Mr Elles is today presenting us with a motion for a resolution about postponing the 1996 discharge has to do with the MED programmes , and from what we are hearing , not just the MED programmes , either .
On the contrary , the European Parliament is not opposed to it , but there was a serious management problem which was mainly located in Brussels , and was discovered by the Court of Auditors .
And the fifth lesson is that the European Commission should send all the details of this affair to the judicial authorities in Belgium , France and Italy so that they can examine any possible legal implications .
That same United Nations report says that , whereas in 1960 the poorest 20 % of the population had a 2.4 % share of world income , today that share is 1.1 % .
We think that for there to be a proper follow-up to the Copenhagen Summit , it is essential for all those countries which do not yet comply with this demand to come to a decision in that respect .
And in ten years time , we will be debating poverty here again and still talking about the thousands of millions of people still in the same situation .
So , we agree with a practical approach , we agree with the list of categories and aid proposed by the Commission - and our group is not in favour of either lengthening it or shortening it , as the rapporteur suggests - but we have made two comments which have been taken up by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
We cannot cease to exercise control over the possibility that a certain budget might in total devote more than a certain percentage of GDP to state aid .

I would like to know what stage that project is at , and what Argentina 's position is .
We also disagree with the Sindal report 's criticisms of any regional aid which the shipyards might currently be receiving .
So it makes no sense for us to want to be more demanding than the established framework .
Furthermore , as has also been stressed tonight , that ability to compete is reinforced by the strong devaluation of the Korean won , caused by monetary instability in Asia .
So we are surprised that the safeguard clause I quoted from the recitals nevertheless fails to be reflected in the actual text of the regulation , and we are strongly in favour of it being formally incorporated into it .
Mr President , I am glad to see we are joined tonight by the two Commissioners dealing with this matter , in the contexts of industrial policy and competition policy .
Is it because the Nordic countries have joined ?
I think it would be very interesting and very important for the shipyards and the Spanish regions to know that that position is being defended because , as we are hearing , that does not seem to be the case .
Her report deals with a situation which she knows how to balance perfectly : eliminating excessive burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises ; maintaining the reliability of the necessary figures , so as not to lose the proper information ; and maintaining the other information we have at present - also referred to in her report -, namely the regional aspect of statistics .
I hope the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council may like to advance some intelligent comment on this phenomenon .
