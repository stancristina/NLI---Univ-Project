, women and children .
I am not very enthusiastic about this debate , but I am of the opinion that the indivisibility of human rights - the Universal Declaration - should apply within as well as outside of the European Union , and should also cover social , economic and cultural rights .
Nothing is being done to rehabilitate prisoners , which obviously increases the social burden on all the EU countries .
I do not of course want to conduct an anti-abortion crusade here and now , but quite frankly I find it rather too much that the European Parliament goes so far as to deplore the fact that certain Member States forbid or merely limit information concerning voluntary termination of pregnancy , as stated in paragraph 56 of the report .
So what is just ?
We shall therefore attempt to improve the text , so that it may offer protection to all and receive the vote of as many Members as possible .
Secondly , we should not forget the original aims behind this report .
In view of the diversity - and also the positive changes - in judicial legislation , and out of concern for certain rights which are still being denied , for example the misuse of preventive detention and prison overcrowding in some countries , this report was intended to home in on some of the approaches already being followed in certain countries , bringing them to the attention of the others .
Rather , it is time to put an end to the uncertainties of the end-user , avoiding a conciliation procedure which would undoubtedly be long and arduous .
We are becoming a laughing-stock : the peoples of Europe expect us to do our work , and all we can produce is foolish nonsense !
( The President cut the speaker off )
Prohibition could , then , be applied to substances which actually cause structural changes in the biological composition of an organism .
Our task as administrators is to establish strict , clear-cut rules , the same for all the Community countries , to prevent this phenomenon from becoming a truly dangerous one .
However , we do this with regret every Thursday afternoon in this House - which is perhaps rather less crowded than it should be - when we must unfortunately acknowledge that so many persons are still deprived of their rights .
Now , as in every case of self-respecting regional cooperation , it is receiving something in exchange : an invitation to apply Islamic law in that country .
In my opinion , for example , whereas the Member States should keep a watchful eye on immigration as it occurs , the Community should take initiatives such as organising entry into our territory for those who deserve it and have a genuine claim , whereas those not meeting these requirements should be challenged .
Amidst the momentous changes affecting contemporary society , there is one spectre hovering over Europe which could have undesirable consequences if not properly handled : globalisation .
The problem lies elsewhere , namely in grasping how the coherent aims which you have announced tie in with the specific policies which the German Government seems determined to introduce .
The problem of unemployment , among others , can only be tackled in a European context .
Given that our President speaks Greek , I shall take the liberty of saying this in Latin and translating it with a German proverb : 'laus nova nisi oritur etiam virtus amittitur ' . The German proverb states : ' Wer nicht vorwärts geht , der kommt zurück ' . I believe that Europe too could fall backwards unless it moves forwards .
How much strain can we place on public disaffection , without running the risk of alienating our citizens once and for all from the centres of decision-making ?
Although it is true that the sad affair of fraud and misappropriation of European taxpayers ' money , underlined by the refusal of this House to grant discharge for 1996 , is currently casting dark shadows over the Community 's whole executive , it must nevertheless be brought to public attention .
If transparency is to encompass all forms of public access to information and decision-making , democratic control implies that our citizens should not only participate but should also be allowed a supervisory role .
I hope that the House will adopt my amendment on the European Council , drawing the Council 's attention to the fact that holding the European Council on 3 and 4 June will jeopardise the whole scenario established at Amsterdam .
While we welcome the conclusion of this agreement , we should not overlook the problems created by Korea 's trade practices and the obstacles it has hitherto put in the way of EU products in the shipbuilding and automobile sectors , which are deemed sensitive under the agreement .
That is the position , Madam , as I am sure you know .
The honourable Member is quite right : nothing is as sensitive to market trends as the industries which profit from them .
What I think emerged very clearly on the last occasion was that the Canadians have no intention of amending Bill C-27 .
In any event , above and beyond the negotiations , and as well as keeping events under daily - or monthly - review , the Commission is absolutely convinced that early ratification of the UN Convention is the most effective strategy available to us .
Indeed , as you will remember , Mr Varela , what happened in the last episode , in 1995 , is that Canada refused to recognise the competence of the Court of Justice , which has now in fact ruled that it is not competent .
All these projects are implemented through NGOs , a list of which I have here and can leave with you
