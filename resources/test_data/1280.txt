under-represented at some levels .
What I can say is that when we have organised competitions aimed at specific nationalities amongst the new Member States , it has been the Finns who have shown the most interest in EU posts , and for this reason selections have been made faster .
But as our time is drawing to a close I do not wish to prolong this sitting .
Mr President , to assume that all European countries will avoid asymmetric shocks is naïve .
Within the EU we have to be prepared in good time in order to ward off such shocks .
As Mr Metten takes Finland as an example of these , I would like to emphasise that the substantially increased role that Nokia and high tech exports have come to play in the economy has diversified the industrial structure and exports .
Nor do I see a harmonised monetary policy as appropriate .
For my own part I would like to stress the importance of Keynesian budget policy as a tool to ward off recession .
In this way , when the danger of an asymmetric recession looms the country in question could , by means of a budget deficit , stimulate the economy and , with the surplus of the boom phase , bring the situation back to an overall framework of 3 % .
Now it is time for the Commission and the Council to follow the same line and amend the Stability Pact so that different Member States may prepare to avoid shocks by means of anticipatory measures .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Metten for a splendid and professional report , which contains some excellent proposals .
Economic shocks are nonetheless serious and they always affect the worst-off most seriously .
Although these shocks were felt throughout the whole EU area , the effect on some states was greater than on others .
Medical supplies are urgently needed .
On this subject I agree with the previous speaker , but we no longer have the right devaluation medicine at our disposal .
I was astonished that one of them did not regard the issue of asymmetric shocks as important .
The rapporteur gives as examples of shocks affecting single countries the effect of North Sea oil production on the United Kingdom , German unification , the floods in Europe , mad cow disease , and swine fever in the Netherlands .
For that reason it is time that EU aid to Russia was targeted at relieving the violent social upheaval that has been going on , and not at supporting an oligarchy led by people who moreover , send their money , which is actually our money , abroad .
Nevertheless , the situation in the timber processing industry is important , and when the Russian crisis came along , it did not affect Finland , which shows how much our situation has changed .
We need a guarantee fund and instruments of stability .
I was involved myself , as was my colleague , Mr Rübig .
The system of automation that we are dealing with here , with the computerisation of customs and networking , is absolutely essential .
If the Member States and the Commission do not realise this , it is very strange .
We talk about the information society , but it is not working in the area of customs .
But it is important that essential matters are not just left to the committee , but that Parliament should be able to debate them , as otherwise it is not just a question of avoiding transparency , but also bypassing democracy .
The Commission 's document on the Nordic dimension , which was officially presented at Vienna , is excellent .
The stabilising effect of the Nordic dimension cannot be underestimated .
It is vital that the operational proposals put forward by the Commission are realised .
Cooperation among the countries that share the Baltic coastline must be improved .
Better exploitation of the vast energy resources in north-western Russia , and , on a wider basis , in the Barents Sea , has to be made one of the main objectives of the Nordic dimension .
I wish to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
This has been approved in the report .
So has the committee 's view that appropriations should be decided on an annual basis in association with Parliament 's budget debate .
For that reason the Committee wanted an addendum to Article 3 which called for differentiation in the relevant funding in the budget .
In connection with this year 's budget an advisory working party is to be set up to focus on human rights , and the Council and Parliament have sanctioned it for next year .
It is vital that this report should be approved so that a legal basis may be established for the appropriations concerned .
Mr President , human rights belong to all of us .
That is what we think , anyway .
We have already heard that , as far as homosexuals are concerned for example , not everyone would necessarily agree with us .
Their human rights are not being fully respected .
At the Vienna summit , which debated Article 13 , great hopes were also laid on Parliament in this connection .
It is just as my colleague Mr Lange said a moment ago : there is a loophole here .
Light commercial vehicles have been left out , even though they are responsible for substantially high levels of carbon dioxide emissions .
I would also like to stress that the objectives of this voluntary agreement are very modest .
We must be able to do something about this .
So it is high time we acted more decisively and effectively at both national and EU levels to prevent discrimination and increase tolerance
