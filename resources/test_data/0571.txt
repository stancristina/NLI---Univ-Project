The first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF , without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice .
As there are doubts , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda , and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union ' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor ?
Unfortunately , the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight .
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment .
On the other hand , as the rapporteur points out , in the name of competition policy , public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies , with the privatisation of important industries and public companies , as has happened in Portugal , with harmful consequences for the country and its workers .
On the other hand , the rapporteur ignores the main causes of the distortion of the rules on competition , specifically the growing number of mergers and their consequences for that distortion .
Mr President , ever since Plato ' s ' Republic ' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts .
In this , their second report , the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund , that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing .
This will inevitably be influenced by my parliamentary experience in this House , and of course by the parliamentary experience of that great Member of our national Parliament who is now the Minister for Justice and my colleague .
We will do this today .
Then there was the launching of Europol soon after the start of the Finnish Presidency , on 1 July 1999 .
The Secretary-General of the Council has published a collection of documents covering the entire Schengen acquis , pending publication in the Official Journal once all the translations are available .
Applicant countries can be associated with projects selected by the management committee as long as this complies with the objectives of the programme .
As regards SIS , the Schengen Information System , I am pleased to report that the Member States were very positive about its operation and use .
I would now like to state before you here that we firmly intend to consult the European Parliament , not only in those cases stipulated by the Treaty , which we are obliged to do , but also to inform and consult Parliament whenever we believe that it is appropriate to widen this type of consultation , and when , in direct contact with the Commission , we believe that Parliament should be able to present its opinion .
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech , 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council , and a fundamental expectation , as from this year , that will be realised in the form of specific actions .
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work , not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium , but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists , particularly at Council level , on issues concerning the fight against organised crime .
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme , the presidency believes that it is worthwhile , bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty , to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention .
Lastly then , Europol , which started its work in 1999 .
We are familiar with Parliament ' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council ' s legal advisers .
In this first speech , I would like to share with Parliament the Commission ' s view of the most important events in 1999 .
The Union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom , security and justice was confirmed at Tampere .
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament , that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and , as a consequence , the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities .
These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters ( Brussels I ) , the convention on jurisdiction , recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters ( Brussels II ) , and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters .
