It is unacceptable for any democratic debate to be dispensed with , either in the national parliaments or the European Parliament , on issues relating to rights guaranteed by constitutions , in the name of the need for rapid action .
However , in a world political and economic climate which is changing rapidly in the wake of the tragedy of 11 September , and in the face of the new demands from democratic States - primarily for terrorism to be combated , of course , but also for an area of peace and respect for human rights to be created in Asia and the Middle East and , moreover , for economic growth and employment to be boosted - we would like to make quite clear the need for a better coordinated European Union initiative which can speed up the institutional reforms , which are still far from completion , and thus empower the European Union to enter the field as a world political entity , an initiative which is able , that is , to speak with a single voice in Washington and Islamabad alike , as President Prodi advocated .
Little has been achieved thus far and more needs to be done , and here I endorse what President Prodi said regarding the common foreign and security policy .
I feel that the course embarked upon by the Commission and the Council is the right one .
After 11 September , the political geography of the world has changed radically .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a few comments on this debate , which has revealed great unity , not just between Council and Commission but also between these institutions and Parliament .
This is an issue of fundamental importance , in which regard I would point out to Mr Tajani and the other speakers that what has been termed the 'reconstruction plan for Palestine ' is something which is very much on our minds : I have discussed it many times with Mr Peres and we are well aware that we should concentrate on taking action in certain sectors such as water , energy , infrastructure and revitalising industry .
A further point related to the Convention .
A general agreement has been adopted on the board , the executive structure and so forth .
We also saw the destruction of the European Union 's three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht . "
We need to bring all our work out into the open and achieve more transparency , accountability and democracy in our governance .
I will go back to Mrs Maij-Weggen' s comment on the actual definition of the Convention : we cannot consider it to be a consultative body , as some have described it .
It is a political issue and is the result of the way our work is organised , with the debates taking place separately from the votes .
Second report ( A5-0337/2001 ) by Mrs Rühle , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the discharge in respect of the financial management of the sixth , seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year [COM(2000 ) 357 - C5-0257/2000 - 2000/2164(DEC ) ] ( Parliament adopted the decisions and the resolution with successive votes ) Report ( A5-0328/2001 ) by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the Communication from the Commission on the implementation of innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund Regulation for the programming period 2000-2006 [COM(2000 ) 894 - C5-0341/2001 - 2001/2141(COS) ] ( Parliament adopted the resolution)EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE Hautala report ( A5-0358/2001 ) Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
My daughter , Elisabetta , has been a regional councillor of the Liguria region for five years and is currently a regional councillor of the Lombardy region , for the Pensioners ' Party of course .
Mr President , Mr Fatuzzo ' s explanations of vote are so poetic that I would like to ask you , as a member of the Bureau , whether the Presidency has any intention of publishing these speeches in a book , considering their value and the sentiments pervading them which surpass all the other speeches in the House and endow them with a poetic value that Parliament must not fail to appreciate .
It concerns the Social Fund , which , as we know , is a fund dedicated to workers and to improving and enhancing the chances of the unemployed of finding work .
We support the rapporteur and the majority of his proposals , and so I would like to use the time available to me to send two messages from our group to the Council , in particular .
The Union must assume a new role .
It is a farsighted measure , particularly in economic terms .
In Europe , we grant a subsidy of a dollar a day per bovine animal - and these animals are not high quality , they are our own mad cows - when there are one billion , three hundred thousand human beings who have to live on less than one dollar a day .
The Désir report addresses clearly the limitations and dysfunctional areas of international trade , of unequal participation , and the lack of transparency and democracy and the ensuing consequences , and proposes reforms to remedy these shortcomings .
I therefore cannot fail to congratulate the rapporteur , the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , Mr Brok , on his report and on the priorities he has set for the forthcoming year in this area , particularly with regard to what - as we have been witnessing in recent months - will be the
