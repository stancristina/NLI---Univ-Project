I rarely speak in debates after summits but this is an important one .
I therefore look forward to some genuine action from the European Commission .
It is action not words that is needed .
When I talk about words , I am thinking about words like "bench-marking " and "peer review " .
I am sure there are not many people in this Chamber who understand what bench-marking or peer review means .
Do not worry , it is meaningless .
What actually matters is a light touch on the e-commerce directive , a light touch on telecommunications .
Give people the freedom to use the Internet to their advantage , to their benefit , for social reasons , for educational reasons , for the disabled - all the benefits the Internet can give us .
We do not need the heavy regulatory touch of the past .
Please Mr Prodi , ignore your friends on the Left and stick with the new world not the old world .
Mr President , I welcome the Lisbon conclusions .
In fact , seen from the perspective of employment and social policy and against the long procession of summits which preceded it , Lisbon stands out along with Luxembourg in terms of the potential it offers us .
I stress the word "potential " because , as others have said , we now need to look at the follow-up .
Partly that follow-up is institutional .
We will be looking very carefully , for example , at how the broad economic guidelines will be prepared , at just how successful the input of the Social Affairs and Employment Council will be in emphasising the need for employment and social cohesion when it formulates the broad economic guidelines .
Also , we are told that each spring the European Council will consider an overall report to be produced by the Commission that will deal with structural indicators to be agreed .
We wonder who will agree those structural indicators and just how strong the synthesis report to be produced by the Commission will be .
What will the role of the Commission and this institution be ?
Will it , in fact , be largely intergovernmental ?
If so , I think we will be disappointed .
But we are not just concerned about the institutional follow-up .
We are also concerned about the substance .
What proposals , for example , will the Commission come forward with by June this year on social inclusion , as it was challenged to do in the Lisbon conclusions ?
Further than that , how quickly will the high-level group on the future of social protection begin to move into the realm of a convergence strategy for social protection that this House has called for ?
So we are concerned with the substantive follow-up as well .
One point disappoints me - that is the stance of the EPP in all this .
It is trying to pretend that it welcomes the outcome because it is largely liberal and concentrates upon the liberal market aspects .
It should be honest and say that , like us , it has always supported a social market economy .
We welcome the emphasis upon the smooth and efficient functioning of markets .
But as always we want that to be balanced by solidarity and social inclusion .
I hope the group has the political honesty to accept that it continues to support that point of view .
Mr President , congratulations on a particularly focused summit as regards : the clarity of the objectives ; the analysis of the tasks needed to meet those objectives ; and the built-in progress-chasing system .
There was particular emphasis at this summit on the European area of research and innovation , following the excellent communication from Commissioner Busquin .
This is a domain of severe under-achievement in the European Union .
We need deeper knowledge in science and technology .
We have grasped the need to rectify our lack - by means of patent protection , mapping of areas of excellence , tax incentives for research and development , an electronic network for scientists and enhanced mobility for our researchers .
The sixth framework programme will be another tool .
As well as deeper knowledge , we need wider knowledge .
We need people who have been disenfranchised in the areas of science and technology - women , older people and particularly those suffering disadvantage - to be on board in the quest for this wider knowledge .
We need to use the knowledge in better ways .
Of course , we need new products and we need new processes and we need new ideas about how our society should be run .
We also need new sustainable technologies .
The European Socialists are fully behind the leap forward which is possible given the cogent analysis that took place at the Lisbon Summit .
Mr President , many commentators have drawn adverse comparisons between the European Union and the old Soviet Union .
Both have been profoundly anti-democratic , both have seemed opposed to enterprise and wealth creation .
At the Lisbon Summit it appeared that the EU had rediscovered a commitment to enterprise .
Although I have some reservations about references to the social market in the EPP resolution , I am happy to support it .
Let us hope that it is carried into effect and is more than mere soundbites and press releases .
In direct contrast , the President of our Parliament made a remarkable speech in Lisbon which amounted to a virulent and vituperative attack on multinational companies , on liberal economics , on free markets and on the very heart of western capitalism .
I have no doubt that she was prompted by the best humanitarian intentions .
But we must understand that if her proposals were carried out , they would damage competitiveness and productivity
