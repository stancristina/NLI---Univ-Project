of the Union 's citizens , to safeguarding the Institutions .
Therefore , my appeal is very simple : we want the Convention to carry out the Convention 's work fully , autonomously ; we want it to produce , as you have all requested , a clear , systematic draft , because the Convention Assembly represents all the citizens , all the countries , all the institutions of Europe .
And so , just as I am calling on the Convention to express a single , strong opinion and to present it to the Intergovernmental Conference ,
This is a point which warrants close attention on our part as we now prepare to assess the conditions for accession .
It is in this spirit that , to Article 52 of the report , which notes that the conditions for opening negotiations are not yet in place - which is undoubtedly true at present - we prefer the version contained in Amendment No 11 , to which Mr Dell'Alba referred just now , which expresses the positive view , the confidence that the requirements can be met if Turkey carries out the necessary reforms .
It is not the European Union which wants to become part of Turkey but Turkey which wants to subscribe to these shared values .
We must respect the diversities which make up the rich heritage of the European Union , but the limits are defined by respect for the Copenhagen criteria , for the principles of democracy and the rule of law , and these criteria and principles must not just be proclaimed but enforced and lived .
That might have been so in the past , but we now believe that NATO , with the participation of Russia , will gradually have to assume , with a slightly more effective contribution from the European Union , an international policing role , serving a United Nations which has been reformed to safeguard human rights and democracy in the countries of the world .
On the eve of enlargement , I believe this is a significant way of boosting our economy and the political content of our foreign policy .
President-in-Office of the Council , today , something which we hope will be extremely significant is taking place in Sharm El Sheik : a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians , which we hope will be genuinely constructive .
It would seem ridiculous if we were to hear it again now .
We cannot be content with calling for dialogue and mutual understanding and saying that the situation needs to be improved .
I am here to illustrate an oral question tabled by Mr Rocard on behalf of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , who is unable to be here this evening to illustrate it himself .
I fully endorse all the calls to the Member States to achieve a rate of voluntary participation in breast screening programmes by women of over 70 % , a level which no country has yet reached .
I would like to point out first of all that a point is missing from the report produced by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities which is essential if that committee is to be able to claim the title 'Equal Opportunities ' .
The second point on which I would like to focus concerns item 7(g ) of the report in question .
It is therefore important for the Member States to develop a wide network of certified multidisciplinary breast units which meet specific quality criteria .
This is something which , I regret to say , still happens today in many countries .
Only during the final days of the Convention was it understood , at last , that submitting to the terms of the most sceptical governments could have caused the entire venture to fail , and the backing of national and European members of Parliament was sought , as well as the support of the much-maligned Commission , working together with the Presidents and the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Convention .
It is unthinkable that the European Union should continue to participate in major negotiations such as WTO negotiations without any supervision by the European and national parliaments .
The committee of which I am Chairman , and Parliament in general , were strongly in favour of the Convention and advocated the drawing up of a European Constitution .
Firstly , the risk of a change in the institutional balance of powers due to the creation of a new position at the top of the Union , the position of full-time President of the European Council .
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs declared itself to be fully against this , proposing alternative or compromise solutions , but they were not accepted .
I am afraid that that is the price of intense activity which was certainly difficult and , at times , even ineffective , tending moreover towards the lowest common denominator and , therefore , of necessity beset by continual negotiation .
I will not comment on the text of the Treaty but limit myself to one warning and one regret .
I feel that , from a spiritual point of view , this is one of the elements which contribute to the greatness of Christianity and make it a universal point of reference .
At the same time , it is essential that we support the talks at all stages without recommitting the errors of the Oslo Agreement when , after the great handshakes , the two parties were left alone with very different power relations , with the result that violence and oppression prevailed instead of peace .
Mr Sharon has said that three and a half million Palestinians cannot be ruled with military occupation .
We must exert pressure with the instruments we have to bring about the creation of two peoples and two states .
