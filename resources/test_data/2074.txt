It really can be done .
It proved possible for the ordinary detergents , so it must also be possible for these dishwasher tablets .
Okay , that is not what we have decided .
Another important point concerns phosphates .
Madam President , cleaning products are necessary , but they are also a source of pollution .
Secondly , the criteria must be clear .
It must also be clear that under no circumstances may economic criteria come into play .
( NL ) With this report the European Parliament has again gone too far with regulation .
This time Mr Liese has steered a slightly more middle course and made agreements with the Social Democrats .
The reality is unfortunately different .
Mrs Buitenweg 's report proposes a good middle way , one with which we in the Netherlands have acquired good experience .
My party , the Socialist Party in the Netherlands , considers this a mistaken development .
We do not have the time to go into each of these aspects in depth , but it is clear that in these circumstances land reform is necessary , even if that word is taboo .
Fidel Castro is evidently afraid of nothing so much as his own people .
Nor do any negotiations need to be conducted with regard to the Cotonou Agreement .
Democrats of the world unite ... in Cuba and give Castro a fright , by opening not only your wallet but also your mouth .
This violation of the international legal order is unacceptable .
Mr President , I too of course am greatly concerned by the arrest of more than 70 dissidents , among them journalists and leaders of the illegal opposition parties , including the leaders of our two sister liberal parties in Cuba , which are also members of Liberal International , and the excessively long custodial sentences given to them in legal proceedings held away from the public gaze .
By way of clarification , does the Commission consider it conceivable that the European Union will allow Cuba to accede to the Cotonou Agreement as long as the political detainees now sentenced remain in detention ?
Article 2 of this treaty requires respect for human rights and democratic principles .
Should these steps prove to be of no avail , Mr President , then I would plead for a postponement of the ratification of the Euro-Mediterranean Treaty .
But here we clearly have a case of three kinds of human rights violations .
Mr President , in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo , two tribes , the Lendu and the Hema , are in conflict with each other .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , last Friday , Parliament was closed on account of the holiday celebrating the day in 1950 when Robert Schuman made his declaration on the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community .
Over the last year , we have spoken about the situation in Russia on a number of occasions .
The report on cogeneration that we have here is enormously important in terms of a sustainable energy policy in Europe .
It is almost complete , but something still remains to be done : we need to add further - but minor - refinements to Annexes II and III .
Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca has already indicated how essential Amendments Nos 75 , 76 and 81 are to us .
I realise that it has turned out much lower than she proposed .
I think , therefore , that we have to take care not to start the race too fast .
For that reason , I certainly do not wish to deny the necessity of this proposal for a regulation .
Given the contribution that this sector makes to the development of the Community , a support strategy is the least it can expect .
This is hard to understand , since , after all , Galileo is important to maritime safety .
I support the arguments in favour of Galileo .
Incidentally , the Commission itself , in its communication , speaks about the consequences of the war in Iraq for the energy and transport sector .
This is perhaps the most complex subject , both from a legal and a political point of view , with a total of almost 900 amendments - if I include all the committees ' amendments - which were then reduced to about 75 in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
So you have to try and make rules that are workable and realistic .
The first compromises I suggested were based on this .
I linked liability for risk with state-of-the-art defence as a mitigating factor ; 100 % mitigation would mean that the judge could decide not to hold somebody liable .
I therefore also support the amendments that were submitted and that were based on my initial compromise amendments .
I have no doubt that many people , including our green fundamentalists , would like to go much further .
This proposal is also suffering from this .
There has been a limited form of environmental liability based on that principle in the Netherlands for some time now .
The owners of the nuclear power stations only have limited liability , and the State absorbs that .
Nuclear energy is always regarded as a cheap kind of energy , but if all the costs were to be charged on , including the costs relating to environmental damage , the question is whether wind energy and other environmentally-friendly forms of energy would not be equally competitive .
Why am I not happy ?
I wonder whether excluding certain sectors - the oil industry , the nuclear industry - is sufficiently well covered by the international agreements that are in place .
I would have preferred insurance to be made compulsory , because this would be relevant to small - and
