to do so , but I hope you will allow me the liberty of throwing this particular gauntlet down before you .
I have in mind people with sensory or intellectual impairments , wheelchair users , people with limb impairments , elderly people , pregnant women , small children , those accompanying them , and people transporting heavy luggage .
The stabilisation and association process must be a pragmatic policy .
On the subject of Kosovo , ladies and gentlemen , I would nevertheless like to make some things very clear .
We will include a more specific and in-depth response to these same issues in the third report on cohesion we are scheduled to present at the end of next year .
This will have to be taken into account .
All the necessary impact studies must therefore be carried out before these reforms are implemented .
Otherwise they could have a devastating effect in rural areas and cause a huge exodus from the countryside .
We must also remember that a kind of hidden enlargement is taking place as a result of Association Agreements with third countries to the south .
What we are experiencing today is not however in line with that approach .
The last report demonstrated that whilst it is true that the poorest regions have achieved growth in percentage terms , the richer regions have grown at least as much .
We must congratulate ourselves on this .
Lastly , an inconsistency on the part of the Council .
Therefore , Mr President , as I understand that Parliament must be sensitive to our citizens ' concerns , I would ask you to include in our agenda a Commission statement , followed by a debate , so that we can examine the circumstances in which this incident took place , the causes , the measures that the European Union needs to take in order to prevent a recurrence and possible terms for European Union solidarity .
That is why Mrs Hautala was asking to postpone the report for a while to allow the other Members to arrive .
The chairmen of our group have requested this debate in writing .
The routes to Europe from every other continent pass through Galicia .
I would also like to announce , given that this House , in accordance with the new Rules of Procedure , does not allow us to table resolutions , that through the Committee on Fisheries I shall propose a resolution to establish protected European sea-fishing zones in susceptible areas , which will increase the required distances to be maintained between these zones and ships carrying dangerous goods and bring forward the obligation for this type of ship to have a double hull , which is currently laid down for the year 2015 , and I shall call for it to be brought forward to the year 2005 .
Operating at world level , the United Nations ' Committee against Torture publishes its findings every four years and makes recommendations to the signatory states .
Mr President , I thought we were going to hold the debate on the Prestige on Thursday , but I see that all the groups are speaking and I would not want my group , on whose behalf my colleague Mr Jov√© Peres and I shall speak on Thursday , to fail to give its opinion and say what I believe should be done .
We shall once again see ourselves swamped by these images of hundreds of children dying of hunger , without organising a specific debate on hunger in the world .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my group has tabled this question on media concentration and I must say I am very happy that the initiative has spread throughout the House , because we consider that this is not a single-party or single-group issue , but a concern over a matter of constitutional importance to the Union .
In any event , however , Mr President , my group thinks this is above all a democratic issue , because it refers to one of the bases of the system we live in , namely the protection of freedom of speech , which is one of the cornerstones of a democratic society .
European construction has always been a challenge and what I would therefore say is that if the directive was necessary , and it was necessary to address this issue , in 1992 , it is all the more necessary now .
There were four Commissioners I was thinking might appear , and it was a pleasant surprise to see Mr Byrne , who also has to defend us as consumers against this uncontrolled invasion not only of audiovisual messages , which are frequently subliminal , but also against uncontrolled advertising and the monopoly in the field of advertising .
Nevertheless , the rapporteur must acknowledge that there have been enormous difficulties within the Committee on Legal Affairs and , in order to make the negotiation of this directive possible , has had to accept a series of compromise amendments that make up the current text , which has been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs .
The rapporteur has therefore felt obliged to do some rather deft work , trying to bring together positions in order to produce a first text that would reach the plenum in this House .
I even have the impression that there are significant differences between the national delegations within the various parties .
Several studies have demonstrated very clearly the effects of this advertising and the sponsorship of certain sporting events in terms of young people starting to smoke earlier .
Mr President , within the framework of the reform of the CFP which the Commission has decided to present to us in small doses , today we are debating the reports on the 'guideline ' document and the protection of the environment .
