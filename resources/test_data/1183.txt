Does it refer to a medicinal product which has the same structure as existing medicinal products but with a very small change , or does it actually refer to medicinal products with a new chemical structure ?
I therefore call upon you , Commissioner , and the Council to come up with a balanced model for a management board which can work calmly , free from dispute or conflict .
The report appears to represent progress for the free movement of pet animals in Europe too .
I would stress , Mr President , that , as I see it , it is important to address the issue of where the refugees should be received and which States should pay for this when - as , I am afraid to say , sometimes happens - large numbers of citizens of other States flee to our European States .
I have had another dream , Mr President : I dreamt I was watching a play in which the enlarged Europe was taking part .
Today , I want to try and address the situation from a political perspective - if it can be described as such - rather than a technical perspective .
The 2003 budget is proving to be a good one , and I congratulate the rapporteurs on their commitment , all the effort they have put in and the results achieved , thanks , not least , to Commissioner Schreyer , the entire Commission structure , the secretariat and the draftsmen , but I can only emphasise that this is a technical budget in which our role has been primarily that of making the figures add up , lacking as we do the strength , the courage and the will to introduce genuine political measures .
However , precisely because it is a challenge , we must take more decisive , political action , action which is , above all , more visible to all the European citizens .
It may be that we pay little or rather too little attention to the Mediterranean question , it may be that we pay too little attention to the issue of the Middle East .
We go so far as to debate reconstruction , Afghanistan and issues concerning very distant countries , but there is a matter nearer to home which we will soon , all too soon , have to address more thoroughly and much more decisively .
With due regard for the interinstitutional agreement and the Financial Regulation , the European Parliament is about to vote on new pilot project and preparatory action initiatives , which I believe will be useful for European integration .
This will also create employment , for the diversification of farming will certainly pose problems and require new goals to be set .
I believe that this particular medicine would do more harm than the illness , and so I feel that the right direction to take would be that of simplification .
Although there are gaps in the agreement , as the rapporteur himself points out when he says that Parliament has had to make concessions to the Council , it is , at least , a step towards greater democratic control .
We believe that there must be an end to this way of treating the European Parliament and the citizens who elected it , who continue to be disgracefully humiliated by the Council .
The debate will focus on our proposals regarding the ten candidate countries with which we recommend winding up negotiations by the end of the year .
Peace , stability , democracy and the rule of law are the essential ingredients for political stability .
If we succeed in uniting faithfully and speaking with a single voice , we will be able to make a difference in issues such as climate change and managing the impact of globalisation .
Indeed , we must not forget that the ten candidate countries are already growing at a consistently higher rate than the present 15 Member States .
It is now time to address the remaining problems .
Nonetheless , despite our total confidence in the candidate countries , the Commission has undertaken to monitor their final preparations and progress even after accession .
As regards the Structural Funds , too , there appears to be growing consensus on an annual figure of around EUR 25.5 billion for 2004 , 2005 and 2006 .
On all the financial issues outstanding , I expect the Brussels European Council to give the Danish Presidency and the Commission a mandate to conclude the negotiations with a view to a final decision being taken at Copenhagen .
We clearly , therefore , need to make an effort to provide practical , sound , detailed information .
Mr President , yesterday 's and this morning 's meetings and the meeting due to be held in the coming days in Brussels are all trial runs for Copenhagen , aimed at defining the European Union 's position before the last sprint to complete negotiations .
The ten countries have made considerable progress since last year and will be ready in 2004 .
There is a possibility that this may change in 2006 , depending on national feeling .
Lastly , would it be possible to reflect on the need to proceed swiftly with and put more funding into the development of corridor 8 , linking Puglia to Albania , Macedonia and Bulgaria and terminating in Varna and Burgas ?
What will be the consequences of enlargement for southern Europe ?
I will therefore start by responding briefly to Mr Modrow .
Firstly , the need to take the final step as regards the financial framework .
Just now , I read out the figure which the Member States will receive under the cohesion chapter and how that differs from the amount the new countries will receive .
For this campaign , for 28 countries , we
