are being torn apart and that people are sent back to a country that is unsafe for them , where they head for disaster .
Is this because you really believe that Member States are better placed to comply with environmental legislation and to monitor it , or are there simply budgetary reasons for this , namely that you do not have enough officials to check whether the Member States indeed comply with this legislation ?
In other words , if they could complete all the administrative formalities , so that they can start immediately with the real construction work on 1 January 2004 ?
The problem lies in the very fact that it goes unspent , which is an entirely different issue .
Is it not possible , or conceivable , instead of simply leaving these , to conclude an agreement at a given point with a Member State that fails to manage to spend that money ?
For example , the EU has one such delegate for the Middle East .
Mr President , when we talk about next year 's budget , we should not overlook the fact that the budget 's implementation , both now and in the past , has displayed worrying features .
This is why I consider it utterly despicable that a number of fellow MEPs from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy should put pressure on the Council to break through ethical boundaries .
Firstly , with regard to the equal opportunities budget itself , it is important in my view that the money intended for initiatives to promote women 's equal opportunities - initiatives taken by the NGOs - should indeed be able to be allocated in a simple manner .
Commissioner Nielson said a moment ago that the conditions for cooperation in the field of human rights with the ACP countries , Asia and Latin America , are very stringent .
However , these projects are often important , for example , for society in the developing countries .
The Committee on Fisheries insists on this being done .
As far as I know , it is nearly October and the Commission has shown no intention of launching these initiatives .
Considerable investments in infrastructure for the benefit of road transport will not only promote supply , but also demand .
This lowering of subsidy thresholds is also important for extending sustainable transport services .
Indeed , extending capacity has virtually the same effect on transport flows , while the costs are down compared to when a new service is launched .
Roads remain of crucial importance , with a reduction of traffic congestion by more efficient use of them being the starting point .
I had expected the budget to be higher , and that may , in fact , turn out to be necessary .
This ambition must also translate into projects geared towards preventing transport .
Journeys must be avoided and economic growth must be disconnected from transport growth .
Let us not get carried away here .
Failing this , I fear that citizens and governments will not be prepared to invest in new or modern rails .
Firstly , as has been mentioned a number of times today , we are now on the brink of a slow but steady economic downturn .
The first one , which falls within the pillar of adaptability , is quality of labour and quality of the organisation of work .
This is an underdeveloped area .
Finally , it is patently clear that parliaments must be interviewed and called on more extensively in order - how shall I put it - to lower the level of this sort of work across the European organisation .
If , therefore , it is not clear whether the policy works , is it useful to retain this strategy ?
The glass ceiling may have become a little more fragile , but it is still in place .
Lifelong learning often passes them by , while this is , in fact , very important .
This same increase is not reflected in the bodies that have a say in policy .
When , while 42 % of women are in the labour market , not even 25 % of women are represented in the administrative bodies of the unions , a figure dropping below 12 % or 10 % in some administrative bodies , and if , for example , employers ' organisations have 1 % or 2 % of women in their administrative bodies , then I maintain that these social partners are not representative of the labour market .
If we have to wait for the figures , it will be a long time before anything happens .
This is similar to organising a negotiating table with disabled people ; they too would be very sensitive to the issues affecting disabled people , and they would be right .
Have old objectives been confirmed ?
Furthermore , we reached agreement on curbing overfishing , dangerous chemicals , and made multinationals accountable for destructive practices .
This is beyond me .
In our view , the new partnership for energy should have been launched in a better way and should have been discussed beforehand in Parliament .
Since the recent floods , the seriousness of any potential climate change is starting to strike home , but few are aware , let alone convinced , of the need for action .
I would suggest three points that could facilitate communication with the citizen .
Policy on climate could then also become integrated in a climate strategy .
The Sixth Framework Programme for research and Article 169 offer good opportunities in this area .
As far as I can see , though , the results of Johannesburg are too insubstantial , but this is actually more despite rather than thanks to the EU 's efforts
