I believe that the United States , the subject of much criticism in this House , is right on this point , and I feel that Europe must do more in the area of agricultural policy , agricultural protectionism and other forms of trade protectionism .
I , however , believe that there is a middle way between killing and dying , which we must take .
Yes , when will it end ?
I am truly appalled and saddened , for we are all , myself included , responsible for what is happening in the Middle East and for the continuing deaths in the region .
How much credibility can Europe claim , though ?
Do we need any other proof of the intention of the Bush administration to torpedo the ICC ?
We Radicals have believed this for many years , and for many years we have fought , as we are continuing to do now , to bring this Court to birth and to see it grow and gradually acquire universal jurisdiction and be recognised by as many countries as possible .
Yesterday , we learned that , in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention , Washington is not going to allow inspections to be carried out in US firms , despite the fact that a war is about to break out because of a very similar situation .
To this end , the creation of a special trade programme for countries in difficulties and the promotion of agreements with international bodies which can successfully reduce the crisis threatening the stability of the entire continent would seem appropriate .
I feel that this work must continue because the right of petition is related to the citizens ' awareness of their European citizenship .
In view of that , this is an important opportunity , particularly to ensure that greater importance is attached to the views of the European citizens .
Improvement has been possible thanks to the use of new technologies , but I believe that access is facilitated when information on accessibility is distributed as widely as possible .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is with great emotion that I take the floor to speak to this House today .
Bearing in mind the progress achieved by these countries , the track record in implementing their commitments , and taking into account their preparatory work in progress and foreseen , the Commission considers that these countries will have fulfilled the economic and acquis criteria and will be ready for membership from the beginning of 2004 .
Turkey is encouraged to pursue its reform process and so advance its candidacy for European Union membership .
In the space of a decade , we have seen the holding of dozens of transparent , democratic national , regional and local elections , the adoption of thousands of laws and regulations giving shape to the new democracies and incorporating the Community acquis into national law , the training of tens of thousands of civil servants and magistrates to interpret and apply the new legislation and the participation of hundreds of thousands of elected officials , specialists and members of professional organisations in EU-financed training and cooperation projects in order to learn about our policies .
This programme is starting to bear fruit .
Mr President , our objective is still to sign the Accession Treaty in spring 2003 .
I hope that the achievement of the historic objective of unifying our continent will not be jeopardised by this vote .
I believe we can and must discuss this calmly and openly , for the costs have been analysed in detail and they are in line with the resources available .
As regards the costs of enlargement , we know that they are sustainable until 2006 because they are included in the Berlin financial perspective .
In the coming months , we need to conduct a realistic and positive information campaign .
In other words , the time has come for a European constitution .
Here , I am thinking of Russia , Ukraine , Belarus and Moldova .
Without Parliament 's support , we would not have been able to achieve the objectives that we have , and as well as the European Parliament I would like to thank the parliaments of the candidate countries .
Do we want to develop alternatives to weapons , violence and destruction ?
My question is this : since France is part of the Security Council - and it is the only European country to be part of it - is there any form of coordination between the other European governments in respect of the French position ?
Lastly , I feel that Europe must address the issue of combating terrorism and producing legal instruments for prosecuting terrorists , acting with complete honesty towards both the United States and the authoritarian regimes .
Another aspect of the same subject is the mobility of professional labour and professional categories of workers .
We have therefore tabled an amendment before the House with the consent of the rapporteur , Mrs Bastos , which proposes that the Commission and the Council be asked for reassurance on this point .
We cannot afford to let this absurd situation continue any longer .
Madam President , I think that , this evening , we all welcome the fact that we have reached a key point in relations between the European Union and Algeria .
You set great store by the Agadir process set up between the countries which have concluded association agreements with us .
The greater the consideration that the Union gives to these countries , the greater the benefits it might derive from relations too .
In summer 2002 , however , everything changed .
I am also , however , annoyed because , yet again , all this had to go via the Council ,
