It is , however , to be deplored that the report does not even propose to bring the advantages and rights into line with the countries where these are most favourable to pregnant women in work .
Short sea shipping Mr President , Mrs Peijs , I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of her report .
You told us that the Commission was active in meeting the operating costs of NGOs , but what we Members of Parliament want is to ensure that all NGOs , may be supported and funded on the basis of a number of practical projects .
This is precisely why , given that social matters are essentially part of the remit of NGOs , we must make progress in the matter of civil dialogue .
However , two points in my fellow Member ' s report pose a problem for me .
Madam President , I am not about to enter into this debate , but I would just like to draw your attention and my fellow Members ' attention to another matter concerning this city , which is the extremely sensitive and worrying situation of a group of Hungarian gypsies who arrived in Strasbourg on 24 July , following persecution and racial discrimination in their own country , and who are seeking political asylum not only in our country , but also in other European Union countries .
If anyone adopted a unilateral stance on these occasions , it was the British Government which , without any prior consultation whatsoever , adopted a position in favour of therapeutic cloning .
It would be appropriate to speed up the signing of the association agreements , which to date have been signed only with 7 countries .
It is crucial to implement our proposals in order to achieve the necessary revitalisation of the Euro-Mediterranean process .
I do , however , feel that one fundamental matter , immigration , has not been sufficiently taken into account by this proposal for a regulation .
We should be wondering whether accelerated economic liberalisation , in the guise of free trade , is not an aggravating factor in this deterioration .
Too frequently I meet people who have extensive experience of the local association movement , who feel let down by the procedures they have to follow in order to receive subsidies .
We have been working in this area for almost ten years and for the last five , the significant MEDA programme has been available to us .
The truth is , however , that so many preconditions have been left out that people may have the impression that we do not care what anyone thinks .
The issue is of fundamental importance and there is a powerful taboo in this Parliament which we are never prepared to confront : that we have fifteen national diplomatic services , which have been strengthened over years of integration by gradually taking over the competencies of all the national ministries and which have become the real powers , the main power blocking any possible reform of foreign affairs and diplomacy , because it is their power that would ultimately be under threat .
It appears that , last year , the EUR 90 million that were budgeted for this programme were not even used , due to a lack of human resources available to study the dossiers , which are piled up on a desk somewhere in Brussels .
Mr President , throughout the world , development aid is giving way to humanitarian aid .
It specified how the clauses of the Wye River agreement , which had as yet still not been applied , were to be implemented .
The progress achieved owes a great deal to their determination to bring the positions of both sides closer together and move the negotiations forward .
Their leaders must make difficult and courageous decisions and everything must therefore be done to encourage the parties to continue unwaveringly along the path which they have taken in a bid to conclude a global and final agreement .
It is the natural concomitant of the Palestinians ' indefeasible right to self-determination and I am convinced that it is also the best guarantee of security for Israel .
First , it marks the implementation , the belated but full and unconditional implementation of Security Council Resolution 425 and therefore represents undeniable progress in this respect .
Here too , the withdrawal of Israel from southern Lebanon and the gradual restoration of Lebanese sovereignty in the area are steps in the right direction .
The United States alone cannot provide this guarantee .
As for Europe , which intends to support the process , not to take sides , it hopes to be more , much more , than the region ' s banker .
You have all naturally focused in your interventions on the peace process and the negotiations , which are without doubt the key to progress in this region of the Middle East .
At the same time , however , you cannot rewrite history .
What can the European Union do in this context ?
We also want to promote the development of strategic partnerships with our neighbours and with the main regional blocs .
Finally , we shall be convening the European Conference twice , once in Sochaux on 23 November for the ministers of European affairs of the Fifteen and ministers from the candidate countries , and once in Nice on 7 December for the Heads of State and Government , at the opening of the Biarritz Summit .
What is special about the European response , compared with other instruments , is that it can offer a global response to all these dimensions .
During this meeting , as far as the peace process is concerned , the European Union should play a major
