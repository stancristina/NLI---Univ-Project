At the same time it has been possible to hold negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement , the regulations and the strategic guidelines .
I also wish to thank the preceding presidencies and the Commission and Commissioners for their valuable work in carrying out the cohesion policy reforms .
It was not an easy task , as the views and interests of the new and old Member States had to be reconciled .
The committee reached a position which supported the idea of drawing a parallel between these northernmost regions and the peripheral regions .
Cooperation between the Commission , the Council and Parliament ensured that a solution on financing would be reached that would safeguard the position of the sparsely populated regions in the subsequent financing period .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for their wide-ranging and creditable contributions .
Rather , the main aim is to bring about equality between people , for their benefit , and to achieve concrete results .
All these factors will bring the European Union close to the people , as a means of helping them , and they will be an opportunity for making the relationship between the public and the European Union a closer one .
Owing to repeated requests to do so by the Committee on Regional Development , the country holding the presidency at the time once again raised the matter for debate by the Council’s Committee of Permanent Representatives .
This committee at the time rejected the European Parliament’s proposal almost unanimously .
As I understand it , Parliament and the Commission are to make a joint statement on this issue .
The Lisbon objectives for growth , competitiveness , and employment should not , in my opinion , be regarded as opposites within the social and regional dimension .
Finally , may I warmly thank everyone for their high levels of cooperation .     Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for an excellent report .
Top-level research will not be transformed into innovation and employment with money alone , however ; we need to create an innovative climate , which the Commissioner also spoke about .
That will be the main feature of a modern industrial society .
It is a matter of our attitude and willingness to embrace a coherent strategy in order to achieve results .
Actually , the problem is that the differences between the Member States are enormous , and the speed at which things travel varies greatly .
Several special Union programmes , such as Descartes or Aristoteles , have increased the mobility of researchers , but there remain barriers , which actually drive researchers overseas .
By its own example , Finland has shown that it is possible to build competitiveness founded on research and innovation based on a welfare society .     .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thanks go to the rapporteur for an excellent report , which we support .
That is the question .
Nokia is a good example .
In the accelerating and ever more fiercely competitive global economy , European competitiveness can only be maintained by investing in research , development and innovation .
It is as if we had come to a lake and fished it empty and then moved on to another lake and fished that one empty as well .
This sort of European overfishing cannot be thought of as a wise move .
Job satisfaction and employees ’ ability to cope are important , and they can help to ensure that we have an effective and lasting workforce .
Especially worrying is the fact that the demands of work have grown , especially in the female-dominated sectors .
The Commission intends to submit a proposal to the Council shortly , requesting authorisation to negotiate with Montenegro a Stabilisation and Association Agreement based on the negotiating directives of 3 October 2005 , which concerned the former State Union of Serbia and Montenegro .
Here the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first stepping stone , while the ultimate goal of this process is EU accession at a later stage , when each of the countries is able to fulfil the necessary conditions .
This European perspective of the Western Balkans was confirmed by the European Council in the middle of last month .
This autumn the Commission will issue a separate annual report for Montenegro , which will include specific recommendations for the way ahead in the country .
The question by the honourable Member is extremely pertinent and important , especially from the point of view of the Republic of Montenegro and its citizens .
As regards forecasting when Montenegro might be able to meet all the conditions of accession and thus accede to the European Union , I will leave that to the betting agencies .
The honourable Member raises a very critical question .
I can assure him and all of you that the Republic of Montenegro has the same prospects for the ultimate goal of EU membership as the other countries of the western Balkans .
Minority rights are a critical condition .
As regards the level of negotiations with Serbia , until recently we had negotiated with Serbia and Montenegro at two levels , on the basis of the twin-track approach , with the State Union on the issues that fell within the competence of the State Union and with the two republics on the issues that fell within the competence of the two republics .
This method minimises any technical disruption , and with Serbia , for instance , we can resume the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement immediately once Serbia is cooperating fully with the ICTY .     During yesterday’s meeting with the Finnish Government in Helsinki , Mr Barroso said that a free trade agreement with Russia is possible .
Mr President , Commissioner
