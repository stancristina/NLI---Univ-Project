, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution .
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today , before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow .
In this light , the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic .
Consequently , neither the Council , the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State .
Having said that , in my opinion , the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum , the very least we could do .
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party , the French Communist mayors , were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France .
Deciding upon future policy lines , with a view to a new directive , rather hastily , without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners , I feel , runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators .
Member States , i .e . national authorities , are responsible for implementing this strand .
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying , especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union ' s rural development policy .
Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type , which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application .
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment , the source of so much despair , if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , LEADER I was an outright success due , in particular , to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators .
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy ' s report , the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention , the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and , finally , the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes , on the basis of a real partnership .
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme .
It is true , I admit it , and you are well aware of the reasons , ladies and gentlemen .
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF , particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean .
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this , just as you yourselves do .
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion .
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed , provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity .
This is not impossible .
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty , you are now revealing your ultimate goal .
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship .
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable .
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming , with the social distress taking the form of unemployment , misery and crime .
This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs .
In the same respect , given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50 % of all unemployment , the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment .
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions , which are weaker than the nation states , will easily submit to Brussels .
However , I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation .
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States , as suggested in recital of the report .
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials ' with 'government officials ' .
Additives in feedingstuffs Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives .
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and , to do this , the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time .
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation .
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive ?
Last October in Turin , the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean .
However , I should like to ask a slightly different question .
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks .
rapporteur .
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions ' way of working .
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure .
Several million NGO members - millions , I say - recognise in LIFE the Union ' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage .
Thirdly , to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite
