pledge in letters of blood that he will deliver the habitats directive in full within an agreed timetable , is she prepared to assist the region and provide structural funding in such circumstances ?
Mr President , there is no disagreement on the fact that we want to comply with this piece of legislation .
I was surprised to see you quoted in my press as threatening to cut off European funding .
I consider that to be a disproportionate action for what we are trying to achieve .
You will know that in the case of the UK, at a moderation seminar , the Commission agreed a timetable to allow for review and inclusion of additional sites .
In Paris a timetable was set to allow for a revised list to be presented in July with another moderation in October 2000 .
We are determined , after years of foot-dragging by the previous Conservative Government - Mrs Jackson 's party - to meet our requirements in the UK, in good faith , to follow the proper legal and proper consultation to ensure this directive is complied with .
This process is ongoing and I have no reason to believe that any plans submitted for regional funding breached the EU habitats and wild bird directives at this stage .
Therefore , I fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution .
But let us be clear .
Any refusal by the Commission to approve the programme - for example , in Merseyside - thus undermining £2 billion worth of investment , or any other Objective I area , including Cornwall , involving 5 million people in the UK, would actually breach - you said this Commissioner - the well-established Commission principle of proportionality , namely the obligation to pursue the least restrictive way of ensuring compliance with EU legislation - in this case the habitats and wild bird directive .
We therefore need to have a balanced relationship between means and ends .
In the final analysis any breach of EU legislation must actually go the European Court of Justice .
I cannot accept that such a balance means the cutting off of vital lifelines of EU funds to the poorest and neediest regions .
Commissioner Barnier probably said to you today , Commissioner Wallström , that all European programmes should be able to start without undue delay because it can be extremely difficult to make up for lost time later on .
I therefore ask the Commissioner to take collective responsibility for ensuring that Structural Fund programmes are implemented in time .
That is your responsibility as a member of the college .
Mr President , what is at stake in this debate is whether the EU 's commitment to sustainable development in theory , actually means something in practice , whether when push comes to shove , we are prepared to make some very difficult decisions .
Sustainable development is supposed to be about integrating economic development with environmental concerns .
That is what the EU has signed up to in countless treaties from the Rio Earth Summit onwards .
That is what Article 6 of our own EC Treaty obliges us to do - to integrate those policies .
At the heart of this debate is the issue of economic development coming right up against environmental constraints .
We are going to be increasingly faced with hard decisions on this .
It will be a very good test of what our commitment to sustainable development really means .
At a recent plenary session , we talked a lot about coherence in EU policies .
Members from all over this House were rightly emphasising how important policy coherence is , yet here we have an outstanding example of policy incoherence .
That is why the Greens are supporting very strongly this resolution from the Environment Committee .
Mr President , 12 August 1949 is a day which the ancient Romans would have said should be marked with a red stone .
It signified a great step forward for mankind - and yet in the fifty years since , although our own half-continent has lived in peace , more people have died in armed conflict than died in the whole of World War II .
We have failed to spread the lessons and values learned from that conflict .
Too often our own Member States have been parties to conflict , either through the production and sales of weapons , through the production and distribution of landmines or through the temptation - in the words of a great Victorian statesman in my country - to prefer their wars to be fought at a distance and wherever possible in the name of God .
We have failed to educate against the glorification of combat in our own communities .
We have failed to educate against the problems and the scourge of racism and xenophobia .
Yet , thanks to global communications , we have a constant reminder now on our television screens of the terrible effects of man 's inhumanity to man , and of course to woman and child .
We have seen recently in the former Yugoslavia , and now in Chechnya , the terrible effects of armed conflict and we see , furthermore , the effect of governments ' efforts to suppress independent media comment on such conflicts , and the development towards totalitarian government .
If the European Union is to become a community of values - if we are to play a true role in the new global governance , then we need to be promoting the values of the Geneva Conventions not only to our own soldiers and security forces , but also to people in our civilian societies .
We need to be pushing for the creation of a permanent international criminal court and urging our own Member States to sign and ratify the Convention
