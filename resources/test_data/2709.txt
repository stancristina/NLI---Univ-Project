First , we must not leave things in the lap of the Gods , we must not take decisions at the eleventh hour , because we could bring the European Union to what may well be an explosive situation .
For the poorer countries , I think that we need to find ways of making the most of appropriations by introducing suitable mechanisms , incentives and , if necessary , sanctions so that the money actually goes somewhere .
At the same time , and quite rightly too , our European Union has decided to integrate new Member States whose per capita income is demonstrably lower .
Is it logical , is it ethical and , hence , is it acceptable in the final analysis for the second objective to be achieved at the expense of the first ?
It therefore makes sense , it is obvious in my book , to retain the first objective even for the enlarged European Union .
So those who need to should take a realistic view of the new situation , they should approach it with an open mind , they should take a long-term view of the cost-benefit ratio of a revised , ambitious regional policy and they should not disappoint regions which continue to require help from Europe , from the Europe of their dreams , the Europe they believe in .
Mr President , the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities sees the European Commission 's initiative to mainstream action to support equal opportunities between men and women as an important element in this report .
Under the new regulation which applies to the 2000-2006 programming period , mainstreaming equal opportunities for women and men is a priority aim and the Member States are obliged to conduct an ex ante evaluation of their programmes from the point of view of gender equality using indicators and statistics .
One hundred and thirty million mutilated women in the world is a terrifying number .
However , European Union law seriously lacks any teeth , which is why we are calling for legislation to be applied which will make this horrible practice a crime .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano Mart√≠nez-Orozco and start by stressing the political importance and impact of this report , which will of course be even greater if it is supported by a large majority .
It is difficult to quote an actual figure but we suspect that it is much higher than we can possibly imagine .
Obviously , as stated at the World Conference in Beijing , genital mutilation is a violation of human rights and , at a secondary level , it is discrimination , because it only applies to women and girls .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in Nice cannot as yet form a legal basis .
May I say that , a few days ago , the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive to the Council on the adoption of minimum requirements for recognising the status of third country nationals or stateless persons or refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention .
Medical and health workers in at least five countries in the European Union often come into contact with such cases and they must be specially trained and specially qualified to help these people .
The potential for educating and supporting immigrants .
As far as our relations with the third world are concerned , we have already made a serious effort to ensure that development aid is predicated on respect for human rights by governments , especially in this area , and to take account of governments ' efforts to apply policies to educate , train , raise awareness and support women and families .
The last report on employment tell us that most of the Member States have given up trying to right this wrong and that this issue is missing from the social dialogue agenda in most countries .
Our role , your role is a difficult one ; we must convince public opinion and women themselves that all these issues are interlinked .
Mr President , I too should like to make a point of congratulating Mrs Smet , whose report demonstrates her personal knowledge of and experience in this matter .
As you know , the fourth line of action in the strategy on employment , which relates to equal opportunities , has dealt with the issue of unequal pay since the strategy on employment was first implemented back in 1999 .
The question which arises here is what tools does the Commission have at hand to make this assessment .
We need a statistical analysis of the ratio between men and women as regards the hourly wage for paid employees working longer than 15 hours .
In some Member States , there is a huge gap between the date on which data is collected and the date on which the final results are published .
The second basic point concerns the guidelines for 2002 .
We have divided the priorities which need to be set by the programme into five individual areas so that we can study the question of equal pay and move on to the question highlighted by several lady Members , that is , the need for an integrated strategy .
Mr President , the question of harassment in the workplace relates directly to respect for fundamental personal rights , the right to dignity and the right to participate in economic and social life on equal terms .
If we bear in mind that , according to the statistics , the number of people which make up these vulnerable groups is over 8 % , the political dimension is easy to see .
At the same time , there are numerous groups which fall victim to harassment , from women and the disabled to foreigners and people of a different faith .
In addition to measures to
