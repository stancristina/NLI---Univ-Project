Both more reliably and automatically and also , as Mr Beysen says , "internationally as well" .
The final area , Commissioner , is to look at ways in which we can work with you as a Parliament to speed up the approval of the process .
Surely it should not be taking this amount of time to work on largely technical areas .
Mr Beysen was talking about the way that Parliament has been working internationally on some of these issues .
Surely we should be setting our own house in order first .
If you want a special committee within the Internal Market Committee to look at small business issues , simplification issues and statistical issues , then ask us to work with you and for heaven 's sake let us not have to consider these proposals again when we had to wait three years to make serious inroads into what ought to be a comparatively simple area of progress .
Mr President , the challenge confronting us is how Europe can do more for crisis prevention and management , and the proposals which we are debating are the only way we can achieve that more effectively .
I congratulate the Commissioner on the lead he is setting for greater efficiency not only in aid , but also in this area .
I thank him particularly for his undertaking to examine my proposal for a European public security force , because there are several organisations across Europe which could offer experience , not least the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland .
I want to address a word to people in London .
It is reported in the newspapers that certain people in London are saying they would end the EU 's involvement in the defence process .
To London I say : you cannot do that ; be realistic !
You could possibly end the UK 's involvement , but you cannot stop what the European Union is doing .
Please face reality .
This is a valuable new development in which we are involved and which we are debating .
We must try to shape it positively .
I look forward to further debate on these questions , being Parliament 's rapporteur on the Rapid Reaction Facility that we will be dealing with later in the year .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mrs Lalumi√®re on producing a report which is a fine balance of the arguments and interests involved .
It is a remarkable achievement .
I also wish to congratulate the Council on being able to establish at the last summit the principle of the headline goals .
It is important to realise the significance of these headline goals because for once , instead of spending years discussing institutions , the European Union has put results before means .
That , as we are already seeing , will drive forward the agenda very rapidly .
If we are to succeed in our ambitions at a price we can afford , we have to ensure that we get better value for money out of defence and , in particular , defence industries .
We need a strong , competitive European defence industry .
Notwithstanding the takeovers and mergers in the private sector , there is still far too much fragmentation in this area .
We still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity .
The Western European Union Armaments Group , for example , moves very slowly on the basis of consensus .
Even the six EU Member States which two years ago signed a letter of intent on cooperation have still not agreed a framework agreement to implement that letter of intent .
We clearly need more urgency in this area and we need a single , coherent framework within which the defence industry can cooperate .
That is why I am disappointed to hear what the presidency said about the intention to continue with the work of the Western European Armaments Group .
I believe the pillar structure of the EU provides us with the best opportunity for a framework within which industry can operate .
Pillar II can provide the common positions on things like arms exports , and we could be working towards a European armaments agency which brings together OCCAR and the Western European Armaments Organisation .
The Commission has a crucial role in this .
The last Commission drove forward the agenda on restructuring the defence industries : there were two communications .
This Commission has been completely silent on this issue .
It is as if it is running scared from confronting the implications of its role as the guardian of the Treaties .
We have to ensure that the single market applies to defence industries as far as possible , and that Article 296 only applies in those areas specified in the Treaty .
I would urge Commissioner Patten to follow in the footsteps of Commissioners Bangemann and van den Broek to drive forward the Commission 's responsibility in delivering an effective and competitive European armaments industry in order to back up the measures we are taking in the political field .
Mr President , we are regularly reassured that the measures being put in place under the common European security and defence policy are intended to strengthen NATO .
This is somewhat disingenuous .
If this was the intention there would be no need to set up the separate structures which largely exclude the Americans and Canadians and marginalise reliable European allies such as Turkey .
Over the past five years NATO has already restructured for the specific purpose of facilitating European action should the alliance as a whole not wish to be engaged .
But this apparently is not enough .
The real desire is to create something separate from NATO .
Of course we want to see the Europeans reforming and enhancing their military capabilities but I fail to see how the continued reductions
