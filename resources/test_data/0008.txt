Mr President , I believe that we should also increase cooperation between air and rail transport , and that airports should be integrated into the trans-European networks .
I also believe that what we have done regarding the matter of security is an immediate response concerning those elements which will restore passengers ' confidence in the safety and security aspects , which are obviously so essential if the public is to regain confidence .
There are people on the margins of society who are not poor , and not all poor people are excluded , but the area of overlapping is a very large one .
Given the uncertainty about the precise position of the President of the United States , I propose correcting the second part of paragraph 2 to say "including the search for effective procedures " instead of " the establishment of existing procedures " .
It does not , however , because three Members of the Union are not part of the euro zone .
Consumers are not the only ones to bear these unjustified bank charges : they have a particularly serious effect on SMEs that export their products and the competitiveness of these companies suffers for no good reason .
Incidentally , I still do not understand how someone can advocate a liberalisation that seeks to bring prices down and which takes the form of promoting the 'least costly ' sources of energy and , on the other hand , complains about being increasingly dependent on external sources as consumption increases ( or is not decreasing ) due to the fact that prices are very ( or too ) low .
Whereas only a public service policy can meet social and environmental requirements and guarantee " sustainable development " in this economic sector .
Such statements , however , carry little weight with Vivendi , Suez and other huge corporations , who have appropriated the water 'market ' for themselves in order to squeeze enormous profits from it , with the blessing of the State .
This position does consider the interests of the public but is unpopular with the Union des Industries Chimiques , a French employers ' organisation which , in a letter to Members of the European Parliament , protests about the constraints that we are attempting to impose on companies that manufacture or sell chemical products .
And there is not even any discussion of cancelling the debts that are strangling these countries .
I do not really need a minute , Madam President .
Let us open up our eyes , then , and cast off the blinkers that force us to see only roads , and we will finally see the entire European network of stations and railway lines that are almost completely overlooked in terms of providing piggyback transport .
Nigeria is proof , Mr President , that the wealth and value of a nation are often measured according to the priority that it gives to human rights , and especially to women , children and workers .
Over 200 civilians were killed in this massacre and houses and market stalls were burned down .
Therefore , I feel that we can be proud of the decisive role played by the European Union action in the development of democracy in these countries .
Moreover , the American embargo on relations with the island is preventing it from buying the food and medical supplies so desperately needed by the people of Cuba .
I mean that the legislation regulating them is insufficient and that they are cheap to buy .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the areas to be discussed at the European Council in Brussels-Laeken on 14 and 15 December will include the future of the European Union , European security and defence policy , enlargement , the fight against terrorism , the area of freedom , security and justice , the general situation of the EU and its prospects , employment and social cohesion , headquarters and various bodies and agencies , and lastly , external relations .
The Convention will begin its work as soon as possible under the Spanish Presidency and will complete its proceedings by the European Council in June 2003 .
In this regard , the Council took great interest in Mrs Kaufmann' s report on the White Paper on European Governance .
At the European Council of Laeken , the Heads of State and Government will be given the opportunity of sending out a few messages to the candidate countries .
The Union ' s response to the challenge posed by the tragic events of 11 September has shown the political will of Member States to make progress in this area .
If necessary , it will issue an opinion on the situation in Afghanistan , the Balkans and the Middle East .
In doing so , we are introducing further bureaucracy , and I do not think there is any point , Mrs Theorin , in discussing transparency , governance , co-decision and democratic legitimacy , when we cannot even talk about electing the Commission by direct universal suffrage .
That is why I support the guidelines contained in the White Paper and the Kaufmann report .
We must , of course , ensure there is greater transparency in the Council ' s work , we must encourage the European Parliament and the national parliaments to play a greater role in the legislative process .
So , with only a few days to go before Laeken , it is most certainly a welcome commitment , one that I heard voiced by almost all Members .
I think that this is quite a legitimate question , even if I must reiterate that , in our proposal , we took up the proportions that were used in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
The possibility for the Convention to present various options must enable us to hold a debate with
