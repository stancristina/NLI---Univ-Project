The cornerstone of this pre-accession strategy was the partnership of March 2001 , with principles , priorities and interim objectives which would allow Turkey to meet the Copenhagen criteria .
A new government has taken over power , with strong support from the people .
At the Copenhagen Council , the Union itself recognised that the new Turkish Government was resolved to proceed with further reform and it urged it in particular to deal quickly with all the weaknesses which continue to exist in the field of political criteria , in relation both to legislation and to the application of legislation .
Within this framework , the Union encouraged Turkey to actively continue the reform process .
We hope that this prospect will act as a catalyst and encourage Turkey to adopt and apply the necessary reforms .
A revised national programme for the adoption of the acquis , with clearly defined targets , is expected to constitute Turkey 's planned response to the new partnership .
At this point , I should like , guided by the recently adopted revised partnership , to refer with greater clarity to the main issues that we expect Turkey to deal with up to its evaluation in 2004 .
What I want to say is that , as we see it , there are two basic issues for promoting Turkey 's essential candidature status .
The Union has also publicly referred to this issue and emphasised that there cannot be practices that result in deviations from the Copenhagen criteria and we have noticed that there have recently also been corresponding examples with reference to internal and/or external policy .
It is important that we know this ambition , for the realisation of which quite a lot still needs to be done .
Nor has the right been safeguarded for all Turkish citizens , irrespective of their ethnic origin , to enjoy full cultural rights .
All these issues are elements in an imperfect reform process in which reforms formally adopted have not always resulted in practice in the improvement to the situation which had been hoped for .
They also cover the important chapter of justice and internal affairs , in which we are looking forward to improved cooperation from the Turkish side and are promoting the conclusion of a Community readmission agreement .
The Secretary-General has pointed out that , if a solution is to be found , there must be genuine political commitment to his proposals and a clear timetable for completing negotiations .
Within this framework , the priority of the Turkish partnership to support efforts to find an overall solution to the Cyprus question through the good offices of the Secretary-General and negotiations based on his proposals continues to be of decisive importance .
But our common will is to achieve something along these lines by 1 May 2004 .
The Union and we , as the Presidency and as a Member State , support the need to find a solution on the basis of the Annan plan .
As far , then , as the question of a peaceful solution to the differences is concerned , a change in the atmosphere of Greek-Turkish relations has already been noted in various sectors .
The improved climate has resulted in increased bilateral exchanges and a series of agreements .
In closing , allow me to welcome once again Parliament 's acute interest in the integration strategy for Turkey .
We are looking forward to the necessary progress being achieved by the deadlines set , so that we can safeguard a positive and auspicious future for relations between the Union and Turkey .
In other words , something that should have been done a long time ago , instead of the practice to date of avoiding any candid description of reality for various reasons which serve political and other interests , by demonstrating a poorly conceived tolerance , by having two sets of weights and measures and by citing misleadingly labelled arguments , such as the strategic importance of Turkey , the beloved pretext of its trans-Atlantic protectors , or the alleged need to send positive messages to Ankara - as we heard for the umpteenth time just now - and so on .
Mr President , I should like to take advantage of the debate on Mr Oostlander 's exceptional report on the accession of Turkey to the European Union to state once again that I remain a firm supporter of its accession .
I believe that the economic and cultural development of Turkey as the consequence of the freedom of action of its citizens under the rule of law will have exponential benefits for Turkey itself to start with , for the European Union certainly and , without any shadow of a doubt , for rapprochement , understanding and cooperation on the part of the countries and peoples neighbouring Turkey .
I have no particular regard for or trust in nation-saving soldiers the world over , who see any free expression or action as a military target to be neutralised using every means , not excluding , of course , bans , imprisonment , torture and natural extermination .
This is an opportunity for the Turkish people to enjoy a smooth transition , without sacrifice and tragic consequences , to a fully operational parliamentary democracy , a democracy with all its accompanying parameters .
Working together , we can help create a better world for everyone .
A preliminary discussion of the subject could be held in the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June .
Just as the development of the foreign and security policy is allowing the Union to deal more efficiently with recent events , including its cooperation with the United States in the Middle East , Afghanistan or the western Balkans , in the field of the European security and defence policy , improving European military capabilities
