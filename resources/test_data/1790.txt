But they can be solved .
Furthermore , we have justified and still unresolved misgivings about the safety shortcomings of the Krsko atomic power station , which posed a genuine threat to the area around the Austrian border , especially during the struggle for independence .
We shall of course be voting for this agreement , although there are many things that must be asked of the Slovenian government .
There is one thing , though , that seems to me to have received too little coverage in this debate - the need to provide more information and instruction for the citizens of the Union as to what this agreement actually means .
Nor , of course , the fact that it was yet another attempt to persuade the world , and especially the USA , that a common European Union foreign policy is not just hot air .
Mr President , Commissioner , on 13 May the European Council adopted an action programme for Russia .
I hope that we in the European Union will be able to make our contribution to those efforts .
Even so , at least in my view , great strides have already been made towards increased stability .
In brief , the European Union is only one small player in the massive Russian social scene , with limited influence .
Since 1974 there has been a Standing Committee on Economic Policy , working towards the Ecofin Council .
Madam President , the hopes expressed in the White Paper on Growth , Competitiveness and Employment of creating 15 million jobs by the end of the millennium and the hard facts of today are worlds apart .
The Commission should have no problem accepting the amendments suggested by the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment .
First , as chairman of the Intergroup Working Group on Minority Languages , I would like to thank you most sincerely for your support for the maintenance of the budget line and its possible topping-up .
I warmly thank Mrs Gradin and her staff for their efforts in this respect .
But what is important is that the same conditions should apply to the Commission inspectors as to the national ones , i .e . , in particular that if they find suspicious circumstances they must have access to all information and facilities and their administrative reports must constitute admissible evidence in the same way as those drawn up by the national administrative inspectors .
As the fifth Irish presidency on this question , I hope that the Irish presidency will bring this second additional protocol to the Convention on the protection of the EU 's financial interests to a successful conclusion .
It is not one of the great moments in Parliament for us to come and discuss the second supplementary protocol ; but the actual issue which has forced us to talk about it should in fact make all the alarm bells ring in every political camp of this House and also in the national parliaments and governments !
It is not possible to incorporate penalties in this draft regulation ; nor do we want to delay it .
Oh yes , it did put one , but a minor one .
Even if we may not manage to get this through here because the Socialists do not support us , we will certainly manage to have it included in the motor-oil programme or in later Euro-3/Euro-4 legislation .
The EPP will also support Amendment No 5 concerning two - and three-wheeled vehicles .
After the Linkohr report I heard that the Commission had somehow or other produced a new proposal that was not , however , any different from the first one , although our colleague 's report was different from the Commission proposal .
That you or one of your representatives went to the Socialist Group last week is not officially known to the European Parliament .
The European Parliament has also given its views on a number of task forces .
I think this deserves praise and that the House should applaud those concerned .
It is indeed schizophrenic for us to call for subsidies and then decide not to enter the few pennies required in the budget !
Only ten days ago Josu√© Giraldo , Chairman of the Human Rights Committee of Meta , was murdered .
Like you , we mourn the death of the human rights campaigner Giraldo , about which you express dismay in recital F. Incidentally he also worked with the Misereor campaign , which gives a great deal of money for Colombia .
That is a cruel , scandalous and , in my view , unsuccessful strategy .
Mr President , anyone who turns Christian churches into mosques is committing an attack on the freedom of worship and freedom of conscience !
Incidentally , if I may make a brief comment , the Greens are not in it .
We are very pleased to see these indications , but of course as they stand they are not sufficient and we would like to wait for the referendum in order to see clearer indications , simply so that the European Parliament can take a more definite decision , so that we can support the interim agreement and , at a later date , also the partnership and cooperation agreement .
I take my hat off to this young parliament !
By using this article we would be sure of being able to tackle the question of tourism globally , at European level , without infringing the principle of subsidiarity , as in the case of industry .
But most particularly I am thinking of the need to improve the quality of European tourism ; in order to do so it is quite vital to improve the training level in this sector .
Even if President Clinton has suspended parts of the Helms
