, the Commission 's only intervention was to assess whether the agreement is compatible with the Treaty .
Mr President , the Commission has done everything possible to present all the proposals that could be put forward in the context of agreements within the Commission and in the Member States , to give a powerful impetus to the use of renewable energy sources .
That is why we first produced the Green Paper on renewable energy sources and later the White Paper with a specific plan of action , which we believe can really move things along .
In addition , however , I would remind you that in the directive on the internal electricity market , the Commission proposed that there should be privileged access for renewable sources to the network .
First of all , to discourage and punish all those engaged in the sexual exploitation of the young .
Here , in some cases , changes in the laws in some Member States are needed .
In any event , what we must and will persist with - alongside the contribution from the industry and of course the cooperation of the 15 Member States and the governments of third countries , mainly those where the phenomenon is rife - is our joint effort to develop a tourism ethic and at the same time to find ways in which , through economic aid , we can contribute towards economic development so as to improve the standard of living of the population , especially young people , create new jobs , and in that way prevent escalation and combat the phenomenon .
In any event , the Commission makes every effort to respect the framework proposed by the directive and to comply with it in practice .
Implementation must take place in ways which the European Union itself sometimes does not allow to proceed .
Mr President , I too - together with the rest of the House as we have seen - can only welcome the report by Mr Watts and applaud his work , as well as the amendments he has tabled and which I believe Parliament will approve tomorrow by a large majority .
Let me remind you that , until the end of the 1980s , the Commission was literally bombarding Parliament with proposals for measures to support European shipping .
However , there are no positive measures on behalf of shipping .
Because without European shipping there will be no European seamen .
A sure way of making the European seaman disappear as a species is for there to be no ships under European flags .
Here today , we are doing just about the same thing .
Instead of criticising the European Union and the Member States for lack of substantive will , substantive political will for a peaceful solution of the Kosovo problem , we are rebuking the European Union 's bodies because they have not yet taken military action .
Mr President , I must say , and I must remind Parliament and the Council and the Commission , that three Balkan countries , one of them a Member State of the Community - Greece - and two candidates for membership of the European Union - Bulgaria and Romania - have ended up by agreeing on joint action concerning the issue we call Kosovo .
But the solution to the Kosovo problem is above all else political , and if a military intervention of any sort takes place - I will not go into details , because I am not a military man ; my only military experience was when I did my national service , so I will leave that to the Council and the Commission - it will have to be an action stemming from a predetermined policy .
One would expect some signs of solidarity and generosity .
I believe this is an unacceptable situation , one which fails to respond either to the climate or to the great challenges facing the European Union .
Whatever happens from this point on in that province of China cannot but be influenced in one way or another by that historic fact .
Mr Cushnahan , what kind of electoral system is there in your country ?
Are they supremely democratic or are they anti-democratic ?
That is naive and indeed suspect , because it shows that all the concern about what is happening in Hong Kong is just viewed as a springboard , a tool for us to meddle in China 's internal affairs and bring about changes which suit our own purposes .
Mr President , I listened to the first answer given by the President-in-Office and to the one she has just given .
The report refers to such matters and we considered that we were fully competent to intervene , debate and criticise , and the Commissioner praised those points .
So how can we be Pontius Pilate in one case , while in the other we jump in with both feet , as it were , into the internal affairs of a country ?
Mr President , the discrepancies between the different prices are so great that we have instances such as this : people who work in Germany , young working people who bring to Greece a car which their parents have bought , are in the end forced to give it up to the Greek state because they cannot afford the huge tax imposed by Greek law .
And , in any event , is there a date beyond which we will be able to say that the prices of cars will be comparable throughout the European Union ?
The European Parliament has repeatedly called for the Council and the Commission to adopt drastic and effective measures to do something about the international networks of modern white slavers , the slave traders of today .
