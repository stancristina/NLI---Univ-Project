Strengthening democracy is better done by upgrading the role of national parliaments .
Many people may well be wondering why the agricultural policy should now start subsidising a branch of agriculture which has not received any grants to date , for floriculture has hardly benefited from any European grants .
That is peanuts .
We all know , certainly in the Netherlands , that the flower sector is the branch of agriculture par excellence which is the biggest polluter of all , where enormous quantities of pesticides are used , where admittedly not oil but natural gas is wasted and where now we are expected to approve money being thrown at it in scandalous fashion to promote the industry !
Flowers can be imported without any protection .
And that applies to both national and European civil service .
Programmes for career advancement for women and agencies to monitor policy are very important ; job descriptions should be re-assessed and the principle of seniority in promotion should be replaced by the principle of merit .
That brings me to the Kalanke ruling of October 1995 .
Ladies and gentlemen , experience has shown , particularly in the new Member States , that positive action and equal opportunities plans act as a catalyst in the civil service .
They set off a chain reaction in the specific sector and as a result in the rest of society .
Mr President , do not allow the Commission to hide behind one ruling of the Court of Justice , namely the Kalanke ruling , but let it have a free rein , let it take the initiative and together with us call on the Member States to ensure that women occupy top positions among the decision makers to shape society of the twenty-first century .
Selection tests for the police , for example , which expect women to run a hundred metres in ten seconds - I think that can only be done if Marylin Otty were to apply to the police force .
Positive action plans are aimed at eliminating discrimination against women in society and in the world of work .
Then you find yourself in the process that women are deemed unsuitable for the top positions because they have not had the necessary experience .
Now I am not going to advocate an increase in the birth rate here but would point out that we are facing an enormous ageing of the population and more and more women are choosing not to have children , simply because the circumstances are not right .
And that means , however uncomfortable this may be , that if you want to treat women on the same footing , including in the civil service , then men will have to make room for them , for otherwise nothing will change .
Such action is not in breach of the Treaty .
If a decision on sending an intervention force is not made within the next few days then it will be too late .
Second , as a Parliament we have been requesting for years new proposals on driving and resting hours including working time proposals .
I would refer you to Dutch legislation in which summary proceedings can be used to ask an independent judge to rule on the legality of actions .
The report which is in my name confirms this conclusion .
That change is largely due to this House and this report has played a useful part in this process .
A more realistic worry would be that the euro might be too hard at the cost of the Union 's competitive strength and employment situation .
But the real reason is that EMU must be implemented at all costs according to the planned schedule .
Other European countries have other kinds of problems .
And that brings me to the Metten report and the following question .
And then the stability pact also clearly stipulates a maximum of 3 % deficit unless under exceptional and temporary circumstances .
But to assure the necessary certainty and a stable currency and to prevent endless discussions after the event these still unclear concepts must be properly defined .
In other words , he more or less said : meeting the criteria in 1997 is not sufficient .
The fifth framework programme should focus on the competitive strength of European industry , and especially of the small and medium-sized firms .
Europe produces a great deal of new knowledge , but production of knowledge is not enough .
Mr President , the real basis for the Commission 's Green Paper on the Citizens ' Network is our own initiative report on urban transport and congestion of June 1992 .
We were in fact ahead of our time .
The TENs will only make sense if we can build a reasonable link up to and from the major European transborder infrastructure .
Safety should speak for itself but it cannot be said often enough that the number of traffic victims is unacceptably high .
Mr President , this proposal for a regulation is influenced by the continuous liberalisation of cabotage transport of persons .
The rapporteur 's intention to delete Article 4 is completely illogical .
On Monday morning there was a tail-back of around 300 km in the relatively small country of the Netherlands despite the fact that at the eleventh hour an agreement was reached which meant the planned rail strike was called off .
Even for us it is sometimes difficult to stick to the main points .
The elderly will increasingly turn to public transport .
Seldom has there been such a ridiculous sniggering session as we have just witnessed .
And that approach is contained in Mr Wijsenbeek 's report , despite the many fine points .
When we talk about the trans-European networks then it is also sensible to see the connection between these four or five Green Papers
