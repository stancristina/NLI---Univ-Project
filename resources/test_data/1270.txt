to confuse education with training .
The primary purpose of education is not to prepare people for the job market but to prepare them for a life which is fulfilling in every way .
In an increasingly flexible or precarious working environment people will be thrown back on their inner resources at many times in their lives and social cohesion is partly dependent on such personal resilience .
We only have to look at what happens to those who are thrown out of work or who are excluded from the job market .
So when we are assessing the quality of education , we want to see if we can develop people who have self-esteem and confidence , who can communicate effectively , who can look behind the information for the hidden message , who can question , who can work as part of a team and independently , and who are creative , resourceful and have an appreciation of the wider world and their responsibility to it .
I also think that when we are looking at the quality of education we need to see if it is delivering real equality of opportunity for all of those within the system or whether it is doing , as society does , so much to exclude people on grounds of a poor background or their colour or whatever .
So in our comparisons and benchmarking we have to look beyond narrow league table approaches .
After all , every football team in a league depends upon the level of investment and the selection of the very best .
It does not necessarily improve the performance of all .
I am glad to see that we are recognising the importance of involving pupils themselves in the development and assessment of our educational system .
We cannot expect to develop fully rounded and responsible individuals if they are not encouraged to be constructive and articulate about this major component of their lives .
After all , education properly done is a collaborative adventure and we know we have a lot to learn from each other .
That is why I welcome this report .
Mr President , I welcome this document and fully support the European Parliament and Council decision to promote cooperation and quality evaluation in school education .
I particularly welcome the emphasis on social inclusion .
Education is an important , indeed crucial , part of society .
Our education has an impact on all our lives and our communities as well .
Recent reports , as those of us from the UK are aware , have tended to criticise the teaching of children at a very young age as this could prove damaging .
It would therefore be good to compare and contrast with other European models , within limits of course , as my colleague Mrs Lambert has already stressed .
Spain , for example , attaches great importance to social inclusion and developing personalities , working in teams ; integrating .
These are placed higher on the agenda than academia and at an early age .
I also fully agree with better integration between parents , pupils and teachers and the many community players who rightly want to play a role in education and its development and achieve , as a result , the idea of the school as the community .
It will also provide an excellent opportunity to encourage schools in the different regions to share in good practices .
Partnerships between different countries are so important , as indeed are partnerships not only between countries but between rural and urban links .
This is part of a very important twinning concept and philosophy that is well established in Europe and is proving such a success throughout all our communities .
Networking is so important .
I stress that the sharing of good practices and the sharing of information between the different schools in Europe should not develop into a competitive practice .
We should at all costs discourage any attempt to create European league table of schools similar to that in the UK that has proved so detrimental .
I welcome the report , it is a positive paper and one that we can build on to create better educational networks within the European Union .
Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs van der Laan for giving the Committee on Budgetary Control and the European Parliament a model on which to base future discharge reports .
From the outset she was very clear that she wanted to concentrate on a few areas where we wanted to see real improvement .
They were clearly set out last year .
Now we have a follow-up to check that those points have been implemented .
We shall be following her lead in not supporting the amendments tabled because we want to keep to that clear-cut approach .
On the whole , the Commission has responded positively , and this now has to be set within the context of the more general Commission reform .
We are pleased that the Commission will present annual activity reports for each Directorate-General but , for that to work effectively , we need to know the targets for these DGs very soon .
Work on staff policy has also gone ahead but things seem to be moving very slowly .
We appreciate the sensitivity of negotiations on staff issues but we and the European public will soon lose patience if the talking does not stop soon and the action start .
The CAP and Structural Funds are the areas where most mismanagement problems lie in the EU , partly due to the scale of the finance received by these areas .
That is why it is critical that we , as the controlling and accountable body , have access to information on the financial management of these two areas .
We look forward to receiving regular reports from the Personal Representatives Group .
