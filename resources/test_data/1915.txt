should be progressively defined and delimited at European level , with the introduction of similar measures to those currently in force , for instance , in Venice harbour .
However , although we are more aware of the dangers related to illegal immigration , that does not mean that the Union has practically implemented all the most effective measures for opposing it , such as , for example , readmission agreements with third countries , which must progress much faster and be much more practical , given that - as we are all aware - the Union has strong tangible grounds for putting pressure on these countries .
Mr President , there is certainly no lack of suggestions when it comes to asylum policy , suggestions which can provoke feelings either of fear or of excessive generosity and tolerance .
We believe that it is possible to respect human rights while pursuing a proper policy of combating illegal immigration .
Precisely because it understands their value , it is able to display a great passion for social values when it matures , displaying a strength and commitment which are not limited to the quest for results at all costs , and that is why these Members are fully entitled to sit in this Chamber and are worthy representatives of the European Union .
I believe that the Commission 's concern continues to focus too heavily on the first point and too little on the second , the distortion of competition .
Then , in Italy , there is the case of a major television company such as the RAI , financed with huge sums of taxpayers ' money , which competes in every way with other television companies as a commercial channel .
Mr President , this is my customary Christmas present to the Presidency , to the officials who assist the Presidency , to the interpreters , to all those who work in this Chamber and devote so much time during the year to listening to Mr Fatuzzo 's explanations of vote .
I am delighted that the Commissioner has been able to inform us that a positive solution to the problem of creating a definition has now emerged .
Classifying mountain regions as sensitive zones in the treaties would also give a strong signal with this in mind .
It is not so much the signatory states to the Alpine Convention that have not done their homework , as the Commission , which has signed only three protocols and for cost reasons has even stopped turning up to meetings .
I think there is an urgent need for action here .
If you add these names to the few Members present today in this Chamber , you have the mountain people , the champions of the mountains , if I may be so bold as to use that phrase .
First and foremost , they have to convert their diversity from the weakness it has been hitherto into added value in order to start to exploit the genuine potential they offer .
This article calls upon the European Union to reduce and avoid development divides between the regions of Europe .
All we have to do is give them a hand : they are not asking for aid , they are just asking for a little attention and , as I said just now , for the specific nature of their situation to be recognised .
In the past two years , with the reoccupation of the autonomous territories , the destruction caused by the Israeli tanks and bombings has been huge .
This is annexing of territory , for the Qiriat Arba settlements are illegal .
Israel can no longer be allowed to continue to violate all international legislation , inflicting pain and suffering not just on the Palestinians but on its own people too .
We feel it would be more appropriate for this item to be addressed in a more formal , more in-depth manner than will be possible in a last-minute topical and urgent debate .
In any case , what I wanted to say with regard to North Korea is that , as I said just now , we believe it is important that this House should hold a debate and issue a statement on the withdrawal of North Korea from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , and that the Council and the Commission should also issue statements .
I hope that due consideration will be given to certain concerns expressed in committee by myself and other colleagues and that a number of amendments correcting and clarifying the text adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will be adopted , so that misapplication and unilateral measures which would harm our cause are avoided .
In conclusion , I trust that the Members will reflect on the points I have made and that there will be broad consensus in tomorrow 's votes .
We must resist this temptation at all costs and , to this end , I hope that the Convention will take on board the lengthy debate which has taken place in Europe , particularly in the Council of Europe , on the matter .
Moreover , as Mr Duff has already said , it would appear necessary to make it easier for the citizens to approach the constitutional court and to identify the channels open to them , and not just where the regions are concerned but in cases of violations of the citizens ' fundamental rights too .
I believe it is right for the proposal on the Union 's powers not to interfere with the systems of the individual States .
We cannot , however , disregard the fact that some national Constitutions confer major legislative powers on the regions , and the Convention will have to recognise this , although without creating privileges , without upsetting the internal market and without removing the need for a political Europe
