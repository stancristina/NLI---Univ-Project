In what way is the Council prepared , by using its contacts with China , to bring the matter of trafficking in women in China to the fore ?
I assume that such contacts will be established very quickly .
The honourable Member should be made aware that two decisions have been adopted in application of Article 20 of the EC Treaty .
The United Kingdom is providing consular services in Mecca during the Haj pilgrimage .
The decision that I referred to previously stipulates that if the person seeking consular help is a citizen of one of the Member States of the European Union , the diplomatic or consular representation from another Member State shall treat the person seeking help as if he were a citizen of the Member State represented by the embassy or consulate .
This is at least stated in the decisions that have been taken .
The monitoring of how this EC labelling of products is used is a common concern for the Commission and the Member States .
In turn , the Commission sets up programmes to ensure that the market monitoring is organised in a uniform way between the Member States .
I would therefore like to propose that , in the first instance , the honourable Member turn to the Commission for any further information concerning this matter .
Torture is one of the most pressing problems in Turkey .
Therefore , in its medium-term priorities in the draft partnership agreement for accession , the Council has included the requirement that conditions in Turkish prisons be changed to conform to the UN 's rules as regards minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners .
The Council will , of course , continue to monitor the situation closely .
This was his only 'crime ' , and for this he was to be convicted .
In declaring Turkey an applicant country for membership of the EU , which was done at the Helsinki Summit , the EU now has completely new opportunities of closely following developments in Turkey and of pointing out every deviation from the standards which should apply to a candidate country .
The Swedish Presidency is actively working towards making as many debates as possible open within the formal frameworks which apply .
This decision has now been incorporated into the Council 's Rules of Procedure .
Nine such debates will be held in what could be regarded as the important and central Council constellations beginning this Friday when Ecofin is to hold a debate on its work programme .
I think that it should be a matter of course in a democratic society for the citizens to have the right of access to their most important legislative body , and in the European Union that is of course largely the EU 's Council of Ministers .
It is quite simply a fundamental demand for democracy .
Take , for example , the Swedish Parliament .
Even a long march begins with a small step .
The EU has repeatedly appealed to the authorities in Belarus to respect international standards in these extremely important areas .
By voting in a new president , the people will get the chance this year to take a crucial decision on what their future will hold .
Therefore , the Council is particularly keen that , in the long term , Belarus is established as a partner and it is also keen to ensure stability in the region as a whole .
Like these countries , the EU has maintained that a policy which aims to isolate Belarus would militate against its own objective .
The Union will , of course , also take this opportunity to raise the issue of people who have recently disappeared .
My warm thanks for your reply .
But 20 percent of the candidates in the so-called parliamentary election last autumn - I was there myself as an observer - were dismissed .
I think that it is absolutely right to see the development in Belarus , as Mr Sacr√©deus does , in conjunction with the development in Russia and the development in Ukraine .
We will then combine this with the urgent efforts that I described earlier in my initial reply .
The Council 's bodies are well aware of the type of persecution and mutilation which the honourable Member mentioned in her question .
As the honourable Member will undoubtedly recall , agreement was reached at the Tampere Summit in 1999 to work towards establishing a common European asylum system based on a complete and absolute application of the Geneva Convention guaranteeing that no-one is sent back to be subjected to persecution , and that this system should include an approximation of the rules for the recognition and content of refugee status .
The Council is now awaiting the Commission 's proposal and , when it arrives , the Swedish Presidency intends to treat it as a priority issue .
Naturally , I am in favour of such a scheme .
Then we are , of course , deviating slightly from the principle of individual treatment , but the basic answer to the MEP ' s question is : yes .
This concerns in particular the resolution on the oil for food programme .
In this connection the Council also notes and welcomes the establishment of a working party within the UN which will draw up general recommendations on improving UN sanctions , on how they are to be better directed and on how to avoid unnecessary human suffering .
As regards the UN Compensation Committee based in Geneva , which , as you know , has been working since the Gulf War to settle claims resulting from the war , I think it is sensible to wait for an assessment from the UN of how this work is continuing before we in the Union take a stand on whether or not
