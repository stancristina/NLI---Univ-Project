in Doha in November 2001 , which adopted the agenda for the negotiating round on trade and development , and the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in March , at which an historic agreement was entered into on funding and good governance .
From 2006 onwards these assurances will increase the total aid volume by around 25 % annually .
Within the EU , we greatly desired to establish development targets in a number of areas that were not covered by the Millennium Goals or by previous agreements .
We wanted to insist on the results achieved previously with respect to human rights , workers ' rights , equality and good governance , and we wanted to ensure effective follow-up .
As regards globalisation , we attached importance to reflecting the positive opportunities that exist as a result of globalisation and to emphasising the social dimension and corporate responsibility .
We were able to establish a number of practical objectives , with deadlines for achieving them , within the areas of poverty , health , the environment and natural resources .
This should be seen as a supplement to the Millennium Goal of halving the number of people without access to clean drinking water by 2015 .
In addition , there is an agreement to establish a ten-year framework programme for sustainable production and consumption which tackles the crucial problem of the separation of economic growth from deterioration of the environment .
No practical target , with a deadline for achieving it , was adopted due to opposition from the USA , Japan and the OPEC countries in particular , but we did obtain an objective of increasing the global proportion of sustainable energy at the earliest possible date .
This is the greatest pronouncement adopted to date in this area .
Furthermore , in cooperation with a number of other countries , the EU submitted a declaration to continue working on this issue .
These goals and objectives from Johannesburg together with the Millennium Goals provide a concrete agenda for our work on national , regional and international efforts over the coming 10-15 years .
Johannesburg placed greater political focus on the actual WTO process and its significance for developing countries .
The agreements reached at Monterrey on financing for development and the significance of good governance in attracting investment and funding were affirmed .
Moreover , a number of EU countries took the initiative at the summit jointly to procure further voluntary contributions of approx .
Finally , we were able to establish that the social dimension is to be promoted and that the consensus achieved previously on the role , rights and equality of women is to be adhered to .
Importance was attached to the national responsibility for good governance , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
I would also add that indigenous peoples were also mentioned in the declaration .
With regard to partnerships , the ground was prepared for greater interaction between the public sector , private organisations and private businesses in the implementation of the goals set .
In addition , the EU launched two new ambitious initiatives within the priority areas of water and energy , namely ' Water for Life ' and ' Sustainable Energy for Poverty Reduction ' .
Johannesburg created the momentum for more effective implementation of the agenda on sustainable development .
There was a clear message from business that in their investments and production they accept their responsibility for local communities and the environment .
This is an important issue on which we must continue working .
These words must be turned into deeds .
In this context we have a particular duty to follow up our own initiatives in respect of water and energy .
In preparation for this summit I presided over a conference of Finance Ministers from these countries last Thursday and I am pleased to report that much of the agenda that we have discussed here was discussed with our Asian partners , and that it was decided to initiate a series of preparatory activities between the EU and Asia so that we can ensure that progress is made in Canc√∫n and elsewhere where the WTO process is to be continued .
Lastly , I would like to say that it is important that , when we talk about these things , we in Europe realise that , although we may be major players , we need partners who want the same things as us .
And both I and Commissioner Pascal Lamy are very pleased that we got as far as we did with our Asian colleagues last week and yesterday .
What should have been the climax of the Johannesburg summit - the political declaration - ended up being a weak mish-mash of the special interests of various countries which does not dare mention human rights directly , which leaves it up to the corporations themselves to check whether they are meeting their responsibilities and which erased all mention of the promises made at Rio not having been met .
Neither the EU nor the USA had the will to make concessions to the developing countries in the area of aid and trade .
Consequently it was also difficult to achieve improvements in the areas of the environment and human rights .
The Johannesburg Summit provided confirmation of ten years ' experience of the USA as a player in global environmental and development policy .
Unfortunately , the EU does not have much to boast about either .
' Let us enter into an agreement capable of replacing darkness and despair with light and hope for hundreds of millions of people , ' said Mr Rasmussen in his speech at the summit .
Sadly , I find it difficult to see where these fine words are reflected in the final outcome .
Do global summits still have a role
