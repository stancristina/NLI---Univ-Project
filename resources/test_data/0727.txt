One very positive point is that the specific programmes have turned out to be absolutely consistent with the framework programme , which , as you know , has been finally approved by the Council and has now been officially in force since 3 June .
In any case , the framework programme is only a basis .
As far as the priority of genomics and biotechnology for health is concerned , the Commission will of course take on board all of the amendments relating to research into cancer , of whatever form : genetic , clinical and others .
There is also , as you said , support for the creation of the European Higher Education Area .
Turning now to Mr Alyssandrakis 's report and the additional comments made by Mrs Matikainen , I believe , Mr Alyssandrakis , that all of your amendments serve to clarify the Commission proposal .
It will be useful in helping us to establish the European Research Area by creating common bases of knowledge and measurements and also , as you stressed Mr Pi√©trasanta , by fostering links with national centres .
This therefore needs to be taken into account when considering the general issue of dispersion and non-dissemination , and Europe needs to make its contribution to the joint effort .
With this in mind , I think that the July part-session , as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy proposed yesterday , will obviously be very significant , because it is then that we will be in a position to make the Sixth Framework Programme a reality as part of the European Research Area .
Mr Mantovani , you also mentioned SMEs .
It therefore concerns a very important subject .
The Commission is unable , for the reasons indicated by Mr Byrne during yesterday morning 's debate , to accept Amendments Nos 4 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 22 , 23 , 24 and 26 .
- ( FR ) We voted in favour of this report because of the various elementary adoptions of position which it contains .
Nevertheless , I shall vote in favour of Mr Mastorakis ' report , which approves that position .
- ( FR ) The draft Council decision on the organisation of European elections makes provision for the possibility of regional constituencies , on the initiative and at the discretion of each country .
After enlargement , it will be not only Brussels , but also Strasbourg , Luxembourg , Frankfurt , and perhaps another location which will have to be established and promoted in order to meet the needs of the enlarged Europe which we are creating .
- ( FR ) The UEN Group and the French delegation of the RPF are opposed to any manoeuvre which would reduce the length of plenary sessions at Strasbourg .
Mr President , I wanted to say to our rapporteur that his report , as many people wanted it to , has been greatly reduced in the manner of Balzac 's peau de chagrin .
In addition , Mr President , do not tell us that the principle of direct payments to agriculture is fair , because it is an unjust principle and it must be reformed .
That is our task , and we have not yet completed it .
Obviously accession to the European Union is open to only one Cypriot State as far as international law is concerned .
The Commission will have to try to answer this question during the current debate on the common fisheries policy .
By acting hastily , as is being proposed , we could ruin agriculture in both the Member States and the candidate countries .
Would that not be the best way of testing our democratic commitment ?
The amendment we have tabled is along these lines .
In other words , it is better to legislate , taking account of small enterprises , which means serving 65 million people more effectively .
We accept that it is in our own future interest to safeguard the planet 's fish resources .
There is a serious misunderstanding on this point .
We did not take part in the vote on this resolution .
All that will be at stake is strengthening Fortress Europe , whereas it is urgently necessary to combat trafficking , mafias and secrecy through a policy of opening up frontiers , normalising the status of those without papers and giving nationals and foreigners equal civic and social rights .
The dismantling of public services ; industrial restructuring , leading to an explosion in unemployment , particularly in the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Lithuania and Poland ; the actual or planned closing-down of energy sources in Lithuania , Estonia and Bulgaria , with dramatic social and economic repercussions ; the planned elimination of millions of smallholdings in Poland , Slovenia and Hungary and the dismissal of those for whom they provide a living , albeit a meagre one ; and the policy for reducing agricultural production , which the European authorities want to emphasise everywhere .
I welcome Mr Brok 's report , which shows that real progress has been made in the enlargement process .
The Commission has already agreed broadly to subsidise these regions and , in particular , the undertakings that operate there , explaining that , following enlargement , the regions at the present external borders of the EU will certainly attract less than prosperous labour from newly admitted countries .
The voluntary agreement does not , for its part , seem capable of offering the guarantees required of a trustworthy road safety policy .
Equatorial Guinea is at present the scene of unacceptable violations of basic human rights .
Mr President , I am dismayed by the way
