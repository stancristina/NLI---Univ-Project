I totally reject the rapporteur 's conclusion that the election campaigns in all Member States should mainly be about choosing a President for the European Commission .
These amendments mainly relate to restricting speaking time , to time-consuming procedures for selecting more rigorously the amendments to be voted on and to opportunities for presidents , on their own initiative , to give the floor to backbenchers sympathetic to them .
Every list that obtains seats , even if this is only one , is recognised as a group .
Hence my appeal to the Member States not to raise any new obstructions in respect of enlargement .
Would you mind bringing this to the attention of the competent authorities ?
They involve the fight against corruption which , in Slovakia , is still too widespread .
It is up to the Slovakian citizens to decide , but as in 1998 , these elections are , in fact , about Slovakia 's future in Europe .
The Liberal Group is taking the asylum obligations arising from the Geneva Convention very seriously .
It is our task , and that of the media , to offer the people a true picture of reality , whether this is beneficial or not .
This is only natural , on account of the rule of law being prioritised with good reason .
Apparently , it is one of the Council 's fondest wishes to avoid parliamentary control , certainly in the form of the capacity to remove a political official from office .
In Poland , for example , the employment figure is 19 % and is not showing any signs of abating .
Moreover , all the figures bear out that immigration to the European Union is restricted .
Mafia and corruption still remain a curse .
But other minorities too often experience a lack of appreciation and recognition of their identities .
Fear that enlargement will be too fast after all , or that it will be too costly after all , or both .
However , without enlargement , the reform of agricultural policy will not take place .
That too is true , let there be no misunderstanding about this .
Ladies and gentlemen , Madam President , we should all ensure that the completion of enlargement in the next few months does not lead to one large European coitus interruptus , because that would be wholly unsatisfactory .
This applies to both Objectives 1 , 2 and 3 and to the new initiatives .
As a result , the money of the funds will not be spent , and we will miss a major opportunity for development in eastern Europe .
At the same time , the number of cod fishermen has fallen considerably in my country .
This is why it is important to monitor the effectiveness of the measures .
It is unacceptable for Dutch fishermen who are allowed to catch 10 % of the Total Allowed Catch , the TAC , for cod , to be far more restricted in their fishing activities than British fishermen who account for 40 % of the TAC.
I will make a few observations to the measures included in the Commission proposal .
Thirdly , a reduction in effort is achieved most quickly by applying the sea-days ' scheme .
By that , I mean that if a fleet , in the event of sound quota management , is capable of working profitably and effectively , then this should not be disturbed .
I come from a culture where self-regulation is very common .
As a final point , I have stated in the recommendation by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy that something needs to be done about whiplash , although this is not at all related to this issue , but rather to a safety issue which also robs a huge number of people of their health .
I would ask the Commissioner not only to enter into consultation with industry very promptly in order to do something about this pedestrian protection , possibly by means of self-regulation , I would also ask him to tackle these other problems too .
Indeed , the framework directive has 22 years of research behind it .
It is also important to note that it is not only the European Parliament that prevents road victims .
At the moment , the Community is prescribing requirements for the design of cars , which is good , in my view .
In this light , there are a few observations to be made about the agreement .
Practice has shown , however , that adjustments can be implemented remarkably faster , not in years but even in weeks , as long as the right incentives are in place .
However , the EEVC tests too are updated regularly .
To a certain degree , I can go along with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and others who would ideally like to see voluntary agreements concluded with industry .
I very much welcome phase one 's implementation on a voluntary basis .
Mr President , are the non-elected executives of industry the legislators , or is this the task of the elected representatives of the people ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , in particular Mrs Read and Mr Harbour , and the Commission Secretariat , for their pleasant cooperation , and state that I , as the rapporteur , am delighted to have submitted this report .
The European Parliament can , therefore , give its full support to this process .
Governments will thus need to follow developments very closely .
This would not , however , get to the root of the current problem .
The report also pays attention to the candidate countries .
