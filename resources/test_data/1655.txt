The United States backs Israel 100 % .
The EU could despatch troops to protect Palestinian areas .
The EU could demand that Israel dismantle its stocks of nuclear weapons .
Some years ago , I met Shimon Perez .
Offer EU membership to Palestine and Israel as a reward for achieving a definitive peace .     Mr van Hulten’s report is an important one .
We have chosen to vote against the wording that calls upon the Commission to implement the one share/one vote principle , because this is not in line with the principle of subsidiarity .
Increased movement in the European labour market is good , but we cannot accept flexibility at workers ’ expense .     We have today voted against the report , our justification being as follows .
Such behaviour may lead to its becoming more difficult in the future to conclude agreements , if the institutions do not keep to them .
We particularly welcome trade and industry ’s initiatives in the interests of increased transparency and the scrutiny of administration and reporting , and we hope that these principles will influence future European development in this area .     I have voted against the resolution (adopted by 422 votes to 30 , with 47 abstentions ) prior to Cyprus’s referendums on 24 April , because the European Parliament would thus be contributing to the Turkish occupation of the northern part of the island .
Turkey continues to be given the right to intervene unilaterally , and its occupation continues , even though it is being reduced from 37 % to 28.5 % of the island .
In practice , Cyprus will not be a fully-fledged EU Member State .
Item 13 : We welcome increased European cooperation between the national coastguard services when it comes to joint operations , planning and the development of competence .
Naturally , a balance has been struck , as Mr Brok said .
This leads to our undermining respect for our own high principles .
It is that balance that makes us in the Greens/ALE Group think it obvious that we must say no to this agreement now .
I shall concentrate upon two parts of the report : those relating to Israel/Palestine and to women’s right to determine their own lives .
Closing one’s eyes to reality has never led to genuine solutions to problems .
Proposals 28–40 are important additions to support .
In the developing countries , reproductive problems are the most important cause of death and disablement .
Committed people look to the EU to play an active role in working for a better world .
I think it logical that we continue down this road in the last report of this term of office .
The majority of the countries to which the regulation applies are in reality developing countries .
Nonetheless , we have made some demands of the Commission to ensure that Parliament is able to follow the work on the regulation more effectively .
It is important that the decisions taken on a human rights basis reflect the EU’s commitments to support democracy , international law and , naturally , respect for human rights .
We must protect human dignity when it comes to our measures concerning human rights , cooperation and the development of aid and ensure that the primary focus of these measures is always the consolidation of democracy , international law and human rights and the eradication of poverty .
Is that the way in which you are to defend your EU project ?
Is it to be done by means of accusations and ridicule , through the harassment of whistleblowers and by setting the police on investigative journalists ?
You may have a different view but , when you ridicule us , run us down and call us anti-Europeans , you undermine the democratic legitimacy of your own project .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the last conciliation of this term of office was aimed at establishing a common market for railway transport , and it has been a great success , especially for Parliament .
Efficient management must be based upon the general European interest .
His wording means that the Commission must seek also to liberalise passenger services in a similar way after 2010 .
It is necessary to develop the railway infrastructure in order to reduce the congestion on our motorways and enable us to fulfil the environmental requirements .
We were able to maintain a more or less common front against the Council , a fact that is , of course , in large part the reason for the outcome .
Your chairmanship , Mrs Randzio-Plath , has been characterised by impartiality , knowledge and professionalism .
Overall growth has not achieved the rate we had desired and expected .
We are well aware of the current figures .
We know that the changes in the new Member States have been very far-reaching and often painful .
Instead of criticising countries like Slovakia and Estonia which have reduced their taxes and in that way created room for growth , we should see what we can learn from their having done this .
Corporation tax in the new Member States is lower than in our own countries , but healthy competition is to be welcomed .
There is still a need for structural reforms in quite a few of the Member States .
Where the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned , we think that this has operated well .
The Liberal recipe for enabling the EU Member States to obtain growth and more jobs involves sound public finances , increased competition , completion of the internal market in all its aspects and structural reforms for the future .
Mrs Randzio-Plath’s excellent report documents how dreadfully bad matters look .
As long as the pact prevails , there is little help to be found .
I do not believe we can break
