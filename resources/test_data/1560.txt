Energy brings synergy .
The TEN-E networks in the energy sector will play an important role in the liberalisation of the internal market and in improving operational reliability , as they will enable the EU to connect to suppliers outside the Union .
Transport networks are part of the general infrastructure , whereas the TEN-E networks are in private ownership .
A Coordinator would hardly be of any great value either : it would simply create a new organisational level once again .
Their preparation has not been systematic : in practice it has been quite random .
According to new estimates , all energy sources apart from renewables may run out within a few generations , depending on levels of consumption .     .
Madam President , we are dealing with a subject that is central to climate policy .
As the person delivering the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I myself had hoped that this would have provided an opportunity to correct the problems and distortions of competition which the directive on emissions trading contains .
It is perhaps paradoxical , but when we treat Member States uniformly we accord them unequal status .
I am not objecting to the ambitious nature of the savings , but their unfairness .
My own country , Finland , which has invested in the efficient use of energy for years now , is facing quite a different challenge from that which Poland , for example , is .
In a common market , it is a matter of the distortion of competition when measures that have already been implemented are insufficiently taken into consideration and Member States are not given enough latitude .
If my idea had been adopted , a study would have been conducted of the savings potential across Europe , and savings targets would have been allocated on a country-by-country basis , according to each country ’s savings potential .
The issue may well have been considered urgent , but too much haste can be costly , to the extent that it could lead to conciliation with the Council .     .
Mrs Rothe has undertaken a mammoth task , and I thank her for it .
The proposal entering the debate is an ambitious one .
The proposals for energy saving targets , in particular , are even tougher than those in the Commission ’s proposal .
We have seen that , without them , Member States wriggle out of their responsibilities over and over again .
In fact , we were got started too early , and now we have to pay the price for that a second time .
I would like to point out that we have implemented all the directives that are connected with the Lisbon process .     .
We support the rapporteur in her conclusion that we did not agree to this and that , accordingly , the compromise at first reading was not reached .
It is reasonable to establish a database where existing environmental data can be made greater and more varied use of .
Moreover , even if it is important for many authorities to collect revenue for the information it produces when it is being used for commercial purposes , it is important that our citizens can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own lives and health without having to pay for it .     – Mr President , the success of the Community’s environmental policy depends very much on the availability of reliable scientific data and the trouble-free transmission of that data .
We must therefore try to improve the way spatial data is used and accessed , to facilitate the planning , implementation , monitoring and evaluation of policies .
The Community has various instruments at its disposal to help improve access to reliable data , in particular public sector data , in the first place , and later standardise it to make it comparable at Community level .
One problem with both these directives is that it is feared that losses of income for certain data providers will result .
I would therefore advise that we tread carefully right now , to avoid surprises .
The Community’s spatial data infrastructure will supplement the directives on the re-use of public sector information and public access to environmental information .
I also wish to express my sincerest thanks for the constructive cooperation shown by the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development .
In all , more than 11 billion a year has been set aside for rural development in the EU’s future financial frameworks .
The Commission proposed that a certain minimum amount of financing should be allocated to each policy .
The committee reduced these threshold amounts to the lowest value possible , because Member States have to be guaranteed sufficient flexibility in order to draw up their own individual programmes .
For this reason , the development of the Least Favoured Areas scheme , for example , is more relevant than ever , as aid under the common agricultural policy mainly focuses on the EU’s best farming regions .
That is why my group believes that aid measures should be targeted specifically at private individuals and the organisations they establish , not the state .
It is not enough to react to terrorism with the police and intelligence services working closely together , although they are , of course , crucially important .
Acts of terror are tragic and , as their name suggests , they are designed to spread fear and panic .
For that reason , European societies have to be made stronger from within , in terms of their structures and culture in relation to action , and become societies where there is less potential for terrorism .
We must also be able to
