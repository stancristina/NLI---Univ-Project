of the chocolate product which vegetable foodstuffs can comprise , so this matter can hardly be catastrophic for the countries concerned .
One of the poorest countries in the world , Burkina Faso , in fact depends on its exports of shea nuts .
People are also saying that it is the poor countries which will be hit if we impose a ban on using vegetable foodstuffs .
I do not think my question has been answered at all .
Second , given that the EU played a decisive role in getting the elephant moved from annex I to annex II , one might well ask if this is going to be followed up and money is going to be given to endow such an observation system , for if it does n't happen , it is clear that the agreement to moving the elephant to annex II is useless .
The additives we approve in the EU will be assessed in the light of how many additives people may be exposed to .
So now we are dealing with the proposal on the basis of responsibility for health and the concept of technical necessity .
My advice to them is to examine the EU policies which may affect people 's health , including the food policy .
This directive should not be extended , but limited .
Substances such as nisin should not be used in food , as this is an antibiotic and so belongs to the world of medicine .
We do not want to stroll lightly into a resistance problem further with our eyes open .
Marking of food is the alpha and omega .
So we must know what food contains .
This is irresponsible , and so are the proposals for change by the Environmental Committee .
As the substances are refined differently , and 408 is not as pure as 407 , I think they should each be given their own E number .
It is important to insist that we should only use additives if there is a technical necessity and a health test can be passed .
Rather , it and some of the EPP Group 's proposals are based on what is possible for industry and technology , which is quite a different thing .
It is only in recent years that food has been plugged with additives .
Before , we managed to make food without artificial additives .
The number of allergies is constantly increasing , and it will of course end up with the Commission one day having to put forward totally different proposals if it wants to live up to the health aims of the Amsterdam Treaty .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Breyer for all the work she has put into this report .
I will come back to this later .
But , when you read this version of the directive we are dealing with today , you cannot help but think that the Commission does not particularly feel inclined to explain what is happening either .
But , apart from this , when the Commission tries to explain on the background for the proposals , there is also a conflict between the grounds for the proposals and the specific remarks .
No other reasons are given , even if that is a so-called reason .
The specific remarks state that in fact this is a collection of forgotten additives , that new Member States have joined with specific traditions , and that some substances have been updated which the Scientific Committee has completed since last time .
Finally , another possible factor is that some countries are again trying to get something through which they tried to do before without success .
And if this had been said straight off , we could quite easily have had a discussion on that basis .
And if we add that it is largely inaccessible , so we will have to spend oceans of time on the directive , that may well be slightly irritating .
This might perhaps be partly justifiable at a time when it was only experts who were involved in the directive 's proposals , but now that the directive is part of the democratic process at both national and international level , it is totally unacceptable .
And , as we know , it only leads to totally irrelevant discussions .
To continue with amendments on the present basis is totally unacceptable .
Mr President , I still was rather unclear whether the name which the Commissioner announced was actually mine , but it could hardly be otherwise at this point .
I would like to say that I have been involved in this for quite a long time , and that means I know how complex it is .
It was in all modesty I was trying to say , and so I said that if the directive is to be amended , and it will be , it must be structured in a logical , readable way .
That 's not the problem at all .
For instance , Amendment No 20 refers to a law on mother 's milk product itself containing polyunsaturated fatty acids .
Of course , packaging immediately leads one to think of physical packaging , and that is definitely not what this is about .
Amendment 15 refers to liquid coffee and tea in tins , while the French refers to liquid coffee and drinks based on tea in tins .
If we are voting on subjects which are reasonably technical , and of course we are not experts , I think it is very important that the translations we are given are correct .
I do not mean of course that we should not vote on these proposed amendments , but I would like to ask that people check that the Danish translations are more accurate in future than is the case with this report .
