as a manifestation of the fact that people have been listening .
I would like to say that I was delighted to hear Mr  Juncker’s recent comments , when he said that we should now end the debate concerning what comes first and establish that in Europe things happen at the same time ; that we improve our competitiveness , carry out social reforms – including in the labour market – and implement environmental reforms all at the same time .
We are not aiming for just any kind of combination , however .
President of the Commission , I feel today that the greatest investment of all that we need is investment in human beings over the coming five years .
It depends on the type of flexibility we are talking about .
If we do this , we will have an opportunity to bring about a new deal in which we say to people : ‘We shall safeguard your security in the twenty-first century in a new labour market with new jobs’ .
In other words , we shall say that we are here to create new jobs that can take the place of the old ones , and we shall ensure that people are able to take those new jobs .
May I end by urgently saying to the Luxembourg Presidency and to the Commission that we need greater demand in Europe and that we need macroeconomic coordination of investments , for I can assure you that , without major economic growth , there will be no popular understanding for reforms , and without reforms we can have no sustainable economic growth .
If we can agree on this in the Luxembourg Presidency’s proposal to the European Council , we shall have come a very , very long way .
I think great efforts are being made to secure balance , and we want to be there all the time , as Mr Schulz said today , to secure that balance that is the European identity .     – Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for agreeing to complete openness concerning 3 000 working groups .
It can be found on the Commission ’s website or , even easier , can be downloaded from my website at bonde .com .
Thank you .
I would also like to thank the Commission for agreeing that in future we can find out about all the contributions from the Commission to the Council of Ministers and its working groups .
Until now , we have been excluded from the majority of this legislation .
I am as happy as a little boy on Christmas Day , because I have been working towards such openness for many years .
Thank you .
It is almost too good to be true .
My dear Council of Ministers , can the Luxembourg Presidency not ask that the 300 working groups dealing with legislation be laid open to Parliament ?
When we sit on the committees and deal with the draft legislation , officially we have only the original draft from the Commission , while the Council’s working group is sitting looking at edition 17 – which we cannot legally obtain .
We have the electorate’s vote , but we lack the confidence of the Council of Ministers .
When will we have the opportunity to thank you in the Council for what would be the most natural thing of all ?
Thank you , Mr President , especially if the Council will give us a little more to say thank you for .     – Mr President , first and foremost , my thanks to all the members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety for their constructive cooperation .
After more careful study , however , I can clearly see that the tree is not only decorated but also maintains a consistent theme .
Firstly , it has now been established that Natura 2000 is to be funded .
The amount is not up for negotiation .
The European Environment Agency in Copenhagen has , time after time , drawn attention to the alarming situation , and we need to reverse the trend .
We only know that if we do not get moving right away , matters will simply become more and more expensive day by day .
In Denmark , many farmers are bagging pollution permits in Natura 2000 areas .
This type of behaviour must be stopped .
In this respect , it is pleasing that the Committee is united in believing that Natura 2000 should be incorporated not just into rural development policy , but also in a broader framework .
The committee has , however , been even more realistic than the Commission .
We mention environmental considerations generally and not just Natura 2000 , and we know that the goal cannot be achieved unless amounts are earmarked in these funds and conditions introduced .
To date , we have seen little sign of environmental considerations , despite the fact it is already possible to incorporate them into the funds .
If , however , consideration for the countryside is integral to the way the funds are used , farmers will then have an interest in the environment and in environment-friendly farming and other production in the areas concerned , earning twice as much in the process .
There are small areas that cannot be helped via the funds .
More than once we emphasise the need for the rural development fund in particular – in other words , the second pillar of the common agricultural policy – to be significantly increased , if the task is to be achieved in a justifiable way and in harmony with those who are to implement it .
We must not forget , however , that a substantial part of the amount must come from the Member States .
