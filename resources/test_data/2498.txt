I digress .
There are a good few possibilities , and , indeed , I wish to ask in this regard that the Commission maximise the use of the existing possibilities in its policy before resorting to further new ones .
Just compare that with our resolution .
My answer is ‘no’ , and for two reasons .
We are both members of the delegation on Central Asia , and it is partly thanks to him and his great commitment that we are able to put this kind of issue back on the agenda .
We must stand up for freedom of belief .
Mr Bowis has already described the situation in Uzbekistan , and I have nothing to add .
The government of Nepal receives supplies of arms from the United States on a massive scale , aid from India , military aid from the United Kingdom and other countries , and supplies of arms from Belgium , which even amended its Arms Act in order to be able to supply those arms .
We now have a delegation there .
The EU has been trying for years to reduce the fleet capacity of European fishermen .
A year ago , at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg ( September 2002 ) , the Dutch and European authorities hypocritically signed declarations that there must be an end to worldwide overfishing by 2010 , but in reality the Dutch and European authorities are shifting the problems caused by overfishing in European waters on to the countries of the Developing World .
So am I , to say the least .
I am , for example , referring to discrimination in the area of social policy and employment , the right to asylum , and justice .
Needless to say , although there will have to be extensive consultation with the Council on this matter , it is clear to everyone that a distinction must be drawn .
Everyone is entitled to it and must have access to all forms of education , irrespective of their origin , gender or age .
A disproportionately large number of the poor in developing countries are women , but they are often the very people who are denied this right .
By this I mean not only the government bodies at national , regional and local level , but also the members of parliament in those countries , the NGOs , the private sector and also all other actors involved in civil society .
Finally , I should like to underline here once again that the European Union 's cooperation with Asia and Latin America requires a modern legislative framework , in which both the fight against poverty and that against inequality have their own dynamism .
Solidarity suggests a sense of involvement among people that takes shape within social contexts , close to the citizen and based on an internal conscience : think of the charity taught by Christ .
The selection of organisations and projects must be done very carefully and must not be left to the Commission itself .
To my mind , the option of concluding multi-annual framework partner agreements is a good way of getting round this , but we must beware of these subsidies being maintained until the end of time .
The organisations that have hitherto received subsidies run the risk of being left in the cold in 2004 .
Mr Hernandez-Mollar , you stated that this trust is in place , but I think that this trust , which is desirable especially in a political context , is not sufficiently in place or sufficiently substantiated .
There are too many kinds of levies on car ownership but also on use .
I particularly have the reaching of a common position on levy grounds and goals for the application of levies in mind .     – Commissioner , the tragedy caused by the drastic streamlining measures at Ford Genk has exposed a number of painful areas in the European car industry .
For this to happen , it will have to anticipate the ever-growing component of electronics in the added value of a car .
These are only a few initiatives ; there are still many more around which Europe could work .
Companies require from the government a stable business climate .
In that way , the European Union does not lose its industry and can match it with a very strong and better manned service industry .
I think that this could also be a possible solution for a case like Genk .     – A few years ago , the CEO at Renault , Mr Louis Schweizer , who had , incidentally , been the principal private secretary in the cabinet of France 's Socialist Prime Minister in a previous life , decided , in the interest of his shareholders , to close down the Renault factory in Vilvoorde and make a few thousand Flemish workers redundant in the process .
I do not think that I have to convince anyone of the fact that this is a real tragedy , not only for the people at Ford Genk , but also for the suppliers and for the region as a whole .
This , in my view , clearly contravenes legislation concerning the European works council for which we voted here in 1994 .
That was the big problem .
Then it suddenly transpired that the German companies were more competitive , although wages there are higher than in Belgium .
Even though , of course , studies have already been carried out and their results have been made available , I am surprised that the Commission has announced that it still intends to go ahead with this .
Reference has been made to the Structural Funds , and to the fact that they will be subject to a review in 2006 .
Although I am grateful to you for being here and
