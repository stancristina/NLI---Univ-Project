by the political Left ( with 266 votes in favour of doing so and 237 votes against ) .
The removal of item 15 opens the way for European finance ministers to increase public expenditure in times of recession and in situations in which there are budget deficits .
I voted in favour of item 5 to the effect that a possible introduction of the euro should be subject to a referendum .
In practice , this item would entail a relaxation of the objective criteria in favour of vaguer , politically negotiable criteria .
Unfortunately , this item remained in place .
I voted against item 10 to the effect that EC law takes precedence over Swedish law , even before Swedish legislation has been amended .
Mr President , those sympathetic to the United States also have cause to criticise legislation that forces airlines to choose between the EU and the United States .
As we all know , legislation must balance personal privacy and the fight against crime .
This must be seen in the perspective of our discussions in the EU of a one-year storage period .
Rather , we also need to hold discussions with other countries in the world that have special rules .
If we do not organise serious discussions , we shall end up in a position in which we have to discuss mutual and reciprocal reactions , and it would probably be better if we were to reach agreement in some other way .
This is also a good example of the discussion in the Convention and of the need for people to be able to demand political accountability .
In that way , we shall obtain legal guarantees and be able to combat crime .
Man is still the norm , meaning that women treat men in the way that men treat other men ; and that many women treat other women in the way that men treat women .
No doubt that says a lot about the situation in the rest of the world .
I cannot see that very much in particular , or even anything at all , has happened in the five years since then .
Many have taught themselves to use the term 'gender mainstreaming ' , but just learning to use a new term does not bring about any changes .
In the fifth century , what was then an elitist male Church in Europe decreed at one of its Councils that women had souls .
They are weary of participating in projects that do not lead anywhere .
Our calls have fallen upon deaf ears .
On this issue , I really do support the Swedish Minister for Equality who , with her recent pledge to use legislation to introduce quotas if we cannot get more women onto company boards , has hopefully also promised a new approach .
In this context , I cannot forbear to mention the Convention - one that now wishes to introduce a Christian basis , but no equality between the sexes .
We ourselves present the biggest obstacle .
Cohesion policy , the European Social Fund and the Structural Funds are very important in terms of developing cooperation within the EU.
The fact that more has not happened in almost ten years is , of course , worthy of note .
There is also a strong link with education .
It is possible to exert strong pressure upon the ways in which the Community funds in question are used .
If the equality perspective is insufficiently clear or if the bodies that are to manage the funds do not have an equal representation of women and men , the applications should be declined .
Mr President , I want first of all to thank the chairman of the committee , who is also the rapporteur for this matter , for the work he has done .
I am therefore pleased that the European Parliament can now contribute to a procedure more in keeping with legal certainty : a humanitarian exemption from the freezing of funds and economic resources , of which the rapporteur has given an account .
As always in the case of action taken by the authorities , legal certainty at both national and international levels is important to the individual .
Legal uncertainty still exists and , in this area , the committee 's new amendments can play a major role .
These amendments must then be carefully considered by the international community , the Commission and the Council .
That is relatively simple to provide for when it comes to the 'old ' consumer requirements in terms of the link between price and quality .
This means that today 's consumers demand many different types of information .
We no doubt need to make use of the principle known in Swedish legal parlance as the honesty principle , whereby it is permissible for people to make claims about their products as long as they are fully able to substantiate these .
We have chosen to vote against the report on reforming the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks .
There is therefore no reason to put a move on and table a proposal at this early stage .
I have voted against the report because I cannot support the proposal in item 3 that the ECB 's Governing Council should act on a double majority basis when taking decisions and that these should be 'based on the population of the Member States , the total size of the economy and the relative size within it of the financial services sector '.
That is something I cannot on any account support .
Through dubious and , in some cases , illegal state aid , tax revenue has been used to move jobs around within the European Union .
The punishment is therefore mild in relation to what has happened
