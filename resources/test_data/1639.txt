This is a military operation that has been executed following the EU/NATO declaration on the ESDP of 16 December 2002 , which welcomes 'the strategic partnership established between the European Union and NATO in crisis management , founded on our shared values , the indivisibility of our security and our determination to tackle the challenges of the new Century ' .
.
As a matter of fact , this hysterical language is , in itself , quite incomprehensible , in light of the explanations given by the Commission yesterday during the debate in plenary .
.
In particular , to rapidly adopt a Directive on Fire Safety in hotels , a review of the current timeshare system and even to extend consumer protection in the air transport sector .
( PT ) I have voted in favour of this report and welcome , in particular , the fact that broad consensus was reached on this matter in the specialist committee .
( PT ) As I stated in my explanation of vote on the report by Mrs Thyssen , Community consumer protection rules have clearly failed to adapt to a rapidly changing market .
In order to achieve these aims , I agree with the view put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs , specifically with regard to the need for Community legislation arising from this Green Paper to be clear , simple , coherent and of high legislative quality .
Job losses deal a devastating blow to the workers affected and their families .
I have just quoted verbatim from the press release issued by Clark on 10 January .
These cases are models of a poor example to set and raise the following questions : where is the balance between economic interests and those of the companies and the rights of workers and of society ?
It is not our intention to prevent companies from closing or relocating their factories , but to ensure that those benefiting from financial aid give commitments and provide guarantees for long-term employment .
Something must be done urgently .
There is even a new specialised area of business , which consists of obtaining the maximum subsidies possible from European Funds only then , at the first opportunity , to leave the companies , which have been subsidised with European funds , on the brink of bankruptcy or even bankrupt .
I also agree that the Commission should have acted more swiftly , not only by ensuring that its legislative machinery and the various directives in force were implemented , but also by drawing up a programme of action for a crisis situation such as this .
Furthermore , they sometimes undertake such action after receiving substantial Community , national and local aid , failing even to meet the commitments they have given and ignoring the extremely serious social and economic damage they cause , which is what happened in the case of C & J Clark in Arouca and Castelo de Paiva and in many other cases in Portugal .
To sum up , this is a very long list , which needs to be closely examined .
Otherwise the aid they have received in the first country must be repaid .
On top of that , what Mrs Figueiredo is saying is not true , because the Prime Minister , the government and the local authorities have been persistent and tireless in this matter .
Industrial relocation and restructuring and companies closing down once they have received financial aid from the European Union are not new phenomena , but their scale and context has changed considerably .
Consequently , we cannot remain indifferent .
We feel it is unacceptable that a multinational company that has benefited from Community financial aid in the Member State in which it has decided to set up could breach the obligations inherent in this aid .
They are being seen in Portugal without the Commission having taken the due precautions in good time - I agree with my fellow Members who have said this already - but above all , as a result of the rules in Portugal being subordinated to an entirely excessive form of financial fundamentalism , which takes no account of the real economy and people .
The increase in industrial relocation that we are seeing in some European countries and , if we can generalise , particularly in the less developed economies such as Portugal 's , is truly unacceptable .
This is why a special role has been given to the European Monitoring Centre for Industrial Change , which can assist in defining alternative policies for cases of relocation .
Madam President , I wish to inform you , on behalf of the Group of the European Socialist Party , that I am tabling an oral amendment which would lead to the name 'EFTEC' being added to paragraphs 9 and 16 .
It is unacceptable that , in disregard for the European Parliament 's position - which is one of opposition to a war without the sanction of the United Nations - some European governments should have persisted in their support for the Bush administration , whose real objective was never to disarm Iraq but , rather , to overthrow the Iraqi regime , install a North American protectorate there and control the wealth of Iraq , particularly in the form of oil .
In this way , it waters down principles laid down in the Treaty and impedes their implementation , specifically in the fields of economic and social cohesion , solidarity , environmental protection , public health and food safety , public services and social rights , sustainable development and the quality of life , which is unacceptable .
His attitude is ridiculous and paranoid .
Indeed , we cannot easily accept the way in which the Council position clearly relegates the powers of the European Parliament to second place and clearly limits these powers , in patent breach of the Treaties and of the
