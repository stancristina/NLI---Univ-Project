In fact , the European Union is already seeing many Iraqi oil transactions taking place in euros and , due to their volume , these transactions contribute considerably to the strength and stability of the European currency as a means of international payment .
As a matter of fact , it is worth asking whether dictators who generally rule without any constraint and particularly without the democratic scrutiny of their public , only understand and respect the language of diplomacy , the language that has always been used , as Javier Solana said , when it is backed up and given credibility by the means of coercion available to it , the last resort , as he also said ?
If we achieve this , if we unite on the fundamental issue , the conditions might then be created for beginning the process of democratisation in Iraq and for enabling its people to enjoy the advantages of peace .
This doctrine should , therefore , be expressly criticised and rejected by the European Parliament .
The existence of weapons of mass destruction , an accusation that President Bush is levelling - so far without any convincing evidence - at the dictator and murderer Saddam Hussein seems simply to be a pretext , ignoring Kim Jong-Il , the Korean dictator - who does indeed have atomic weapons - and all the other dictators in the Middle East .
As emphasised by the representatives of many countries at the world parliamentary forum in Porto Alegre , we must call on our leaders to firmly oppose the war and reject the concept of preventive war contained in the new strategic doctrine of the Bush administration .
Our citizens want peace , so let us all work to make this possible , repeatedly expressing our protests , indignation and rejection with regard to the imminence of a new war against Iraq .
We are pleased to note that , in his first annual report on the general activities of the European Union , the Director-General for agriculture has corroborated our viewpoint , in expressing his two main reservations about the Budget for this mechanism : firstly , that the Commission has reduced and simplified the system of refunds in the beef and veal sector and , secondly , that it is committed to gradually reducing the use of these mechanisms in line with negotiations at the World Trade Organisation .
This is a concept of citizens ' rights that operates only in the interests of multinationals and large business concerns and which does not exist to protect consumers or even farmers , who are frequently the victims of a diabolical and destructive bureaucratic machine .
The need to recover funds from the Member States is primarily more an indication of failure than of success , because it demonstrates the poor functioning of the systems of farm subsidies .
Lastly , I should like to refer to the establishment of an incentive mechanism of 20 % for Member States to recover funds from the economic actors , which appears in principle to be a good idea .
It is noteworthy , however , that the European Parliament , political body par excellence , is concerned , on its own initiative and in line with the specific rules for studying proposals , with the way in which resources common to all of Europe are allocated and with the outcome of this allocation .
We cannot overlook the fact that the CAP is currently a potential source of equality and absorbs 47 % of the Community budget , which requires the use of specific auditing and regulatory procedures .
This indignation increases exponentially when many of these projects with unacceptable environmental impacts are funded under the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds .
I should like to highlight three main results of this Conciliation .
It is therefore crucial that rapid and far-reaching measures are adopted in order to put an end to this situation , which must surely weigh on humanity 's conscience .
It is equally crucial however , as I mentioned previously , that fundamental measures are adopted , breaking first of all with a model that has proven to be inadequate and unfair , which places the least developed countries in an inferior position and treats them shabbily - particularly by claiming that everything can be resolved through trade - which perpetuates an unfair system of trade that attaches sole priority to economic growth and ignores the importance of a fair distribution of the wealth that is created .
I should like , in addition to the numbers that have already been mentioned on hunger and malnutrition , to provide some others that I think are worth bearing in mind : 1 % of the population owns 57 % of the world 's wealth ; more than 2.5 billion people have no access to drinking water ; more than 2 billion people have no electricity ; more than 1 billion live in extreme poverty ; and 70 % of those infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa .
It is also true , however , that it was the deep-seated differences between the European Union and the developing countries , especially in the trade and finance dossier , that prevented more far-reaching results from being achieved .
This proposal is of considerable importance , not only for the average citizen in the street but also for the Community 's environmental policy , because it provides for public participation in the drawing up of certain plans and programmes for the environment .
This Convention enshrined access to environmental information and suggested greater public participation in decisions having an effect on the environment , thereby achieving more substantial effects from the rights laid down in the Stockholm Declaration ( 1972 ) and in Article 1 of the Rio Declaration ( 1992 ) .
What is of particular importance is the link made ,
