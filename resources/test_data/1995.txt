development of educational and vocational training systems to promote lifelong learning , the development of systems and models for the organisation of labour geared to producing a qualified labour force capable of facing up to the challenges of change , support for entrepreneurship and for the world of scientific and technological research , and the development of actions geared to promoting equal opportunities in the labour market .
Fundamental here is the proposal to extend partnership , which should become an obligatory procedure at national level , for both governments and regions .
The Greens believe Community financing under the CFP should be limited to vessels no longer than 24 metres .
This objective groups together four separate and distinct actions , namely one for urban areas , one for industrial areas , one for rural and mountain areas and one for fisheries .
I am curious to see how the funds will actually be managed .
In this way , the clauses agreed at Naples on the fringe of the 1993 G7 meeting , which provided for 66 % debt remission , could be applied to the less disadvantaged countries , while the G7 Lyons Agreement of 1996 could be applied to the most disadvantaged : remission of up to 80 % of debt .
We have always thought in terms of regional interdependence .
The Commission is already willing - it seems to me - to review the reserve proposal .
Now , if the level really were 0.46 % , this concentration could be understandable .
Madam President , first I would like to compliment Mr GÃ¶rlach on his report .
We are driven by two concerns : the first is that the crisis situation on the international markets may hold up reform while waiting for better times .
Instead , we think it is necessary to press on rapidly and stick to the planned timetable for decisions next spring .
Our message - at least the one we have tried to get across in this resolution - is that it is right to have the cards on the table and let the farming world have its say too , because it cannot be made just a passive witness of decisions taken over its head .
I do not want the difficulties that have emerged in relations between the political groups to lead to the defeat of the resolutions tabled .
So the decision taken on 17 July in Rome to establish the world 's first international criminal court is of historic significance .
We call for ratification by our governments , first and foremost , and by the other countries which decided to set up the court in the historic vote on 17 July in Rome . 60 countries are needed : we ask , through Parliament , for 31 December 2000 to be the date this court comes into existence and ends the impunity now protecting so many tyrants and dictators - not just in retirement , like Pinochet , but active , like Slobodan Milosevic and others - through the arrival of international criminal justice handed down by a permanent criminal court .
This is why I am anxious that you should know , for your information , that General Makashov received - I am quoting an authoritative Italian daily , the Corriere della Sera - ' tumultuous applause during the parades on the 81st anniversary of the October Revolution ' .
So far , convergence has been achieved in only one of the areas under discussion : the balance between stability and growth .
I would conclude by adding that the scale of the challenges lying ahead of us over the next few years calls for political vision and a fresh input of ideas .
Linked to the Ocalan case is the problem of pressure , threats and acts of terrorism perpetrated or merely threatened by well-organised ethnic and religious groups which have a huge following in Europe , as reported by no less a figure than a leading German left-wing intellectual , Peter Schneider , who states : 'It is clear that Turkey is striving to manoeuvre the Turkish minority in Germany , like a sort of fifth column .
The Commission - and I am pleased to see Mr van den Broek here in the House - made a mistake concerning the accession procedure .
I wonder how many EU countries would have seen fit to entrust their citizens with such a sensitive decision , on a matter directly affecting all the inhabitants of Latvia , citizens and non-citizens alike .
Opening negotiations by no means implies that they will be completed overnight ; it does however mean bringing these countries to the negotiating table on a par with the other states , Poland , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary and so on .
On the other hand , harsh and violent attitudes will not resolve the matter either , and the terms in which Turkey has referred to Italy are not always palatable .
But the problem is that certain obstacles still exist at the present time , and it is on these that we must focus .
It has thus made a serious mistake .
The Italian Government did what was necessary , as everyone has acknowledged .
That is by no means a peripheral question .
I know that this is a matter to be settled under electoral legislation , but it would nevertheless be helpful to offer some guidance in this respect , for example along the lines set out in Amendment No 89 .
It is vital to cut through the demagogy , adverse propaganda and opportunistic moralising : we must be in a position to perform our difficult and complex work on a salary which is reasonable and equal for us all - for all MEPs , whose circumstances vary and who accept different degrees of inconvenience in performing the same duties
