    Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Mann for an excellent report and for her extremely close and constructive cooperation during the time we have spent working on it .
This can be the case occasionally in the political sphere , but from an economic perspective precisely the opposite is , in actual fact , the case .
These have increased sharply and now stand at EUR 1.5 trillion .
It gives us more and more services and better products .
On the contrary , it is , in fact , a precondition and something that makes us all , throughout the world , richer .
Yesterday , I received an e-mail from the left-wing antiglobalisation movement .
The verdict , not surprisingly , was a loud and clear ‘no’ .
It is now two years since ten new Member States joined the EU.
It is not just a question of changing coins and notes , but also of giving up a part of your independence .
The result of these referendums must then be respected , just like the people of Sweden’s ‘no’ to the euro .     Mr President , I completely support the agreement and genuinely wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Niebler , for both her constructive cooperation and her considerable readiness to listen while the work was under way .
In spite of that , we are still forced to live with wage discrimination on grounds of sex .
It means , however , that we must continue with the work at all levels if we are to achieve our aim .     Mr President , in peace movements around the world , women often take the initiative and are in the majority .
Through the peace movement , women have shown another and better way – one of conflict resolution and measures to bring about peace .
In developing countries in which there are no large companies , it is of course more important to ensure that there is an institutional framework that makes it possible for small and medium-sized enterprises to operate .
We are completely in favour of women and men being treated equally in employment .
These are matters that the Member States are better dealing with independently and in accordance with international agreements already adopted .     We have today voted in favour of the report on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue .
What such initiatives can perhaps do , however , is in some way to crystallise the objectives towards which our institutions ’ efforts are directed .
Incredible though it may seem , the European Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education wishes to increase the EU’s share of the subsidies for national events and initiatives of this type from 50 % to 80 % ( Amendment 33 ) .
Our view is that the EU should not revise the Swedish people’s opinion by adopting a position for or against a possible opt-out clause .     In the vote on the euro , I abstained from voting on whether , following its referendum , Sweden should be regarded as qualifying for a derogation .
The motion is based on the incorrect assumption that Sweden will be forced to accept the common currency in spite of the outcome of the referendum .
Consistent application of such a principle is , of course , unthinkable .     I voted in favour of Amendment 9 because I believe that Sweden should demand a derogation following Sweden’s referendum on the euro in 2003 .
I am voting in favour of the report because of the huge criticism of the way in which Lithuania has been treated .     We Swedish Social Democrats are opposed to Parliament’s part-sessions taking place in Strasbourg and question why Parliament has set aside a significant budget item for purchasing buildings there .
For example , we are , as previously , sceptical about the European Parliament’s information-providing activities , which tend to take over the roles of the MEPs and political groups .
One of the things the report comes out in favour of is a EUR 4 million increase in appropriations to the political groups and the European parties .
At the same time , there are risks and problems .
The June List champions Roma women having access to better protection of their reproductive and sexual health .
The Member States are very diverse in terms of culture and traditions .
However , the basis of the report is such as to give rise to some peculiar lines of argument in which the suffering of men as one group and women as another , as well as levels of blame and responsibility , are graded so as to fit in with demands that quotas be allocated to women in various contexts .
A large number of servers were confiscated in a string of different companies that had nothing to do with the activity in question , and operations in these small businesses were shut down .
It has always been wrong – all of these new inventions have always led to increased sales .
Women and children are being brought into the EU from other parts of the world in order to be exploited sexually .
The UN estimates that four million people are transported within or between countries every year in order to be exploited sexually .
They then have their ID papers taken , are kept locked up , rarely know where in the world they are , hear only foreign tongues , are beaten , threatened and , above all , made to make their bodies available in whatever ways their customers may conceivably desire .
No customers means no demand .
Instead , in his mind , she is reduced to a body that can be bought .
No one should have to prostitute themselves .
In 1999 there were 4 000 child prostitutes
