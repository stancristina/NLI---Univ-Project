The Commission itself acknowledges that they cannot be limited - they will only increase .
Therefore , if we do not achieve progress in this direction , it will be very difficult to fulfil the Rio objectives and to renew commitment to them at the forthcoming United Nations Summit .
I pay tribute to the laudable effort Mrs Breyer and other colleagues have put in and to the concern they show .
National policies must be consistent with international resolutions .
We mean that , in developing agreements , we should put the most possible emphasis first of all on mutual benefits , ensuring social and economic results of European interest and social prospects which are favourable for the European Union as a whole , as could be the results of job creation ; secondly , in the legal protection of the results and thirdly in seeking a fair joint funding set-up .
We also feel that in the process of improving the profitability of these economic structures the introduction of research as an extra component should be added to that of low salaries .
Because , ladies and gentlemen , this report is a snapshot of developments in Europe and ways in which those developments affect the success or failure of a project which , day by day , is based on an economy of productive and technological processes which are increasingly directed at competitiveness and effectiveness rather than human resources .
We should also be happy at the fact that life expectancy has increased but we should not forget that this life expectancy in some cases will be independent while in others it will be dependent .
We must families with children , especially single parent families and disabled families .
At this moment in time if the population is actually diminishing in Europe and having problems , then this is due to our economic model and should send out a clear message to our people : there are too many people and too many young people and at the same time there is no possibility for demography to advance .
We must stop Old Europe being converted into a decrepit and regressive Europe and that is the role of the European Parliament .
We really must favour family life , parenthood , respect for elderly people ; all of this has to be the object of cultural promotion , just as women 's rights and just as the future single currency will also have to be promoted .
That must be this Parliament 's chief concern .
I live in a region which goes by the name of Asturias which has come into the international limelight recently with the signing there of an agreement on human rights and bio-medicine .
We must check whether these scientific committees have in fact , with the criteria approved in this regulation , been able to give what we might call their seal of approval to this report .
We would therefore ask for greater emphasis to be placed on safety aspects since , although many of my colleagues have dwelt upon labelling in recent years , labelling is an ancillary and not a fundamental matter .
Such violations must be denounced before this house , but always clearly and meticulously , after detailed study of each alleged case to establish whether there has been damage to appropriate measures of protection and respect for human rights , or whether the violation has been properly dealt with under the national legal and administrative systems .
So a report on human rights must be structured on the principles contained in the Treaty of Rome .
Issues relating to jobs , wages , working conditions , respect for minorities , the fight against racism , and so on , have a great deal to do with human rights .
Only foreigners from Union countries are good foreigners in the European Union .
Many people are working on these issues in society , and especially in local and regional government which have prime responsibility for problems of arrival and abode - and I mention arrival because that is what is happening in my country - relating to people from third countries .
The difficulties lie in attaining the targets for reducing debt and public deficits , because , in addition to essential budgetary austerity , it is crucial to meet the forecasts for economic growth , which are the most important indicators - in my view - at this time .
The introduction of the words 'in most cases ' in the Committee on Civil Liberties restricts a universal right which is implicitly recognized in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights , leaving it to the arbitrary decision of governments .
And yet citizens are experiencing day by day the economic horror which provided the recent title for a famous French bestseller .
In conclusion , we socialists think it is wrong to reduce all economic policy to the objective of ensuring a healthy economic framework .
Because money could be recovered in that way and I know it has only been applied in certain very particular cases in southern countries , but I do not know if it has been done for cattle fraud , cereals fraud or other types of fraud .
So the Group of the European People 's Party will vote for all the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Economic Affairs , and for Amendment No 21 which we have tabled .
The first point I feel bound to approach as rapporteur is the need and justification for this Community action .
As this is a question of intellectual property it comes under article 100A of the Treaty of the European Community , as established by the Court of Justice ruling of 13 July 1995 in the case of Spain versus the Council .
Besides involving these two sub-markets , the purchase and sale of
