, Mrs Segelström and Mrs Westlund , do not agree with this .
We do not agree with the general criticism made of the Council for having reduced the size of the budget .
That is particularly the case regarding agricultural aid .
We believe that the commitments for 2005 definitely should not exceed the Commission ’s proposal of 1.14 % .
The aim should be to come down below the expenditure ceiling of 1 % of gross domestic income .
The EU should avoid interfering in the democratic process in the Member States .     We believe that the European Union’s policy on fisheries agreements needs to be revised .
We believe that , if the EU concludes a fisheries agreement with a third country , the total amount of financial compensation for this third country must be funded by those EU Member States whose fishing vessels make use of what is offered under the agreement in question .
With its long experience and global importance , the UN is better placed to implement them .
Although we are very well disposed towards different countries showing solidarity with one another when disasters occur , we do not believe that this is primarily an issue for the EU , but that the Member States’ respective national parliaments should decide what financial resources should be provided when a serious accident occurs in another Member State .     There are a number of sensible points of view in the motion for a resolution , but also a number of proposals that it is impossible for us members of the June List to vote in favour of .
Last part of paragraph 33 : ‘[ The European Parliament ] urges continued parallel reform of the common fisheries policy , including the creation of a European Fisheries Fund’ .
We did so not because we thought that the proposal was perfect in all respects .
We must not turn the best into the enemy of the good when we judge the new draft Constitution .
Secondly , the social clause in Part III , which obliges the EU to meet the social objectives in all the areas of competence .
Sixthly , the introduction of a legal basis for services of general economic interest .
Seventhly , the fact that EU citizens are now able to take initiatives .
If the purpose had been only to reduce the defence budget through greater efficiency , that is what would have been stated .
This may cause anxiety in the wider world , which remembers the last time we wanted to spread our civilisation with the help of the army .
It is something I reject .     The PEACE programme is justified as an internal matter for the EU.
There were many who laughed in a rather indulgent way then .
Through the Convention and through hard work , especially here in the European Parliament , we now have a draft European Constitution .
Certainly , a lot could have been better , and many fellow MEPs have talked about the fact in this House .
Finally , I regret that the Convention did not discuss the issue of the European Parliament’s seat .
We shall be able to adopt new reforms and shall be able in the future to take further steps with a view to the next Convention and the next Constitution .
Nor does the Treaty of Nice make it any easier for us to cooperate with so many Member States .
When the will of the people changes in a country , it must be possible for policy to be changed .
What is presented here as a Constitution is an attempt by the political establishment to usurp the European peoples ’ democratic right to shape their own futures .
That is why the June List rejects this draft .     I too wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy .
One example is the case of a French company that wishes to produce gravestones being prevented from doing so by Germans and exposed to threats of fines .
It is time for European leaders to begin to act .
A better environment and improved self-sufficiency are naturally very important and bring about economic growth .
Obviously , that is not the case .
Nothing was mentioned about what is perhaps the most important legislative process under way , namely the Chemicals Directive , REACH.
Finally , I should like to congratulate you on a very good presentation of the priorities and hope that , during the next six months , you will be able to achieve the objectives you have established .     The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of the report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , A6-0070/2004 .
The Constitutional Treaty makes the basic rules governing cooperation in the European Union easier to understand .
We therefore support the proposed Constitutional Treaty .     We have voted against this report .
The EU is thus no longer a federation of states , which is what we believe it should be , but a federal state .
We protest about the fact that , in connection with the reading of this report , the majority in the European Parliament is to invest EUR 340 000 of taxpayers ’ money in a spectacle to launch the ‘yes ’ campaign for the adoption of the ‘EU Constitution ’ by the Member States .     I have chosen to differ from my political group and shall vote against the report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe .
I voted in favour of Sweden’s becoming a member of the EU in the 1994 referendum , and I am sincerely in favour of the idea of international cooperation in solving common problems .
There are important tasks we must perform together , especially where the environment , human trafficking and social dumping are concerned
