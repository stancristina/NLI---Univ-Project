vision of the world , their knowledge , their ways of being , knowing and acting , and these qualities are being completely wasted across all social , institutional , economic and political processes .
Instruments are available to us which can provide a more balanced division of tasks between men and women , so that they can reconcile their private and professional lives .
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying , as the Commissioner has already said : around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees , waiting for a helicopter to come and save them .
I would like to emphasise , however , that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing .
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves .
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation , representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique .
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us .
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft , especially helicopters , of which it is clear that too few are in action .
It is true that Mozambique ' s democracy is still far from perfect , as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them .
As has already been said , helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us .
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets .
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau , according to which what we need is a flexible workforce .
Firstly , fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin .
This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa , where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry .
For better or for worse , the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life .
Furthermore , this view was accepted in the Commission ' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses .
The Commission feels , for this reason too , that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation , but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission ' s opinions on the amendments under discussion .
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person , this idea is clearly defined in Article 3 .
The EC consequently takes the view that there is absolutely no lack of clarity about the specifications given in his written answer by Commissioner Patten when he said , and I quote in the original English : " ... as already explained in the communication , Israeli settlements or occupied territories cannot be considered by the Community as part of Israeli territory for implementation of the EC-Israel agreement .
Hence , the relevance of your second question on the effectiveness of the verification system .
In the event that these initiatives , which are currently under way , do not enable the origin of a product to be determined , the Commission may have to look at the possibility of calling a meeting of the Customs Cooperation Committee , in which the differences of opinion on verification procedures in this kind of agreement could be resolved .
The Commission is therefore seeking to confirm to both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian authorities that we are willing to accept this proposal , which we feel will allay the concerns that you have raised here , Mrs Morgantini .
The Commission is also aware that the political importance attributed to the peace process by the European Union is reflected in Parliament and in the Commission , as has been said here by various Members and is a result of the recent visit to the region by President Nicole Fontaine as well as President Romano Prodi' s very recent visit last week .
We are also convinced that we are taking positive steps to create an atmosphere of mutual trust which is always the best basis on which to build peace , because the Middle East has no alternative but to achieve peaceful coexistence between all of the peoples living there .
It is therefore necessary to adopt measures under the common fisheries policy and to provide appropriate financial resources to guarantee the income of those who depend entirely on fishing for their livelihood , such as fishermen , particularly at times when fishing activity is suspended or reduced .
We can safely say that the European Union is at the moment gaining in substance .
It could be said that our economy and society are today facing the challenge of a new model , the model of the knowledge-based economy and society .
The second fear , which is perhaps more serious , is that in order to recover this leading position , in order not to lose ground irreversibly , Europe may have to put its own social model at risk , to make social exclusion in Europe worse , and this will affect our own citizens .
