I therefore look forward with great interest to the report which the Commission is to present within six months , so that we can finally approve the Commission 's policy .
With what intermediaries is the Commission allowed to work ?
I believe that this whole problem - which has never really been resolved in the European Union , but is becoming more and more significant because of the take-up of external aid and the scale of the Structural Funds - is one which deserves greater attention .
So in the short term , there is no point in ending this production of tobacco - we should simply import it from other countries , which is of no benefit at all to Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am one of those who wish to see an end to the contrast between our policies on health and agriculture .
Mr President , I am afraid I cannot accept that , because it does not actually remove the real problem .
I anticipate great problems with the rapporteur 's proposed financing of the Council 's decision on agricultural prices .
That is very much open to question .
The shift to rail transport consequently remains a pipe-dream , even though virtually everyone in Parliament says they think it is essential .
My main objection to the system of taxes proposed by the Committee on Transport is that it does not distinguish between Euro I and Euro II vehicles .
Recent research in the Netherlands has shown that the use of less polluting engines has reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide , despite an increase in the total number of kilometres travelled in road transport .
For these reasons , I voted in favour of most of the amendments tabled by the Green Group .
Firstly , ASEAN has spoken in very critical terms about Cambodia 's proposed accession .
There are still far too many people going about freely who ought to be appearing before the tribunal in The Hague .
The situation of the people there is much worse than in the Federation territory , let alone Serbia or Croatia .
The greatest possible cooperation is called for , so that the rule of law is finally restored in the area .
Nor do I wish to express an opinion about the equally gratuitous statement in the resolution that the death penalty is ineffective as a deterrent , a means of preventing crime .
Freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial are being trampled underfoot .
I think it is right that Parliament should speak out against this , while saying at the same time that we must do everything to banish and take legal action against this genital mutilation , not least in our own Member States .
I would therefore draw a political conclusion : it is important for the EU to adopt and conclude the association agreement as quickly as possible , so that we can include Egypt permanently in our Mediterranean policy activities .
So matters are in hand in that respect .
Mr President , when a rapporteur tells us something , it has to correspond to what is in the amendment , and those two words are not used here .
The Commission 's initiative in producing this communication must therefore be strongly supported by the European Parliament , and we in Parliament must not be too hesitant in our response .
If we use the checklist here which is set out in detail in the Commission 's communication , that should be done satisfactorily .
It is clear to me that it must be decided that increases in productivity will be used primarily in favour of jobs in future , to extract guarantees of work if there is wage restraint .
Is it logical that the Council can then simply reject such an agreement , without any procedure being laid down for what is to happen afterwards ?
I then come to the difficulty which has already been raised here by a number of Members , namely that there are still three partners in the social dialogue and that small and medium-sized undertakings are still absent .
I do not need to repeat here how important SMUs are in socio-economic terms in Europe .
It was originally 15 % .
Is this happening in the interest of our environment policy , for example ?
Nor is too much scope for vertical agreements a good thing , since retailers can then become pawns in the game of chess played out between major distributors and producers .
According to the Green Paper , these are admission thresholds .
In my opinion , national , regional or local rules must continue to be possible .
And it was already being said then that the budgets for Leonardo , Socrates and Youth for Europe were on the low side .
That is what I am calling for here today .
The disintegration of the Soviet economy resulted in trade and payment transactions coming to a standstill , a slump in production , arrears in payments , and hyperinflation .
Moreover , Tajikistan is not yet able to guarantee that it will meet its payment obligations to the Union .
That has our approval .
It gives me particular pleasure to be able to pass on my best wishes to Mr Van Miert , because I have very good memories of him from the time when he was Commissioner for transport .
Given its importance for democracy , I believe the matter should be debated in this part-session .
The subject is being discussed everywhere else , so why not in this Parliament ?
As chairman of the Committee on Women 's Rights , I can tell you that the committee has discussed the sterilizations in Sweden , Finland , France , Denmark , and no
