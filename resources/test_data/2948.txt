is , is it feasible and is the proposal in question an adequate proposal now that circumstances have changed ?
Can we continue with the same approach to the employment strategy ?
So today , we are better , much better placed to cope with a recession .
It would be a huge reversal at this stage if the Member States failed to focus their energies on efforts to apply the employment strategy as agreed .
The changes which we propose include three basic factors .
Unfortunately , there is still a huge discrepancy , as much as 15 % , between men 's and women 's wages for the same work .
There is the question of the social partners and their role , there is the question of flexibility and security on the job market and , to reply to Mrs Van Lancker , may I say that the Commission is determined to submit a proposal for a directive by the end of the year , due to the lack of success of the social partners .
The European Commission will examine a good number of them .
The austerity imposed on the Member States and the European Union as a whole means that even the budget lines available in the past have been cut back .
In fact , innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund can play a vital role in increasing employment and enhancing regional and social cohesion , the sine qua non to our strategic objectives , and we must not just make use of them , we must also take action to make up for lost time and lost resources , because the guidelines for innovative measures were only finally adopted a full year after the adoption of the structural fund regulations , which made delays in implementation unavoidable .
However , we also wish to express our concern as to the efficiency of this proposal , which is vaguely worded and riddled with weaknesses .
We understand , Commissioner , that innovation is a multidimensional , composite concept and , as such , hard to define and confine to specific sectors or lines of action .
That is why we propose that the European Commission should adopt fixed criteria to be taken into account in fixing support priorities for and selecting projects and to state them clearly in calls for proposals .
The importance of complementarity is clear from this morning 's debate .
We all support it but they themselves are ignorant of it .
We particularly welcome your reference , Commissioner , to equal opportunities and believe that this principle should distinguish not just how men and women are treated but also access to the policy on innovative measures by regions which lack innovation and face particular structural problems , such as mountain and island regions .
Of course , your efforts alone will not suffice and the Member States must not be left out of this process .
The first is optimising the application of Article 6 and the second is having the best , most efficient relations between the European Parliament and the Commission .
This was announced in February 2001 .
The evaluation of these plans was strengthened at the European Parliament 's request and now we do not just evaluate each plan individually , we also evaluate the measures as a whole so that we can assess their complementarity .
Of course , there are other ways of working together and exchanging more views .
The new directive certainly responds to the change in the situation which has taken place over the last twenty-five years as regards women 's employment and vocational training and replaces an outdated legislative framework which has done what it can to combat discrimination against women , serious infringements of the principle of equality , higher unemployment rates , the exclusion of women from numerous professions and the general division of the job market along gender lines .
Both the rapporteur and all the political groups showed willing , although it was difficult to strike a balance between the ambitious objectives set by the European Union for women 's employment and the quality of jobs , the already high acquis communautaire on equal treatment for men and women and the exceptional , high-level performance by certain Member States which have gone beyond the proposals for the directive ( Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Smet referred to experiences in Greece and Belgium ) and the real need to maintain flexibility and the status of female employment during a downswing in the economy and on the labour market , help speed up cooperation with the Council and the European Commission and avoid overburdening the text with important women 's issues such as equal pay , which are dealt with elsewhere , and achieve the consensus and majority needed .
In my personal experience , this procedure has given all of us , European institutions , national governments , social partners and social agencies , a more responsible attitude to women 's problems and to the importance of female employment to our development objectives .
Personally , I support Amendment No 17 on the recognition of paternity as a factor in the strategy to promote new working conditions , as a factor in the balanced participation of men and women in family and professional life and as acknowledgement of the social values of family life and support for women in their multiple and simultaneous roles .
The simplest way would be to adopt fully unified criteria for each classification level and for all the Member States .
Given past injustices , the reasonable doubts of European citizens should not be brushed aside with replies along the lines of " this area is supported , even though it is better off than yours because it is a NUTS II territorial unit , whereas yours is n't "
