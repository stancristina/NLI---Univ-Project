Ukraine will soon be a neighbour of the EU.
I have had the opportunity to meet various representatives in the country , for example the young mayor , Natalia Gnatyuk , and the leader of the young people 's movement of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church , Andriy Yaniv.
Secondly , I wonder whether , in light of the fact that both countries are developing in the same direction , it is tenable or reasonable in the long term to treat Ukraine and Belarus as differently as we are at present .
As early as 11 April 2000 , the Commission submitted its communication on Internet policy 1998 - 2000 and we know that the ICANN meeting in Melbourne was concluded yesterday .
Mr Paasilinna , the Commissioner and I have had the privilege of being able to read newspapers which have reported something of what has supposedly taken place in Melbourne .
Is it true that a Norwegian company has got the top domain name ?
Even Mr Paasilinna said that there could be cause for criticism in this area .
The same question was asked by Mr Paasilinna .
We need to work more quickly .
These include ethical issues within the medical sphere , environmental and consumer issues in connection with the cultivation of genetically modified crops and global issues of justice in connection with patent rights and the dominance of the industry by large multinational corporations .
There must be strong , independent and open public research in the field so that there is also research into areas which are not of immediate commercial interest and into the problems and risks posed by the technology .
Such regulations must be a precondition for considering whether to embark upon the large-scale commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops .
That means that our citizens ' fears and anxieties must be taken seriously .
I should prefer to focus on the possibility of using biotechnology to design new pesticides and chemicals which work where they have to work and are broken down when they have to be broken down .
We must have a truthful and open-minded attitude both to opportunities and difficulties .
I am very glad that the report is to include paragraph 62 which addresses the protection of the individual 's personal integrity whenever genetic information is used .
We Swedish Social Democrats believe that nuclear power is not an ecologically sustainable source of energy .
We Swedish Christian Democrats wish to emphasise that we voted against the second and third parts in the split vote on paragraph 36 which asserted - mistakenly - that 'a clear framework now exists for the release of genetically modified organisms in Europe which will ensure maximum consumer protection and environmental protection ' and - also mistakenly - that 'it would therefore not be justified to continue the de facto moratorium on the release of GMOs ' .
Nonetheless , the proposed ban on animal experiments is not in itself enough , because the industry could quite simply conduct its experiments outside the EU instead .
As a liberal , I care a great deal about the rights of individuals .
In this connection , I would ask you to pay particular attention to Amendment No 39 , which proposes that animal-tested products should be required to be labelled with the words , ' Tested on animals ' .
We support all the important parts of the report .
Nor is there any doubt about public opinion on this issue .
If such a ban is to be effective , it nonetheless needs to be combined with a marketing ban .
That is , of course , what has to be fought for ; the right to tougher , more progressive legislation .
We believe , then , that this cannot be an argument for not pursuing this issue .
We believe that more account must be taken of people with allergies .
This is my way of saying that we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left will be voting for all the principal points in this report .
However , PVC also has other qualities , being the source of unusually hazardous waste .
We find it an encouraging sign that we have been given a Green Paper in this area , but we hope that this will soon be followed up by a more comprehensive legislative initiative .
Well , first of all , there must be a reduction in total use , at the same time as substitute materials are promoted .
It is important for this to be combined with an import ban , so that the measure is comprehensive in scope .
Legislation would be more effective and more environmentally friendly than a voluntary agreement .
That means an efficient labelling system , however , and it has to be realised that much of the recycling done at present is a failure .
As I said before , the reason for this is that if there is no legislation and if the latter is not combined with an import ban , there is a risk of the measure ' s not being effective enough .
That is why it is appropriate to mention the substitution principle in this context too .
We have in actual fact undertaken to receive new countries as Member States in time for the European elections in 2004 , and most of us are probably agreed that this is a great and historic commitment of ours and something which should also be reflected in the Budget guidelines .
In my view , that does not emerge clearly enough in the section relating to the Commission .
We do not know to which countries this will apply , or how many of them there will be .
The enlargement process does not only entail a commitment with which the
