Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this debate is really very important , in the sense that it offers us various practical prospects for the application of the euro process .
There is also a more technical but equally important matter , which Mr Wolf spoke about : namely , accountability - in other words , the real transparency which should characterize this whole process , both at the level of Member States ' national central banks and at the level of the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank .
From 1 January 1999 , there will be a single monetary policy for those countries in the euro zone , stretching from Lapland in the far north-east of the continent to Lepe or Cape Saint Vincent in the extreme south-west .
So our view is that we need a more determined approach than is shown in the Commission 's announcement of a few days ago , saying that all compulsory measures will be free whereas optional ones will depend on the market .
Tourism , which has become a mass phenomenon during this second half of the twentieth century , should serve to promote the euro - the currency of the twenty-first century .
The euro will help tourism .
Economic history is littered with examples of monetary authorities deciding to stimulate inflation in order to lessen the burden of national debt .
We cannot allow the future Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks to be deprived of all the possibilities for success which would be bound to result from the merging of so many central banks without having such varied rules .
It is well known that all rights have their limit , at the point where they come into conflict with the liberties and rights of other people .
We are very sensitive to disasters of all kinds - as we should be - but for some incomprehensible reason we find it exasperatingly easy to resign ourselves to accepting that enormous disaster which takes place week after week on the roads of the European Union , resulting each year in nearly 50 000 deaths and more than 1.65 million injuries .
Mr President , I want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , on his excellent report .
We must bear in mind that in recent years world investments have risen to over $ 10 billion - all direct international investments - and we are in a period of growth , with an annual increase of about $ 500 000-$ 600 000 million .
I think that is a view shared by a lot of people , in Parliament in general and , especially in this case , in the Committee on External Economic Relations .
Lastly , are efforts going to be made to ensure that there are more programmes , and that they are better funded in those places where there is most male chauvinism ?
I want to point out to the Commissioner that the FAO has called on the European Union to increase and strengthen its prevention and monitoring systems for the transformation and transmission of diseases in the area of agricultural health .
The report we are currently debating and will vote on tomorrow proposes three things : firstly , to bring Directive 93/75/EEC up to date , by requesting the inclusion of certain maritime transport safety requirements , especially with respect to irradiated nuclear fuel , plutonium and high-level radioactive waste ; secondly , to increase the amount of information to be supplied when transporting these types of goods ; and lastly , to facilitate future amendment of the directive 's annexes , by simple recourse to the committee procedure , in order to bring national regulations into line with established international regulations on maritime safety .
In it we propose that the INF Code defined in the directive should be the updated version , as in force on 1 January 1998 rather than 1996 .
What we are requesting is the implementation of a series of Community regulations , to try - among other things - to improve maritime safety and protect the marine environment for future generations .
Let us not forget , ladies and gentlemen , that we are talking about highly dangerous substances , such as irradiated nuclear fuel , plutonium or high-level radioactive waste , which persist in many cases - and I am not exaggerating - for more than 30 000 years , which is really saying something .
Mr Marset Campos will speak later on and will have plenty to say about some of the proposals we made in the amendments which the rapporteur has very kindly accepted from us .
So we stress that aspect , and also the need for help for non-governmental organizations and relatives who work closely with this type of patient .
Finally , that means we also need to increase the financial budget in order to address all these needs .
We think the amendments improve the Commission 's initiatives .
Surely like that they will be committed right from the start ?
Good morning , Mr President .
Mr President , on page 26 of the Minutes , where it refers to Question Time , it says , " Parliament considered a number of questions to the Commission ' .
I do not think we should see our role as a defensive one , like a critic or a Cato .
It has to be done with the due solemnity accorded to any declaration made in this Chamber .
So we are going to support the measures adopted by the contact group , call on Europe to play a greater role and , of course , support the mission which appears to have been accepted by the former president of the Spanish government , Felipe González .
That conference represents a milestone
