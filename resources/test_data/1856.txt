Forests , for example , not only supply us with the raw material wood and increase the oxygen content of air , but also clean our water and prevent erosion and flooding : a function of which awareness is growing in all corners of the world as the impact of climate change is increasingly felt .
Rather , the EU must concentrate on things that have real European added value , and here I can pick up directly what the previous speaker was saying : Europe should take action primarily on cross-border questions that one Member State is unable to deal with alone .
When funding NGOs , however , we must ensure there are strict criteria and transparency .
We have millions of people in the European Union who have had very positive experiences with complementary and alternative medicine , not forgetting environmental medicine .
Such supposedly deterrent measures are of doubtful success and I do not believe the public wants them .
I believe it is the minimum if we are to do any meaningful work at all .
If the further reduction you want were to become reality , it would mean we only had one third of the previous funding for what will be 27 states .
I would like to mention another figure here .
I would therefore like to suggest that we postpone this vote until March II instead of holding it this afternoon .     Mr President , this brief amendment requires a short explanation .
However , that makes it necessary to regulate these products , which go out into the world rather as ‘ambassadors ’ for a town or region .
A debate about the European Union’s ability to admit new members is therefore in my opinion long overdue .
Perhaps then we would have real consumer protection .     Mr President , Commissioner , like many or almost all of the Members who have spoken before me , I , too , would again like to stress that it is not sensible to combine consumer protection and public health in a joint action programme .
The problem is a completely different one : it lies east of the River Nister .
The European Parliament must send out clear signals here .     .
Of course , the question is , what will replace them ?
So far as the Pasat case – the case of the former Defence Minister – is concerned , the Commission has raised the problems surrounding this case several times .
To avoid setting off the fire alarms , we have only brought a small symbolic candle into plenary , which is burning at Mrs Pleštinská’s place , but it is intended to make clear the strength of our ties with the freedom movement in Belarus .     Mr President , Commissioner , up until now Kazakh President Nasarbayev has acted according to the old proverb ‘keep your friends close and your enemies even closer ’ and tried to include them in his regime .
I need only remind you of Charles Taylor from Liberia or Mengistu Haile Mariam from Ethiopia .
But we are also specifically discussing the case of the former dictator of Chad .
Every victim of terrorism is one victim too many .
You also show your democratic credentials in your ability to listen !
Defining Europe’s role in the globalised world as regards migration ?
You told this Parliament you would fight for these strategic objectives with this financial allocation .
No, without greater competitiveness we will be unable to maintain the social system in Europe , without greater competitiveness we will be unable to maintain the social model of Europe .
I fully support you on that .
We also need to include countries of supply and consumer countries in our debates .
I would also like to draw your attention in this connection to the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport .
Therefore , energy policy – and I should like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for putting the focus on energy efficiency – is a top priority .
The real question is this : will we ultimately win through politically , and be able to regulate appropriately and independently and separate the networks from everything else ?
I would therefore quite particularly like to say that the previous German Government 's decision to construct this pipeline under the Baltic Sea , bypassing Poland and the Baltic states , was a poor one .
It would be more important to take a really good look into ensuring that we can achieve our target for 2010 – 12 % of total energy consumption coming from renewable energy .
We cannot , as our fellow-Member from Poland has just said , do without current coal resources  – that is out of the question .
That is why we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels .
However , the Member States also need to get involved , because only a joint effort will bring us to our goal of security of supply , competitiveness and sustainability , which must be the main focus points of European energy policy .
The paragraph dealing with exactly what you asked about points out that in fulfilling its main objectives , the energy policy for Europe should ensure transparency and non-discriminatory markets ; be consistent with competition rules ; be consistent with public service obligations and fully respect Member States’ sovereignty over primary energy sources and choice of energy mix .
Some of this money is being used to fund initiatives that make a very direct contribution to improving the security situation in Congo , for example by creating humane living spaces for soldiers and their families or by providing modern equipment .
But they should be available .
On the other hand , we must , as the President-in-Office said ,
