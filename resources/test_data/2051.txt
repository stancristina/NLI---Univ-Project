There is no question but that we must send tens of thousands of peace workers , both civilian and military , irrespective of whether the United States and Israel say we must not .
We must not send them to Israel and we must not bomb Israeli towns .
Why are you so afraid to act , Mr Solana and Mr Patten ?
Summaries of the applications would be translated into all the Community languages .
In Europe , we at present have rules which are difficult to interpret and which mean that the universities cannot make the most of their opportunities .
Even at the first reading we had achieved fairly broad compromises in Parliament , and I think it has been a strength that we have been able to retain most of these compromises at the second reading too .
Nor must this present any obstacle to those countries which wish to progress more quickly and which already have more progressive legislation in quite a few of these areas .
The Council 's proposal can be improved in a number of further respects .
In another part of Finland , where ' Rosk 'n Roll ' operates , waste is collected and advice dispensed in return for a special eco-fee .
There must be common systems in which the principles of the market economy apply .
I do not in actual fact believe that the amendment concerning flame retardants is of any benefit to the environment .
It is a big responsibility to take decisions about public health and the environment that are to apply for a long time into the future .
The European Chemicals Bureau believes that , when it comes to oktaBDE and dekaBDE , the risk assessment and situation are now the same as they were for pentaBDE , when the result was a total ban .
Following the reappraisal and the new risk assessment , we must also arrange for the precautionary principle to prevail .
In 80 per cent of cases , the use of brominated flame retardants involves the use of dekaBDE.
Mr President , the rapporteur 's proposal and the proposals adopted by the committee entail a tougher attitude than the Council 's common position , and that , I think , is good .
Moreover , we are in possession of the arguments right now , and we know that these substances , which are hazardous , accumulate in the human body and are increasingly present in our living environment .
One of the signatories of the paper is the Director-General of the Swedish emergency services authority , comprised of experts on , for example , fire protection , and that authority too is prepared to say that flame retardants have had their day .
The reason our products burn as well as they do is that we already use chemicals in them .
So how quickly is it prepared to act ?
The substance accumulates in nature and , as has already been pointed out , it has been found in mother 's milk .
The directive is far-reaching , covering all uses of pentaBDE and all types of goods containing this substance .
I can understand and share the anxiety felt by MEPs regarding other , closely related substances not included in the original area of application of the proposed directive , and I wish to comment on this , as well as on the issue of timing .
On the basis of the results of this work , the Commission will table a new proposal at the beginning of next year , that is to say at the beginning of 2003 .
Nor is the Commission able to approve the amendment according to which there would be a total ban on dekaBDE as from 1 January 2006 if the risk assessment were to show that there are risks associated with the substance .
We are concerned here with Mr Florenz 's report , which has also been debated during this sitting .
Suitable measures can then be taken immediately .
Just like China , which we shall be discussing later , Russia is using the fight against terrorism as a kind of alibi for oppressing its own political opponents and minorities .
It is true that a number of positive signs can be detected .
Death squads , summary executions , torture , rape and disappearances .
Their situation is , of course , incredibly precarious .
We must be very clear in demanding of Russia that it put an end without delay to the atrocities and massacres directed against civilians .
The ELDR Group demands that an independent committee of investigation be sent to Chechnya to ascertain what is really happening .
Together with the OSCE and the Council of Europe , the EU can play a role in facilitating talks so that we can bring about a political solution .
The truth , however , is that the EU 's contribution to the UNHCR 's budget has declined by a third in recent years .
The ELDR Group supports the resolution before us , even though we think it is rather faint-hearted .
At the same time , there are continuing protests by workers about the fact that at least 25 million jobs have disappeared in state-owned companies as a result of liberalisation and privatisation .
In spite of a series of reforms , grassroots democracy has not seriously taken root .
Citizens ' rights and democracy must be promoted in all circumstances .
Nonetheless , something is perhaps in the process of happening .
Certainly we can be cautious .
Our reason for doing so is that we wish to keep down the costs of patent applications , and we therefore advocate a solution in terms of just one or two languages .
In that way , continued access to local expertise within the patent sphere is guaranteed in all
