a lack of rigorous information .
The other committees must take responsibility in the knowledge that new policies mean new expenditure , that for every increase there must be a cut .
At that time - and I must insist on this - the European Central Bank displayed skill , good leadership and management and the ability to maintain the principles of independence .
In the current phase of European construction we are seeing significant economic and monetary integration processes , which have been speeded up since the adoption of the single currency .
Mr Solbes said in an appearance before this Parliament that he would try to cooperate with the Members without prejudice to the quality of his work .
And as a Spaniard I must mention Charles I , who wanted to unify the European currencies on the basis of the Cologne mark .
The spokesman of my group has expressed this very well and I will not repeat it .
But we must also warn - and you understand this perfectly - that bad decisions regarding monetary policy may harm growth and prevent the economic recuperation which has started .
( ES ) Mr President , my intervention will be very brief , and I simply wish to highlight the importance of the presence of Governor Duisenberg in Parliament for the analysis of the first report of the Central Bank .
Mr President , I am going to ask three questions on behalf of my Socialist colleagues in the Committee on Development and Cooperation , who are here in spirit but physically are in the Committee itself , voting on the amendments relating to the World Trade Organisation .
These are the things that determine culture , give meaning to liberty and open up the path leading to the achievement of shared goals .
We know that this is the time for cooperation , not for confrontation nor for intervention .
" Is there a civil war in Colombia ? "
The Colombian conflict , under its own steam , has undergone serious changes and , without doubt , the force with which drug-trafficking exploded in Colombia in the Eighties has been the element which has led to the greatest increase in violence .
While the military capability of the violent groups is increasing , largely thanks to drug money , the civil population is asking to be freed from the conflict , since they have realised that it is they who suffer as a result and it is their fundamental rights which are violated day after day .
There has also been a lot of speculation about the so-called "zone of peace " .
Peace processes take time and require patience , a lot of patience .
I am totally committed to the defence of human rights .
In addition , a Presidential Decree has been issued to promote respect for non-governmental organisations which operate in the field of human rights .
There is no nation in the world which has offered up as many martyrs as Colombia in the fight against drug trafficking .
This principle requires us to confront together the serious global problem of drugs , at every link in the chain ; that is to say , production , distribution , consumption , money laundering , the diversion of chemical ingredients and arms sales .
In this struggle , ladies and gentlemen , we need you as partners and allies .
We also understand that we must tackle the problem of polluting emissions .
It is not a military plan .
You are largely responsible for leading the rapprochement with those countries which are building hope for themselves and which are eager for the third millennium to bring genuine successes .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , first of all I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency on the success of Tampere with regard to the opening up of a new stage in the development of European citizenship , dealing with the always difficult balance between liberty and security .
The second is immigration .
The Straits of Gibraltar and the Andalusian coasts are the silent witnesses of the tragic deaths of human beings .
The action plans approved seem to me to be very interesting .
And it seems important , bearing in mind everything that has been said here , to point out an issue which , in my opinion , symbolises this setting for the citizen .
You have at least fifteen enormously important mandates to perform .
What must it mean ?
It must not mean new competences for the European Union .
And I wish to say , Mr President , that that is not the European Union which many of us have fought for and in which many of us believe .
Therefore , I am especially pleased that our resolution opts for social dialogue as a method for resolving conflicts .
Since we are always so self-critical , I believe that we should welcome this step .
And in the Union , where we have all ratified the Test Ban Treaty , we have political and moral arguments to address to our American partners so that we can remind them that they have a serious responsibility to try to stabilise the world and that they can rely on our help if it is really possible to cooperate with them .
How can the European Union deny this very right to the Chechen people ?
The joint position of the Council has not yet accepted the Parliament ' s criteria and the rapporteur , reasonably , has retained in this second reading the ones which he considers to be essential .
The system of knowledge , the human emotions which only the Arts and Letters can produce , in other words , our culture , are deeply based on what the Europeans have in common and therefore form the basis of European citizenship
