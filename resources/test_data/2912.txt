There is , in fact , undeniable tension between the supranational and regional dimensions : tension which is historical , for the more European development has tended towards the supranational , the more - I regret to say - we have lost sight of the fact that , within many States , regionalisation processes were developing with characteristics and approaches to decentralisation which were different from what we were developing in the European Union .
It is the basis for a debate which will take place formally in the Convention , probably at the beginning of February .
This is a debate which greatly concerns us and which we must vigorously oppose , using the weapons of the law and legislation to oppose the weapons of violence , insofar as this can be deemed lawful .
Violations in Italy continue to be very frequent .
It is certainly wide-ranging - too wide-ranging in terms of the issues addressed .
It is in line with her own personal beliefs , but it contrasts with the attitude of the vast majority of Europe 's citizens , who certainly do not see homosexual unions and the right to adopt as the ideal formula on which to build the European society of tomorrow .
As far as my country , Italy , is concerned , these have been developed on borders with Member States such as France and Austria and on borders with third countries such as Switzerland too , and with a candidate country , Slovenia .
I would also like to mention that the committee of which I am chairman has worked well on this matter , as always .
I regret to say that there is no genuine European rail network .
Mr President , I am sleeping very well at the moment and I have had a lot of dreams .
In the same dream , Mr President , still at the Palais de l'Europe casino , another player at the table was Mr Sterckx .
Mr President , Mrs Ainardi was also playing at the Palais de l'Europe casino in my dream - a game of poker in this case - with the other rapporteurs on the European railways .
Mr President , last night , I dreamed about Mr Napolitano too .
Mr Napolitano , who is the rapporteur of this document on the role of the regional authorities , was the President of the WUR - the World Union of Regions - in my dream .
I feel that this is an area in which , in any case , it is for the Member States to decide .
This was clear throughout your speech .
We therefore feel that we are in complete harmony with the Greek Presidency and its programme for Europe , both as regards its intention to develop the work that needs to be done within the institutions on matters such as the Members ' Statute and the issue of rules on parties and as regards the two major themes which were at the heart of Prime Minister Simitis ' speech , enlargement and unification : we want a wider Europe but we also want a more unified Europe .
That means - and we must not forget it - that it does not lose any of its value with enlargement but actually becomes more important .
This time last year , I laid stress on the unsustainable delivery gap between agreement on policy and action to turn policy into legislation .
The unsatisfactory performance of some countries is holding back the overall development of the Union .
In addition to a list of things to do , with which we are all familiar and of which everyone is quite aware , there are moments when some factors assume more importance .
Without investment and innovation , we will not achieve growth and we will not be able to maintain our present levels of prosperity .
Today , in Europe , such conditions are not widespread enough .
Yet this represents a 25 % increase in applied scientists and engineers .
Whereas our young people , who are going to the United States in ever-increasing numbers , stay there for the most part , I can tell you that the majority of Asians and Chinese - and there are currently tens of thousands of Chinese studying in the United States - go back home .
Mr President , Prime Minister , time and time again , the European Union has confounded the most sceptical critics with bold , resolute initiatives .
Let this be clear : if Europe does not undertake a major common research programme to bring back the drained brains from abroad , to make the most of our young people , to create a breeding ground for scientific and cultural knowledge , then we are lost .
In the past month , there have been 8 million new subscribers to mobile telephone networks in China - in one month .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in financial markets , where the liquidity of the market is closely related to the confidence operators have in the reliability of securities payment and settlement systems , the inefficient operation of the latter can represent a source of risk for the markets themselves .
Reliable payment and settlement systems require a clear legal framework , rules and procedures to govern securities holding , transfers , lending and related payments , as well as the imposition of constraints on these securities .
There has never been a price war , as market liquidity is controlled by a single active player .
With regard to taxation barriers , the difficulties do not stem only from the differences between systems but also from strong resistance to change and harmonisation by some Member States .
A quick read through reveals that these are all public utility services .
Here are some examples : in the European Union ,
