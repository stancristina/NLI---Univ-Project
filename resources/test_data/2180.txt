in place will be the lowest possible level of protection from absolute impoverishment , in order to avoid social uprisings .     – Mr President , the invasion by Israel and the flattening of southern Lebanon , the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people , many of whom received the hospitality of the people of Cyprus , the massacre of victims , all this proves the failure of the doctrine of the so-called war against terrorism .
President Abbas and efforts to form a government of national unity must be given political support .
Europe therefore has vital reasons for seeking peace and development in the region .
It is demonstrating this with its intention to apply the Security Council resolution , the need to clarify the content and the role of the peacekeeping force and its participation in this force .
The magazine refers to the apartheid being imposed by the Israeli authorities on the Palestinians on the subject of water .
This will give an incentive to the Palestinian people , an incentive to the moderate reform forces in Palestine and the Hamas forces to integrate peacefully into the democratic life of Palestine .     – Mr President , thank you for such a complete reply and for the prospects which are opening up .
The third part of the European Youth Pact makes provision for measures to reconcile the family and professional lives of young people , so that they can create new families in Europe .
Does the Finnish Presidency intend at the end of its term of office to present us with the positive results of its actions on reconciling family and professional life ?     – Mr President , Commissioner , according to the official statistics of the Chinese national statistics office , the rate of growth of the Chinese economy for the whole of 2005 has been revised from 9.9 % to 10.2 % , due to faster growth in industrial activity and the services sector .
It is a development scenario which is an unobtainable dream for Europe and the United States .
We need to put at the centre of a cooperation agreement with China the further opening up of the Chinese economy to European companies , something which requires legislative and administrative regulations .
Promoting and applying eco-labelling systems strengthens environmental awareness among consumers , thereby encouraging environmental responsibility among producers , by making them more aware of the environmental repercussions of fisheries and aquaculture .
I also wish to congratulate the Commission on starting a dialogue on eco-labelling .
An effort must be made to inform consumers , who must support it , be informed and understand that , in buying eco-labelled products , they can be sure that they are buying healthy and safe food and that they are protecting the environment .
We need to sit down at the same table , we need to consult them and they need to understand that the effort being made is in their interest .
Who convened this meeting ?
You said here , ‘they could become binding’ , you did not say , ‘they will become binding’ .
Finally , could you please tell us , Mr Vice-President , the story of the European PNR which , it would appear , you discussed in London ?
Will it be an effective measure when the United States , even today , refuses to tell us if use of the PNR with America was necessary or effective ?
No one here denies that an anti-terrorist policy and cooperation are needed .
I understand that recent events in London have heightened interest , in Member States , about data transfers .
However , I should like to emphasise that our common objective , to safeguard public security , is self-evident .
However , in all cases , on such a serious issue , there must be close cooperation between the institutions , with the active – I repeat – participation of the European Parliament , especially the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , at all levels of negotiation .
With these comments , I think that we shall vote for the opinion expressed in my honourable friend 's report .     – Mr President , the debate on the protection of personal data reminds us every time of the theatre of the absurd .
Thirdly , the existence of secret prisons is denounced by those who were members of the governments and signed agreements with the United States of America and who then come here to the European Parliament and protest .
The so-called 'anti-terrorism campaign ' has one objective : to terrorise the people and subjugate them , but we believe that it will not ultimately succeed in doing so .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is an important day for me personally and , at the same time , for my colleagues and for the Committee on Culture and Education because , following an entire project lasting about one year , I have the pleasure today of presenting to plenary my report on the protection of the European natural , architectural and cultural heritage in rural and island regions .
My proposals contained in the report are directed at the European Union , the Member States , local and regional authorities and European citizens , who are called upon to take specific measures to maintain and promote it .
Given that Community programmes in the culture sector do not offer adequate funding , additional funds to maintain the heritage must be found , together with other Community resources : within the framework of the common agricultural policy , in the Structural Funds and in the LEADER , URBAN and INTERREG Community initiatives , which are to be incorporated in the next financial period into the new political cohesion and CAP financing instruments .
