It is not up to the authorities to say how many women must go out to work .
And the Members of the European Union must stop lying .
Africa ' s initial objective was to achieve independence , with nation states instead of ethnic tribes , and the result was Rwanda , the Hutus and the Tutsis , Nigeria , the Ibos , and Biafra .
In practical terms , Africa will achieve the first stage in growth according to the Rostow model if it protects its agriculture , its livestock farming , its self-employed craft industry , and its emergent economy .
All the more reason not to flood Africa with the unregulated world economy and not to flood Europe with an influx of people .
I do not know of a single example of a country which made any progress by applying their directives .
Furthermore , we were critical of the authorisation procedures stipulated in the proposal , which seemed to us too lenient and inordinately centralised .
Consumers want to be certain of the operators ' ability to monitor the origin of meat accurately .
Labelling is no safeguard against GMOs , chocolate containing vegetable fats or , tomorrow , GMO fats , or , at a later date , American hormone-treated beef , or prion-infected meat .
Madam President , I wish to inform you and the Members who come into daily contact , although sometimes without noticing them , with the Parliament staff who ensure the running of the House as a whole , that certain sections ( security guards , receptionists , firemen ) were on strike yesterday afternoon .
I would like to tell you how much I appreciate the very high quality of the report presented by your two rapporteurs , Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos and Jo Leinen , which we are now debating .
But we also proposed two options on that basis .
My second comment relates to the active involvement of your Parliament , which is vital to our success .
So we can see some progress and certainly a political will to move forward .
The interest that is being shown in this draft Charter and the support for its incorporation in the Treaty confirm what I regard as the need to reaffirm , over and over again , the fundamental values of the EU , to set down once and for all the principles shared by all the citizens of Europe .
We must seek the best while remaining within the realm of the possible .
The same is true of a Council in which the qualified majority rules have to be readjusted and whose proposed method of operation will inevitably lead to deadlock and inconsistency , and of a Commission in which the rule must be one member per Member State .
Mr President , if the problem about sounding the bell is that the sitting has to resume first , the solution is quite simple .
The European Parliament has just given way on three vital issues , in circumstances I consider shameful : On banning the release of GMOs containing antibiotic-resistant genes : Amendments Nos 11 and 37 which called for such GMOs not to be released into the environment were rejected .
Coming back to the issue under discussion today , this is a proposal to amend Directive 90/220/EEC , which covers both the deliberate release of GMOs for experimental purposes and their deliberate release with a view to putting the products concerned on the market .
On antibiotics I would be in favour of a ban on the use in GMOs of genes conferring antibiotic resistance .
Let us look back for a moment at the embargo on beef .
Far from focussing on social and democratic rights , indeed looking more to the US social model , the summit once again sang the praises of the law of profit , workforce flexibility and all-out competition , with new forms of privatisation and liberalisation .
- ( FR ) The solemn declaration of the first EU-Africa summit in Cairo opens by stating , and I quote : " Over the centuries , ties have existed between Africa and Europe ... developed on the basis of shared values of strengthening representative and participatory democracy " .
Madam President , aside from the letter of the report , I want to draw attention to a few of the numbers contained in it .
Otherwise we would be being neither lucid nor ambitious enough .
Tomorrow we will certainly have to consider the question of the democratic scrutiny of this closer cooperation , an area where our Parliament will have to play a major role .
It is a question of equality and solidarity .
The time has come for Europe to be a power capable of genuine political expression , of sustaining a social project and framing a common foreign and defence policy .
It is up to us , the elected representatives of the people of Europe , to work towards improving the efficiency and democracy of our institutions .
With 6 Members it is materially impossible to follow up all the dossiers that are crucial to our country .
As I pointed out this morning , they have sought the greatest possible convergence between the Commission and the European Parliament , in order to imbue these negotiations with the political impetus they need .
The first option is one Commissioner per Member State on a permanent basis , all sitting at the same time , but with a Commission which will one day have 30 or 35 Commissioners , which will inevitably mean a hierarchy within the College .
There is no way that later , when we have 20 , 25 or 30 Member States , we will be able to do what we did not manage to do either in Amsterdam or today , this
