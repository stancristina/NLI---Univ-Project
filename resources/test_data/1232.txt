Mr Rømer has surely only read the title of my question , which is the same , but has not read the text .
I would like to ask the Commission whether it intends to create any programme for integrating young immigrants , so that we too may reduce racism and xenophobia , since these new European citizens also have a sense of belonging to our community .     Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to thank you for your words , which have definitely reassured me a little , because , having read this Communication , I am rather concerned that we might be going too far in subjecting education to the exigencies of competition and the market .
From an external point of view , do the Members receive the correct information ?
I hope that , like last time , the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will be receptive to our proposals and not be a wary Presidency which wants to maintain the status quo , ignoring the fact that circumstances have changed and that the operating rules must be improved in order to improve budgetary execution .
Our fellow Members decided that there was no need for Friday sittings , and here we are , at an inappropriate time , which is not worthy of the quality and dignity of our parliamentary work .
Mr President , I would like to add my voice to Mr Posselt 's protest , because I believe that we in this Parliament must not forego what is really important just because of a failure to comply with formal arrangements , and if a debate with the Commission and the Council has been scheduled , the Council should be present .
This is all the wrong way round , and is contrary to the spirit of the European Union .
We are talking about strategic sectors , but equally strategic are communications , transport and finance .
The big operators cannot impose or predetermine these conditions .
Finally , I would like to point out that it is not true that the Directive on takeover bids does not provide for political interventions : Article 4(5 ) provides for the establishment of exceptional measures in accordance with national circumstances .
If we are to talk about economic patriotism , what Spain needs in order to continue growing and creating employment is more competition rather than more protectionism , more liberalism rather than political interference or haggling , more energy security , which means integration into Europe , rather than continuing to be an island where energy is concerned .
In this case , let us acknowledge what we do well .
Another issue that was dealt with was the Code of Conduct on counter-terrorism .
From a political point of view , given this spiral of violence and following the cartoons of Mohammed conflict , now more than ever we must strive for peaceful co-existence in the Mediterranean .
The members of the new Council will be elected by the Assembly by absolute majority , that is to say , a minimum of 96 votes in favour will be required .
But I am pleased that , in any event , their constructive cooperation with the new Council has been ensured .
We need a faster system , with clearly defined time periods and procedures , in which competences are properly allocated .
Furthermore , the Members of this House have an obligation to the diversity and wealth of European gastronomic heritage , which has so far enjoyed an international reputation .
The European Commission must not deal with these cases as if they were a question of a mere business relationship between client and service provider .
Do not forget that constitutions , such as the Spanish Constitution , recognise the essential role of professional associations and the fundamental work they do .
I wished to register my protest and I hope to receive a written reply as soon as possible .     .
Mr President , many opportunities are currently opening up in Africa to come to terms with what is often a blood-stained past .
We must therefore remember that , without an International Criminal Court to establish individual responsibility as a mechanism for applying the law , acts of genocide and flagrant violations of human rights will often go unpunished .
The communiqué tells us that ETA is going to stop killing for as long as it sees fit and that it is doing so in order to achieve its supposedly political objectives .
The European Parliament fully shares the citizens ’ concerns and we in this House must therefore send a clear and strong message in favour of energy independence for the Union .
In a globalised world , the national giants are minnows at world level , and Europeanist speeches are of little use if , when it comes to making decisions , words have not been followed up with concrete actions .
No: we simply want to bring together the enthusiasm of the different parties in this House , of the different political families in this House , in order to seek solutions to the people’s problems .
Why ?
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , therefore , Mr President , is going to back Mr Leinen’s report and is also going to vote in favour of the amendments presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , by Mr Onesta on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance — which relates to young people’s associations — and by Mr Maaten and Mrs De Sarnez .
It is also necessary to give these parties a legal personality , on the basis of Community law , which ensures that they operate transparently and efficiently in all of the member countries .
How often have we heard our colleagues in our countries saying , ‘Yes , the party we
