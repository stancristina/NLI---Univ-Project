The fact that female business people , in the financial services for example , often encounter difficulties is a great handicap for the operation of a business , especially for the whole small business structure .
One third of entrepreneurs in these small firms is over 50 , which corresponds to about 6.3 million work places in Europe .

Raouf Denktash has made impossible demands , yet there can be no peace in Cyprus without an agreement with the Turkish Cypriot side as well , and for this one must seek new ways .
We must be flexible in laying down conditions for aid .
Everything has changed .
We are currently concerned at the unrest and the wave of brutal oppression which exist , and which have already cost many people their lives .
There is also a simple reason why they want to overthrow the Bahrain Government .
We are very ready to do everything in our power to support this process .
Transition from a dictatorship to a democracy is a development which many countries in Europe have made .
They get up to all kinds of tricks , the population structure in the sub-areas is completely altered , and in these colonies , representing different areas , we are supposed for all practical purposes to close our eyes to it .

I hope that there are forces in America strong enough to persuade the President - force him , I would almost say - to add his signature after all .
In the Bundeswehr of the Federal Republic of Germany there are still 1.5 million of these anti-tank mines .
Principally , the planned financial means must be increased and distributed amongst Member States using objective criteria .
If we had allowed cows to graze on pasture and had not fed them with meat protein - which also happened to be infected - we should not have this problem today .

This is a meeting of specialist knowledge and local needs with corresponding consumer requirements .
Mr President , I would also request you to instruct the German authorities to finally recognize European passports because one has , from time to time , great difficulties - including , I am sad to say , even at Munich airport - which is generally the best airport in the world .
