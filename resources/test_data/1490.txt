of today , are of no use in terms either of family life or of the labour market .
To an extent , the mix of subjects renders the report impractical and difficult to place in relation to the real world , but that is in no way Mr Pirker’s fault .
In general , I am able to support the report’s overall objective of strengthening cooperation and coordination within the EU in these essential and cross-border areas of policy .
The report nonetheless contains a proposal that I find too far-reaching : that of establishing a federal European corps of border guards which – in contrast to , for example , Europol – would have extensive operational authority to use its powers .
With regard to the principle of subsidiarity , I do not think that the Commission is able to document either the effect of , or the operational need for , a federal corps of border guards .
We still do not know what would be the effects of the many sensible proposals , such as those for increased cooperation and coordination between the Member States’ customs and border authorities .
Thirdly , there is simply no legal basis in the existing Treaties for a federal corps of border guards and , even if the Convention’s proposals for new Treaty wordings were adopted , it is doubtful if there would be a legal basis for such a corps .
At the same time , it is clear , however , that , if the introduction of a corps of border guards were to have any meaning at all , the Commission would , in the long term , plan to delegate a number of EU tasks to that body .
With regard to the proposals concerning the biometric data , I do not wish to comment in more detail upon these at the present time .
To sum up , I recommend , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , that we vote in favour of the motion for a resolution in the report .
At the same time , it is , however , crucial for me to emphasise that what I want is a common policy in this area and not a common police force .     Mr President , it is extremely sad that the way in which we , here in the European Parliament , are celebrating the 200th anniversary of Haiti’s break with oppression and slavery is with a statement about the drastic situation in the country .
I must not use my speaking time to repeat everything that my fellow MEPs have said about President Aristide .
A number of things have gone completely wrong in Haiti .
The most basic right , that to food , is being violated to a quite incredible degree .
The EU and the international community cannot , and should not , look on silently .
A political solution is the only way of reintroducing a system providing legal certainty and respect for human rights , and the only option for solving the structural problems that have brought Haiti to the brink of famine .     Mr President , packaging waste constitutes a considerable environmental problem .
In Denmark , we are already close to achieving the proposed recycling target .
All materials that are damaging to the environment and people’s health must be removed from the waste cycle and replaced by ecologically sound alternatives .
Such alternatives do exist now .
The waste problem does not need to become any greater than it is .
As long as PVCs and phthalates are used , a duty must be imposed upon them and used to pay both for the damage that has arisen through the use of PVCs and for the changeover to ecologically sound alternatives .
In spite of these shortcomings , I shall vote in favour of the motion for a resolution in Mrs Corbey’s report .     Mr President , the EU must have a common foreign policy and common Foreign Minister and be a legal person .
Looking at the statistics , it emerges that the Member States are in agreement .
Perhaps it is also necessary to consider how we use the UN.
Are we too , however , in a position to comply with our obligations , namely to support the UN system when required : as when , for example , the weapons inspectorate told us that there was probably no imminent threat from Iraq in the form of weapons of mass destruction ; or when Hans Blix told us that there was probably no threat and that , if these weapons of mass destruction were in fact there , he was certain that he and his colleagues would be in a position to find them .
Perhaps the weaknesses and problems of the UN also have to do , then , with our inability to rely upon the system’s in actual fact being able to undertake anything sensible .
I should like to recommend that we be very sincere in our support of the UN and that we also be more active in the battle to reform it .
We need to reform the Security Council .
We are destroying the planet’s biodiversity at the same rate at which the dinosaurs were wiped out .
In ten years , two million children have been killed in wars or by landmines .
More than four million young people have died of AIDS .
Or is it ?
I am therefore very happy that , in the Conference of Presidents , I was able to register my group ’s unanimous support for the UN , because never before have there been so many innocent and poverty-stricken children who need a helping-hand from ourselves in our cosy little corner of the rich part of the world .
