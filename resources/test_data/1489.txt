.
There must be simple ways of keeping track of the legislative process .
Changing the EU 's institutional culture takes time , but we have achieved a lot in a short time .
I have also learned a lot about flexibility from Mrs Maij-Weggen , something that is an important feature of European cooperation .
Mr President , nothing could be more apposite than what is happening this evening .
An exhortation to the Commission : do not let the Eurostat scandal sully the good work you have done during the historic years when Europe was being reunited .
We are not here to stand around hugging one another .
The Commission should have one register , not several .
Openness must be the rule rather than the exception .
We need to improve in this institution too .
It is an extremely sound proposal which will entail a considerable improvement where such emissions are concerned .
I wish to thank Mr Lisi for the groundwork he has done .
As it is , as many as 84 amendments have been tabled in the Chamber , and I myself take responsibility for a number of them .
Together with Mr Meijer from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , I have , for example , tabled Amendments Nos 62-77 , dealing with limit values .
I wonder why the Commission chose to settle for limit values higher than those in both these alternatives .
I believe that the discussions conducted by the industry in recent days really do not serve their purpose .
I am well aware of her commitment to these issues , and the information she provided about what has happened following the Johannesburg Summit was welcome .
In this context , we are required to work horizontally , that is to say to integrate the objective of economic growth with those of social development and of the effective protection and responsible management of the physical environment .
In the same way , the research world is partitioned .
We can take this Parliament as an example .
We still measure everything in terms of gross national product , that is to say the total production of goods and services .
The European Union 's role in the work in favour of sustainable development is central , especially today when we encounter a lukewarm attitude on the part of the Washington administration .
Allow me to give a practical example .
I can only hope that this issue of the supply of water , with the billion euros earmarked for it , will be resolved shortly .
What is really required - and what is not at all happening - is for priority to be given to the supply of energy and to sensible efforts in this area , not only on the part of the Commission but also on that of the recipient countries .
I should like to call upon Mrs Wallström to try to release a proper amount of additional money and earmark it for this area .
I just hope that there is very substantial reporting of what is being done in the developing countries .
I believe the Commission as a whole needs to commit itself to developing both quantitative objectives and indicators whereby we obtain reporting worthy of the name .
From that point of view , what happened in Cancún is of course very unfortunate .
We have been able to study the annual report for 2002 .
One problem is that the Commission has not responded to some of the reports we have written in response to the Ombudsman 's special reports .
We must get our second wind once the Intergovernmental Conference has been concluded .
How was it possible for the Court of Auditors not to have found errors at Eurostat ?
I fully respect the Ombudsman 's independence , but I nonetheless believe this could be an idea that the Ombudsman 's Office might bear in mind in its forthcoming work .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too wish to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs González Álvarez for her friendship and the good work that has been done .
I think it has been a successful year .
Unfortunately , we are getting no further when it comes to the Spanish water plan .
We are nonetheless all agreed that , before enlargement , we must make progress in dealing with petitions , especially at the beginning of the work , and grasp the hand of cooperation extended by the Ombudsman about a year ago .
There should be a code of honour so that the Commission publishes its answers to the questions specifically for the Committee on Petitions .
If I were to grade different areas of responsibility within the EU , issues of competition would be among the most important .
The market is changing .
The Della Vedova report further strengthens the Commission ’s proposals in these respects .
That applies in purely general terms but , in particular , it is important for leading companies in smaller countries to be able to grow stronger , within their own countries as well , and to do so with a view to providing more jobs within the whole of the EU and to increasing competitiveness outside the EU too .
Mr Solana , I want you to broach this subject with the Palestinian Prime Minister .
In a democratic country such as Israel , which is a sign to the rest of the world that democracy exists in the Middle East , every such suicide attack carried out by a terrorist group will make Israeli opinion less willing to compromise with the Palestinian Authority and less well disposed towards handing land over to the Palestinians .
He must nonetheless indicate , politically and in terms of the action he takes , that that is his ambition
