In their joint statement after their meeting in Paris , the UN Secretary General and President Papadopoulos stated , among other things , that it would be beneficial for all concerned and would greatly improve the atmosphere for further talks if progress could be achieved on further disengagement of forces and demilitarisation on the Island , on the complete de-mining of Cyprus and on the issue of Famagusta .
However , as a strategic objective , enlargement can be the scapegoat for collective European impasses and that , in my opinion , should be avoided .
The question is deeply political , not bureaucratic .
The role of catalyst belongs to the European Union .     – Mr President , today there has indeed been a very positive development as regards the agreement achieved in New York .
These clear reforms may give new momentum for human rights to the institution of the Council and reduce the lack of credibility and efficacy of the UN.
The aim is to have a submissive Council that can be turned into an agency which will judge infringements of human rights with partiality and against the criterion of imperialist ambitions .
To paraphrase Brecht – because time is short – who wrote , ' When imperialists talk of peace they are preparing for war ', I would say that , when you talk today about protecting human rights , you are preparing to massacre them , as you do every day .
I am truly delighted at the large number of both speakers and proposals submitted on this programme .
Unfortunately , however , under present circumstances – and I refer here in particular to economic circumstances – we must be careful and – to use a word which I do not particularly like – 'realistic ' . The most serious issue which is pending at the moment is the closure of discussions on the financial perspective and Parliament has an important role to play here .
In other words , there will be less money for the Europe of the 25 and 27 Member States than there was for the Europe of the 15 .
If , however , the considerable reduction to which I referred earlier ultimately comes about , this will mean that numerous actions and numerous sectors of the proposal will have to be abandoned , because there is no point in allocating small amounts to numerous sectors in such a way that , in essence , no sector is supported effectively .
That is why the whole programme needs to be reassessed , priorities need to be set and the actions , initiatives and sectors covered need to be reduced considerably , so that we can cover effectively even just the few sectors selected .
I know that both committees would prefer there to be separate programmes , I understand the arguments and I understand the concerns .
That is why , at the present stage , the Commission will reject the amendments which promote the split into two programmes and , once we have the final outcome of the debate on the financial perspective , then we shall re-examine the matter .
I merely wish to emphasise , because there is no time and there are a great many amendments , that the Commission 's position on each of the amendments will be circulated in writing and I would be obliged if it could be included in the Minutes of this debate( 1 ) .
However , it also provided further proof of the value which Community action has in the field of public health .
The promotion of policies which result in a healthier lifestyle – health determinants .
Improving the effectiveness and efficacy of health systems : we need to examine jointly the health systems of the Member States in order to safeguard their compatibility , as this will allow them to perform better for the citizens of Europe .
In addition , emphasis is placed on actions such as the effect of the environment on health and the collection of data relating to low birth rates , low fertility and sterility , which are developing into a scourge for aging European communities , which are already under threat from the demographic problem .
Ladies and gentlemen , I could continue with an endless catalogue of prevention and care issues .
From this point of view , I believe that Amendment 64 , which recommends a higher amount , because the programme is now fuller than and different from that tabled by the Commission , is needed because , without financing , the best programmes will not bring about any results .
One in three European citizens will suffer from some form of cancer during their lifetime .
Rheumatism is the second most frequent cause of visits to the doctor .
Consequently , I have tabled the relevant amendment on behalf of my group – Amendment 156 – which I should like to ask you to support .
Consequently , we need to make a huge effort to include the needs of these groups and the organisations that represent them in our health systems .
We must take account of their experiences , so that we can create specially designed health systems which meet the needs of the Europeans who are victims of discrimination and receive poor treatment .
The basic priority of the programme is to combat inequalities in health by strengthening existing networks in the field of public health .
Another basic priority is to safeguard the added value of Community actions in relation to national actions for health , in order to strengthen transnational cooperation in innovative sectors , such as telematics in medicine .
Already , the situation of the Balkan peoples is drastic and it will worsen when they join the ΕU.
Any demagogic crowing and political adjustments by the other parties are an attempt to disorientate the people and launder the huge political responsibilities which they have in going
