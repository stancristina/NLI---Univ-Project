view , to be a more favourable climate for the regional package of requirements than there is today .
I fully support the strengthened version of the Napolitano report that Mr MacCormick mentioned .
Commissioner Barnier and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo have just commented on the proposal to offer constitutional regions direct access to the Court of Justice .
Firstly , it is not easy for any Member of this Parliament who has been elected on a national list , but who wants to be re-elected , to agree with criticism about his or her own country .
Human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated .
We must also be willing , however , to regard serious human rights violations in one or more Member States as a European matter and to ask ourselves what the European Union as such can contribute towards improving the situation .
Internal correction mechanisms are not particularly effective .
Finally I would like to ask the representative of the Council - who is not here , but perhaps the official who is hidden away somewhere can pass this on - what has become of the decision by the General Affairs Council in June 2001 to coordinate our internal and external human rights policies better ?
In the light of the situation the world is in , however , this statement is a long way from reality .
The Swiebel report pleads for a clear framework , preferably a constitution , as we would otherwise not be able to arrive at an independent , unambiguous assessment .
Europe is a community of values , not only an economic community , as Mrs Swiebel rightly says .
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam , then the Treaty of Nice and possibly as part of the Convention , we do in fact have more opportunities to give Member States a good ticking off if they make mistakes , and even to kick them out of the Community .
There is , after all , no real consistency in the application of the Charter of Human Rights .
I am very much in favour of promoting gay rights , but not by saying that you will also get the rights you do not want .
We must therefore develop a standard procedure for the different Member States in this directive .
We must not only have a common goal but also a common working method , and I am somewhat stricter than you are when it comes to discouraging new national rules .
The agency must have its say about how this is to be done .
It is important for the people who work on the railways to be involved in the things that concern them .
I get terror-stricken whenever I hear people from railway companies saying that if we do not adapt quickly we will have no more goods traffic on the railways , and we will be priced out of the market - not by the prices themselves but by bad working practices .
Regrettably this increase in scale is now being misused to force all the Member States of the European Union to allow other companies with private capital to access the railway network .
If we do not accept that part , the future will look a great deal better .
Passenger transport by rail is a public service and must remain so .
With this in mind , we have therefore submitted an amendment to Mr Jarzembowski 's report .
This Railways Agency should have been in place thirteen years ago .
If we view the railway sector in the context of the agreements in the Lisbon Declaration which call upon us to become the most competitive region in the world by 2010 , we have to achieve this , otherwise our hearts will be in our boots .
The Railways Agency 's expertise and clear responsibilities are therefore very important .
Another condition that must be met if the Agency is to operate efficiently is that it must remain independent and that it has independent experts chosen for their abilities and not as representatives of a particular organisation at its helm .
Bureaucratic obstacles must be eliminated as far as possible .
We endorse that .
In other words , Railway Directive 91/440/EC , the original separation of infrastructure and operation , is seen as being wrong .
Particularly with the fact that Mr Jarzembowski has included passenger transport in his report and has outlined a plan for it .
That is also why it is so important to pay attention to this .
Changes would have far-reaching consequences for the sector .
Firstly , most of the current provisions can remain intact .
In short , the emphasis must lie on simple , enforceable provisions , adequate controls and identical assessment standards by regulatory authorities .
Of course , this also applies to the reinstatement of a wide range of definitions so that they are not open to multiple interpretations .
I have objections to the proposal concerning driving times and rest periods in road transport in the form in which it was originally sent to Parliament by the Commission .
The last thing the sector needs is more new regulations .
Some of these companies come from outside the EU.
The proposals on which we are voting today are therefore a half-measure that inflicts the pain one-sidedly on other countries .
What is more , drivers want to be protected against overworking and overtiredness , but they also want to get home quickly after a long trip .
It goes without saying that we must maintain the very best relations with our Turkish neighbours , and that we can maintain the best possible trading and other relations where applicable .
Europe must not hesitate to deploy all its diplomatic and economic resources to achieve this .
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten wholeheartedly for his answer
