The reason for this was , of course , mainly political .
That is all well and good , but Sweden does not fulfil the remaining two criteria , that is to say those relating to the rate of exchange and legal convergence .
The outcome of the forthcoming referendum must of course be respected but , in my opinion , Sweden should , in the event of a 'yes ' vote , already be prepared to prevent a delay in the introduction of the euro due to the absence of legal convergence .
On the other hand , Sweden is obliged , under the Treaty of Maastricht , to become fully involved in EMU cooperation once the convergence criteria have been fulfilled .
This will make it possible to obtain that broad support for the report desired by both the rapporteur and myself .
Item 5 states , however , that referendums are to be held and that the outcomes of these must be respected , even if they entail rejecting the introduction of the euro .
On the contrary , the 'no ' camp is at present very clearly in the lead , by ten per cent according to the latest poll .
Sweden has a well-run economy .
The economists sympathetic to EMU cannot deny this state of affairs .
The truth is that EMU has not been the success it was expected to be .
We shall soon also have a range of new Member States that are also outside the framework of cooperation concerning the euro .
What , in actual fact , do the Commission and the Council have to say about these matters ? ( The President cut off the speaker )
The Commission and the rapporteur , Mr Olle Schmidt , point out that , on two issues - the rate of exchange and legislation concerning the Swedish Central Bank - Sweden does not meet the requirements .
At present , we have relatively low inflation and low unemployment , together with stable state finances .
That would undermine confidence in the euro and EMU.
That is something that would favour growth and increase flexibility .
Allow me finally to say that , for both political and economic reasons , I hope that Sweden will soon be involved in cooperation concerning the euro .
Mr President , my contribution relates exclusively to Mr Olle Schmidt 's report .
According to both Wim Duisenberg and a report in the Swedish daily , Dagens Nyheter , prices have in fact risen following the introduction of the euro and contributed to an increase in inflation in the eurozone of 0.2 per cent .
What I find startling , not to say of serious concern , in Mr Schmidt 's report is item 6 , through which he wishes to make voters feel powerless by stating right now that , sooner or later , we must at all events become members of the eurozone .
That is perhaps a rather bizarre message , coming from a representative of the Church of Sweden , but the idea of a regicide in the service of the people is otherwise quite an old one .
The discussions now being conducted within the Arab world to induce Saddam Hussein to resign are extremely interesting .
The United States , the EU and the UN Security Council ought to have shown greater commitment to solving the conflict between Israel and Palestine .
The peace talks must begin again .
The view of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is still that the weapons inspectors must be allowed to continue with their work for as long as their efforts are meaningful and for as long as they are making progress .
It is our view that if , in fact , any military decisions are to be taken , they must be taken by the UN Security Council .
This is unreasonable and frightening , and it undermines the UN 's credibility .
For my part , I am convinced that , in the present situation , the best way is that of continued work by the weapons inspectors , quite simply because military intervention is always the last resort .
One might perhaps wish that they were working still better , but progress is at present being made .
That is why the weapons inspections must continue .
We must therefore join together in helping to maintain this system .
If the EU is in future to play a role in the area of foreign policy , we must learn from what has happened .
Mr President , what has happened to the EU 's common foreign and security policy ?
Those who demand that the weapons inspectors should be given more time to enable them to find Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction lack support under UN Resolution 1441 for their declared position .
On the contrary , it is Saddam Hussein 's task to produce his weapons of mass destruction and destroy them under the weapons inspectors ' supervision .
Personally , I have no confidence in Saddam Hussein 's goodwill .
He went on to murder one of his ministers in the course of a government meeting .
Allow me to express the hope that this can be brought about without the need for recourse to war .
We must not forget that Saddam Hussein threw out the previous weapons inspectors in 1998 .
Ever since its defeat in the Gulf War in 1991 , Iraq has systematically sabotaged the possibility of the UN weapons inspectors ' investigating the presence of weapons of mass destruction in the country .
It is just such weapons of mass destruction that the UN inspectors have not been allowed to search for .
Difficult situations put our trust in each other to the test .
