Treaty .
And page 6 of the report states that " the Treaty of Amsterdam Treaty makes substantial changes to the existing third pillar of the Treaty on European Union and places the cooperation of Member States in the fields of justice and home affairs on a new legal footing ' .
I regard this report as a bogeyman , but it is heartening for others ( Commissioner Gradin , for example ) , in that it advocates a harmonization of the Member States&#x02BC ; criminal codes .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasize one fundamental point , and that is that a very important part of the quality of any democracy is measured by the degree of open control that can be exercised over the police and the penal institutions .
Therefore we must not create instability through a selection method which enforces distinctions between the applicant countries .
With its chosen strategy the Commission has turned enlargement into a horse race in which the participants will inevitably feel like winners and losers .
An A team and a B team have been created .
It is clear enough that there are differences between the countries , including with regard to how close they are to fulfilling the requirements made by the EU , but seen in the light of the process of change Europe is in the middle of , it is the wrong time to make such a static division .
Agenda 2000 talks of the strengthening and enlargement of the Union , but it is not the Union which is to be strengthened , it is instead the citizens of Europe which are to be strengthened , and it is the ability of the citizens to decide over their own lives which shall be enlarged through Union cooperation .
Only through an equal cooperation with the applicant countries will we be able to secure popular backing for the EU , and without that the project will collapse .
Madam President , when future historians come to judge our epoch , the chapter on the wall between east and west will be important .
It is the fall of the wall which we are all happy about , but what we are in the middle of doing is moving the wall .
Throughout northern Africa the poor can remain in their poverty .
We have barriers against the sale of their products .
They do not get the necessary or possible help to help themselves .
In central Europe we are moving the old wall from the border of Germany eastwards .
In the Baltic we want to make the Bay of Finland into an EU sea by negotiating with Estonia with its 1.5 million inhabitants , but Latvia with 2.6 million and Lithuania with 3.7 million inhabitants must wait for better times .
The strong peace movements of the seventies and eighties did not manage to overcome the division of Europe .
It was the eastern Europeans themselves who knocked down the wall , and now we are trying to gather the fragments to put it up again .
We must not be remembered for that .
We must create open , freer and more flexible European cooperation from which nobody is excluded .
We want to have a Europe of All the Nations .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding report .
Expansion is the most important , but achieving full employment is one of the major ones .
Viability means that we must shift taxation from labour to taxation on pollution and resources .
Equality means amongst other things that there must be equality for men and women , including in the next generation , that is , our children .
Not only for women 's sake , but also for the sake of the children , who feel happy if their fathers are really there for them .
If we can combine these three concepts , we will have the basis for creating our own path in Europe .
Mr President , this report is a really good piece of work .
Organizing the future labour market is a large task , but this report does a good job of covering not only the opportunities but also the risks involved in the new organization of work .
A more flexible labour market may benefit both employers and employees .
To employers , it means more flexible staff who are willing to 'do that bit extra' for the business .
And how !
Because there is reason to fear that , while the strong and most flexible will manage to exploit the new challenges and opportunities , those in weaker positions , such as the poorly-educated , will find it even harder to keep up .
Nor does the Commission 's Green Paper focus on the effects of equal opportunities now that employees have to be more flexible when it comes to working hours .
This model must be used if women are also to have the chance to benefit from the new opportunities existing on the labour market .
Mr President , I too would like to start by giving my thanks for the cooperation on the Budget committee and with my colleagues , not least when they give a positive reception to amendments proposed by the Liberal group .
I would like to start by looking at the Giansily report on the ECSC budget , and I would like to note straight away that I am totally against the report 's proposal to impose a tax of 0.11 % in 1998 .
It would be totally unreasonable to punish an industry with such a tax in this way when the parties involved have agreed to abolish the tax otherwise .
It is said after all that enough money has been accumulated for different measures
