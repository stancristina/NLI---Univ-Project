I believe that the only phrase he knows in Italian is [it is raining – damned government] .
The Convention’s efforts have not been pointless , because – and I firmly believe this – this Constitution is necessary for the enlarged Europe and there is no alternative .
Otherwise , we would have to face working with a botch-up , like the Treaty of Nice , carrying out enlargement without deepening the Union , under bad conditions , and discussing the financial perspectives in a stifling political atmosphere .
And naturally the European Parliament must play its historical role as a driving force , in this case as the driving force for the European Constitution .     – Mr President , Commissioner , representatives of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , in my capacity as budgetary spokesman for the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I would like to congratulate the various rapporteurs involved in the budgetary procedure for 2004 , as well as the Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , and her services , for their great cooperation , and also Mr Magri , who , as has already been said , has done a great bridging job within the Council – an always difficult Council – in order to be able to achieve this draft budget .
All of this must be undertaken while applying the necessary austerity in the total growth in spending .
This is going to require of us authority and efficiency in spending , but let us not forget that now and forever , and , above all from next May , it is also going to require great generosity .     Mr President , I am speaking as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the former A-30 budget lines .
First stumbling block , the duration of programmes .
It is therefore essential that the Commission and national administrations respond effectively .
I hope you have understood my question .     Mr President , my question related , firstly , to whether the invasion of Iraq has demonstrated that terrorism cannot only be combated through repression – and we should ask the Iraqis who they consider to be the terrorists – and , secondly , to whether the decision has been taken within the framework of the United Nations or within another very particular United States framework .     Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am surprised that you should reply to such a highly political question in such bureaucratic terms ; but since that is how you want it , I must ask whether the Council intends to establish measures for China similar to those established for Cuba , such as recommending that the Embassies of the Member States receive representatives of the opposition , of the resistance relating to Tibet , or defenders of human rights who clearly do not take the line of the Chinese authorities , over the holidays .
We are talking about the rights of women , regardless of their nationality or that of their husbands , who are being denied a right which , as human beings , is recognised under international law .
In other words , is the European Union 's contribution sufficient for those countries ?
I imagine that the main difficulty lies in the current lack of available means both to deal with the immigrants received and to repatriate them .
In the first case we said that the provisions of the Statute cannot be modified by means of a fundamental act , on the basis of Article 190 of the Treaty , and in the second case , we indicated that the sums in question would represent a significant burden for category 5 of the financial perspectives .
In this regard we must recognise that public opinion and the media are right when they make certain criticisms .
On the three issues raised – which I hope will be approved in the resolution – which my group advocates , I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has been very clear and explicit in relation to primary law , with the reimbursement of expenditure and with taxation .
I do not believe that now is the time to invoke the subsidiarity principle , but quite the opposite : we are building a European Union which must be based on common institutions with a common operation , and this is what explains the proposal for European parliamentary statute and a statute for European political parties .
Mr President , this is absurd as well , because if our function is European , our pay should come from the European budget , or are Members of Parliament in the national states paid by their constituency within the State ?
I entirely agree with the Commissioner , Mr Nielson , who has just stated that all efforts will be doomed to failure if the conflicting parties do not show clear signs of goodwill to achieve those agreements and live in peace together .
Mr Gbagbo himself , who was very friendly and very pleasant and who , during a meal which we were invited to in the presidential palace itself , explained to us his view of the problem , he said things in the presence of many of us who were there – no less than 10 or 15 people – which I believe do not point in the right direction , such as , for example , that he had to strengthen his army and that he had plans to buy certain military materials in the countries of the East .
The principle of interoperability allows us to remove the obstacles standing in the way of creating the internal market in electronic tolls and therefore to prevent barriers ; it allows us to extend electronic tolls more widely and restrict congestion at payment
