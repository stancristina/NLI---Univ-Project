World markets are , however , dominated to a large extent by the US dollar .
Because the new Euro exchange rate might be particularly unstable in the early stages , there may be large fluctuations in prices for agricultural products on the world market when they are converted into Euros .
This of course would be promptly reflected in EU internal prices and agricultural aid , when there would be rapid swings in value .
It is worrying that , with the establishment of the Euro , prices for agricultural produce and the value of agricultural aid might not grow and , indeed , may instead fall .
If the Council is not ready to make a unanimous decision on taxation , what conclusions can the Commission draw ?
Is it the philosophy of the Commission that the income tax position can be eased by reducing the social security burden ?
Mr President , we have here a great many issues connected with taxation .
But we can actually achieve something in taxation .
I would also like to ask a question which has already been asked several times here : what does the Commission mean by wage flexibility being a good way of remedying the employment problem ?
I would like to thank them both , accordingly .
This is both worrying and surprising .
The objective 6 regions are sparsely-populated areas in northern Europe which have experienced immense structural change , and where the employment situation is bad .
Although the presentation of the resolution is very recent , it may be slightly out of date .
The implementation of structural funding is hampered by bureaucracy and complicated systems .
The main topic of debate at the Luxembourg Summit is employment .
Mr President , EMU compels us to debate the subject of social security structures , because there has been great pressure on us to reduce state expenditure .
In this respect , I do not believe that EU policy is uniform .
There is really a lot that needs doing in the harmonization of indirect taxation especially .
We even want to pay taxes , to some extent , so that people can have a minimum of state support .
I certainly believe there is no cause for concern , in this respect , with the Nordic countries , and , indeed , that social security thinking in Europe generally runs along the same track as the Scandinavian philosophy .
Just one example is the German health insurance system , which is clearly a step in this direction .
Mr President , I wish to turn your attention to that point in time which the negotiations for the continuation of the Lom√© Convention are aimed at .
It is a matter of a comprehensive geographical policy in the EU , its effectiveness , and , at the same time , its role in the worldwide context .
That is Finland 's official position .
The EU must present the matter at the next round of WTO talks , as the issue should apply globally .
The rapporteur urges the Commission to cut the import subsidy for one third of the countries involved .
Furthermore , the rapporteur suggests the Commission should increase staff and at the same time pour more money into staging points when animals are being transported , and for the monitoring of abattoirs .
Finally , I demand that all Member States incorporate the directives in force as part of its national law , and I mean those five countries which have still not done so .
The law must be put into practice in every country and the Commission has responsibility for monitoring the process , and making demands on Member States in that respect .
I can fully support all the suggestions she makes in it including point 35 which is being discussed .
Concrete proposals are required from the Commission .
Because the ending of the import subsidy - which cost ECU 300 Million in the year 1995-1996 , for example - will not have a rapid effect , the Commission should now embark on a programme of measures whereby those companies guilty of abuse would have to pay back their transport subsidy .
Nevertheless , I think we also need more people in the Commission to monitor things .
We need more openness ; it is vital that each and every instance of abuse is publicly exposed .
Perhaps rather tardily in view of the speed with which the report is being dealt with , I have also discussed this issue with various Finnish experts .
The need for individual and corporate data protection is high on the agenda in society today , let alone in the next century .
Information of a sensitive nature , such as in the area of telemedicine , will be carried by them , let alone the flood of information there will be to do with security .
Violation of data protection thus embraces a wide area , ranging from industrial espionage to tinkering with and hacking away at national security .
When EMU begins we will need a more effective employment policy than before , in order that European growth can continue , and that prosperity can be divided equally .
It is not enough to create ambitious target programmes if they are not going to be implemented until the next millennium .
What is especially important in the report is the introduction of the lowest possible rate of VAT in the labour-intensive service industries .
The report does not go far enough , though .
I think the most essential thing is not whether working hours should be shortened by a change in the law , through negotiations among the labour organizations or by experimenting with working hours .
The number of jobs has increased and companies have gained by increasing production
