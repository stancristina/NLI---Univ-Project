have had the privilege of visiting many of these countries in the past year and I have to say that , in many cases , one ' s sympathy turns to anger when one sees the abject poverty that people in these countries live in while their leaders and ministers revel in wealth and prosperity and one begins to question the distribution of aid and debt relief .
Despite all the help given from Europe , individual nation states and institutions , Africa ' s external debt is growing by about 12 % per annum and some countries are repaying more in interest than they are receiving in aid .
That cannot be allowed to continue , but neither can the historic reasons for causing it to happen .
I will be criticised by some honourable Members for saying it , but conditionality must be built into not only development aid but also debt relief .
I have always maintained that good governance was more important than pure democracy if you are going to stamp out corrupt practices , and if we cannot wipe these practices out we are only pouring good money after bad .
We must therefore be in a position to monitor the effect of debt relief and make sure that all of it is spent on civil society to give better health , education and employment prospects to the people who are being denied it .
There is a secondary effect of bad governance and that is the lack of external investment into these countries which denies them the chance of improved prosperity , better employment prospects and a higher standard of living .
The fight against fraud and corruption should be made a condition for allocating debt relief and development aid - not my words , Mr President , but the words of President Obasanjo of Nigeria in Abuja at the opening of the 13th session of the ACP-EU Assembly .
If only that could be echoed by every other president in Africa , the resistance to giving debt relief would diminish and some real progress could be made in alleviating the misery and poverty of millions of people .
Mr President , as others have said , many promises have been made on debt relief but in fact very few have been delivered .
After all the headlines that we heard at Cologne last year , less than $ 13 billion of the $ 100 billion promised has actually been cancelled and as the Commission and the Council have told us , contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund are still way below target .
As the Commissioner rightly says , the burden deserves to be shared .
The fact is that despite a $ 1 trillion budget surplus over 10 years , President Clinton is not able to squeeze $ 210 million for HIPC out of Congress .
That is an appalling fact for us to take on board .
It is also the case that we are still waiting for the World Bank and the IMF to come up with something similar to the European Union .
All G7 countries have promised some form of 100 % debt cancellation , but many of them are very slow and disinclined to do it in the way that we would like .
Also , to qualify for debt relief , each country has to complete a long and often contradictory 'HIPC' process , and only 5 countries have so far managed to go through the hoops that they are being asked to go through .
So far , the United Kingdom is the only country that has offered 100 % debt cancellation .
France , Germany and Japan only include pre-cut-off debts and so ignore a significant portion of debt .
Japan , incidentally , ties its debt relief to responsibility to buy Japanese exports .
On Mozambique , for instance , it is very significant that the IMF , the World Bank and the Paris Club only postponed payments from Mozambique and then actually lent more money .
So , what I would say , finally , is that we in this Parliament urge all the creditors to stop delaying and to start working really hard towards fulfilling full debt cancellation for the poorest countries .
Of course , I agree with all my colleagues , the poorest countries who fulfil the criteria of delivering debt relief to those countries that show a commitment to social sector and human development support .
Mr President , I suppose I can start on a note of slight optimism in that President Mugabe has now named the days for the election as 24 and 25 June .
But on the down side , he is increasing all the army and civil servants ' pay as a straight bribe .
I sincerely hope that Members of this Parliament will have the chance to act as observers , as these elections must be seen to have been free , fair and transparent in the atmosphere of fear that President Mugabe has created .
Only last month we passed a resolution in this Chamber condemning violence , calling for the return to full democracy and for free and fair elections to be held .
Some of these demands have now hopefully been implemented , but not before another white farmer had been murdered .
We all accept that there must be a redistribution of the best land in Zimbabwe , but this must be done through round table negotiations , and not with the violent acts we have seen over the last few months .
President Mugabe has now set up a committee of white farmers and Mugabe supporters , hopefully to reach a sensible agreement on land redistribution .
President Mugabe should never forget the economic damage that will be done to Zimbabwe ' s economy if land redistribution simply means the land goes back to subsistence farming in small blocks
