This is the sharing of responsibility .
The moral of this story is that we either act jointly , or the problem will get out of hand .
Secondly , I would like emphasize the fact that there are of course also problems in the sphere of foreign policy .
These issues fall outside the scope of this report and outside the competence of the Committee on External Economic Relations .
Mr President , when discussing the first report by Mr Sainjon on this topic , we already expressed our appreciation and our criticism .
By mixing the public and private spheres , he ignores the nature and responsibilities of public administration on the one hand , and business on the other .
That is why we cannot support this report .
My group is wholly sympathetic to the difficulty in which the Commission finds itself , because no one has yet quite invented the wheel to solve this problem .
We can debate this matter in a somewhat more peaceful frame of mind , but I have to tell you honestly that I am discussing it with mixed feelings .
I find it extremely difficult to start talking about instruments which have a sound function within the context of a common asylum policy , but in isolation seem to be there to keep asylum seekers out .
That is also a good thing .
So to conclude , I repeat that in my view genuine political refugees should be received in countries neighbouring their countries of origin which have on the whole a similar way of life and culture , and therefore not in Europe , and that we are prepared to support this policy materially .
Now it appears that the accountant , previously the prototype of a dry , upright figure working on his own who would only get a look in to see that figures entered in the books were correct , has now become someone who also intervenes in what happens in companies .
That is why we submitted our amendment to paragraph 7.
In the light of the obligations I do not consider it justifiable for the Commission and the Council to resist Switzerland 's ambitions for a sufficiently high levy on heavy goods vehicles to bring about an actual transfer from road to rail .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , it is high time something was done .
Because as long as the agreement has not been signed , there are unnecessary traffic diversions .
In a word , we agree that in the negotiations with Switzerland we must start with the right measurements .
Those are the two amendments to this amendment .
This morning some German ministers declared publicly ; yes , we will have to do something for Algeria , because otherwise the waves will hit us again .
Austria , meanwhile , finds that membership of the EU does not only entail benefits .
I ask Commissioner van de Broek whether the said report is correct .
Therefore , colleagues , how can we stop the explosive population growth in these countries ?
I hope Europe will not fall behind .
To conclude , Mr President , a remark about the situation in Chiapas .
Bilateral agreements are not the solution , because they offer too many opportunities for secret deals .
And rightly so .
So it is gratifying that , at the Council of Europe , a charter awaiting signature which forbids the cloning of humans .
I sincerely hope that we decide on an absolute , tough position against human cloning .
Humane penalties instead of the death penalty is one of the most important symbols of the state of law and of true democracy .
They have never been thus in Kenya since the country 's independence .
These are small things which in my view can have great results .
Especially where more structural development aid is concerned , preference should be given to the aid programmes from the Member States .
After all , poor countries which are weighed down by unbearably high debts , and as a result have to hand over far too much of their yearly budget to interest payments , have far too little money to implement their own policy , and are therefore becoming poorer and poorer , become more dependent on aid , from the Union amongst others .
Aid should not be parachuted in .
Aid must stimulate people to take matters in hand themselves , and should not become a habit .
What has transit through Ireland got to do with Switzerland , for instance ?
Mr President , I can agree with the good intentions of the Torres Couto report , but I would like make a few comments .
To my mind it would be better if , slowly but gradually , we worked towards writing off the debts , but then we should be allowed to make some demands .
Although it was generally acknowledged that the developing countries could never pay off these debts , writing them off or rescheduling them was never a matter for discussion , in particular as far the multinational debts were concerned .
This contrasts sharply with the United States ' efforts in that part of the world .
Article 157 of the Treaty states - and we all recognise now - that we must have clear independence and that Commissioners cannot accept any instructions , nor should Member States or even Heads of States of Member States give any instructions to this body .
But it is now more important that we in this House establish this as a firm rule for the future with the agreement of the President of the Commission .
In that sense we are satisfied with the statement made by Commissioner Santer , and we fully support its general direction .
All demands
