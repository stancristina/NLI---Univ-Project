consistent innovation in the environmental sphere , an incentive to invest in recycling capacity .
There has been a great deal of debate about whether material-specific targets should be prescribed or not .
It is , in fact , an improper use of re-use , and one that must be avoided .
In Johannesburg , the entire world is talking about sustainable development .
It is the best guarantee for future generations not to be saddled with our waste , a shortage of natural resources and climate changes .
What is missing are more effective rules for the prevention of waste , the re-use of packaging material and producer responsibility .
What works in one country does not in another .
That is my conclusion in general .
Firstly , we feel it is exaggerated to ban all exports of insecticides that are banned in Europe .
As far as trade is concerned , I do not know whether Mr Deva has read the article in The Economist a few weeks ago , which clearly stated that the trade barriers among the developing countries are much higher than those with the rich countries .
Despite pleas from Parliament and the Commission to abolish these subsidies in 2002 , the European sugar lobbyists managed to persuade their governments to extend the protectionism to 2009 .
More environmental agriculture , the abolition of export subsidies and the strict enforcement of food security rules - that is what sustainable development is about .
Countries should not be coerced , and it is unacceptable to take advantage of their famine .
This is currently what we see happening at the Johannesburg Summit .
I am ashamed when I observe how privatisation makes entire peoples , entire countries or regions , dependent for their income on executive boards that only take account of the interests of their own shareholders .
Cows became cannibals and the animals ' nature was no longer taken into consideration .
However , since the use of airspace is set to grow exponentially over the next few years , our busy airspace will be placed under enormous pressure , with all the safety risks that this entails .
A high safety level and a strict regulatory framework are what matter ; not whether services are provided by the public or private sector .
Such an approach would , in my view , make it impossible to reach the goal of increased efficiency whilst retaining the same safety level .
Commissioner , I have heard many times that everything is cut and dried , but I need to see it to believe it .
Moreover , Eurocontrol is not only a regulatory body but also a service provider , which means that we are creating a serious conflict of interest .
It is in these terms that our explanatory documents once again underline the importance of the Commission 's proposal for a directive .
We cannot fail to observe that the accident figures vary widely across different regions and continents across the world .
In 25 % of the cases involving third-country aircraft , the flight manuals or navigation maps are missing , or the Global Positioning Systems are not sufficiently updated .
Furthermore , and I should like to finish on this note , we need to prevent privatisations in the aviation sector , and particularly privatisations in the safety field , from undermining this very safety , because that is probably when corners will once again be cut .
The standards for the various services should be as uniform as possible , preferably at global level and at least at European level , where we should draw on the expertise and experience of organisations such as ICAO , Eurocontrol and soon also EASA .
In my view , this debate also has an international political dimension .
This discussion is immaterial in the US , as it has one aviation authority .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , I should like to speak about the report on noise charges at airports .
Within the present common European framework , noise charges are calculated in a readily understood format , which enhances transparency , fairness of treatment and predictability and avoids arbitrariness .
It is therefore not necessary to make exceptions for airports that pursue a strict policy in the field of noise charges .
Within the framework which the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has outlined , a very strict policy is possible .
Finally , I should like to make a comment on the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens .
The step from the European airspace to noise is naturally a simple one .
It is about harmonisation , and these noise charges must naturally be the result of noise classification .
I would state very clearly that we will certainly be retaining their amendments .
I can inform you that most of my group will , in the plenary , be endorsing the amended proposal , as approved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
In addition , there is no transparency in the conditions under which this airport will be established , the way in which the licences are granted or the question whether the daytime and night-time scheme is being maintained .
Thirdly , certification in accordance with the ICAO standard should be introduced .
The proposal 's objective is to lift a number of limits on the value of sales promotions and to harmonise a series of information requirements at the same time .
Mr President , Commission , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to say a word of thanks to all my fellow Members of this House , and particularly the shadow rapporteurs , with whom I have worked closely in order to pilot the report on sales promotion into the plenary .
