way in which we want to deal with refugees and immigrants in future .
If this is the case , then it is also clear that our discussion must be as free from ideology as possible .
No human being is illegal , and one cannot possibly tell whether or not a human being is in an illegal situation .
May I remind you of the very unfortunate attempts of Commissioner Vitorino ' s predecessor , Mrs Gradin .
Those wishing to permit the entry and residence of all eligible relatives in addition to the core family may do so .
So not only is the call for more equitable burden sharing as regards receiving refugees justified , but also burden sharing itself is an expression of solidarity between the peoples of Europe .
It is evident that the Commission is in a better position than the individual Member States to promote the Community interest , whereas individual Member States tend to concentrate on their own interests .
A Community expulsion law would be a directive in which the Community lays down a proper legislative procedure stipulating the circumstances in which an illegal immigrant can be expelled and possibly even deported .
This crime prevention network is also important in other respects .
Mr President , I would like to point out that competition is an important area of policy , but that it is not part of the Built-In Agenda .
If groups abandon jointly negotiated compromise proposals literally overnight and suddenly put in writing the opposite of their original statements , then that casts some doubt on the very seriousness of this procedure .
Madam President , I would also like to thank the Commissioner for all the effort she has put into these negotiations .
This legal instrument will also help to counter a trend which I view with increasing scepticism .
The Commission has high-handedly ignored all Parliament 's suggestions in this field , and it is giving exactly the same treatment to Parliament 's requests for a European Public Prosecutor 's Office to be set up and for the independence of OLAF , the European Anti-Fraud Office , to be guaranteed .
Mr President , the increasing frequency of fraud offences within the Union and the Commission 's behaviour are a scandal .
And his conclusion that there have not yet been any appreciable improvements in the fight against fraud also coincides with the OLAF Supervisory Committee 's view .
No one can have any political interest in doing that .
The other problem that has been acute since 1 January 2001 is that we also wish to indicate the places where the animal was born and reared .
The Community action to tackle the first BSE crisis , however , also included full funding of public storage and an early-marketing premium for calves as well as additional direct aid amounting to EUR 1 309.9 million .
In other words , the Commission is not at liberty to exceed the prescribed limit .
He did , however , repudiate suggestions that Turkey sought to incorporate the northern part of Cyprus as its eighty-second province .
It is an important principle that our accession negotiations with Cyprus should not suffer because the political conflict has not yet been resolved .
They may be summarised as follows : transitional arrangements should not relate to the nature of the acquis but only to the postponement of its application for a fixed period ; they must not cause any significant distortion of competition ; they must include a clear implementation plan , including details of any necessary investments ; in areas connected with the internal market , transitional arrangements must not be too numerous and must be of short duration .
You know that the discussion process and the decision-making process on these issues have only just begun .
Nor do we have enough money to avail ourselves of the instruments of mass communication , which means that we cannot buy advertising space or write scripts for publicity spots on TV .
People must be told what is at stake , and we must address the anxieties , concerns and fears that are associated with enlargement and tell our people quite openly and clearly what we are doing to ensure that the contingencies they fear will not materialise .
I do not believe it would be wise for the Commission to provide the applicant States with money for their own public-relations activities .
Mr President , I have no wish to punish anyone , so I shall come to the point fairly quickly .
I believe the parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee fought very hard before reluctantly consenting to the result of the conciliation process , and that is also how my group will vote in the Chamber .
That is precisely why we believe that this target must be binding , and the process should begin in that country where the level of energy efficiency is highest , the country most capable of effecting such an improvement .
And here I wonder whether the European Investment Bank could play a bigger part .
That is why I am critical on this point , but only on this point , of the Swedish Prime Minister ' s letter of 7 March , which I otherwise welcome , in which he says that Nice represents a strong institutional basis for the future of the European Union .
One final comment , Madam President-in-Office : you spoke of the Community method and Robert Schuman .
In my view , this means introducing a quasi-constitutional process , as a result of which a unified Europe is established by the will of its people .
That is the nub of the discussion and the conflict between us .
Involving national parliaments at the very earliest stage makes a second parliamentary level unnecessary and would be a simpler and perhaps cheaper and less bureaucratic solution
