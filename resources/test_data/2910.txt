I share Mr Florenz ' view that the reduction of waste is an essential element of sustainable waste management .
Nevertheless , I have read the amendments and this evening , we in the relevant committee will see what we can do with them all and make sure that an opinion is brought before Parliament .
One of the laws in the United States that should apply is the Privacy Act , but this Act does not apply to people from third countries , to name but one example .
I think that the question to the Court , as to whether we can conclude international agreements in which both Parliament and the American Congress are placed offside , is a very interesting one indeed .
We accept that further amendments will be tabled , but these amendments may not go so far as to fundamentally depart from the option .
I very much welcome this Commission proposal .
It very much looks as if the European Commission , which proposes maximum harmonisation , has wrongly evaluated the political feasibility of this .
Consumers will find that incomprehensible ; they want the protection that they enjoy in their own countries .
This article constitutes a huge stumbling block in terms of effective consumer protection .
In this connection , we have asked that MRLs be stipulated on the basis of best agricultural practices , particularly integrated agricultural methods involving the lowest possible dosage and spray frequencies .
First of all , maximum values for residues must be kept as low as possible .
It is gratifying to note that the Council has reached a political agreement after all , in which Parliament’s reservations have been duly incorporated .
Do you intend to go to the Court of Justice again ?
I am indebted to them for the unanimity and support .
Point 2 : this linking directive is independent of the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol , as is the law on emission trading .
Even if trees die a natural death , they expel all the carbon absorbed .
By acting in this way , we would put our ecological credibility on the line .
Neither has Greenpeace .
We , in Europe , have adopted defensive policy in the environmental field for too long .
Mr de Roo has done his level best , on which I should like to congratulate him warmly .
More specifically , we discussed the avoidance of the use of heavy metals and collection targets .
The guiding principle underlying drafts of the Commission ’s revised battery directive has always been a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries .
The substitute for nickel-cadmium batteries , namely nickel-metal-hydride batteries , operate at a temperature of -20° Celsius to +60° Celsius .
The same applies to button cells in hearing aids and watches , cordless power tools , emergency lighting and all industrial applications .
The Commission has proposed a closed-loop system , but the rapporteur has already pointed out that only 80 % is being recovered , which means that 20 % must be disappearing into the environment .
I hope that the majority in this House will know better .     Madam President , I reluctantly agree with what is now on the table .
I still regret the way in which , last time , Mrs Gillig and her Socialist colleagues refused even to bring this point to a vote in a democratic manner .
I know that the Council is against it , but we could have kept this all together .
My group considers this to be a sound basis , and also sets great store by the fact that it is ensured that the first step will be ready , as a matter of priority , by 1 May .
The Netherlands , along with its neighbouring countries Germany and Belgium , should set an example for the other Member States in areas in which a great deal of bilateral negotiation is yet to take place , and the Netherlands should , if possible , also produce more ambitious cooperation agreements for the 25 Member States , because it is to be expected that labour migration will intensify .
Tomorrow , my group will be voting in favour of the Lambert report .
That , of course , also applies to other countries that are extremely anxious that , upon the EU’s imminent enlargement , a heavy burden will be placed on their social security .
Madam President , Commissioner , I hope that we can , together , realise the ideal of mobility among Member States being promoted , and that first-generation frontier workers will be compensated accordingly and do not always have to fight for their rights .
This is quite a serious blemish on a candidate Member State .
In September 2003 , Parliament approved an initial report by Mr Sterckx , which gave a detailed account of events and made a few recommendations .
Let me now turn to the report .
This also applies to a huge number of colleagues of his .
A sound compromise has been reached in the committee on the European coastguard service .
These could be introduced tomorrow ; the market is ready for them .
Needless to say , coordination and cooperation among Member States is of key importance .
We are all in favour of giving the European Maritime Safety Agency ( EMSA ) , the new institution , an important role during the further development of policy in this field , including controls and suchlike .     Mr President , Commissioner , as other Members have already said , we can be pleased with the work the rapporteur has done .
In my view , far more attention should be paid to the maintenance and state of the ships .
I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on her work in the field of maritime safety .
