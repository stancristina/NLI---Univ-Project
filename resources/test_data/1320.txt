Since the Commission has an obligation to respect the Treaties , the Council should not order it , the Council should request it to put forward a proposal in accordance with such and such an article of the Treaties so that we can move towards protecting these rights .
Madam President , the most genuine , direct , live contact that the European Parliament has with the citizens of Europe , individually and collectively , is the procedure within the Committee on Petitions .
In these cases did the citizen , the petitioner , get justice in the end or not ?
What will happen after that ?
Finally , I would suggest that the debate take place not once a year but , if possible , during each part-session - if we appreciate the importance of the institution - or even every six months so that Parliament can be brought up-to-date , and so that it can supervise and assist the committee in its task .
They are of course parallel , complementary functions .
A year ago exactly , as rapporteur for the annual report of the Ombudsman , I had the honour of presenting the views of the Committee on Petitions .
I wish to say briefly that I think the European Parliament has made a good choice and the European Union has a worthy representative in the European Ombudsman , because really and truly Mr SÃ¶derman has constructed and is still trying tirelessly to construct this invaluable instrument .
We have some breathing space before the next elections , therefore it is necessary today to send a strong message to the people concerning their participation in the developments of the European Union .
I believe that such disasters , with hundreds of dead and thousands of injured victims , and with incalculable economic and social repercussions , must make the European Union treat them seriously .
Finally , I believe that in this matter Turkey must today have the full support of the European Union , regardless of the problems it has or does not have with the European Union .
In the region that extends from Italy to Greece , Turkey and the rest of the Middle East earthquakes are observed to have typically many similarities and , unfortunately , similar effects .
And I ask this .
Could the Commission perhaps give us some initial thoughts on the matter ?
Tens of thousands of hectares of cultivated land and a large number of cattle farms were completely burned .
Existing legislation is so lax that mafia groups avail themselves of arsonists in concert with commercial entrepreneurial construction interests and cause the fires in Greece , beyond what can normally be expected .
Madam President , Greece has the painful privilege of being the country where , with each of the many fires that occur , the extent of the damage is greater than anywhere else in Europe .
I believe that the European Parliament would like to express its support and solidarity for my compatriots .
Finally , I wish to highlight in the most unambiguous way that the total prevention of these ravaged regions being turned into plots of land for building must be debated at all costs .
Madam President , every year in Greece and in other Mediterranean countries of the Community enormous areas of forests are burned .
I call on you , Commissioner , to inform us : firstly whether the action plans were handed over to you by the Greek government in 1997 and what sums of money were pledged for that purpose from the Community budget ; secondly , what is happening with the work of the national land registry which is being financed by the second Community Support Framework and for which the Greek government was requested to make cutbacks and to transfer money to other works .
Madam President , I will not describe the disasters .
We ourselves abolished the budget line which corresponded to this issue .
In addition , I would like to emphasize that in fact there is a problem , that a way needs to be found to give help , as the extent of the disasters is extremely great , and that we ourselves must try to find this way and not abolish budget lines when we need them .
Beyond the whims of nature fires are caused by , or facilitated by , the lack of a land registry , because there is always the hope that the burned areas can be appropriated , and by arbitrary building and town planning that lacks infrastructure or suitable access and impedes the extinguishing of fires .
It can also refuse funding which , directly or indirectly , encourages or turns a blind eye to arbitrary building .
Madam President , we are absolutely , categorically , for the resolution and for the acceptance of all requests , and we ask the Commission to carry out its duty in a responsible way because it would be unacceptable for it to play the Pontius Pilate in such matters .
They find various excuses that all the money was used up , especially after the reunification of the two German states .
It is clear that it is unquestionably incumbent upon us to find the fairest possible way of addressing the issue of some of the assets of Holocaust victims .
However , other countries that were involved in this matter need to take the same corrective action .
What he has told us is very interesting .
I therefore think that , although the things the rapporteur proposes are very positive , we should reinforce them in some quarters .
And , of course , as was quite rightly mentioned , compensation must be paid out on the spot and in cash , even if it is difficult for the carriers to do so at that precise moment
