Combating poverty is the primary goal of the EU' s development policy .
There are , in particular , three very important points with which the Commission ' s communication has not dealt particularly thoroughly .
Bearing in mind the fact that women , and especially women of child-bearing age , are the mainstay of development and the fight against poverty and the fact that reproductive health also includes the fight against HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , it is significant that , in general , the Commission rarely refers to health , including women ' s reproductive health rights , other than in an aside .
It is of the very greatest importance that the EU should help combat these life-threatening diseases that are partly responsible for halting the development process .
As is well known , George W. Bush has recently suspended all aid to organisations which , in any way whatsoever , offer advice on contraception and abortion .
Secondly , it is a real threat to public health - or , rather , the absence of public health - in developing countries .
I therefore hope that the House will adopt those amendments also adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
We have voted against the overall report , because we think that the agreement with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea involves the economic exploitation of that country .
Instead , the EU should help Equatorial Guinea to be in position to exploit its fishing resources itself .
This system of quotas expires at the end of the production year on 30 June 2001 , and the Commission proposes that the current system be continued for a period of two years , with certain changes of limited scope .
The Commission omits to say how the period 2003-2006 is to be funded .
The Commission proposes that the price be kept at the same level but that the quotas be reduced by 115 000 tons .
The aforesaid reduction in the production quota will mean that the market for sugar from the world ' s poorest countries can be opened in accordance with the 'everything but arms ' principle .
As I mentioned before , however , what is then missing is information from the Commission to the sugar industry and the sugar producers about funding during the period 2003-2006 .
At the same time , however , we demand that the reform of the organisation of the market be in place no later than in 2003 .
Mr President , the EU' s organisation of the market in sugar is far and away the most protectionist in the world .
It is incomprehensible that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should wish to see the system extended to 2006 , especially when the Court of Auditors has pointed out that the Commission has withheld relevant information and ought to have dealt with the issues of the economic costs of surplus production , the effects on world market prices and developing countries ' income and the impact on the environment .
In spite of everything , that is not , however , the worst of it .
What really tops it all is the fact that the failure to reform the policy on sugar has obstructed the 'everything but arms ' initiative whereby the world ' s 48 poorest countries would be given access to the EU' s market .
It is an initiative which , in the worst case , would have increased imports of sugar by approximately 100 000 tons per year .
It is deeply disheartening for this House that Parliament ' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should want to be still more protectionist than the European farming lobby .
This is a task which the Commission has been all too lax about .
I should like to have seen the President of the Commission here this evening .
Almost a year ago , the Commission promised , in its work programme for 2000 , to present a strategy , but nothing has happened .
Allow me just to point out a couple of the practical problems with the EU' s information policy , or lack of information policy .
The information is too centralised , it is all prepared in Brussels and it is not directed at target groups according , for example , to gender , age , geographical considerations and the level of education of population groups .
There are also some thoroughly topical and practical problems .
There are too many bureaucratic obstacles to accessing information .
Is it reasonable that copies of the Official Journal of the EC which are more than three months old should have to be paid for ?
Too much information is only available in the EU' s main languages .
We have eleven official languages in the EU , and all eleven must be used .
There must be a determination to make optimum use of the information technology now available .
I assume and hope that , as Mrs Pack also mentioned , the Commission ' s offices in the major European cities will be involved and that they will be given tasks and responsibilities , as well as means to address and inform the man or woman in the street .
Commissioner , this task has now become a matter of urgency .
Unfortunately , it is a proposal which not only ignores the disease but also exacerbates both the symptoms and the disease .
Whom is it imagined will be intimidated by this proposal ?
Whom is it imagined will profit from this ?
Take a country like Afghanistan which is now almost surrounded by closed borders .
There is no room for more camps in the locality , as some of us call it .
Whom do we want them to pay ?
The Mafia , or the church and humanitarian organisations ?
If we increase the penalty , then we see
