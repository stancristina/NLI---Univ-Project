We have done so because this report highlights the many serious problems faced by frontier workers .
In spite of the failure to introduce qualified majority voting in this area at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice , we want to use our vote today to send a powerful signal to the Council and call upon them to complete a thoroughgoing review and simplification of Regulation No 1408 .
We believe that the rules for coordination must be simple and easy to administer .
We cannot therefore support a new directive which adds new procedures to Regulation No 1408 .
In addition , we want to stress that we do not consider , either , that health benefits such as medical treatment can be compared with general services , and that responsibility for this area must continue solely to be the responsibility of the Member States .
- ( DA ) The joint motion for a resolution contains many sensible ideas but does not do justice to the very difficult situation in which NATO has placed the civilian population in the Balkans , the soldiers who were stationed there and their dependents .
American soldiers in KFOR were warned against breathing in depleted uranium .
We do not think that the American army provides warnings of this kind without good reason .
The consequences for the civil population in those areas exposed to military action by NATO have by no means been thoroughly investigated .
We therefore believe it is quite inadequate merely to carry out another investigation into the consequences of using depleted uranium weapons .
We believe the matter has now been quite carefully examined .
In our view , the precautionary principle must , in any case , also cover those who report for international assignments , as well as the civil population in war zones .
All production ought to be stopped , and all stockpiles destroyed .
That is partly what this speech is about .
Something ought perhaps also to have been included about the situation regarding religious freedom for the Falun Gong sect , but it was not .
I am also pleased that Chechnya has been mentioned .
It is an area which may yet become a powder keg for security policy in that area , and perhaps also in our own area .
There are some areas to which I think too little priority has been given .
The Swedish Presidency says that it will give high priority to the work done towards abolishing the death penalty .
In this connection , we need to keep our eyes on our so-called friends .
Following the American presidential election , the number of death sentences carried out in the United States will reach record levels .
I also think we have to remember another of our 'friends ' , namely Turkey - an applicant country - which we do not mention at all in this resolution .
Turkey does not comply with the Convention Against Torture .
That is not an easy question to answer , but we know more today than we once did , thanks partly to the many NGOs and journalists who constantly report on human rights violations around the world , and knowledge is a prerequisite for action .
But there is , in fact , an obligation to act upon information , so that not to do anything is to let down those whose rights are being violated , and in this area the EU has an independent responsibility .
As many speakers have mentioned , the EU has quite a high profile in the area of human rights , and that is both a good and a bad thing .
In relation to Central and Eastern European countries , we have had success with our policy , which can probably best be characterised as an iron fist in a velvet glove .
Therefore , it is also gratifying that we have focused on human rights in connection with the new ACP-EU partnership agreements .
If we have to introduce sanctions in Central and Eastern Europe , then everyone will be affected .
If we are obliged to introduce sanctions , which more often than not will only affect the poor sector of the population , we therefore need , where developing countries are concerned , to establish a special strategy with regard to sanctions so that we do not only hit those we really wanted to help , as well as those who have suffered in the past .
We must be clear which sanctions are to be imposed .
When we go out into the world , we must try to be very specific and see what the human rights situation is like in the countries concerned .
We can organise meetings with human rights activists and human rights organisations in the area and we can arrange for the final report to deal with human rights issues .
I should like , in conclusion , to say that those areas dealt with in the resolution are important , but that they are not , of course , the only areas demanding our attention .
We think it is a good custom for the presidency to alternate .
We call upon the presidency of the Council to re-open the negotiations on the Treaty of Nice so that this can be scrutinised democratically .
It is also startling that the negotiations ended with a decision to hold all summits in Brussels , with the Swedish Prime Minister ' s not knowing about this decision when we believed he was involved in making it .
It is unwise to introduce majority voting for the purpose of appointing the individual countries ' Commissioners .
With an EU government formed through majority voting , an EU State is on the horizon instead of the electorate ' s preferred vision of a Europe of nations and democracies .
We call upon Sweden to introduce genuine
