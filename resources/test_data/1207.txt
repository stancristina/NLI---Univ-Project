But we should not forget that it is not the only political party being persecuted .
There are still thousands of political prisoners being held in wretched conditions , mainly in F-type solitary confinement cells .
They want no change to the status quo , so that it is easier for them to exploit Turkey 's market , its cheap labour and its geopolitical position .
The dead number over one hundred Palestinians and thirty-five Israelis .
Those who call themselves the guardians of civilisation are proving once again to be barbarians and the most dangerous terrorists of all .
Thanks to Mr Ferber 's hard work , we have what I think is a first class result with what appeared to be an exceptionally tricky issue .
And I think that , in the end , we managed to find a creative way of reconciling these two needs .
Are there in fact any such optimistic results for the 'difficult countries' , including my own ?
It does not make sense to move heaven and earth so that our cohesion policy can continue to be efficient while , at the same time , jeopardising the future of a village post office which is the village 's lifeline .
So an end to hypocrisy !
We must do something to put an end to this heinous crime .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took the same position and unanimously approved my opinion and my amendments , almost all of which were included by the rapporteurs in their reports , for which I thank them .
The Lisbon objectives of a dynamic and competitive European Union with full employment depend on a competitive internal market in electricity and natural gas .
This is just one example of the favours being done to the private sector .
The fact that the amendments increase the intervention of the European Commission is also a very serious matter .
We recently witnessed the collapse of the Taliban regime , which highlighted the tragic position of women in Afghanistan .
They also turn the spotlight on the violation of women 's fundamental freedoms and rights by fundamentalist , anti-democratic regimes centre stage in a most dramatic manner .
Under these regimes , the sexual conduct , way of life and reproductive functions of women , even the way they dress , are generally controlled by religious leaders , allegedly abiding by scriptures and cultural traditions , while inhumane , violent and humiliating punishment , such as whipping and stoning , is the order of the day .
I think there is a serious problem in Poland .
History teaches us - and modern times also show us - that women are the first and most vulnerable victims of fundamentalism and it is this which interests Parliament 's Committee on Women 's Rights .
It is true that women and how they live are always the last bastion of resistance to progress in a country or society .
Anyway , keeping the faith cannot go hand in glove with suppression and violence .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Izquierdo Rojo because she touches on a very important and difficult problem in her report .
To start with , as far as fundamentalism is concerned , I think that we have to analyse the concept outside the European Union .
On Women 's Day recently , we discussed Muslim women in Europe .
However , any interpretation of the Koran or any other religion in the European Union cannot be respected unless the basic laws and principles of the European Union are respected first .
The European Commission has proposed specific measures to mainstream the gender dimension in all forms of foreign policy , in external trade , in development aid , in all the European Union 's individual agreements with third countries and at summits organised between the European Union and various continents , such as the Europe/Africa , Europe/Asia and Europe/Latin America summits .
Similarly , we are organising an initial seminar in March for experts from the 15 Member States and delegates invited from all over the world to debate a foreign policy action plan to be complied with by the European Union and the Member States .
Mr President , I should like , first , to congratulate Mrs Thorning-Schmidt , because she has dealt with what is , both technically and politically , a very difficult issue .
Loss of hearing is clearly the most widely-known harmful effect of noise .
The Commission has accepted the Council 's common position in that it enhances the level of protection set out in the Commission proposal .
Although I agree with the idea behind Amendment No 3 , the second part of Amendment No 4 , Amendment No 5 , Amendment No 13 and the second part of Amendment No 16 , the Commission cannot accept them for reasons of consistency and legislative procedure .
Factory noise has been compared with the noise from music or concerts .
I should also like to remind the House that HINDREC , the European Association of Industry , Hotels and Restaurants , agrees with the proposal currently on the table .
Basically what they do is to reduce the sound to which each worker is exposed to a level set by the worker , so that they can do their job without suffering this gradual deterioration in their hearing .
Of course we shall be examining the Commission proposal in the European Parliament 's Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and studying the details , but I should like now to ask you three very brief questions .
In other words , how do the bilateral agreements stand in relation to the European Commission 's multilateral measures ?
Thirdly , a question which bears no relation to this issue but is highly topical and ,
