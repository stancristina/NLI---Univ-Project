Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar for an altogether outstanding report .
This time we have a new treaty with a partially new content .
We also need a major effort in the area of training measures and a proper effort in the area of small and medium-sized businesses .
Seen in the long term that can only be good .
Before Mrs Carlsson became a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we had the Molitor report , which investigated this question .
We looked into it on the committee and there is no such link .
We shall try to influence them prior to the employment summit .
I would like to say thank you for your reply .
The directive includes far-reaching requirements for accounts of all the consequences of various methods of working and also for a public statement of emission risks .
I would like to thank Commissioner Bangemann for his reply .
It has been used for just over 20 years , not only in tunnel construction , but also at airports and in mines , and so on .
However , there is no point in replying to it now since he is not here himself now .
There is no area where decision-making is being transferred closer to the citizens of the Member States .
I would like in particular to point out two paragraphs in the report which I cannot accept .
The second area is that the report demands new large institutional changes as an absolute condition for a future enlargement of the EU.
In this way enlargement is being taken 'hostage ' , but there is nothing to say that an enlargement would be more successful if the dominance of the large states in the EU were increased further by giving them more votes on the Council of Ministers .
We were agreed and the criticism was massive precisely because of the lack of openness and public insight as well as the 'concerns ' about supranationality , intergovernmentalism and protocols etc . in the third pillar which make it completely incomprehensible , and mean that it could in fact lead to legal uncertainty .
The citizens have very little sympathy for these superpower dreams and there is very little desire for EU federalism .
There have been a number of advances , but are they sufficient to deal with the issues which we are facing ?
We also already have 200 Russian mafia organizations which have started to operate within the Union 's borders , and drugs syndicates have multi-billion turnovers in the Union .
The Union needs to create a clearer profile and a stronger European identity in order to give our coordinating efforts greater effect on international developments .
That ought to be able to contribute to the Member States taking a greater European responsibility and raising the value of the citizens ' European interests .
I am therefore grateful that the report takes this up .
That is the ultimate basis for the will of the people which can drive forward the necessary reforms .
It is not a matter of what others shall do later , but of what we shall do now .
However , recently there have been very credible reports that in fact the Algerian government itself may have been involved in this .
I hope that it will apply for a long time to come and that each country will decide for itself what shipments of radioactive waste from other countries it will accept .
I believe that my interpretation of this is correct , but if it is the case that this is also wrong and that the Council is right , I would also be pleased to convey that message to my country , Sweden .
Is it not the case that this explanation relates to the method to be used for terminal storage and that that is decided by people themselves , not by the waste that is to be terminally stored ?
A great deal has happened recently , partly at the latest party congress and partly during President Jiang 's visit to the USA with the famous statement about a 'mistake ' at Tiananmen Square .
Is a hopeful change taking place in China or not ?
The reports on massacres in Algeria which I spoke about do not implicate the Algerian government , but they do implicate the Algerian authorities .
However , the treaty we have entered into is based on the idea that the certificates we receive from the exporting countries should be correct .
Keeping salmonella out demands a lot of a country .
Wherever it occurs , the whole flock or herd must be destroyed .
How can we justify these costs when , in spite of veterinary certificates , of a lot of the meat being imported proves to contain large amounts of salmonella ?
We cannot do that today .
After Mr Wohlfart 's formal and uninvolved response , I am unable to trust the Council in this respect .
We have succeeded in Sweden , but it cost us a great deal .
Even worse are the salmonella bacteria which have become resistant to antibiotics .
My question is when does the Council really expect to have effectiveness so that the inspections which are carried out can be checked and we can rely on the certificates which exist .
I would also like us to be able to rely on the certificates which are issued in all parts of Europe .
I have a follow-up question which I would like to have answered .
What would be the result of such a decision on the part of Sweden ?
I would like to ask what objectives actually exist .
Is there an objective that the whole of the European Union should be as free of salmonella as Sweden and
