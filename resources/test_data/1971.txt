libraries : these kinds of rightholder exceptions are vital for promoting research which is so important for our economic health .
A less high profile exception that is important economically is the right of reverse engineering of computer software .
We would entirely reject those amendments which are seeking to inhibit the use of those public interest exceptions .
We therefore accept the need to tighten up the wording of Article 6( 4 ) , to clarify its role and to restrict it to truly on-demand interactive services .
Having said that , there is another exception which is more controversial , which is ordinary private copying .
We are all pleased to see the rules have been tightened up to prevent it being abused and used as a loophole for piracy ; that is something that we would also support .
I would lastly express some reservations about Amendment No 11 .
If this amendment is passed , I fear that the broadcasters will have an advantage .
They are getting something for nothing .
I think this skews the common position a little and , unless someone can convince me otherwise , I would have grave reservations about Amendment No 11 .
We have a sensible and balanced position and I fear Amendment No 11 may tilt that balance in the wrong direction .
Mr President , we are now close to the end of what has been a three-year process of reforming the legislation for the control and genetically modified use of organisms as products within the European Union .
We have now completed the process of reconciliation and we have a text for final approval .
The text before us meets many of Parliament 's demands at first and second reading .
We have the precautionary principle reaffirmed .
We have tighter risk assessment of all GMO releases .
We have schemes for monitoring traceability that will ensure continuous assessment of all releases throughout the ten-year life of this time-limitation for consents .
We have achieved the phasing out of all harmful , antibiotic-resistant marker genes .
We have a clear timetable .
We have a clear and transparent process and a clear timetable for the approvals which ensure the mandatory consultation of the public which guarantees public registers of locations of GMOs grown and used .
Steps have also been taken on the issues of liability , traceability and labelling .
Parliament can only be satisfied on those issues , however , when we see the additional legislation and flanking measures which I understand are now in preparation within the Commission .
In short , we have in front of us today for our approval the toughest GMO legislation in the world , so tough , in fact , that some natural foods in common use today would not pass through this procedure .
Should we approve this legislation tomorrow it would mean the beginning of the end of the present informal 'moratorium ' on GMO commercial approvals .
Certain Members of the Council have , however , already made it clear that they will scrutinise individual applications for approval and may not allow commercialisation until legislation on traceability and labelling is in place .
I welcome this .
This is a final safeguard to the recommencement of an approval process which has been long awaited but it can be no reason for opposing the final approval of the new 90/220 legislation we have in front of us now .
This legislation is an essential building block and foundation for the success of those measures still to come .
I therefore commend this important legislation to the House .
It is essential to ensure the safe and proper use of GMO products within the European Union .
It is essential to ensure the building of public confidence in these products , it is essential to ensure that this new technology , which promises so much , will in the end deliver what we are seeking from it .
Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner three questions .
How soon does he think the 350 000 ceiling on beef taken into intervention will be passed and how far does he expect it to go ?
Is it not better to incinerate animals over 30 months old rather than start putting too much of this old beef into intervention ?
Finally , I do not understand the 90-animal limit because surely extensification , greening the agricultural policy is the way forward .
I can take the Commissioner to many farms in the UK where there are over 90 cattle being raised on an extensive-type regime and to smaller farms where cattle are intensively produced .
So surely it is the extensification payment that should be altered , not this 90-animal ceiling .
The Commission refers the honourable Member to the statement given by Commissioner Wallstr√∂m to the plenary session of this House on 17 January .
Since that date the Commission has convened a meeting of the group of experts established under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health consequences of the use of depleted uranium .
The report of that group will be ready in a few weeks ' time .
The World Health Organisation will also issue a report on the subject in the near future .
The Commission will then consider appropriate action to be taken in the light of the scientific evidence produced by these activities .
In response to the particular questions of the honourable Member , the Member States of the Union have not informed the Commission of their actions taken following receipt of the Regional Environmental Centre report .
The Commission has no plans to initiate medical examination programmes .
As the honourable Member will know , it is a regrettable fact that the people of the region face a variety of threats to health from several sources and some of those threats are obviously environmental in origin .
