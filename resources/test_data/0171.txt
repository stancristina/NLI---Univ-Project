We have waited for a long time to adopt a directive on promoting equality between the sexes in areas other than work .
I consequently voted in favour of this proposal for a directive .     .
This directive on equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services has been in the pipeline for a long time – it was first included on the Commission ’s social policy agenda in June 2000 .
I agree with the rapporteur that the use of gender – a factor that is beyond the control of individuals – as a criterion for calculation is wrong and , since it does not stand up to objective scrutiny , constitutes discrimination .
This policy has been undermined , both by the systematic closure of local slaughterhouses and their replacement by larger , centralised facilities , and by the lack of support for mobile abattoirs .
Secondly , the report shows that the number of cases of fraud and irregularities reported in 2002 has risen by 13 % to over EUR two billion , most of these under the Structural Funds .
We have shown solidarity , in various ways , with the Palestinian people , and with those individuals and groups in Israel who are fighting for peace in the region .
Parliament and the European Union must adopt clear and unequivocal positions to condemn terrorism , but such positions will only have credibility when they condemn the terrorist policies of the Israeli Government and when those positions lead to concrete political and diplomatic measures , such as suspending the association agreement with Israel .     Mr President , the conclusions of this Spring Summit show that government leaders are stubbornly pursuing a policy that is indifferent to the worsening economic and social situation , that turns a blind eye to the high levels of unemployment , poverty and social exclusion and the increase in social inequalities and a deaf ear to the protests of workers threatened by the relocation and restructuring of multinational companies .
The Council suggests that the priority should be to speed up the pace of reforms in the fields of employment , social security and health , despite growing public opposition to measures that , in some of our countries , are jeopardising fundamental social rights .
It should be noted that what is known as the Lamfalussy process for adopting legislation on the financial markets was accepted by the European Parliament , which meant that the basic political choices involved in the process would be taken by codecision and that the technical measures for implementing them would be adopted by the Commission .
The European Parliament is once again critical , but once again approves the process because , once again , it agrees with the stated aims .
There is a clear need for the third EU-Latin America summit in Mexico to set the date for the opening of negotiations on association agreements with the countries of Central America and the Andean Community , with identical characteristics ‘ , to those already concluded with Mexico and Chile , or to those currently being negotiated with Mercosur .
We should , therefore , promote relations with those countries that are mutually beneficial , both to the countries and Member States involved and to the EU as a whole and also to the balance of intercontinental socio-economic and geo-strategic relations .
From this point of view , I welcome the new agreement on political dialogue and cooperation that has been proposed , which is intended to strengthen relations between the Union and the Andean Community by extending political dialogue and enhancing cooperation and by establishing conditions that will enable us to negotiate a ‘viable and mutually advantageous ’ association agreement , which would include signing a free trade agreement .
With ten countries soon to join the EU , in 2004 , the Fund will be affected by the fact that various countries have benefited from European Investment Bank ( EIB ) loans , guaranteed by the EU budget , which means that these will be covered by the target amount from the moment they join the Union .
In this context , the Fund is also an important instrument for our policy of cooperation with third countries .
This proposal for a regulation arose from the need to amend Regulation 2728/94/EC/Euratom establishing a guarantee fund for external actions , with a view to new Member States joining on 1 May and their ensuing new status .
If we consider the ceiling for loans , which stands at EUR 20.260 million , we will rapidly conclude that the report accompanying this legislative proposal adds little to the underlying geopolitical considerations and objectives , particularly that of creating a pan-European-Mediterranean free trade area , in which the European Union can exert political , economic and military influence at regional level .
The Union’s enlargement , on 1 May 2004 , will increase the EIB’s lending capacity , without increasing the ceiling for its mandate to provide external loans , which will be particularly favourable , at a time when the European Union is stepping up cooperation with the potential candidate countries from the Western Balkans and is preparing gradually to extend its relations with other neighbours , to the South and East .
This world can be divided into ‘donors ’ and beneficiaries of the philanthropy of these ‘donors’ .
We therefore feel that this report is dangerous , because it portrays the world as those acting in good faith would like it to be or could be and not as it is .     .
This , must not , of course , preclude pursuing dialogue and providing humanitarian assistance or food aid .     .
As I said at first reading when we voted on this proposal for a directive ( 14 May 2003 ) , it is extremely important that we adopt a global
