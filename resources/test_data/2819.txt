Some government finances are indispensable prerequisites for economic stability and economic progress .
Securing budgetary discipline strengthens price stability and creates conditions which are conducive to creating much needed employment within the territories of the Union .
The Stability and Growth Pact States provide the 15 Member States of the Union with a comprehensive surveillance procedure to monitor their budgetary policies .
The Stability and Growth Pact calls for Member States to reach , in the medium term , a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus .
It must also identify the adjustment pacts adopted to reduce the general government debt ratios .
The Commission and Parliament monitor submissions made by each Member State of the Union to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact .
We must also remember that there are wider provisions for closer coordination of economic policies in general between the Member States of the Union .
The principle of the Stability and Growth Pact is also a logical progression from the criteria laid down in Maastricht for the Member States to comply with economic conditions for participation within the new European single currency .
The one comment I would like to make about the state of the single European currency is : Why do so many Member States want to join such a regime ?
It is clear that Greece will shortly join the existing 11 Member States who are participating in the economic and monetary union , and I wish to congratulate Greece on its economic recovery and wish it well in the future .
I welcome Greece into the euro zone .
It is also clear that Sweden and Denmark will accede to the single European currency regime over the next couple of years .
It is known that the vast majority of countries from eastern and central Europe want to sign up to the process of economic and monetary union in as short a time as possible , but I believe that the European Central Bank has to outline a clear strategy as to how it intends to bolster the value of the new euro .
The 290 million citizens within the existing 11 EMU countries have the right to know what the European Central Bank intends to do to maintain and enhance the value of the euro now and into the future .
Mr President , as you know , I am the co-rapporteur with Mrs Buitenweg on this important directive on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
I hope that you will rule that the vote , as per our agenda agreed on Monday , will go ahead and I have two points to make to our colleagues in the PPE in that respect .
The first is this : since this directive was first proposed , the whole furore across the European Union because of events in Austria and elsewhere , where the extreme right has come forward , has caused us , as a Parliament , with the widest possible across-party support , to work with the Council and the Commission to agree an accelerated timetable to enable this directive to go through to provide the strongest possible response to the racist and extremist threats that undermine our combined values .
That deal with the Council and with the Portuguese Presidency said that we would agree in this Parliament this week prior to the Council of Ministers ' meeting in June .
If we fail to meet that commitment , what does that say to the racists ?
And my second point : we talk about the dignity of Parliament .
What about the dignity of black and ethnic minority people subject to racial harassment , victimisation and discrimination ?
Madam President , I just wish to emphasise on behalf of the Liberal Group the desirability of debating and voting this report this week .
Despite the short timetable for the consideration of this matter , it has been dealt with very fully in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and there has been every opportunity for amendments to be tabled .
It is regrettable that there have been administrative delays in producing all the language versions .
However , I feel that there is a touch of opportunism in the PPE Group ' s objections to a vote this week .
After all , if it were technically impossible , the services would never have proposed that it be voted on tomorrow .
Therefore , we should debate and vote on it tomorrow ; otherwise there is a danger of obstruction by one group .
Mr President , I also wish to add my congratulations to Mrs Randzio-Plath for the work on this report , which has been difficult at times .
This directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies which distort competition .
In order to do this , the directive proposes to require public undertakings and private undertakings that perform public tasks to carry out separate accounting procedures .
I obviously agree with the rapporteur that competition rules must be applied rigorously in order to prevent cross-subsidies that go against the purpose of the aid .
However , in the sphere of public broadcasting it is essential to remember that , in accordance with the Amsterdam Protocol , in the system of public broadcasting in Member States , it is up to each Member State to specify the financial and organisational structure of public service broadcasting .
This has , as I said , been a difficult report ; it has been fraught and often very tense in committee and , more specifically , at the committee votes .
However , I believe the final outcome will work and is a practical and correct approach .
Mr President , when one hears of the horrendous debt that has built up in many African states , the first reaction is one of deep sympathy .
However , I
