Mr Kinnock ( ‘Old ’ Labour rather than ‘New Labour’ ) was right with his ‘roadmap’ , because our problem is that the volume of both freight and passenger transport by rail has been decreasing progressively since the 1970s .
Moreover , schedules are not passenger-friendly .
We shall be making our consent to this conditional upon the following , however : there must be no social dumping , and consideration must be given to the interests of the environment , as Parliament demanded in the Meijer report .
To enter into direct competition with direct competitors , the railways need comparable framework conditions , and so it was right and necessary for us to now give priority to establishing the railway counterpart of the ‘night-boarding ’ legislation for air transport .
I certainly agree with Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Rack that this time scheduling of legislative resolutions is not exactly the most sensible thing for Parliament to do .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , efforts to enable the revitalisation of Europe’s railways began back in 1994 .
Turkey did comply with this requirement , albeit with a unilateral declaration that made it at least questionable whether the protocol would be implemented .
We must not lose sight of the fact – which the groups ’ resolution makes clear – that it is for us in this European Parliament to state that the conditions are formally met – in contrast to their form of words , which refers to ‘sufficiently fulfilled ’ – and that issues of minority rights , issues relating to the processes of reform within Turkey , and the freedom of religion issue have a major part to play in this .
Let me ask a very serious question : how do things stand as regards human rights ?
Paragraph 16 of it states that the Treaty of Nice is not an acceptable basis for further decisions on the accession of any further new Member States and that Parliament therefore insists that the necessary reforms be brought into force within the framework of the constitutional process .
We also want to make it clear that we cannot wait until the end of a fifteen-year process for it ; it must happen at once , at some point in the first or second year , and if the protocol to which Mr Brok referred is not put into effect , which means that Cyprus is not recognised , then the accession negotiations will have to be suspended .
You in particular should be more reticent , Mr Langen .
I will sum up by saying that we , as a group , will be voting in favour of the resolution .
You are not the centre of the universe !
Mr President , I would be most obliged to you if you were to use whatever influence you have on Mr Cohn-Bendit to induce him to take some time out to think and thereafter to withdraw the sweeping accusations of racism that he has aimed at those who are opposed to Turkish membership .     Mr President , I would like to say , for Mr Brok’s benefit , that not all the arguments against Turkey are racist , but that those who can ride the wave of racism in their campaign against Turkey must , for that reason , give some thought to what arguments they use .
If Turkey succeeds in doing that , then it can and should become a Member State of the European Union .
We will have no chance to carry on with what was originally thought of as the European Union in any meaningful form .
Peaceful demonstrators were beaten to the ground and then hauled before the courts .
That is not the right way for Turkey to become a part of Europe .     Mr President , in December last year , this House came to a decision , voting by 402 votes to 216 , in favour of a start being made on accession talks with Turkey .
While the extension of the customs agreement amounts to its indirect recognition , a unilateral statement is made at the same time to the effect that it is not recognised at all .
The Chairman of the Socialist Group in this House asserted during the debate that I had formerly advocated Turkey’s full membership of the European Union .
'without prejudice to the implementing measures already adopted , on expiry of a two-year period following the adoption of the directive and on 1 April 2008 at the latest , the application of its provisions requiring the adoption of technical rules , amendments and decisions in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be suspended .
It is incomprehensible how the Commission is going against its better judgment on this .
Yet it would now be an additional burden on , and indeed an intervention in , free-market regulatory mechanisms if we were to introduce provisions such as those the Commission has just proposed .
I am very pleased that he has supported and emphasised that again in recent days , and also that the Presidency has made a number of commitments here on the issue of energy policy .
Yet we are all aware that , ultimately , part of the problem is refinery capacity .
On the one hand , consumers are paying very high prices ; on the other , windfall profits are being generated , in not only the oil sector , but also other energy sectors .
Is it not much more important to reduce dependence on oil and gas and bring the consequences of global climate change under control as far as possible ?
This is disappointing .
In addition , we in Parliament maintain the vision of a permanent seat for the European Union as soon as the political , legal and constitutional conditions for this are met .
The doubling
