which , as my fellow Member has said , could lead to imbalances in the market , distortions of competition , a concealed renationalisation of the common agricultural policy , and this could lead to very bad results for everybody , including those who are sceptical about the common agricultural policy , because renationalisation would lead to much more of the protectionism which they believe is already too much .
Mr President , since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , thousands of people have been arrested by foreign troops , mostly from the United States and the United Kingdom .
In any event , I would like to make two proposals which I believe to be fundamental , even though they are not taken up in the compromise Resolution itself .
I met Mr Nour at the first session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , following its creation in March 2005 , in Cairo .
Romania’s efforts must continue , of course , but there is no question that progress has been made in the right direction , as you have just acknowledged , Commissioner .
Furthermore , the accession treaty provides for specific monitoring , since there are safeguard clauses which can be activated during the first three years .
In any event , as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner pointed out , we are clearly dealing with a double contradiction : an internal contradiction from the European Union 's point of view , because it is not possible for the European Union to include the party that has won the elections on its list of terrorist organisations and , on the other , to make a financial contribution from the Community budget to an organisation that does not renounce violence .
Let us not repeat the mistakes following the Iraq war : Chaos and the collapse of the Palestinian institutions could harm Israel , which is seeking security .
Thirdly , the members of the Committees on Foreign Affairs and on Development , because they have approved this report unanimously by means of a very unusual vote ― 51 votes in favour , 0 votes against and 0 abstentions , and with no amendment to plenary on behalf of the political groups ― which demonstrates clearly the will of the whole of Parliament to back the report that will be put to the vote tomorrow .
I am aware that there may be a degree of uncertainty at the moment given Venezuela’s decision to leave the Andean Community , but now more than ever the European Union must send a clear and well-defined message in this direction , in order not to strengthen the position of those people who are against the integration processes .
I would like to express my most sincere gratitude for the political support that you have given us and for the way that cooperation between our two institutions has been strengthened .
I therefore believe that the Vienna Summit also offers an opportunity to test the will and determination of the Latin American countries and I hope that this is translated into concrete progress .
The majority of countries in the region have adopted democratic systems , they have embarked on ambitious economic and social reforms and they have a great potential for development , but unfortunately there are still great social shortcomings , mainly due to the fact that the economic progress has not reached the majority of the population and this is leading , or has led , to a degree of disillusionment with certain democratic governments , as a result of their inability to comply with the terms of the social pact .
Great attention has been focussed on the emergence of the new political movements in Latin America , which some see as a direct threat to the traditional political , economic and social structures .
This decision still depends upon the Central American countries clearly demonstrating that they are moving forward with their own integration strategy , but I am very optimistic , and I believe that these decisions will be formalised at the meeting of the Central American Heads of State or Government that will take place from 5 to 7 May .
Madam President , dear Benita , dear Hans , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking as Socialist coordinator in the Committee on Development , but also as draftsman of the opinion of that committee on the partnership between the European Union and Latin America .
Commissioner , you should know that , when you defend your proposal in Vienna at the 4th EU-Latin America/Caribbean Summit , you will have the majority , if not the unanimous , support of the whole of the European Parliament .
This is a very good time do so because , as has been said , Latin America is undergoing certain changes that I believe to be genuinely hopeful .
Secondly , since two Austrians are here – an Austrian Commissioner and naturally an Austrian representing the Presidency—in-Office of the Council – I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the issue of feminicides , which has been discussed in this House on several occasions , must be given a prominent place at the Vienna Summit .
Furthermore , I believe that there is a high degree of agreement , on the importance of this bi-regional strategic relationship , on establishing a European Union-Latin American parliamentary assembly , on regional integration and on the Bi-regional Solidarity Fund , which , incidentally , in the Bregenz declaration and as far as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is concerned , was also altered , because there was no mention of Latin America and the Caribbean being able to participate by means of proposals .
I am very pleased with the excellent report by Mr Salafranca , by means of which the European Parliament is demonstrating its contribution to the political will required for the strong and genuine development of strategic relations
