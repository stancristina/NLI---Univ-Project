Twelve amendments were tabled in the House .
Our group has thus voted for a certain number of amendments in this direction , proposed by Mr Lannoye , within the framework of his report .

Should there be a specific tax ?
Drugs Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Nassauer is obviously responsible for his own remarks , even the political remarks he makes .
That is why we will vote against the Committee on Civil Liberties ' amendments .

I therefore agree with it in principle , provided of course that we are very watchful with regard to human rights , as Mrs d'Ancona said .
As of course the risks such people run if they return are well known , they are tolerated within the EU , but without status or rights , in several of our Member States .
Of course , the changeover from road to rail will be expensive , and will necessitate large investments .
