Secondly , I would like to mention the further limitation of working hours in terms of night work .
To minimise accidents the identification of vessels must be improved , the obligation to notify must be extended and procedures for transferring and using information must be simplified and attention must also be paid to differing circumstances .
However , those suffering from oil damage must receive full compensation for the loss caused by the damage .
The maritime safety agency to be set up must support Member States and the Commission in applying Community legislation .
The field of operations drawn up for the agency is quite broad so good cooperation with Member States is important .
Besides tightening up the regulations , care must be taken that the decisions made are realistic and capable of being carried out .
For example , issues of responsibility must be addressed at global level .
Oil catastrophes have concretely shown that relying on good luck costs society dear .
I would like to congratulate all three rapporteurs for drawing up thorough reports .
The Erika II package certains very many positive proposals among which I would particularly like to mention the setting up of emergency ports and the automatic monitoring of vessels .
Although we Europeans can affect the condition of our maritime environment very significantly , we must always remember that we are not alone in the world , even after enlargement .
One example is the European oil pollution compensation fund ( COPE) .
Ladies and gentlemen , safeguarding the cleanliness of our seas and especially our coastline means we must not hesitate a minute longer .
Mr President , Commissioner De Palacio , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to thank Mr Collins for his successful report .
Safety precautions are essential .
Aviation is becoming more technical and is increasingly relying on the ability of staff on the ground to produce safe air navigation services .
It is important that exchanging information regarding risk situations and accidents functions both within and between Member States .
Each year , Member States must submit a report on the level of safety of civil aviation .
If a risk situation or accident is due to serious negligence , the Member State must have the right to initiate legal proceedings .
The safety of Europe ' s airspace is to everyone ' s benefit .
Our group supports the main points of the report .
At the same time effective dialogue is required with groupings of oil producing countries , exactly as stated in the report .
The Union should also seek more decisively than previously to replace oil with other sources of energy .
Renewable energy sources and biofuels in particular can replace part of oil consumption and at the same time promote the Kyoto objectives .
Nor should we overlook local renewable fuels whose renewability can be successfully proven , such as peat , cork waste and olive stones , for example , depending on the geographical area .
The simplest way of saving energy is to improve the energy efficiency of buildings by harmonising building regulations towards energy efficiency .
This is what we are dependent on , this is what will soon consume 70 % of oil .
They also surround this building , all the European Parliament buildings and all the offices , the same vehicles which consume our oil .
There is no such thing .
That is a good saving .
What next ?
In Finland , for example , 30 % of the land area is bog .
We use less than one percent of this and it does not have to be transported anywhere .
Therefore , for us using the annual growth in peat makes sense .
Therefore , we will have to do something else and as far as I am concerned this is either nuclear power or natural gas .
It could be the high point of the northern dimension .
Russia ' s partners are large and they are used to shortcuts .
They will enable us to gain speed and at the same time develop legislation .
There is nothing there except polar bears and silent Scandinavians .
Mr President , I would like to use my explanation of vote to explain my voting on the Hughes report .
We already have Regulation 3820/85 on driving and resting times which also regulates suitable driving and resting times for small haulage businesses .
Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , on behalf of the Liberal Group I thank the Commission and the rapporteurs for this excellent work which does not seek only to simplify administration but this time also has an excellent goal from the point of view of farmers : simplifying the procedures for applying for support .
In this sense this move is a very fundamental one .
This is a very important issue especially as far as the smallest farmers are concerned .
It surprises me that the Commission is working on the basis of a policy whereby growth in income under the scheme would be set at a fixed level rather than being index-linked .
To make the scheme attractive also to farms attempting to improve production , our committee ' s proposal on raising the level of support is justified .
Prime Minister Persson , Commissioner Wallstr√∂m , Mr President , I would like to thank the Swedish presidency particularly for its perseverance in seeking to highlight issues which are important for the environment and for bringing the environment to the heart of policy together with economic and social issues during its six-month presidency .
It is true that conciliations were finally concluded , but not perhaps at the ambitious level that Parliament would have liked to see .
Strengthening the ecological pillar in sustainable development is also essential since when sustainable development is monitored year by year , we have
