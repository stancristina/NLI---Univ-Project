Furthermore , it should have condemned the disgraceful actions of multinationals , which use women 's work in one country until they find another country in which they can make bigger profits , turning a blind eye to the impact on women of increased unemployment and worsening living conditions .     .

If international trade as a whole were properly looking after the consumers ' interests , it could have long since significantly reduced the selling price of imported footwear .
Accordingly , this is one of the main ways in which to help the candidate countries implement the Community acquis more effectively because it ultimately acts as a kind of preparation process whereby these countries and their citizens might familiarise themselves with the Union 's policies and working methods .

I voted this way because the fighting bull must not be allowed to die out , and its existence is safeguarded by the institution of the bullfight .
It is vital that this activity change as soon as possible so that it no longer depends crucially on animal suffering .
Furthermore , the attempt , via Community 'legislation' , to impose on one Member State either the traditions and cultural values of another or the particular perspective of one of the Member States on traditions or cultural values foreign to it is , as much as anything , indicative of an arrogant and totally unacceptable attitude , and something we do not wish to see .
