that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly .
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified , where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two .
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address .
This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future .
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern , and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this , is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future .
Will it really address the concern or will , in practice , in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas , the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause .
The Erika oil spill is one of a catalogue of disasters that have taken place in recent years in Community waters , including the Braer spill off Shetland and the Sea Empress off Wales .
These spills , in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage , have devastated local industries .
In the case of the Erika , the local fishing and aquaculture industries have suffered a bitter blow and it is important not just to look at the harmful effects that are apparent today but also to look ahead at the long-term detrimental effects of oil pollution .
Effective compensation is essential .
It is time that shipping safety within the Community was tightened up and that greater controls were introduced , including bringing an end to the use of flags of convenience which is also increasingly resorted to in the fisheries sector .
The companies responsible , the ship and the cargo owners must pay up for their negligence .
The current compensation funds are inadequately funded and this was all too apparent in the case of the Braer disaster where the Shetland Islands fishing industry was inadequately compensated for their losses .
We must learn from past experience and make sure that the industries affected by the Braer spill can be rebuilt .
I support the cautious approach which the Commissioner has taken and is taking in this matter , firstly because this is not a simple issue .
It is complicated ; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from .
No less so in the Middle East because there you have a situation where there are many joint ventures between Israel and Palestinians , where produce in some cases is partly manufactured in the Palestinian area and in the State of Israel and these developments are good things , they augur well for the future because if trade is being done in this way in the Middle East , then that will be the bedrock of any peace agreement .
Therefore , because it is not an easy and simple issue , we have to be cautious and we have to be careful .
The second reason why the Commission is right to proceed in this way is that if the European Union wishes to play a part in the area in securing peace then it must be seen to be fair and evenhanded .
It would not be fair and evenhanded to rush into a decision without letting the talks and the groups that it is meeting determine what the situation is , both in terms of the area of the State of Israel relating to the trade agreement and , as I say , in relation to the goods and where they come from at the same time .
There is I think one final reason why the Commission should be supported .
We are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement .
You have a government in Israel which wants peace and wants to secure peace and if you proceed in a rash and rapid way then you could jeopardise the success of that peace agreement .
You cannot cherrypick in negotiations , this is part of an overall settlement of some extremely complicated issues and I think the Commission is absolutely right to let these things flow through carefully in the hope that by doing so we can secure what all of us want and that is a secure and just and durable peace in the Middle East .
My Group abstained in the resolution on women in decision making , much to our regret .
But even greater is our regret that we still need such resolutions .
In 1994 , the Green Group was the first group in this Parliament to have a majority of women in it , the Greens were the first group to have a woman secretary-general in Dominique Voinet , now the French Environment Minister , and the German Greens were the first political party to operate gender parity in order to redress the overall under-representation of women in political institutions .
This lead has since been followed by a number of parties and it cannot be said that the electorate have risen in protest to condemn such parties for their actions .
Nor have the electorate felt themselves manipulated by such quotas .
The resolution makes clear there is a need for a proportional system that gives form to women ' s representation and that all political parties must take action .
We look forward to that .
We have sympathy with those who argue that people should be selected on their merits ; they should be .
