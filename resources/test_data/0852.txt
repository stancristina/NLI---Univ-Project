If this philosophy continues of not addressing the cause and of fire-fighting by giving compensation , then the consequences of the fatal climatic phenomena will soon be so great that it will be impossible to satisfy the people affected with compensation , even if it accounts for a large sum in Community and national funds .
Similarly , if the dialogue starts with the aim of demonstrating that everything is working fine , then the peoples will speak again as they did in the referenda .
Any crises which arise from time to time are , in my opinion , factors of the – so far – unresolved question of the management of this interdependence .
Enlargement and intensification of the areas of close cooperation between the European Union and the USA are expected to have a positive spillover effect on all the problems which constitute the challenges of the contemporary global agenda .
Chomsky said that the United States of America is dying from a lack of democracy and there is indeed a lack of democracy and intercourse .
Let me reply by reminding you that , when MEPs went to America to check CIA flights , American congressmen did not receive them .
That is our big mistake .
Even our stock exchanges follow the Dow Jones index .
No one can doubt that the development of international trade and the liberalisation of international trade have made a decisive contribution to reducing poverty and mitigating the inequalities between developed and developing countries .
The same is also happening inside the European Union : there are areas which have been hit by unemployment , deindustrialisation and poverty .
The European Union should , in my opinion , contribute to the democratisation and strengthening of the multilateral trade system through the reform of the World Trade Organisation for the benefit of the poorest countries .
I am satisfied because , compared with the past , we have given priority to fast , simple procedures .
We have included and we have emphasised the cross-border dimension of innovation and entrepreneurship .
We have emphasised and promoted the importance of non-technological innovation , alongside technological innovation .
The answer to the question of whether or not I am satisfied with the development of competitiveness and innovation in Europe is no , compared with our international competitors .
To close , I thank the Austrian Presidency and the Commission for their excellent cooperation , as a result of which the programme was approved on time .
At the same time , a dialogue of cultures and citizens from around the world – because it is the citizens who are the vehicle for the culture – is needed for peace and equilibrium .
We also need to compare and analyse the negative aspects of the careers of men and women in a bid to identify the 'opportunities ' created by inequalities .
Of course , the compromise amendment on the review of parental leave within the framework of the new possibilities offered by the roadmap for women 's rights offers a great deal of hope together with a new agreement on equality and I trust that Mrs Niebler 's children and all our children will live in a society of equality .     – Mr President , a researcher told me that if all the gypsies were brought together in one state , it would have about the same sized population as Germany , in other words they would have over 90 MEPs .
Hitler exterminated millions of gypsies and they were not vindicated by history , like the Jews with the recognition of the holocaust .
The air is for everyone .
We shall all gain if gypsies mix with us on equal terms and not under the sort of racist disposition which , unfortunately , exists less in some states and more in others .     – Mr President , today we are debating whether or not the first chapter with Turkey will be closed .
Finally , there remains the most important chapter of all : human rights .
We therefore need to examine seriously the framework within which negotiations are being conducted with Turkey .
We cannot give it absolution purely and simply because it is a strategic partner , for example on energy issues .
With pride I told them that the European Union is sensitive to environmental issues , unlike large countries such as the USA , China , India and so on .
In times gone by it was a means of communication which played an important role in transport , trade , agriculture and fisheries ; however , with the passage of time , industrial and urban waste is continuously killing this river .
The policies of the Member States do not converge in promoting quality education .
For the rest it is a utopia .     – Mr President , I shall take advantage of the presence of the vice-presidents of the Commission , Mrs Wallström and Mr  Frattini , to raise the subject of youth criminality in the European Union , youth criminality that is presenting a worryingly upward trend .
We have a duty to combine individual sectoral actions into a systematic organised policy , a policy that will incorporate the systematic promotion of mental and social health at school in cooperation with parents and the school community , with the specific objective of developing programmes to control youth violence .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at a recent meeting with the President , Mr Borrell Fontelles , and the Secretary General , Mr Priestley , we agreed , as did many in this House , that elimination of the obstacles and prejudices which result in the exclusion of and discrimination against people with disabilities is being achieved by managing dissimilarities .
Let us support from the point of view of time and infrastructures the voluntary team of workers at the European Parliament
