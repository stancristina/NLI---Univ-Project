and should continue to do - in order to examine in what other ways Europe can be involved in Iraq , first and foremost for the Iraqi people , what other contributions , what other initiatives Europe can arrange for Iraq .
Looking to the future means seeing how we can assist , how we can help the Iraqi people to once again run the State , the institutions and the public administration following the fall of a brutal dictatorship .
Moreover , the European Union will also continue to express its general concern in this field - in order to promote the protection of human dignity without distinguishing between men and women , with particular reference to women 's rights - in international organisations , starting with the United Nations .
( IT ) I would like to thank Mr Harbour for pointing out these difficulties .
Concerns over the freedom of religion are regularly expressed to all the governments in question , both in bilateral and multilateral forums such as the annual meetings of the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations .
( IT ) The request you have made today will be considered closely by the Council Presidency precisely with the aim of evaluating the German and French initiatives which you referred to , Mr Posselt , and precisely to avoid those dangers which could somehow affect such an important principle for the human conscience , that is , even more important than for the rule of law .
Since the breakdown in peace talks and the subsequent declaration of martial law in this province in May 2003 , the Indonesian security forces have launched a significant joint operation against the Free Aceh Movement .
( IT ) I can confirm , Mrs McAvan , that , not least in light of the events of recent days and weeks , our contact and position will remain steadfast , first and foremost to establish and then express what the European Parliament and the European Council are in agreement on regarding this issue .
( IT ) I will certainly find out about what Mr RÃ¼big has just asked me , and if it is acceptable , I will provide a written answer .
.
( IT ) Certainly more information in this regard could be provided by the Commission which , as I tried to explain , has not yet tabled its own report on this subject .
As this is a highly sensitive issue , I would like to avoid saying things which are not absolutely clear and accurate .
In this regard we have managed to reach a very specific balance which confers on the Commission the task , the responsibility of the management , of the political regulation of our single European sky , and calls on Eurocontrol to make available its expertise , its experience and its technical know-how .
It is , in any case , a position which we consider to be quite conservative .
There is a large majority which is mindful of the interests and needs of each Member State , but it is a large majority which acknowledges the need to gradually dismantle , over the coming years , this derogation scheme , the ecopoints system , and try to meet this objective by encouraging the use of increasingly less polluting vehicles , but which also knows that we cannot expect all European hauliers to radically modify their motor vehicles in a few months .
Mr Swoboda , you asked what we should make a priority .
I wanted to say this , not because the Commission , from this point of view , is not well aware of all this , but because it seems that at times the Council was not .
However , while we are here trying to reach a difficult agreement on ecopoints , what is the Governor of North Tyrol planning ?
I think it would be useful briefly to summarise the developments relating to this proposal since its presentation last year .
It is for this reason , therefore , that I cannot support Amendments Nos 1 and 9 , or the second part of Amendment No 17 , for which a split vote has been requested .
On this matter , I take the liberty of proposing a single compromise amendment to define clearly when passengers have the right to assistance , particularly with regard to cancellation , and to lay down a single time limit - five days before the expected departure - after which passengers may benefit from financial compensation .
I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland , whose report focuses on the responsibilities of the European Central Bank in Europe and the responsibilities that it will have to take on with a view to the imminent entry of the ten new countries into the Union .
The recently approved draft Constitution includes provisions governing the European monetary institutions , or rather , the role of the ECB and the national central banks and their sensitive relationship .
Madam President , I feel it is genuinely important for Parliament to start carrying out an initial evaluation of the introduction of the euro today , a year and a half after its launch in the European market .
In particular , the citizens are calling upon us to introduce EUR 1 banknotes or even , in some cases , 50-cent banknotes , as well as for greater availability of low-value notes , especially in cash machines .
Budgets are not merely economic tools but , in fact , key instruments with which political authorities shape a society 's model of socio-economic development and criteria for internal redistribution and prioritise the measures to be taken in respect of policies and the needs of their own citizens
