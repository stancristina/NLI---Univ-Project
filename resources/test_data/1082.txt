It has become a privileged area of activity of organised networks that exploit the discrepancies and loopholes in the legal systems of the Member States , at the expense of the most vulnerable groups , such as children the number of abductions taking place in Brazil and Guatemala is shocking and those living in extreme poverty .
At the crux of the proposal under debate is the idea that the human body should not be a source of profit .
I support the rapporteur’s draft amendment to the title of the framework decision , therefore , altering it to read ‘illegal trafficking in human organs , parts of organs and tissues’ , because I believe that that legitimate and strictly regulated trade ( in commodities such as sperm , or blood and its derivatives ) is advantageous and legal .
They come as no surprise : - the report ‘welcomes ’ the ‘European security strategy ’ presented at the Thessaloniki European Council .
As for our disagreements , I would highlight the foreign policy instruments proposed for the Union , including the European Foreign Minister , enhanced cooperation in defence policy and qualified majority voting in common foreign and security policy .
I disagree with a system under which national sovereignty is disregarded and Member States’ right to independence and self-determination called into question .
The abolition of the death penalty is an important step forward for civilisation , one that must be extended to every country .
The criticism of Israel’s construction of a dividing wall is also poorly supported in historical terms .
The result has been a string of monologues , one after another , that contribute little to solving this problem effectively .
I would also like to emphasise the fact that structural change in the economy , based on knowledge-based activities in the services sector , will create new business opportunities .
What is needed here is a return to a belief in the forces of the social market economy in order to create incentives for potential entrepreneurs to assume entrepreneurial risk and responsibility .
A new approach must indeed be found to industrial policy , hinging on the following priorities : sustaining efforts in the field of education , training and skills , reducing tax obstacles , increasing investment in research and innovation , assuring the quality of infrastructure ( transport , communications and energy ) , facilitating the financing of businesses and social dialogue , making the procedures for starting up businesses more flexible , and so on .
That struggle brought about the resignation of President Sánchez de Lozada .
Such a regime should yield results which are properly comparable , whatever the operator’s nationality and whichever national inspection service is responsible .
These measures need to be examined and debated by all the interested parties , including fishermen’s organisations , producers , vessel owners and national authorities .
We insist on the need for such a study , therefore , before any subsequent decisions are taken .
The rapporteur’s concern that representatives of the sector should participate in the various phases of the decision-making process must also be given priority .
Specifically , what comments do you have on the Hungarian Government’s criticism of the Financial Supervisory Authority , which is , of course , independent of the government of that country ?     – Mr President , Mr Antonione , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the news from the Intergovernmental Conference ( IGC ) paints a picture of disagreements and difficulties .
I salute the Italian Presidency and the dedicated fashion in which it has performed its work .
On the other hand , the German Chancellor appears to be softening his dogmatic initial positions , having indicated during a visit to Bratislava some days ago that he might be prepared to accept the loud calls for the Commission to be appointed on the basis of one Commissioner per Member State , with equal rights .
The more the IGC respects and pushes forward with the sacred founding principle of equality between Member States , the more it attends prudently and realistically to the actual state of public opinion on national identity and European identity , the broader the support it will garner .
Nice is that alternative consensus which so many people invoke ; it is also , for now , the only real consensus , the Treaty we prepared in readiness for the main challenge facing us now : enlargement .
Secondly , allow me to mention three concrete problems .
In any case , I hope that the Constitution of the Union will some day come to recognise the stateless nations of Europe , such as Galicia , Scotland and others , so that they are not forced to fight in order to lay claim to their own states , that being the only practical way for them to be represented as nations in the European Union .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , only with a sense of irony or with a sense of humour – since , as Rabelais said that what distinguishes man is his capacity to laugh – can we talk about progress in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference .
All the Member States have to do is simply accept the project that came out of the Convention and give up on the damaging idea of rewriting it or of pulling it apart .
This Constitution must then be given legitimacy , as a constitutional text must be , by the citizens , by means of a referendum .
This is a text that gives the Commission a high degree of flexibility because it does not contain political or operational guidelines .
I also proposed rounding up the total amount to EUR 3.8 billion in order to take account of the fact that the 2003 budget was in the meantime adopted at a level
