lay down a strategy for a sustainable immigration policy in which national and local institutions can play a major part in using objective criteria to identify occupational needs and the availability of jobs , accommodation , social services and training for all those who ask to come and live and work in our Member States .
Europe must choose to play a strong , responsible , political role , aware that behind the policy choices to be made regarding immigration there lies the possibility of also being a player in the serious international crisis we are going through .
This concern springs from having seen communities , and individuals belonging to communities of immigrants , celebrating after the tragic attacks in the United States , and from the knowledge that terrorist cells have been sheltered and supported by certain communities on ethnic and religious grounds .
I would now like to make three points .
In my opinion , we must establish a substantial educational and cultural programme , a major part of which promotes communication between cultures , for that would be the first step along a path which will certainly bring about the sort of integration we desire .
Mr Evans ' proposal to establish a common minimum standard - as he calls it - actually invalidates this principle by making it too permissive .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for the reasons I expressed yesterday and considering the fact that you have adopted my legislative amendments , I call upon you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolutions until the possibility of an agreement with the Commission and the Council increasing Parliament ' s role , pursuant to Rule 69 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure , can be ascertained .
As regards transparency , I feel that this is still too superficial and that Parliamentary scrutiny should be obligatory for arms exports .
Then there is no reference to the OCCAT Agreement which actually protects industrial cooperation and is the basis for laws such as Italy ' s which make it possible to export arms without infringing human rights rules .
We must have the courage to go deeper into certain complex issues which are still to be resolved .
My concern is the political response .
This is the great challenge before us : to create , export and promote democracy and freedom .
Has the Commission decided no longer to consider it a priority to resolve this issue ?
How does the Commission view the new Italian-French management arrangements for the tunnel ?
What steps have been taken to introduce a special tax ( as has happened in Switzerland and Austria ) aimed at protecting against and making good the social and environmental damage caused and making rail transport , which has considerable potential for further development , competitive in economic terms ?
I would like to end by associating myself with those who are calling for a detailed inquiry at this juncture into where , within the non-governmental organisations , responsibility for what happened lies - clearly , as always , we must avoid putting everything under the same umbrella - for there is no doubt that responsibility does lie somewhere and it must be ascertained where , not least in view of the generosity displayed by the European Union and the European Commission towards non-governmental organisations .
Nevertheless , I would warn that GALILEO may have a much bigger impact on the general budget than initially expected .
Madam President , once again , we declare our condemnation of any form of terrorism , whatever its source .
The fact that the majority of the people in the world live in a state of despair , poverty and underdevelopment can never justify terrorism - never .
Let us at least help the Afghan people and the civilised world to overcome terrorists and fundamentalists .
Only now is the Union being called upon to participate more actively in the prevention and stabilisation of regional conflicts .
We therefore welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council of 21 September in the field of judicial cooperation and home affairs and on combating money laundering .
Our initial response , our initial reaction must be to switch off the psychological 'emergency ' mode and get a grip on our agenda .
Therefore , I welcome the commitment to be made at Ghent to proceed with the debates on the euro , enlargement and the political integration of Europe at Laeken and through the Convention .
That is why , while I support the decisions taken by the Council at Brussels , I feel that it is vital that , as we implement the inevitable specific military initiatives , we must step up political and economic initiatives as well .
Therefore , while it is clear that large-scale , incisive cultural measures need to be taken to teach all people respect for others and acceptance , it is equally clear that civil society must use every tool available to it to fight those political , cultural , economic and religious systems which breed and are based on racism .
For these reasons , I voted for the resolution .
There is one danger which must be highlighted - Mr Goebbels mentioned the confusion following the events of 11 September - and that is that Europe will use the current economic crisis and the crisis in the United States as an excuse to go back to expansionist , deficit spending policies such as those experienced by Europe and its citizens in previous decades .
Mr President , Commissioner Solbes , we need more Europe , and the Stability Pact is a tool for building Europe .
Though we need therefore to comply with and value the Stability and Growth Pact , as much attention should also be devoted to the subject of the Lisbon agenda .
