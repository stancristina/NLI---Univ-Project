Can I take the opportunity of Mr Sterckx ' s contribution to underline the point that I made earlier , a point which he wisely acknowledges , that no one , in consideration of the broad geographical balance to which the Commission is committed , should try to take a still-photograph of the profile of the staff at the Commission and represent that as in any way a permanent state of affairs .
A moving picture is the only one that tells the full story and the Commission is totally committed to ensuring that priority is given to merit and full and proper account is taken of geographical balance , which is essential in a multinational serving institution like the Commission .
On Mrs Hautala' s point , I would simply say that none of the appointments that have been announced today was the subject of a panel and there is a very straightforward legal reason for that .
Mr David O' Sullivan , for instance , will take up his post by rotation as provided for under the Staff Regulations and equally as provided for under the Staff Regulations , Mr Ricardo Levi is a temporary official and moves with his post to his new position .
So in legal , procedural and employment policy terms , the use of the panel system for promotion and appointment purposes was not required by the existing law in the case of appointments of that kind .
I think that also responds to the point raised by Mrs Morgan on that subject .
The question was also raised of women ' s appointments .
Of the 25 very senior appointments that have been made by this Commission since last September , 4 have been of women officials .
That to me is modest .
Mrs Hautala and others will know of my ambitions in this respect .
I would only say that since that is nearly 20 % of the total number of appointments , we are on target for this year ' s commitment to ensure that we achieve at least a 20 % advance in the number of women who are appointed .
In the course of the rest of the year I can say with certainty that velocity will at least be maintained .
Obviously , I would like to see it exceeded because there are a large number of highly capable women , as Mrs Dybkjær pointed out to us , in the Commission , and we want to see that quality properly recognised .
So far as Mr Dell ' Alba' s geographical excursion into islands and boot-shaped countries is concerned , as I say I am looking forward to answering his further question and doing so in great detail .
It is significant that the island country , the larger island country , secured in the course of these months under this Commission no additional appointments at A1 level by promotion .
The boot-shaped country obtained two such appointments - the boot-shaped country obtained 4 A2 promotions in this period and the big island obtained 5 , of which , to the best of my knowledge , none came from Wales .
I hope that is of some reassurance to Mr Dell ' Alba .
Mrs Morgan , inevitably asks from the wilds of Wales ' Why were there not any Welsh people ? '
It is because , Mrs Morgan , whilst I am totally committed to geographical balance , this would mean in Wales having one North Walian and one South Walian or I would generate even more dissatisfaction in the country I love most .
But Mrs Morgan did raise intriguing questions about the questions which have been put down ; doubtlessly they will be pursued .
I would like to say to Mrs Dybkjær that in the comprehensive pursuit of our policy for equal opportunities , there will be evidence as the coming months and years pass , of us giving attention from the point of the invitation to applications , right through to initial appointment and promotions , to show that we are making serious efforts to secure substantial advances in the number of women of all ages and all grades who are employed in the Commission .
I can only ask honourable Members to wait until the physical evidence is available .
But if commitment and the strong and active dedication of members of the current College is anything to go by we will achieve success in all respects .
Mr President , the passage of this directive at second reading has perhaps been historic .
No amendments !
I congratulate heartily our rapporteur on her original strategy and I hope what will be her achievement of obtaining continuing consensus .
I do not believe it has been easy for any of us as politicians to curb our natural instinct either to improve on or alter someone else ' s text .
Yet it was a carefully considered decision .
We know the proposal is not absolutely perfect but the general feedback , both at a recent hearing in committee and from those who have lobbied Members has been : 'let ' s have what might be an imperfect directive with a review rather than none at all ' .
Speed with certainty in this fast-moving new world is essential .
Now we have an initial road-map ; a reference point for European businesses trading on the Web ; a road-map that has clearly established the country of origin principle while still protecting consumer interest .
That is a good balance .
This should really open up the internal market to the many and increasing opportunities which e-commerce promises to businesses of all sizes , but particularly SMEs .
We must continually be aware that the Web is not limited to Europe .
It is , of course , global .
