harmonisation , not even of production and vinification methods .
As you will be aware , Commissioner , back in 1993-1994 for instance , proposals were tabled on which I had the honour to act as rapporteur in the House , in 1995 .
Europe has therefore lost ground in an art in which it has been and remains the world leader .
I realise that , coming from a Socialist , that may sound surprising , but the wine sector in particular shows that excessive regulation can also be fatal .
And so we need to take a more dynamic approach to Europe 's vineyards : there has to be advance replanting , extensive restructuring of vineyards and higher allocations than currently provided for in the Commission proposal .
Nonetheless , it would have been worth taking account of the existing differences and inequities and sending out the message , which we are always calling for , that European producers must enjoy equal worth and show solidarity .
Despite the best of intentions , that gap has yet to be bridged ; in fact the gulf is still very wide .
It was an excellent idea on the part of the Commissioner and the Commission to get rid of compulsory distillation and keep only crisis distillation .
Although this second reading takes up the fundamental points approved at first reading , we also have a range of new and interesting elements , such as the specific reference to animal welfare and the obligation to use suitable alternatives to animal testing whenever possible ; there is also the extension of hazard classification and labelling requirements to cover pesticides , with the label specifically stating : ' To avoid risks to man and the environment , comply with the instructions for use ' .
I would point out to the House that , as compared with the 1988 proposal , this proposal introduces changes designed to extend the scope of the directive in relation to dangerous preparations to the following five new sectors : classification and labelling in terms of environmental risks , plant health products and biocides , non-classified dangerous preparations , explosives and the labelling of some sensitising substances .
The labelling of dangerous substances and preparations is thus a vital way of ensuring that easily comprehensible information on the dangers of the product is provided faster .
So it is becoming one of the European Parliament 's essential tasks to debate the institutions and the way they work .
The Bourlanges report confronts these issues head on , with a free-ranging , imaginative approach to the institutions .
I think the balance is currently being undermined by both the anomalous development of the Council and the weakening of the Commission .
Furthermore , it establishes vital links between the roles of this Parliament and the national parliaments .
In the last few years we have seen open and flexible legislation designed for an increasingly developed world of technology and computers on the one hand , and on the other , old and outdated rules , as in Italy , where the matter is governed by a law going back 60 years .
Adopting the text for Article 5( 1 ) as proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs means that quite unjustified authorisations will be required for making technical copies from the Internet , which will simply have the effect of extending the supremacy in distribution of the great American recording multinationals into the digital world .
The German minister , Mr Lafontaine , went too far and , instead of confining himself to the subject of agricultural spending , structural spending and own resources , sought to widen the debate .
Yet we cannot deny that the European Union 's role is too weak and it hardly amounts to a common foreign policy when some Member States take a view of the Balkan question which is the complete opposite of the position of other Member States , including their view of history .
This kind of conflict cannot be resolved by war , nor can the Belgrade Government restore peace to the region by arming the police .
But the Kosovans cannot be allowed to use the profits from drug-dealing to buy arms to perpetuate the war .
But perhaps you could tell us a bit more because , having heard that a start has been made but it is an uphill task and there are difficult issues , we do still need to know that , if Rambouillet fails , there is a fall-back plan for resolving the problem and dealing with the aftermath .
What general guidelines does the European Union intend to pursue to establish a genuine peace process for the whole area ?
And then there is the problem of Albania , which continues to provide a means of transit for massive arms supplies to the rebels .
Why do we only find out who is supplying the weapons by reading about it in the newspapers ?
No, Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , we are looking at a part of a larger problem .
The full involvement of all interested parties in the consultation and decision-making process is very important .
It is the reason our group will vote for the whole report as approved in committee , although we still think some specific points need further study .
This has also been stressed by the group on climate change for the small island states , which I chair in the Joint ACP-EU Assembly , because these territories are particularly vulnerable and need our assistance , especially as the activities vital both to their economies and to social welfare principally develop along the coastal strip .
The Alleanza Nazionale is voting in favour although , personally , I am only partly satisfied .
Armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has broken out again with unprecedented violence .
