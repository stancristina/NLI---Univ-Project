parties .
The Member States draft national , interim reports .
So we use the data supplied by the Member States .
At every Council meeting , the Commission has to remind the Member States that they are late and of the commitments they have made .
It is impossible to obtain legally admissible evidence , because investigations are not carried out independently .
The Commission believes the multiannual guidance programmes to be important instruments , and so respect for their objectives is an essential factor for the future of the sector .
The Commission is also trying to find suitable ways of harmonizing the definition and measurement of power throughout the Community and is collecting information available so as to examine the question thoroughly .
With regard to the MGP IV decisions adopted last December , the Commission is examining how to assist fleet reconstruction by means of financial provisions or incentives , as Mrs Langenhagen called them , and these provisions will be applied together with the percentages of incoming and outgoing fishing vessels .
I would therefore ask Parliament to reconsider a reduction in quotas as a sanction because of these possible implications .
It is our responsibility to prevent this rule-bending , this fish piracy , and the continuing and devastating practice of using drift nets , particularly by Italian fleets .
The Commission , however , intends bring forward a Council regulation on the control of unloading and transfers : this proposal is already being prepared and the Commission believes it should provide a more appropriate framework .
Consequently , I do not want to go into the merits of the amendments , but I believe that the amendments relating to drift nets fall outside the legal framework of this proposal , and so the Commission cannot accept them , because drift nets are not just a Mediterranean issue .
By giving it the power to draw up recommendations and prepare studies on the assessment of new training courses , its remit would therefore be extended beyond consultation as such .
A degree course cannot equip us to practise a profession competitively in a couple of years , if we are to have the benefit of the basic preparation we consider necessary .
In the case of town planning and restoration , the main sectors of architecture , the limited number of years proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights are certainly not enough .
With regard to the future , all the options are open and I believe that , from this point of view , there is room for further thought .
( Parliament gave its assent )
In fact , there was a programme called PHILOXENIA ; it was born and then died , it was aborted , or rather killed .
I agree too : a common action will help us catch up on lost time .
We propose that it might be better to allow a transition period , a free choice , firstly for the Member States and then for the businessmen in the countries themselves , of whether or not to use the new equipment or keep the 1A equipment with the addition of a digital reader , at least for a specific period .
In fact , all of us hope we will be able to see European workers move freely within the various Member States , as if they were their own , maintaining , and even strengthening , their social rights .
Mr President , the proposal for a Council Regulation , on which the report we are discussing is based , is reasonably and substantially supported by the members of the National Alliance .
We agree on the need to update the Community regulations in question , to take into account the changes in national legislation and several bilateral agreements arranged between the Member States on this subject .
Frontier workers should also be entitled to a pension , an income based on the legislation of the Member State in which they have worked .
Only in that way can we truly maintain the economic and social cohesion of the European Union .
Madam President , in the opinion approved by the Committee on Regional Policy , it has been brought to light that , for all the sections relating to the Structural Funds , the year 1996 has been a turning-point in the commitment of allocations .
These figures cannot fail to lead Parliament to take appropriate measures .
How can we imagine that we can make progress in a situation in which the national states are competing with each other , in a situation of disparity due to the fact that some states regard Community fraud as a specific crime while others do not ?
I do not know how this term can be translated into the other languages , or whether it is compatible , but a body is something that is indefinite , that is half-way ; that could therefore solve the linguistic problem we are otherwise faced with .
Consequently , I share the spirit of the initiative favouring the new financial measures for SMEs .
For this reason , last year , while preparing for the Luxembourg Extraordinary Summit , the European Parliament called on the Council to adopt strengthening and expansion measures in favour of SMEs and proposed the creation of a new budget heading B-55 , job market and technological innovation , to be financed with ECU 450 million over three years , dividing the measures into two sections : initiatives in favour of the job market and technological innovation , in addition to the amount already provided by the EIB and by the European Investment Fund .
But I have the impression that it is like a drop of water in the desert , totally inadequate , all the more so as now , with the entry into force of monetary union , the difficulties of SMEs will increase .
