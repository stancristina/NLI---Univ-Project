Subsequently , they will rise in rebellion .
This puts Thabo Mbeki in a quite different situation from his predecessor , but it also puts us in the EU in a quite different situation .
We should remember this fact and we should also remember the Balkans and what Kofi Annan said in his speech to the UN at the opening of the General Assembly this year : that it is incredible how much we sacrifice to go to war and how little we sacrifice to prevent war .
It is certainly not as good as it ought to be .
Nonetheless , it is there and it binds the EU and South Africa together .
I have been following especially closely your statements about economic policy after the introduction of the euro .
I think it is a good tradition which is now being introduced whereby the Commission reports on what happened at that day ' s meeting , or the previous day ' s meeting if it is a Wednesday .
I think it is something which will help create greater openness about the Commission ' s work .
In this connection , I should like to ask if the Commission will produce the agendas for the meetings of the Commission , together with the most important working documents , in advance of the Commission ' s meetings .
The office has on-going contact with the International Red Cross , the United Nations organisations , the NGOs which are present in the country and Echo ' s own representative .
Echo ' s representative is now in the Panshir valley in order to assess the situation .
What is more , everything we do will have to respect Echo ' s neutral mandate .
The fact that this particular aid , details of which have already been submitted for approval , is being provided does not rule out the possibility of further aid being necessary before the end of the year .
As regards an agreement with the most representative humanitarian players in the area , the aid will be aimed in particular at consolidating the existing humanitarian structures in the area and at assisting the local population by supporting the displaced persons with medical help , food aid and shelter .
The practical details of these forms of humanitarian action are being established in collaboration with our partners in the field .
We are prepared continuously to alter our input , not least against the background of the highly volatile military situation .
Yes , but you are not getting one .
There is just as much humanitarian concern in focusing on the victims of the conflict , irrespective of the character of the conflict .
Otherwise , the victims would not be in the position they are in fact in .
I ask that this fact be respected .
However , there is no value in representing the issue as the questioner has done .
I had expected some understanding for my line of argument .
I have not in any way expressed a positive view of the Taliban regime .
I have merely tried to insist upon regard for the conflict ' s victims as being the decisive factor here .
However , it is crucial to our credibility and to Echo ' s ability to enter the zones of conflict and come into contact with the people we are to help that we avoid a rhetoric which is confrontational , and that is something I shall go on endeavouring to do .
As a consequence of the crisis in Kosovo , the Commission , via Echo , is providing emergency aid to the most vulnerable population groups in Serbia .
Against the background of the growing humanitarian needs which will arise in the coming winter , Echo is considering setting aside a further EUR 10 million for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive programme of humanitarian aid with the following six components .
This figure , which includes 350,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina , 120,000 internally displaced Serbs and gypsies from Kosovo and 300,000 socially vulnerable people , has been calculated by the World Food Programme ' s and UNHCR' s joint assessment team for emergency food aid which visited the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in July of this year .
Secondly : shelter to individuals who have been displaced recently .
Echo provides support for the repair of private dwellings and the supply of goods other than food to make it possible to establish adequate shelter for new arrivals driven out of Kosovo .
Through its contribution to UNHCR , Echo also provides support to families who are housing displaced persons from Kosovo .
With the help of projects of this kind , attempts will be made to alleviate the trauma caused by the experiences undergone by many displaced persons , especially children .
Even if larger rebuilding projects are not undertaken , Echo will make less extensive improvements to the installations concerned in order to prevent health problems from arising .
The most vulnerable groups in Serbia are to be found in such institutions , and Echo will , to the extent that is necessary , provide help in the form of supplementary food aid ( basic food aid being provided by the World Food Programme ) and supplementary goods other than food and heating .
In the course of the winter , special arrangements will have to be made at certain points to provide heating , among other things .
Students from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not - as the honourable Member supposes - excluded from foreign universities or cut off from contacts abroad , because the sanctions in place do not extend to such matters .
In any case , resources have been set aside to support democratisation and promote the institutions of civil society .
With regard to the environmental consequences of the Kosovo conflict for Serbia , I
