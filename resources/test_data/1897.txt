I agree with the questioners from four other groups that the European Union is now obliged to play a positive role in a peaceful and correct division of Serbia and the construction of democracy and economy in Kosovo .     Mr President , Mrs Lehtomäki , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , during the discharge for the 2004 Budget in April , Parliament , on two occasions , made very explicit statements with regard to the European Agency for the Reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo .
I am not doubting your sincerity or your awareness of what needs to be done , but I am nevertheless concerned – will be unable to complete all the difficult tasks it will be given within the time available , which is three to six months , not years .
It cannot be that you and we ask the Commission to play a crucial role in Kosovo with fewer people .
Croatia is now negotiating with the EU about membership ; Macedonia has received candidate-member status and clear progress has also been made with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina .
It is clearly up to a country ’s government to make sure that those are in place , but we have to establish that the media are under pressure to some extent , partly due to the proposed change to the Act on electronic media .
It is a miracle that , in 1913 , in the most inhospitable part of Albanian territory , it proved possible to establish an independent state although it has not been a success to date .
The promise of a prospect of EU membership must be kept .
Economic problems , of course , and I would , for example , draw your attention to the fact that no less than 60 % of the active population are employed in the agricultural sector .
Sound neighbourhood policy should , however , be sufficient to cultivate this historical European tie .
It is in any event significant that even the two Hezbollah representatives in the Lebanese Government have voted against this dangerous compromise proposal .
It is therefore only logical that Israel should , for the time being , maintain its sea blockade against Lebanon .     – Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I fully endorse the speech made by my colleague , Mr Howitt .
He is a DJ.
Some abuse and use that and will continue to do so with effect until this conflict is resolved .
As a European rapporteur , I saw it as being of the utmost importance that I should listen very carefully to the Chinese discussions about the impressive peaceful development of the People’s Republic over the past three decades .
Disregarding these , the Chinese Embassy advised this House to delete Paragraph 24 of the draft resolution on Ankang as being completely unfounded , and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , acting as if there were nothing wrong , tabled an amendment to that effect .
I would hereby invite it publicly to translate and publish the recent interview with China ’s ‘religious big boss ’ to clarify just what control the party exercises , for what is positive and negative in religions is to be assessed by the Chinese Communist Party and nobody else .
The message we must send to the Council and Commission on the eve of the summit with the Chinese leaders is that China needs to be helped to establish the rule of law and to be encouraged to carry out political modernisation as the necessary social parallel of its astonishing economic development .     Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Belder , as chairman of Parliament’s delegation for China , I am left with rather mixed feelings about this report .
There is insufficient scrutiny or critical and/or constructive analysis of the activities the Commission is engaged in .
We should not ask for consensus with the United States after all , for I think that would restrict us enormously in our policy .
As far as conditions for partnership are concerned , it has to be said that every day , some minister or other , commissioner of a region or a country , sets off for China in order to discuss this strategic partnership over there .
Chinese experts who are involved in this say they need social values .
Be fair in your ...     Mr President , I should like to warmly congratulate Mrs  Fraga Estévez on her report on the Commission ’s communication and also Mrs Ries , who drafted the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
In that way , the Commission facilitates and industry submits the applications , which appears to be the right way of going about things .
These two things do not exclude each other ; on the contrary , they are complementary .
After PNR , Swift , the CIA scandal and various other recent problems , I believe that it is highly unlikely that the current United States Government can be persuaded to be sensitive to our very simple and logical demands .
The Member States must prevent a renewed arms race in the region by strictly applying the EU code of conduct on weapons exports to all weapons supplied to it .
Putting an organisation on the list of terrorist organisations is an indication that it is not one to be negotiated with and that every effort is to be made to stamp it out .
That is why an alternative must be made available to those who want to escape .
Mugabe , in his madness , has reduced his people to a state of misery .
It is an important issue and it gives us the opportunity to discuss the promotion
