I mention this simply to support the considerations raised in the report by Mrs Marinucci , whom I congratulate on her work .
I would like to draw attention to four points that I consider to be of the utmost importance .
This time women are on the labour market to stay .
Thirdly , the recognition of women and men as individuals with their own rights within the family .
Unfortunately , our frequent predictions , our fears that this crisis might spread to neighbouring countries have been confirmed in recent days .
We have said time and time again that it is vital to hold political negotiations in order to find a solution to the far-reaching political , economic and social problems besetting this region of Africa .
One thing is certain .
This might just , in the medium term , lead to a solution , with a gradual retreat by the other countries in the region and an internalisation of the conflict to involve only Congolese forces .
I should also like to inform you that we are in close contact with the United Nations Development Programme and with the World Bank , in order to see whether it might be possible to take joint action on the overall rehabilitation of the whole area , which obviously would be an important contribution to any global conference on the region .
The cities of Kinshasa and Kisangani are currently facing severe food shortages and water supply problems since all supplies have been cut .
This is not an easy question , but I think that the European institutions - since Europe is Africa 's biggest donor - might have trouble with our taxpayers and with our own consciences if we do not look into this issue more closely .
Scarcely had the guns fallen silent in Guinea-Bissau than a new focus of instability had flared up in the Democratic Republic of Congo , spreading its conflict into a series of neighbouring countries , from Angola to Zimbabwe , from Namibia to Rwanda , from Uganda to Burundi and Tanzania .
If they were only wallowing in desert sand and dust , we would not be here discussing a conflict that is threatening to turn into a massive regional tragedy .
All of this needs to be re-examined , and we should look into the possibility of taking measures to suspend certain cooperation budgets unless the warring countries show that they have come to their senses .
This is a clear violation of the Lusaka Agreements , and now it looks and sounds as though the country is preparing for war .
Mr President , I shall be very brief and make just three comments .
As far as humanitarian aid is concerned , I must tell you that the men and women working for non-governmental organisations who dare to go inside the Democratic Republic of Congo are genuine heroes , I repeat genuine heroes .
We welcome the fact that Mr Berisha has already called for moderation although the calls for Prime Minister Nano to resign will not help to resolve the situation .
Obviously , issues of public order and security are some of the most vital political priorities .
As far as the situation in Burma is concerned I should like to tell the European Parliament that in July the Vice-President of the Commission , Mr Manuel Marín , and the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Wolfgang Schüssel , met the Burmese Minister of Foreign Affairs in order to express the European Union 's condemnation of the country 's treatment of Aung San Sun Kyi and other opposition politicians .
You will recall that the European Union was and is involved in a battle with the United States in the World Trade Organisation , because we fully reject the idea of the extra-territoriality of laws .
As far as Afghanistan is concerned , I think that everything has been said .
We also still think that the problem of Afghanistan cannot be solved by military means or interference by neighbouring countries .
He very clearly indicated the various factors involved in Cambodia .
Finally , concerning Sudan , I must say that the problem of Sudan is an old one , a serious one , and one which led to the suspension of cooperation relations between the European Union and that country .
The European Union actively supports IGADD mediation and the efforts being made by IGADD 's forum of partners but we repeat that in no way can we consider at present resuming cooperation with Sudan , because sadly the principles that led us to suspend that cooperation still apply .
That does not mean that sanctions are altogether excluded but we will have to watch it carefully , in order , for instance , not to put into question the GPA , the agreement made on government procurement , in the WTO .
I should like to emphasise the need to adapt the forestry policy aspects of the common agricultural policy in future , and also to highlight the importance of regional and local planning for forest areas .
We are aware that some of these fires are of criminal origin while others are the result of climatic changes leading to lengthy droughts and heatwaves .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to say that , contrary to the opinion of all those who have claimed that we must set up a complete 'fire industry ' to combat fires in the summer , I should like to say that when it comes to Mediterranean forests it is a common mistake to think that fires can be fought in the summer or that fleets of planes or hundreds of firemen are needed .
They are huge areas but they are guarded and kept clean and they are protected by fire-breaks and fire-lanes .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall try
