It is blatant intervention in the internal affairs of an independent country , it infringes every concept of international law and it is equivalent to a declaration of war against a people standing up against imperialist barbarity .
Following the proud response of the people of Belarus , they are trying with terrorism , slander and fascist-type sanctions to isolate the country and its people .
The ΕU and the European Parliament consider countries subjugated to imperialism and occupying governments , such as Iraq and Afghanistan , and the political forces that sell off the interests of their workers and countries to capital to be democratic .
Nonetheless , this must not lead us to conclude that this is the only problem in Turkey : there is a major problem in connection with the rights of Kurds , which is something we should not sweep under the carpet in today 's debate .
The recent uncontrolled interventions by the army must not deprive the Kurds of the rights which they must have if Turkey is to become a member of the European Union , by which I mean the rights enjoyed by the citizens of European states .
If these measures are introduced , Turkey will have taken its European prospects seriously and if Turkey honours its commitments in both this area and in all the other areas stipulated by the European Union , this will be to the benefit both of the Kurds and of all the citizens of Turkey .
The powers that be and the army in Turkey find in the action of the PKK a convenient pretext for continuing to intervene in political life and trying to define the terms of the resolution to the Kurdish problem .
We must support consistently and decisively the cultural , linguistic and education rights of the Kurdish community ; we must support political rights ; we must call for the electoral law prohibiting the democratic representation of the Kurdish community in the political life of Turkey to be amended .
The Kurdish problem will be resolved not on terms of suppression and violence , but on terms of democratic dialogue , development and the flourishing of the rights of the Kurdish people .
We cannot but respect the name of this country .
We do not know how many people we need to remember today .
Twenty years have gone by , meaning that cancer will be lodged in the human body for another 15 years .
Deaths from thyroid cancer have multiplied a hundredfold .
At some point they have poured 200 metres of concrete and there are still leaks .
So just imagine how many thousands of years it will be active .
Yes , this is a promise , but he did not tell us that Bulgaria is already building another nuclear station a few kilometres away , just 50 kilometres from the second largest city in Greece and less than 1 000 kilometres from Rome as the crow flies .
Turkey is already building three nuclear stations and I do not want to say that Turkish and Bulgarian engineers are more inferior to Soviet engineers who , if nothing else , were the first in this field and still suffered the accident .
I must also report the following sad fact : this year Greece does not have enough soldiers .
Democracy needs courage .     – Mr President , to all those worried and talking about incentives and criteria , I wish to say that there is no need to worry .
Let us look at the parallel consequences : - firstly , the poorer areas of the countries of Europe covered by the Cohesion Fund today will not be covered tomorrow because another two poor countries will join it .
That is why they cannot be taken hostage either to the present institutional crisis in the European Union or to the fact that certain European countries dispute the enlargement strategy .
According to the official report by the UN special coordinator for the Middle East to the Security Council , 40 people lost their lives last month , including at least three Palestinian children .
The European Union is being called on and must also play its part in addressing the situation , by making an active contribution to stabilisation and to the resumption of talks to resolve the Palestinian problem .
How does the state of Israel see this ?
How on earth can we qualify as 'sad ' a decision taken in a free , democratic manner , while under occupation , by a people in elections which we have called fair and transparent ?     – Madam President , the report and the Commission 's strategic communication on enhanced cooperation between the European Union and Latin America serve the objectives of European capital to acquire an even bigger share of Latin American by creating conditions for its unaccountable action .
In reality they are calling on the countries of Latin America to adopt and apply the policy of the European Union in the economic and political sector and even to accept its foreign policy .
An attempt is being made through this relationship , in the name of development , to plunder these countries still further and , at the same time , to intervene in their internal affairs in order to prevent progressive developments .
We are with them and the Council is right to worry about the departure of Venezuela from the Andean Community ; it is an alternative and progressive method of cooperation for these countries .     – Mr President , Commissioner , as rapporteur on the discharge for the European Development Funds , I wish to start by saying that these funds are an important and valuable tool for promoting solidarity , prosperity in the world , peace , the principles of justice and respect for human rights .
