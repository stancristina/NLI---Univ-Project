From this viewpoint , then , I think that we ought to continue to work in the area to which my report relates to find mechanisms whose scope can be extended in ways that nobody can reject , and to find gradual methods of implementation over a reasonable period that will allow everyone to adapt over time , without demanding that things should happen overnight .
Personally speaking , and as regards Parliament , I can assure you that in any case we will work every day , at all times , from now until 31 December this year , to ensure that the dossier can be closed under this presidency and that it can be closed in the best way possible for all those who are watching us .
How can we do this ?
I really must warmly thank the French Presidency for the action it has taken , its attempt to mediate , and its wish to involve Parliament in what is a very delicate and also very difficult legislative decision .
Yesterday , I met the Federal Republic of Germany 's transport minister , and urged that Germany should also play its part ; what I am trying to do with all the Member States , in the meetings that I have , is to try to take a step forward by supporting the mediation activity that the French Presidency , together with the European Commission , is attempting .
I would like to go into the substance of the various reports and the various amendments that have been tabled .
This aim , which in any case corresponds to the approach adopted by the IMO , is met by the common position , and I am therefore not able to back amendments such as Amendments 7 , 13 or 14 .
In the face of this observation , the Commission saw just one solution : to seek harmonisation .
We need to put this right , and one way of doing this is by helping the insurance sector by setting a single maximum compensation amount that will apply Europe-wide .
While the Commission can accept the point of view of the Council , which introduces a less strict system for ships on the grey list , I am nonetheless pleased that Parliament supports the Commission on the issue of a permanent ban .
I apologise for having spoken at length , Mr President , but there were a large number of amendments and I believed it was right to make the Commission 's view known to Parliament .
This seems to me truly unacceptable , and I cannot believe that Mr Rack , Mrs Wortmann-Kool and Mr Blokland truly meant to make out that the protection of small interests - because what is involved is very small insurance costs for events that , because they are highly improbable , have very low insurance costs - that the small interests of some small operator can undermine a position which I am happy to have heard confirmed by the Commission too , and which it would also do Parliament credit to espouse .
In this context , the Commission has systematically backed the attempts by the Member States and the international community as a whole to draw up legislative instruments of high quality within the framework of the United Nations and its specialised body in the sector of maritime transport , which is the International Maritime Organization .
It is thus also vital in seeking to remove the workforce from criminal organisations , which can focus on the conditions of extreme poverty experienced by certain groups of people .
This is why we will continue to work in harmony with all the Member States , with the Council and also with countries outside Europe that are particularly involved in combating piracy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it seems to me that this debate has been very useful , because it has certainly demonstrated the wishes of Parliament , the Commission and the Council to take action together to tackle a phenomenon that is becoming ever more worrying , namely piracy , and to give a response to European citizens on this issue .
The Commission can give significant help here to the other European institutions .
I would begin by thanking my colleague Adriana Poli Bortone , now a senator of the Italian Republic , from whom I inherited the draft report and an already detailed , meticulous study of the topic ; next my staff , who have supported me enthusiastically and conscientiously in furthering my exploration and analysis of the phenomenon ; and finally the shadow rapporteurs , whose commitment undoubtedly contributed to the adoption of the text in the Committee on the Environment , with a virtually unanimous cross-party consensus .
Fats are an essential part of a correct nutritional intake , but in the right quantities and at the right times of the day .
Therefore , just as the scourge of anorexia needs to be fought energetically , we wish to try and combat obesity in the same manner , working on the various fronts set out in this report , which calls for parallel and consistent efforts .
Above all , however , the report itself aims to make clear that we are dealing with a highly critical condition : obesity .
Once again , my thanks go to all those who have spoken in favour of this report .
It seems to me that Europe is again turning a deaf ear : claims of election-rigging , intimidation , violence and harassment have so far gone unheeded , despite international observers confirming the clear violations , light years away from the required democratic standards .
The Court simply said that access to documents , particularly those with legislative implications , had to be compulsory because access to documents was democratic and that any exception was
