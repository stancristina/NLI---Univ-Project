nonetheless to repeat my question as to how the Council views USCIRF 's report on Saudi Arabia and the Wahhabite Islamic - inspired violence and terrorism .
Could the EU prepare reports corresponding to the American annual reports on religious freedom ?
In what way can the European Union use the good relationship between the Italian Prime Minister , that is to say the new President of the European Union , and the US President to promote joint action by the United States and the European Union to bring about a ban on cloning within the UN system ?
Road safety is important to the European Parliament , a fact that is clear from this report .
The programme has been very much influenced by the road safety debate we have had in Parliament in recent years .
There has been lengthy discussion of the protection of pedestrians .
We really did try to enable all the parties to contribute to our obtaining cars that are as safe as possible for unprotected road users .
Then , there are also committee amendments concerning sports cars : the large cars that we know are extremely dangerous and to which the Commission has also drawn attention in its road safety programme .
I have played a part in bringing about the compromises , and I support the report .
There were major logistical problems and plenty of opportunities to make mistakes , but the euro has become the second world currency in a very short period .
In many respects , the Bank and the work you have carried out are commended but , in one area , the ECB is criticised in a way that I must admit is justified .
You are aware of our wishes and mentioned them before : open publication of the minutes of ECB Council meetings and annual publication of economic prognoses from individual countries , regions and border regions in the manner of what is termed the Beige Book in the United States .
If today , Mr Duisenberg , you could provide us with some encouraging news , it could cause more and more Swedes to accept the euro .
Mr Duisenberg , in the future you can put up a sign saying ' Gone fishing ' .
We have finally obtained a practical common European symbol .
One of the aspects , which was also addressed by Mr Berenguer Fuster and which has been discussed in connection with the introduction of the euro , is that of whether there have been price rises and , if so , unfair ones .
Eurostat 's statistics clearly show that there was a very small , one-off effect of between 0.1 and 0.2 % upon the introduction of the euro .
It is good that we should now take up this issue and ask the Commission to investigate it further .
In spite of great unrest in the world , partly due to the Iraq war , European currencies have not tossed around on a stormy monetary sea , as in actual fact happened in the nineties .
If the euro is to function , a lot of things are clearly required .
What is required is coordination on tax policy , a structural policy and greater mobility for the European labour force .
If the matter were to be summarised , there could even perhaps be talk of the need for a European state power in the economic sphere .
There is therefore considerable hesitation , and more than half of the Swedish population will presumably vote 'no ' in the forthcoming referendum .
People are aware of the ups and downs of the German debate and of the problems there are , and they think it is better to wait .
In purely practical terms , it is now clear that the introduction of the euro has been extremely successful .
I nonetheless think that the most interesting thing about this report is the observation that the euro is in the process of becoming a world currency , together with the demands for a feasibility study designed further to strengthen that role , for we can see how the dollar even now dominates in the world at large .
If we could achieve this , it would be important from both economic and political points of view .
There is a lot to be said , for example , for the possibility of one day fixing oil prices in euros .
It would also , however , be in the interests of European consumers because the price fluctuations we have for oil and petrol , dependent upon the rate of the dollar , would disappear .
Madam President , my political group will be delighted to vote in favour of this own-initiative report by Mrs Ghilardotti .
Ever since the Beijing Conference in 1995 , we have talked about statistics broken down by gender .
It is regrettable that the Committee on Budgets has not itself taken the initiative that Mrs Ghilardotti has so creditably taken .
.
Large parts of the Council 's common position are a good compromise .
There is a connection between poverty and trafficking in children .
European education and culture , traditionally characterised by cultural diversity , have every opportunity to thrive in an open world market and indirectly to support minority cultures , in particular .
Their names and locations have not been published .
We also call upon the authorities in Laos to give the Red Cross permission to visit the political prisoners in order to assure themselves of their physical well-being .
We also believe that the Commission should investigate whether it is appropriate to continue with the ongoing cooperation with the authorities in Laos and that it should report to Parliament on this issue .
Under these laws , 60 Christians were arrested in 2002 , and an active campaign to close churches was conducted between 1999 and 2001
