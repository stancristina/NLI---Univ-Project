, through their improper conditions of work and employment , breach not only labour law , but also human rights .
Today we are expressing our hope for a Europe of unity , solidarity and peace .
The more we remove borders , the more we must increase the new rights of the citizens .
Please allow me , however , to stress that this breathing is not without its worries .
And when one cannot communicate the values one defends , when one is , shall we say , a market , one’s future depends on predators .
A few refinements , confined to the Convention’s draft Constitution , are , in our view , desirable , provided that these do not upset the overall balance of the text .
We – and on this I feel that I am expressing the opinion of the Commission , Parliament and the presidency  – are all equally determined to see the European Constitution come to fruition during the first half of this year , thereby giving tangible form to the progress made in the Convention .
Furthermore , prominent Members of other groups of this House , or their political family , have taken on some of our arguments , even our wording , for which I am most grateful , albeit juxtaposing certain ideas that I would consider contradictory .
In all honesty , as you said just now , we can see right through this ...
I should like to highlight , if I may , the inherent paradox in reaching agreement on a text after the elections , even though it will have been the main subject of debate .
The Eurostat scandal has been known about ever since mid-2003 , and it is astonishing that it is only now , with the European elections a month away , that Members of this House are waking up to it .
Affairs like Eurostat , with its labyrinthine byways , and also the issue of GMOs , which has also been raised today in the context of the approval of the new Commission , are what happens when European institutions believe themselves to be superior to nations and end up being out of control .
I therefore hope that a United Nations commission of enquiry may be set up as quickly as possible and I ask the President of Parliament , the Commission and the Council to work together to ensure that a request to this effect is forwarded to the Secretary-General of the United Nations .     – Madam President , I wonder how one of our Members managed to get up on the Presidential rostrum , an act that strikes me as utterly out of place in the course of our work , and done with the purpose of attaching a religious emblem that is incompatible with the EU’s motto of ‘unity in diversity’ .
Even though part of the island has rejected the Annan plan , I am still convinced that the Cypriots , both Greek and Turkish , can live together and want to do so .
We all want the EU to prosper for the sake of its 450 million consumers ; we all want a dynamic EU , one founded upon solidarity .
This Europe of ours must be social or it will perish .
Enlargement brings the hope of peace , cooperation and valuable exchanges between peoples .
The objectives of the European Central Bank must be redrafted to include job-creating investments and industrial projects .
It is thus that we will have successful businesses and also be able to guarantee the social Europe .     – And now , Mr President , for the social Europe !
There will be no cohesion in Europe , nor will there be a consolidated social and economic model , if goods simply circulate without there being , as we have defined in the Charter , rights for all , which are a matter for the social responsibility of businesses or of an occupational social security scheme .
We cannot therefore regard all those questions that have yet to receive an answer as having lapsed .
Hopefully your new Commission will not miss any further opportunities to speak on behalf of the citizens of our Community .
I feel that these are strong arguments .
I feel , however , that it was in the Conference of Presidents that , as far as I am concerned , I was really able to appreciate your qualities .
Commissioner Byrne will probably make his announcement the day after the forthcoming European elections ...
With the exception of three MEPs , who have stated that they will abstain , my group will therefore transfer its votes to Mr Josep Borrell in the second round of this ballot .
They will include MEPs who do not belong to groups and who , although much larger in number than the members of certain groups and although representing no less than eight or ten nationalities , do not have a single interpreter , in French or English for example , at their work meetings – a form of discrimination that , during the previous Parliament , the Court of Justice had occasion to condemn in principle .
At the same time , however , Ministers have been called to order for failing to observe the rules which they themselves laid down .
It is unfortunate that you chose to go back on a text which is a credit to the European Parliament , striking , as it in one sense did , a miraculous balance between protecting our industry and guaranteeing the universality of the language of software and the freedom of access to it .
The working party chaired by Mr Kok is due to submit its report in October , but you are already calling for more flexibility and deregulation , as a way of helping countries with a very low level of social acquis
