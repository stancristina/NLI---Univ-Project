the governments of all the countries .
Furthermore , we feel that a matter of crucial importance is cooperation between civil and military authorities .
We must remember that air traffic control constitutes a service of general interest , as has already been established by the Judgment of the Court of Justice , and , in this respect , we call upon the Commission to emphasise especially the economic and social impact as regards employment .
I have noticed a political theme emerging during the course of the debate : the perpetuation of the myth that the Single Sky is an attack on the sovereignty of the individual States .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the Commission and congratulating it on its initiative , as other Members have done .
We often say that we must not throw the baby out with the bath water but , in this case , there are some people who have been trying , right from the beginning , to make the bath water dirty precisely so that the baby will then be thrown out , and we would like to avoid this .
The effects of this complexity have been felt even today in this House , although it is clear to everybody that there are many economic , safety , environmental and consumer protection justifications for producing this package : we have seen the amount of delays , the level of air traffic congestion , the costs of this congestion and the difficulties of creating new airspaces in terms of safety .
This result has been achieved thanks to her perseverance and to the contribution of many others , including the European Parliament .
This is why I am calling for the two words 'and training ' to be removed .
Mr President , of course I voted for the report on recycling and on the recovery of packaging , which it discusses , but I have to say that , when I was discussing the report with a pensioner , Mrs Caterina Rossi , from Bergamo , she said to me , ' What a good report !
My colleague and right-hand man , Giuseppe Italia , from Cremona , an elderly pensioner , said to me as I was preparing to come here to Strasbourg , ' I advise you to vote for the report on the Single European Sky .
Although many would not admit it , I am afraid it is becoming obvious that our world 's climate is changing , and it is not necessary to subscribe to the theory of alarmism to see this .
We still have an unquestionable duty to insist more firmly that the candidate countries ratify the Protocol , starting with Poland .
In addition , the consumer is also safeguarded as regards the court or out-of-court settlement of claims .
Competition laws and laws on all cases which can be classed as unfair competition exist , and so cases of discounts which would appear to be an example of fair competition are prosecuted via this channel too .
Mr President , Commissioner , if our aim is to produce both legislation providing full legal certainty and , at the same time , rules which will allow the citizens to derive maximum benefits from the internal market , then the regulation before us is certainly a step in the right direction .
Moreover , once again as my colleagues have recommended , we would like to see an increase in the activity of the Expert Group on Commercial Communications .
I am all the more pleased to note the generally very favourable tone of the report .
The draft regulation does not relate to these measures .
It must also be pointed out that , in many cases , State aid with different primary objectives also has the implicit objective of promoting employment .
This is my question : why is it that , in a regulation which seeks to reduce bureaucracy through a series of measures - and we have already mentioned the specific sectors - was it decided to exclude the transport sector ?
State aid - this is another aspect of the rationale which I feel today 's speeches have picked up on very well - is , by definition , selective .
I have to say that converting such a philosophy , which appears to be widely supported , into detailed , directly applicable provisions , is by no means a simple task .
Moreover , we intend to make provision for the special case of sheltered employment for workers with disabilities .
We are also astounded that public bodies have only accounted for 10 % of the participants .
This is a danger against which the United States , under the Bush administration , has decided to take a stand , adopting a position which , although erroneous , is quite clear , quite cut and dried .
I do not feel there is any division here , as has already been said , as regards condemnation of Saddam Hussein and his regime .
It is evident that the unstated assumption by the European authorities - with the remarkable exception of the German Republic - is that war is , by now , a certainty .
Unfortunately , what we have heard today from Mr Haarder and Commissioner Patten confirms our belief that there is a growing gap between the people of Europe and these governing bodies , a gap which this war will enlarge with deleterious consequences for the future of the Union .
The Afghan government is proceeding , one small step at a time , to bring a return to law and order and respect for human rights , combating the extremist fringe groups which have combined terrorism and Islam to make a single religion .
State aid must be defined and provided by a nation at times of economic crisis
