We should be very conscious of this threat .
Mr President , I am impressed by the breadth and clarity of the President-in-Office 's answers but there is one point that I missed and that is the complexity of the procedures .
Mr President , should the Central Bank be accountable to this Parliament ?
This entails , by definition , a markedly short term vision .
The presidents of the national banks will also start a dialogue with their parliaments .
During its initial phase , ECB policy will have to be characterized by a cautious , searching approach .
That is why Parliament will have to ensure that belief in the principles of democracy and a willingness to be accountable are significant factors in the choice of prospective board members .
This will depend largely on what we do during the coming years .
It will entail much homework for candidates , but also for the Union .
The Union must learn its lessons and be brave enough to act as one with respect to Cyprus .
The accession negotiations alone will under no circumstances lead to a resolution of the political conflict which is tearing Cyprus apart .
Mr President , the British Presidency has made a good start with the two-track approach .
The third pillar is becoming increasingly important for the European Union , because we are characterized by the fact that we are an association of democratic constitutional states .
Will some kind of action plan be developed during the British Presidency to achieve convergence in foreign policy ?
You know the city .
As far as the core of the issue is concerned , the Green Group supports the two reports by Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Daskalaki .
We also knew which changes were needed , and they have not been implemented .
Since that time it has remained ruined and it is now a symbol of the inefficient decision-making of the European Union .
I think it is excellent and well thought out , in particular when he says we should make ourselves more visible through decentralized decision-making processes , by increasing our presence with a clearer figurehead , with a large , effective staff and a wide remit to coordinate and take decisions .
First of all , we wish to underline that blood should be donated on a voluntary basis , and that donating blood should therefore be unpaid .
Firstly , I believe that in principle , donations must remain voluntary .
The system I have just referred to amounts to a standardized , personal identification code which is allocated to each blood donation .
It is an excellent report .
This figure may be based on possible estimates , but these have no normative character as such .
Madam President , the significance of the debate on the budget at this stage is , as Commissioner Liikanen said , that it gives joint guidelines for the Commission in its forthcoming preliminary draft budget .
I would hope that Mr Wynn could reconsider this point .
Oh , he has just come in !
They deal with the abolition of internal border controls ; the unimpeded travel of people from other countries , that is third countries ; and the abolition of restrictions on workers ' residency .
Mr President , of the four freedoms mentioned in relation to the internal market , the free movement of persons still poses some problems .
The amendments from both the Green Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Party of European Socialists are truly unacceptable .
As far as the Greens are concerned , I would like to say this .
This is a restriction , but to my mind a necessary restriction , otherwise there would be all kinds of social abuse in the various Member States .
In my speech I would like to go into a particular point , namely the status of third countries in the context of the free movement of persons .
Do we think it is normal that people from third countries cannot invite their ill relatives to come over here if they can guarantee that they can support them ?
Could you repeat the vote please ?
Obviously , structural measures must also be taken to prevent a repeat of these disasters .
For the moment , they can still control this child .
It is not only Indonesia , it is all of us that may be the victims of what is happening .
So he has got hold of money that could have been spent on medicines and food for the next century , so that in the long run it is all of us who are affected .
I note that on our continent as well , for example in France as a result of the communist Gayssot Law , people were recently awarded heavy sentences , and even reduced to poverty , after simply expressing an opinion .
At the core of the debate on this report is the notion of "independence ' .
I am therefore asking the Commission whether it would be prepared to carry out an independent study into its possible effects , looking in particular at the sectors and regions most affected .
The reply is also at odds with the citizens ' Europe the Commission is so keen on .
We are behind the Council and the Commission .
I am not saying that we should maintain the duty-free facilities ad infinitum , but I do think it is very bad that on the one hand we are saying to society that we are abolishing it , yet on the other hand , the planned tax harmonization - which was supposed to be further advanced than it is at the moment - and the internal market are not yet a reality .
This was the case with my report on
