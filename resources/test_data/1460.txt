Besides , this is our basic role as Members of the European Parliament : to identify the political components , the clashes , and to make provision for solutions to the economic and social problems which are caused .
Internet access and mobile telephone communication requirements need to be met by 2010 , so that the most remote communities in developing world villages can have real access .
However , there is also a whole series of issues which need to be answered .
And the answers are not always easy .
Under the weight of these contradictions , it is not at all strange that the summit did not result in anything specific .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the problem which we have to solve is not how some people , at a time when they have nothing to eat , will plant themselves down in front of a screen and stab away furiously at a keyboard .
The problem is the prosperity of mankind and the to that is peace .
I particularly welcome the fact that the proclamation made at the Geneva summit included the need to promote the incorporation of the gender equality dimension , in other words gender mainstreaming , in the information society .
The participation of women in it may be very important , because women are in a position to promote a different ethical dimension based on the different system of values which characterises them .
Unfortunately , the summit avoided analysing in depth the social reasons which lead to the perpetuation of this phenomenon .
How can someone fund a country under occupation , however , and why does no one talk about it ?
This is yet another example of the excessive hypocrisy of the ΕU.
For the rest , the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels confirmed yet again the assessments of the Communist Party of Greece that the debate is far removed from grass-roots interests , given that no one contests either the introduction of neo-liberalism or the promotion of the ΕU to deputy policeman alongside the USA or the attack on democratic rights and freedoms .     .
We would further note that the attack on democratic rights has been stepped up , with police and judicial cooperation , common border management and confirmation and specialisation of the Thessaloniki decision to introduce biometric elements into passports .
The President in the chair at that sitting told me that he would raise the matter with the Bureau .
Today my honourable friend Mr Patakis reiterated this request .
Its stand on the question of the European Aviation Safety Agency , the EASA , is evidence of this awareness .
Then , as you know , there is the safety issue which arose after the terrorist attack on 11 September .
On the pretext of strengthening competition , it aims to increase the profits of the shipping industry by cutting back marine workers ' wages and social rights and giving scandalous tax breaks to shipping companies in the Member States of the European Union .
This will create the conditions for new crimes at sea , such as the , the and others .
The proposal to strengthen the criminal framework for abolishing pollution from ships will do nothing to reduce crimes at sea , in that everything will be subjugated to safeguarding and increasing the profits of shipowners and big business in general , which controls the sources of energy and the means of transport and production .
There is the MARPOL convention , which is applied differently in the Member States as far as the sanctions imposed are concerned , which is why the initiative by the European Commission is useful , so that there is a uniform approach to the matter from the point of view of sanctions .
Consequently , we are taking a positive step here and what I want to emphasise with regret is that the Council , having asked the European Commission to submit this regulation on sanctions in cases of illegal discharges of waste by ships , does not now appear to be prepared to proceed quickly , does not appear to be prepared to accept the Commission 's and Parliament 's proposals and appears to be delaying the whole procedure .
The approach which we adopted jointly with the rapporteur does not turn a blind eye to the problems raised by the current situation .
Among other things , it is important for care to be taken in all cases to satisfy the needs of the entire populace .
I therefore call on the House , especially those who believe in the European social model as part of the European productive system , to vote for the amendments relating to what I have just said .
In a period of economic crisis , the only thing that is certain is that big business will want to get its hands on the public wealth in order to maximise its profits .
Privatisation results in the destruction of productive forces , problematic performance , a fall in the quality of the services provided , terrible social inequalities , higher prices and fewer jobs .
We support the public character of undertakings of general interest , which need to be upgraded , providing good , cheap services to the workers , and to act as a lever in a publicly-owned economy .     .
The report by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy endeavours to support the inadequate text of the directive with comments which are either neutral or even negative .
Mr President , in a Europe in which there is an acute demographic problem and the number of elderly people is increasing constantly , it is clear that new problems of policies relating to the elderly will arise .
I should like to remind
