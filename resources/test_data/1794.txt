Remember though that the action plan for risk capital predates Lisbon , since it dates back to 1998 .
Nevertheless , and some of you have highlighted this , when we compare it with the figure in the United States , we have to acknowledge that the difference is significant .
With regard to the Community patent , I simply wish to say that , back in July , the Commission approved its proposal on this issue .
This is not a desire to exclude anything , but simply a desire to use the available resources in the best way .
I believe I have mentioned the two issues raised by Mr Skinner .
It is a fortunate coincidence that the meeting is taking place in Korea soon after the historic Korean summit , which opened the way to reconciliation and future reunification .
The process is based on a relationship of equality .
Security problems , which are of particular importance in the region , will play a considerable role in the process , and it is worth mentioning the publication of a separate declaration on the Korean peninsular as an example of this .
Furthermore , the leaders will discuss the implications of the new economy , globalisation , the lessons learnt from the crisis , the creation of a trans-European-Asian superhighway to improve contacts between research institutes , and discuss the influence of the new technologies on economic life , including the measures to deal with the ever-greater knowledge gap .
In this regard , we regret that our Asian partners are still not prepared to consider the creation of a social forum , within the ASEM process , which represents civil society in the same way that the Asia-Europe business forum represents the business community .
The only outstanding problem is the question of qualification for membership , with regard to which the European partners have so far been opposed to attempts to introduce certain limits which could be interpreted as excluding certain partners from future participation .
With regard to the social aspects , we proposed a new body at the time - the social forum - which would represent civil society .
Our political support for Timor is clear and we provide what we consider to be significant humanitarian assistance .
I am not going to highlight the parts of the report on which we agree , but I would like to point out a couple of issues which worry me and also worry certain other Members .
We are currently trying to promote marine transport as an alternative to air transport , and this is therefore an issue to be considered .
I also agree that we should select the most important ports - as Mr Piecyk points out - as well as those which conform to intermodality and , above all , the ports which allow us to make the greatest savings in terms of environmental costs .
I believe that Parliament and the Commission broadly agree on most of the areas under discussion .
Mr Piecyk ' s report justifies this idea by saying that the trans-European networks should not have to include an excessive number of installations .
However , we believe that the most important issue is to highlight the fact that inland terminals are an integral part of the network , and it does not seem relevant to us whether they appear on a map or not .
It is the case that the types of project which Parliament is referring to when it talks of superstructures are not included in the projects of common interest and do not therefore have funding .
We share these objectives , of course .
We believe that the three axles for buses of over 12 metres represent the simplest formula , which will best resolve the problems .
Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are not acceptable to the Commission either .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , ten years after German reunification , which marked the end of the cold war and to which our institution actively contributed , we find ourselves at a new crossroads .
Why ?
It is important that this Parliament sends the message that it is essential to set the timetable at the European Council in Nice , which needs to be successful .
Secondly , with regard to the method , we have not discovered the philosopher ' s stone , but we have realised that this method is democratic , because it is public , transparent , and is allowing the citizens and civil society to follow what we are doing in real time .
We completely agree on this and also on the fact that we have to try to take advantage of that triangle .
We are surely heading for a creative crisis in the Union .
How can the European Union meet in Biarritz to announce a new declaration of fundamental rights for European citizens whilst the most elementary rights of the Basque people , namely language and self-administration , are thoroughly denied ?
Why do I say that he gave an extraordinary speech ?
The method has therefore worked , and so has the content of the Charter .
It is a Charter for the citizens , who have participated actively in its creation .
However , even if what you say is true , and there are some governments who do not want it incorporated into the Treaties , I must say very clearly that the citizens of Europe and the Members of this Parliament have the right to know who those governments are .
Is this not a case of double standards ?
We do not agree with Recital A where it says that Europe was divided by the Soviet occupation because , as everybody knows and as any history book will tell you , the division was a consequence of
