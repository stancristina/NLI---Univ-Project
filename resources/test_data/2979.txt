Despite this , the Commission has made various proposals to benefit from the agricultural budget , if possible .
Potentially , however , there is another very large gap .
One of the options is possibly to set up an insurance system throughout Europe , which would also promote fair competition .
But what is now happening with the Commission ' s proposal is tantamount to throwing out the baby with the bathwater .
The amounts which have been mentioned guarantee that cultivation remains profitable and also ensure sound processing .
What we need is tighter control on processing to ensure that malpractices are prevented in future .
Mr President , over the past couple of years , we have seen a sharp increase in the acreage of fibre flax and hemp as a result of subsidy-hunting in Member States such as Great Britain and Spain .
But the cereal support level is too low for long-fibre flax and therefore acts as a disincentive to producers to grow this flax variant .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Schierhuber .
Encouraging initiatives have been taken in this field and large investments have been made in various countries .
The Council has sat on the regulation for far too long .
What is needed is for resources to be better distributed and correctly allocated to meet all social needs .
Although development cooperation and trade are very much interrelated , they should not be played off against each other .
This is an example to draw on when it comes to determining the strategy for other countries !
For years , we supported the fight against apartheid and welcomed the new South Africa with excitement .
There is another reason to feel ashamed .
This is unethical .
I also have a feeling that other groups in this House from the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy share the same view .
The report also contains a political comment regarding the separate budget lines required for the parliamentary groups on the one hand and the European political parties on the other .
I think that we should really re-think the system .
For example , the rent we pay for the buildings may increase .
Also , the date mentioned in the report is important , in our opinion .
I would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect too .
I entreat Commissioner Schreyer to give very specific answers to this request and would ask her whether she would be prepared to take any initiative in this matter before 30 June .
I would like to highlight two .
This will prevent us from running behind the facts in future , as is now the case with the 1998 discharge procedure .
My group has not tabled any amendments and is in full agreement with you .
We give you our full support and have every confidence in you .
As it happens , we all know that these tests are not yet scientifically accurate and that when these tests are applied , we do not know precisely whether infection actually occurs at each stage of the disease .
I would also like to thank all the delegates , as it would indeed be impossible to find a compromise on a number of difficult and sensitive issues , if it was not for the fact that everyone moderated their demands , and this is what eventually happened .
Since no draft directive has been proposed for inland shipping yet , I would ask the Commission to work on that .
I hope that this procedure will create a disincentive for those countries because we do not intend to carry on applying the number of working hours prescribed for longer than nine years .
In this case , we managed to keep the procedure within bounds .
If this line were to be taken across the board , and if Parliament were to say "no " , then we would not have a solution in nine years , or ninety years .
I would like to know how the Commission intends to deal with this .
Finally , Mr President , one of the first people to propose working time legislation was Winston Churchill .
Do they anticipate the consequences which enlargement will have on the internal structure of the Commission and do the proposed measures and actions take account of such consequences ?
What we are aiming for in the long run with this rail proposal is to attempt to cut down on traffic jams but also , more importantly , to benefit the environment , safety and a number of other aspects .
It is increasingly hard to obtain international rail timetables and it is often the case that train tickets to remote destinations have to be bought outside the country of departure .
According to this line of thinking , everything should come down in price and should become flexible , so that price-based competition has a less detrimental effect on trains .
Furthermore , the money to finance such a high-speed network should not be found through cutting down services on short-haul routes in the individual Member States , as many people are indignant - and rightly so - about the huge amount of funding being ploughed into fast connections for the benefit of a small , privileged minority .
I am pleased that Mr Savary ' s proposals help strike a happy balance .
This should not be done again .
It is high time that the Member States forsook their national stances in favour of a European stance because it is national stances that have prevented the rail system from being vital and from retaining its passengers and freight .
Indeed , a small country is vulnerable in that respect , but
