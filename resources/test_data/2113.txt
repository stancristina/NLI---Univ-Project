therefore like to start today 's debate by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets , and all the members of the specialised committees who have worked so closely with me , most sincerely for their cooperation and for all the time they have devoted to this .
Under subheadings 1a and 3b , we want to distribute all the money to the budget lines that are important to us , and not leave any margin .
It was quite clear to the Committee on Budgets that we would not be able to find the necessary money in the budget lines under Heading 4 , and so we created what is known as an 'asterisk amendment' , containing EUR 250 million for food aid , 40 million for Kosovo , 80 million for Palestine and 20 million for Afghanistan .
We do understand that , because you feel the pinch , but this year we wanted - and we will see this in the vote tomorrow - to lay down conditions for releasing the reserve that you will be in a position to meet quite independently .
The Muslim-Croat Federation could set an example .
Nonetheless , the EU clutched at this straw and signed the agreement , so that other important political projects in the country could finally be pushed ahead .
We should give the others a red card now and then .
We believe that proper commemoration of the victims depends on our knowing about this tragedy , this massive crime on the part of the Soviet regime .
Anyone who does not consider the other socialist republics of the Soviet Union and the other various nationalities at the same time is guilty of racism and of contempt for the suffering of all those affected .
We must do everything so that hunger is eradicated like the plague . rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , after this very moving issue , we now move on to more technical matters .
Airport charges should have a stronger cost reference in future , must be substantiated by transparent calculations and must refer to the agreed level of service .
This report follows on , to a certain extent , from the report which I produced for the European Parliament at the same point two years ago .
I know how enthusiastic everyone is about this .
I hope that we will have a majority in favour of this .
Bands of uniformed men are roaming the country , some of which refer to themselves as the 'official army ' and others the 'private army ' .
I would like to remind you of the differences in the development of competitiveness in the Euro Zone , because the secret is that , although we have a central monetary policy , we have local budgetary and financial policies .
We were proud of him , and I would just like to say : do not let the negative discussions discourage you from continuing this very successful work .
The European Economic and Monetary Union is a stable area with clear accession criteria , and this should not be watered down .
In our opinion , we need an investment offensive to renew public infrastructure and to improve the lives of socially disadvantaged groups in Europe .
( Applause ) on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , it is indeed true that , 50 years after the Treaties of Rome were concluded , we have made little progress regarding equality for women in the labour market .
Over time , however , it has emerged that - as you quite rightly said , Commissioner - that the currently available instrument makes it extremely difficult , if not downright impossible , to respond appropriately to large-scale crises at EU level .
I expect the Commission to act with greater commitment on the current applications , and to keep an eye on what the money is being spent on , in order to ensure that disasters do not recur , and to enable investments can really be in harmony with nature .
With the same cautious optimism , we take the view that we must manage , in the trilogue negotiations , not just to clarify the future framework conditions for CCS but also to lay solid foundations for funding the vital preliminary trial facilities . draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have made some progress towards free agricultural markets , both in terms of opening up market regulations and the social and economic cushioning of European policies .
There are just a few points I would like to make .
If the Irish had voted sensibly , we would have had a say on agricultural issues and on agricultural finances as of 1 January 2009 .
What you propose would be a bit like the automobile industry reducing or abolishing the Christmas break and organising an extra shift to increase the stockpile of cars .
We must prevent , writes Mr Ackermann , the public sector from taking a permanently larger role in the international financial system .
You actually seem really rather clever . '
You pointed out that I might have been wrong about when the Commission will be ready .
Even though the shadow rapporteurs from the other Groups are not present this evening , I would still like to take this opportunity to thank you for the constructive cooperation .
I would like to thank you for listening and for the successful cooperation . rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks for the constructive comments at the end , and above all for the constructive cooperation .
