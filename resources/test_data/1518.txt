as quick , effective agreements .
Madam President , honourable Members , Commissioner , Mr Peterle , I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to discuss the EU 's links with Tajikistan and , in particular , the importance we place on laying a new foundation for our relations with the country by entering into a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement .
If so , it would send a clear signal that we are opening a new chapter in our relations between the European Union and Tajikistan .
Consequently , we have a great interest in supporting Tajikistan , both for its own sake and in order to solve our common problems .
If we seriously want to get to grips with the issues that I mentioned , we need to create a suitable framework for our future relations .
The arrangements for political dialogue and practical cooperation with Tajikistan must be improved so as to better reflect the shared challenges faced by the region .
We are well aware that this is no easy task .
Developments are often very worrying .
We are also very worried about the extensive corruption that is to be found in the country .
The country is vulnerable to radical movements and international organised crime .
Tajikistan has demonstrated an open , constructive attitude to discussions on our shared challenges .
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides us with a framework within which we can develop our bilateral relations further and thereby contribute to the overall goals of our strategy for the whole of Central Asia .
Mr Peterle deals with all this very systematically in his report .
That is why it is so useful , as the Commissioner has said , that we have this dialogue on human rights .
Mrs Hautala brought up the matter of water .
Mr Zemke mentioned the matter of border management .
I am sure that the Commission will return to this later .
To sum up , there are many difficult and complex problems in Tajikistan and throughout the region .
It will provide us with a better tool to use in our work on improving stability and resolving these problems and with which to conduct an active dialogue with the country on human rights and democracy .
It shows how important we all believe it to be that the people of the Western Balkans are brought closer to the European Union .
That is the real benefit of this initiative .
Visa facilitation was introduced back in January 2008 , linked to commitments in the areas to be addressed .
Continued isolation , on the other hand , would lead to a feeling of exclusion and prevent exchanges of ideas and , in the worst case , could foster narrow-minded nationalism .
Consequently , the Commission 's proposal that was submitted on 15 July is very much to be welcomed .
The appraisal of Serbia and Montenegro is continuing and we hope that by this autumn , we will have confirmation from the Commission that all the conditions are met , so that we can take the next step .
I know that that is a matter of concern to many in this House .
Where Kosovo is concerned , the Commission 's proposal involves no change .
The Council has only just begun its discussions on the Commission 's proposal , but the Presidency will work hard to ensure that we can reach agreement as soon as possible .
Our Union is based on various principles and values that all the Member States are expected to support .
We cannot insist on and stand up for respect for human rights in other countries if we cannot uphold these fundamental principles ourselves within the EU.
There is legislation at Community level to safeguard this area .
We welcome this initiative and hope it will be adopted before long .
However , we must not forget that the law has not yet entered into force .
Compatibility between national legislation and the treaties is not a matter for the Council , nor is it a matter for the Agency for Fundamental Rights .
Where Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community is concerned , the Council would be deeply concerned if it were to find cases of discrimination on the grounds of gender , race , ethnic origin , religion , disability , age or sexual orientation .
I can assure Members that the matter of discrimination against LGBT people is on the Swedish Presidency 's agenda .
In formal terms , however , this must be dealt with within the legal and institutional frameworks .
I would say it is about the equal value of all people .
That must also apply to all the individual Member States .
I will not even count how many human rights it violates .
Respect for human rights , tolerance , the inviolability of the individual and the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of - among other things - sexual orientation are fundamental values of the European project and must remain so .
The Member States have a duty to respect both these values and the actual laws that apply in these areas within the EU.
I am extremely pleased that the Commission has been so clear about what will happen if , contrary to expectation , the law enters into force in its original form .
The Swedish Presidency aims to maintain the debate on animal welfare and good animal husbandry .
The project is also investigating the best ways to provide feedback to farmers , consumers and other stakeholders .
The results of the conference may be of relevance for the conclusions planned by the Council in response to the Commission 's expected communication on animal welfare labelling .
Madam President , the Swedish Presidency shares the Member 's concern regarding child trafficking for sexual exploitation or for other purposes
