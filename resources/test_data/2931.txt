ever-depleting ozone layer .
Tighter controls on substances destroying the ozone layer is just one element of a broader environmental strategy that is needed to save our planet .
Britain 's Labour Government has been leading the fight to protect our citizens and to clean up our planet .
At Kyoto , Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott managed to secure an agreement to cut global emissions .
Britain is already well on the way to achieving its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % by 2010 .
This target has now been raised to 60-70 % by 2050 .
Strong , coherent action is urgently required at local , national and European levels to clean up our air , land and sea .
Our citizens want to see concrete action , not just hot air from politicians .
This is our chance to continue our battle for a safer , cleaner world .
Report McKenna ( A5-0148/2000 )
Mr President , I raised this point of order last month and I now have to raise it again .
Each of the questions is dated , presumably with the date when they were submitted , yet they are completely out of order .
The first was submitted on 16 May , the second on 4 May , the third on 24 May , the fourth on 11 May and the fifth on 24 May .
Is there any rule regulating how they are put in order , or some secret method of getting your question to the top of the list ?
People are greatly concerned at what they hear about the present situation in Georgia .
Democratic rights , employment rights , religious rights are all under very severe pressure .
I welcome what he has said and the amount of money that has been given through the EU to Georgia but surely the situation as referred to by the previous speaker of the refugees is one very serious problem indeed .
Is there nothing more that he and this Union can do to help this new state ?
I certainly accept that there is a place for social policy in these more extreme situations .
However , there is a risk of taking it too far .
Would the Commissioner not agree that the most important thing for the European economy , in order to provide the social benefits that we would all like to have , is for it to be allowed to develop without millstones round its neck of excessive social commitments and problems ?
If we are to compete in the global economy , as this question asks , there should be a measured level of social support and policy and not an extreme binding of our businesses and our economies by social requirements .
Question No 34 by (H-0507/00 ) : Subject : Implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme On 11 October last year , Commissioners Schreyer and Busquin promised in separate letters to provide regular information to the European Parliament on the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme .
This was a welcome step .
However , only one further item of correspondence has been received .
On a related subject , provision has been made for a mid term review of the Fifth Framework Programme .
However , if this review is not undertaken by the end of 2000 , it will lose much of its value .
Could the Commission reaffirm its commitment to provide information on the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme ?
Does the Commission believe it is still worthwhile completing outstanding projects from the Third and Fourth Framework Programmes ?
Could the Commission say when it is likely to produce a mid-term review of the Fifth Framework programme ?
Questions to Mr Liikanen I should like to thank the Commissioner for that answer because I share his view that Parliament should be involved in the evaluation of problems relating to any execution of the Fifth Framework Programme or any previous programme as well .
We need to have a framework for the future as to how we operate because I am concerned about the financial burden of the previous framework programmes .
Whilst I accept the need for the continuation of the Fourth Framework Programme , I find it a bit odd that six years later we are still dealing with payments that need to be settled for the Third Framework Programme .
Has the Commission given thought to a policy of cancelling all commitments after two or three years if they have not paid ?
I know from my Committee on Budgets role that Commissioner Patten has been pursuing various methods of removing some of the huge backlog of outstanding payments within the field of external relations .
Does the Commission believe that these policies could be applied to the research budget ?
Finally , how does the Commission propose to improve the implementation of the research budget in the forthcoming Sixth Framework Programme ?
Question No 38 by (H-0477/00 ) : Subject : Defence industries Given the importance of the defence industries as a driving force for technological research and job creation , particularly in SMUs , would the Commission indicate what action it has taken to follow up its previous communication on the future of the European Defence Industry and whether it will be publishing a new communication ?
I thank the Commissioner for his reply .
In the last Commission this was a priority , it was an agenda being driven forward by Commissioner Bangemann , supported by Commissioner van den Broek .
Do I get the impression that this Commission has really lost interest in pursuing this initiative and that the Commission as a whole would prefer not to take this forward ?
It seems to me ironic , at a time when we are reconsidering our defence capacity , that we seem to have lost impetus on the restructuring of the defence industry .
