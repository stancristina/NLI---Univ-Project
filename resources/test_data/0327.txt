rights of ethnic minorities and to practice policies of universal human rights .
We have to demand the highest standards of ourselves .
It will not be easy to implement this directive and I am not referring to the votes .
It requires us to call into question the workings of all our institutions , including longstanding well-respected ones , and our own practices .
That will not be easy or painless .
In the UK we are gradually admitting to the institutional racism we practice and starting to examine the core values of our institutions .
That cannot be done unless the individuals within them examine their own beliefs and actions .
That is why the amendments about training , monitoring and implementation are so important in this directive .
Mr President it is a measure of the effectiveness and importance of this legislation that even in the midst of a comprehensive series of reforms of race relations legislation in my own country , we have a situation where further improvements can be made .
I was going to make a speech of the normal variety , but having heard some of the responses across the House , I want to change what I was going to say , which is more in sorrow than in anger .
This House should recognise and change its tone on what it sees as Article 13 .
Of all the speakers , Mrs Diamantopoulou made the very effective point that words can be cheap in the question of anti-racism .
Posturing is easy .
Motivations are many and varied .
My friend , Mr Sylla , and I are concerned about two important things .
One is that we create a level playing field through Article 13 .
The burden of proof , the ability for organisations to take cases on behalf of individuals who have been harassed or discriminated against - all of these laws do not create an advantage for the majority of society .
They create the opportunity for people of talent and ability to release their talents and abilities to enrich what we have in Europe to create wealth , to create the culture and diversity of Europe , not to suffer disadvantage for small - and medium-sized enterprises or anyone else .
We must start talking positively about these proposals mainly because the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency , many who have created this report , many of my colleagues who have worked hard on their opinions , have responded in the way that we have because we understand that this legislation is not about victims , it is about enriching EU countries .
Many of those EU countries represented in this House do not pick and choose which race-relation legislation they have - they have none , many of them .
We have some - we can improve ours .
It is now an opportunity , a symbolic opportunity and an important practical opportunity for this House to make an historic judgement , to vote in full during a presidency which has helped us bring forward a law which I believe will enrich this House and that we , in time , will be very proud of .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt for their excellent work and the Commission for their proposals .
It is essential that we take advantage of the opportunity that is represented in the Commission 's proposals on the whole of Article 13 .
The time is right to do so .
In recent years we have witnessed across Europe a steady rise in racist crime , violence , discrimination and , it pains me to say , 'political rhetoric ' which plays on racial discrimination .
I feel a heightened sense of urgency as we contemplate and embark upon the enlargement process .
That is why this debate is so important because it strikes at the heart of how we define Europe and ourselves as Europeans .
We are more than a trading block .
We are a group of nations based on a set of values - a set of ideals which must be incorporated and reinforced in all that we do .
I hope that this approach will be addressed when we look at the situation effecting all minorities .
The price if we do not is a Europe falling far short of its true potential .
That is why this directive and the Article 13 package , as a whole , are so significant .
They demonstrate that the Member States , Parliament and the Commission are serious about the long-term eradication of discrimination and racism .
It is not perfect .
It does not fulfil my every ambition , yet it represents a start to a fight against racism in Europe , in our nations , our regions and , more importantly , in our communities .
One day I hope to be standing in this Chamber debating directives which will aim to eradicate discrimination specifically based on , for example , disability , age and sexual orientation .
These current steps must be applauded but there is still a long way to go .
Finally , the spectacle of a white middle-class British male Tory giving a lecture on discrimination and the effects of discrimination would be laughable if it was not so damning and lamentable .
( Applause ) .
Ultimately , discrimination kills and it blights the souls of those who practice it and those who encourage it .
Mr President , we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms .
However , I do not believe extending EU competence to this area is either necessary or useful to its cause .
New laws will not change the hearts and minds of the people of Europe .
What we need is education , time and confidence building in a spirit of cooperation between the various ethnic communities
