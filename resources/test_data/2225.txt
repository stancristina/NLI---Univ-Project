I would like to start by thanking Mr Moreira da Silva and Mr Maaten for their kind words concerning cooperation between the institutions of the EU in Johannesburg .
As you know , the EU-China Summit is being held in Copenhagen today , and consequently he is unable to be here .
I have been informed that in fact there was daily consultation with the candidate countries .
I , too , consider this to be of great importance .
She says that nothing about women and health was mentioned in the declaration , but I would like to draw attention to the fact that it was stated in very concrete terms that environmental threats to health are to be reduced .
So there is something included in that .
I have noted it .
Many people have touched on the issue of EU agricultural policy and there is not much that I want to add to this .
I would like to mention again that at the ASEM Summits last week and this week a decision was made at the request of the Chinese to hold a preparatory conference on agricultural policy in Beijing , so that the European and Asian countries can be as well equipped as possible for the summit in Canc√∫n .
At any event there will be opportunity to continue this dialogue with a number of other countries .
I have noted the literary examples that have been given : Hans Christian Andersen 's ' The Emperor 's New Clothes ' and Voltaire 's Pangloss who , whatever happens in ' Candide ' , thinks that all is for the best .
This is very amusing and we should always bear it in mind since , after all , Andersen and Voltaire had a keen sense of the human urge to forget the cares of the world when it suits us .
However , I think that at the end of my contribution I should be allowed to point out that the institutions of the EU did good work in Johannesburg .
New goals were set and existing goals were tightened up .
Now it is a matter of keeping each other to them , of leading from the front and thereby being justified in making others adhere to these objectives .
Now it is a matter of follow-up .
Naturally , it is a pleasure to address the European Parliament on the EU 's progress within the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
Both our own populations and third countries expect the EU to be able to help to solve conflicts and calm tensions around the world .
In my statement here I will concentrate on the following topics : Afghanistan , the fight against terrorism , the Middle East , Iraq , India , Pakistan , Russia and Africa .
As far as the ICC is concerned , I refer to my other statement .
As mentioned , I will start with Afghanistan .
Far more refugees and internally displaced persons than expected have returned home , and that shows that there is hope for the future of their country .
The recent assassination attempt on President Karzai and other terrorist attacks are evidence of the serious security problems .
The role of the central government must therefore be strengthened and the influence of the warlords reduced .
The Afghan institutions and basic infrastructure must be built up again .
The remaining refugees and displaced persons must be allowed to return , and we must support their reintegration .
We urgently call upon the international community , including in particular Afghanistan 's neighbours , to continue to support a further stabilisation of Afghanistan .
The UN will play a very central role here through the UN special representative Mr Brahimi .
We promised to do so last week during a special debate at the UN.
We expect the EU Member States involved to continue contributing to the ISAF troops .
We are implementing the European action plan to combat terrorism as planned .
Follow-up by the EU to date has focused on the EU 's internal measures , in which considerable progress has been made towards implementation .
This work will naturally be continued under the Danish Presidency .
In the Seville declaration , the European Council defined the Common Foreign and Security Policy 's contribution to the fight against terrorism , including the contribution of the security and defence policy .
As a follow-up to this , on 22 July the Council approved a number of decisions with a view to implementing the Seville declaration .
These included a revision of the dimensions relating to combating terrorism through the links with third countries , including such links in the form of conventions and specific measures that can help third countries to meet their obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373 .
A number of concrete steps have already been taken .
We have earmarked the non-proliferation and disarmament policy for renewed consideration as part of the global fight against terrorism .
On 15 April 2002 , the Council adopted as many as 42 concrete measures that will help to strengthen multilateral instruments , export controls , cooperation and political dialogue .
This logically leads me on to Iraq .
We agree with President Bush on this point , which he emphasised in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly recently .
The country must comply with these obligations immediately .
The EU is firmly resolved to support the United Nations ' continued efforts in this respect .
Among other things , the Security Council has demanded that Iraq give the UN weapons inspectors unconditional and unfettered access and ensure that the country 's authorities cooperate to the extent required .
On 16 September the Iraqi Government notified the Secretary-General of the UN that it accepted the return of the weapons inspectors .
The Presidency agrees with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the Security Council must comply with its responsibilities , should Iraq
