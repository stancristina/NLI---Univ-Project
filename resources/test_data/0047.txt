.
In this way , we should also be showing , especially to today ' s young people , that we believe in an EU that is able to change in order to live up to its own ideals .
Allow me to say a few words about Estonia , that fascinating little country on the Baltic .
I addressed the subject of security policy in my report .
Those of us in the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats share their analysis and support them in this .
Finally , a few words about minorities , mainly a large proportion of Russian speakers in the case of Estonia .
However , that is not enough .
In this respect too , Estonia is on the right road .
I hope that , in just a few years ' time , our new friends and colleagues will be able to sit down here with us in the Chamber instead of just listening from the gallery .
Great progress is being made , and I am delighted that the Belgian presidency has such lofty ambitions .
Integration is a mutual process that requires efforts on the part both of ourselves and of the future Member States .
Mr President , investments in roads , railways and other forms of infrastructure are among the most important that can be made in the countries of the old Central and Eastern Europe .
Anyone who takes a bird ' s eye view of Europe can see very clearly where the old borders between East and West run .
Poland is far and away the largest of the candidate countries and , in the last ten years , it has invested extensively in improvements in roads and railways .
North-South transport would obtain a wider range of possible transit routes .
It is therefore incredibly important that the Commission should continue with this work .
Nor has my own country been spared .
The organisational form is something to which you will have to attend .
Allow me to say that your fellow Commissioner , Mr Liikanen , has , in the same way as yourself today , Mr Nielson , given positive answers to questions raised by myself and a number of fellow MEPs here in the European Parliament .
Many thanks to the Commissioner for his answer .
I therefore think that it remains very difficult to justify making such demands , entailing large additional costs for car owners .
Commissioner , I too want to begin by offering my congratulations on what happened in Bonn .
Many of us went there with misgivings about the likely result of the conference .
I am talking here not only about what happened at the Bonn conference itself but also about the sound preparatory work which , for example , the Commissioner carried out by travelling around a number of countries to try to convince them of the importance of the Kyoto Protocol .
There is no going back now .
It sounds hopeful when the Commissioner now promises that we shall have a ratification proposal before the end of the year and that the intention is to return with communications and proposals on trading in emissions rights .
That also applies to sinks .
It would be all to the good if more countries were to follow that example .
Allow me , finally , to thank the Commissioner and the Presidency for the sound work they have done .
ECHELON proved to be less extensive than we had believed , and the issue has now been somewhat defused .
There is no proof that the United States has damaged global competitiveness by spreading information about companies .
Obviously , cooperation at EU level on this issue involves having national control stations in accordance with the network proposed .
The most important conclusion may appear simple : ECHELON does in fact exist .
That is why it was good that the rapporteur should have especially emphasised those issues in his presentation .
As was also pointed out , management interests are obviously very important , but these are not the whole story .
The British journalist Duncan Campbell even believes that ECHELON is used to intercept communications from Amnesty and the Red Cross .
My second remark concerns encryption .
The institutions of the EU must be able to act jointly on this issue .
Mr President , we are all of us affected on a daily basis by the risks presented by the new computer-related crimes .
Traditional methods of combating these crimes are inadequate , even if on-line crime is just as criminal as off-line crime .
We seek common definitions for solving conflicts of competence , as well as the closer harmonisation of criminal law and the law of procedure and the mutual recognition of preliminary investigation procedures .
The Committee also demands a ban on such invasions of privacy , except in those cases in which the measure fulfils all the following requirements : it is necessary , has proper justification , is the only possible solution , is proportionate to the crime , is limited in time and has been decided upon in the courts .
In this forum , industry and legal authorities , together with consumers , will be able to create a code of conduct and develop early warning and crisis management systems , and it will be possible to develop preventive technology and protective measures and to make these more widely available .
Finally , a big and heartfelt thank you to everyone who has assisted in the preparation of this report .
The first is aimed at adding the word 'terrorism ' , since the committee unanimously adopted this as an oral amendment which has since in some way been lost from the text submitted to plenary .
The term we use in Swedish , 'm√§rkning ' , is tricky to translate .
