oil tankers which come to our ports should become double hull tankers , instead of the single hull ones which present a greater risk of pollution in the event of accidents .
In conclusion , it is not just a matter of the Erika disaster and what has been done up till now , but rather of reaching conclusions so that we can prevent the recurrence of this type of disaster .
It is no accident , Commissioner , that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed , those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of cases , do not have any other resources .
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .
I trust that these measures will , in a few months , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st Century pirates , who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea .
In fact , I believe that things have been done by the Commission , but there is still more to do .
Flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .
According to the information which the Commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .
We have set a figure of USD 180 million ; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers .
In fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .
However , I can assure you that we do not , with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House .
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .
Therefore , Commissioner , we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme , and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat , but not with this Parliament , which expects profound and daring changes .
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission , we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them .
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .
In my judgement , this constitutes a guarantee to both sides , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment .
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region , as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations , will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process .
Furthermore , they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard " to verify the progress made in this area at Community level , but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States .
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out .
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union .
This is a task which all MEPs , the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature : the creation , as has been said already , of an area of freedom , security and justice .
Finally , in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship .
Personally , I am pleased with some of the replies , for example , in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention , which we hope will be reviewed , and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities .
What measures does the Council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?
I will have to repeat these arguments , modestly , in this intervention , because the same issue has arisen once again .
However , the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and , therefore , we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements .
