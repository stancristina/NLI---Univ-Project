That is something we can only condemn in the European Parliament .
The Commission must carry out a rapid expansion of its humanitarian aid , and at the same time develop a more long-term strategy to be able to prevent similar situations from arising in future .
However , when the nuclear power stations have been built there will be no distribution network to distribute the electricity .
Madam President , I agree with the speakers who find that not an awful lot has happened with regard to human rights in China .
At the same time I must admit that I was given something to think about the other day when Professor Tommy Koh , who is the director of the Asia-Europe Foundation in Singapore , was here in the European Parliament and commented on our way of dealing with China .
We should criticize China , but we should still think about how we should improve our way of dealing with the Chinese so that we also bring about better human rights in China .
Peaceful demonstrations are crushed by an excess of police violence .
It would be wonderful if our resolution led to results now .
Mr President , of course , one can always question how often we should criticize a particular country and take it up in resolutions .
I am inclined to think that there has been a tendency in this Parliament to treat the Algerian Government as the only player capable of settling the matter , while in reality it might be the case that we have two players in Algeria who are both as bad as each other .
Mr President , the construction of the tunnel through Hallandsåsen in southern Sweden is a major environmental scandal which I would not have thought possible in Sweden in 1997 .
A full 1 , 004 tons of this sealing agent has been pumped into the mountain .
How many people who suffer from mysterious numbness and sensations in their hands and legs , etcetera , have been poisoned by Acryl amide ?
Nobody knows .
The Commission must therefore ensure that there is a proper investigation into whether the environmental impact assessment has been followed for this TEN project .
Construction was then halted and the water supply was checked .
But Acryl amide , which is contained in the sealing agent Rhoca-Gil , which is sold and distributed by the French chemicals company , is not only used in tunnels but also , amongst other places , in various mines .
We do not yet know the extent of their injuries .
In addition , an independent committee is to investigate the matter .
It is in Sweden that we must deal with the damage which has been caused .
The results can now be seen in a contaminated external environment and workers who have suffered injury to their nervous systems .
However , that was not applicable in this case , since the project was decided long before Sweden joined the EU.
A number of questions remain unanswered .
Sweden 's Social Democratic government has for the past three years , since Sweden 's entry into the Union , delayed environmental legislation and thus the implementation of three EU directives and the environmental impact assessment .
The tunnel through Hallandsåsen is intended to become the largest time-saving measure on a very long stretch of railway .
But essential savings , even in the state budget must never lead to a reduction of environmental controls .
I support the resolution , and I am also pleased that EU opponents from Sweden in this Parliament are now putting their trust in the EU 's institutions .
People may also have been seriously injured .
The project was allowed to proceed much too far before the risks to the environment were taken into consideration .
Mr President , this is not a point of order .
I myself belong to the younger generation which has grown up with IT , the Internet and other audio-visual services .
We must also say that there are a number of disadvantages with the new technology .
It does little good for us to discuss it here in the European Parliament or in the European Commission .
I myself have , in my capacity as a politician , come into contact with people and citizens who I would perhaps never have come into contact with otherwise , but who now sit in front of their computers and can react quickly when I have been on TV or in a newspaper interview and ask further questions .
These are people from whom I might otherwise never hear .
It also involves , unfortunately , freedom for , for example , neo-Nazis who spread and exchange their despicable , poisonous myths , and paedophiles who can exchange information in just a few seconds .
Madam President , firstly I hope you can correct an earlier decision not to accept a vote from me because I was not here .
These exports have only one cause , the existence of export subsidies for this trade .
For this reason I am going to vote for Amendments Nos 11 and 12 .
Madam President , allow me to first say that this is a most excellent report , but our group still cannot vote in favour of it .
We then go and buy up that overproduction and in a hungry world we then destroy the fruit .
The 80 % being discussed is only in relation to the average production of this 2 % of fields which we are now going to chop down .
Let me say that this is going to fail .
Mr President , this is a directive which means and shows that the EU can bring advances for men and women in Europe .
I would like to
