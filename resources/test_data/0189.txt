integrated land conservation .
I also welcome the articles highlighting the need for the activities aimed at raising awareness and training the parties involved to keep pace with research on the ground , and therefore documentation and mapping .
Article 32 , on the other hand , refers to the removal of administrative barriers , particularly for border regions , which have specific needs .
The majority of our citizens cannot be won over by the idea of a federal , democratic and peaceful union , based on thoroughly disquieting examples like the United States , China or India .
That is why we must not think of the Union merely as a bureaucracy divorced from the people and an institution concerned only with laying down rules about countless petty issues .
Guantánamo is a place outside the law , where terrorists or suspected terrorists are detained and thus kept out of reach of normal judicial process .
I shall conclude by saying that the idea of using any means possible to defeat terrorism is a mistake .
We have tried to state that we must be more determined in regarding transport efficiency as the nucleus of a strategy to integrate our policies on competitiveness , sustainability and energy security .
The report proposes that the energy efficiency goals be incorporated into other sectoral policies , such as tax , transport or cohesion policy .
As you know , last December the Commission put forward a general initiative to promote the sharing of information on criminal convictions .
It is a general provision that does not specifically deal with prohibition measures precisely for those found guilty of sex acts involving children .
I am also pleased that this directive is coming to a conclusion , because it contains a number of things that should now make Parliament happy to adopt it .
I would just add a couple of comments : in recent months , problems associated above all with discrimination in the areas of pay , access and training and also indirect discrimination have been highlighted in all the countries of the Union , including those that have historically been considered the most advanced in terms of women’s policies .
The first point concerns the age-old evil of sexual violence at times of war .
I think that the presence of women in this area is what our world can offer in terms of modernity and democracy : a really new , contemporary contribution .     – Mr President , I too congratulate the rapporteur on producing a really good report .
That is what needs to be done , but it is not yet happening , and so we are calling for quotas to ensure that women take part in all peace negotiation processes .     – Mr President , regarding the vote on the issue of paediatric medicines , I should just like to point out that , after the six-month patent extension granted to the multinational drug companies at first reading , I feel that extending the transition period during which that additional protection certificate can be applied for from two years to five years is really going too far .
We are facing a medium- and long-term problem .
Subsequently we contacted the German authorities , so as to obtain their support for prevention and information campaigns in Germany .
I can tell you – without going into details , given the time pressures – that this document confirms the hypothesis that there is an increase in forced prostitution and trafficking in conjunction with the world football championships .
In addition , instructions have been issued at our request concerning the need to protect victims of sexual exploitation , with a view to the application of the special assistance programmes .
We have encouraged the Member States to cooperate to a greater extent with these two organisations .
The aim of the first approach must be to break up the vicious triangle linking victims , traffickers and clients .
Europe is not present at the World Cup championship .
We have proposed certain effective instruments , such as the institution of a European telephone hot line .
If we allow the problem to be ignored , we shall be talking not of sexual liberation but of criminal oppression .
Precisely for this reason , as I have already disclosed , we shall organise a workshop immediately after the World Cup .
In the course of this workshop we shall bring together all the experiences of this month and draw conclusions to be included in a document that will serve for all other sporting events of this type , and also for cultural and political events .
Since this is a medium-term measure , I have instructed my office to look into a legally viable formula that would also allow us to allocate funding for young women who are victims of sexual exploitation .
These regulations must be adopted by the Member States ; they keep the issues of people-trafficking and immigration completely separate .
I can also tell you that , although the police forces ’ data are difficult to explain , hundreds of checks have been carried out in recent months – not only in Germany but also in many transit countries , such as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic .
In conclusion , I reaffirm the need to strike at the root of these cases .
In my view , there is no need for an excessively large bureaucracy to be able to respond effectively to such problems ; what is rather needed is the capacity to supply examples and good practice aimed at guaranteeing the highest possible levels of prevention and of capacity for intervention .
Yet France and the Netherlands had already said ‘no’ in their referendums .
The seventh framework programme contains important innovations , such as the European Research Council , which has already been mentioned
