the President of the European Parliament that as well as the answer to Mrs García-Orcoyen' s question , the joint answer to Questions No 92 from Mr Agag Longo and No 94 from Mrs Avilés Perea was also leaked .
Once this person has received the answer he can do what he likes with it , and can therefore give it to the media , and what is more , I would say that it is his duty to do so .
Madam President , I am not going to raise a point of order , under Rule 141 of the Rules of Procedure , because , as you said , we leave this until the end of the debate , but I do want to speak under Rule 122 due to personal allusions .
Mr President , our Group fully supports the proposal .
First of all in order to arrive at this code of conduct , then in order that it should be effective .
Parliament must therefore wish the United Nations Conference in July to be a success .
Montaigne said that most of the ills of the world resulted from 'ânerie ' , a word which is untranslatable into Spanish , but which is related to 'ass ' .
We have set a timetable : 2005 , and our fellow Members ' proposals , I believe , move in the right direction .
They support the Commission ' s proposals , they highlight the need to meet the timetable and , at the same time , they offer and indicate specific aspects .
I am not going to get involved in the arguments for and against animal experimentation , which at this stage we all know and which , undoubtedly , together with the ban on sales and marketing , are the focus of this seventh amendment of the directive .
I therefore fully support the idea of banning experimentation on animals and I agree with the rapporteur that a date should be set in order to speed up this process .
This EUR 6 billion can be rebudgeted , but we must remember that , given the new rules of the Structural Funds , this is the last time we will be able to operate in this way .
The other institutions do not agree .
The question of principle is the profile of spending .
We hope that the cooperation with the rapporteur continues at first reading .
The consensus proposal presented by the Commission satisfies the two concerns of both budgetary authorities : firstly , it does not raise the overall figure for appropriations until the end of the programming period , as the Council wants , bound as it is by the budgetary limitations of the Member States ; and , secondly , it transfers most of the commitment appropriations until the end of the period , which favours compliance with the Berlin agreements , which is what this Parliament demanded .
But what we can never deny is the Commission ' s capacity for mediation and compromise in order to produce reasonable proposals .
Although immigration , the repercussions of enlargement on agricultural spending , the animal health crisis and consumer protection generate disquiet and concern throughout the Union , the sectoral problems must also be responded to within these budgetary guidelines .
The Council continues to believe that revenues are its exclusive prerogative and does not allow any significant progress in relation to Parliament ' s participation .
The result will possibly be the same as always : they will ignore us .
The likelihood of an agreement is all but confirmed , but it must be corroborated by the Council this afternoon .
It is unacceptable that in this debate , in which we are going to talk about the Council , that that very Council is not represented .
I agree with the report , which is serious , demanding and tough , and I also agree with the final section in which it discharges the budget , because , as has been said here from many different quarters , the Commission is making great efforts to improve things .
I interpret your words as self-criticism on the part of the Commission .
The first two years of the euro have led to the consolidation of good economic results and substantial advances .
And I say it is possible because we do not rule out the idea that , if new factors arise which suggest the need for a new communication , then this would be done next October .
With regard to consumers , the eurobarometer for January demonstrates the consumers ' vision of the euro , and we must acknowledge that in some cases it is relatively confused .
The banks are cooperating well ; they are carrying out changes in advance in their relations with their clients ; the adaptation of automatic cash dispensers in 2002 will probably be very rapid , and even immediate in the majority of Member States ; in general , they will issue notes of low value and will thereby contribute to alleviating the problems of returning change which may arise in commercial operations .
Another measure , in agreement with consumers and businesspeople , is to start to pay a part of salaries , at the end of the year , with 'kits ' of euro coins , which is a possibility .
Mr President , I would say to Mrs Torres Marques that my obligation is not to be anxious .
I am not yet able to offer you a definitive solution .
There are references to each of the national programmes , including the communication issues , even the web pages relating to each Member State and the present communication informs us of exactly the action which each of the Member States has planned .
Campaigns have not only been carried out in accordance with calendar years
