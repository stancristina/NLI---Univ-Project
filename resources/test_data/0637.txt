I cannot help feeling indignant at what I heard him say , and the best interpretation I could put on the Member 's words is that it was a case of vice paying tribute to virtue .
I cannot listen to what the Member said without protesting , because in fact what he said is the opposite of what he actually means .
A transitional charter had been laid down , however , as had an undertaking to restore democracy in Guinea-Bissau , that small and almost unknown country in the Gulf of Guinea .
It is becoming increasingly obvious that an in-depth review of the pact’s objectives and criteria is required if monetary and budgetary policies are to contribute to economic growth and employment .
They make the markets more dynamic , help undertakings to restructure and encourage economies to grow .
Extreme caution is needed , therefore , when adopting European Union legislation with a view to substantially reducing competition ( such laws exist in other legislative systems , in particular in the United States ) .
I would also like to emphasise how much he will be missed in this Parliament , in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , and in the Committee on Fisheries .
I wish I could be as reserved as Commissioner Fischler , who to all intents and purposes confined himself to expressing his agreement with the report , which he felt endorsed the content of the Commission communication .
This fleet must not be considered as belonging to Portugal , or to Spain , or to France : rather , it should be understood to be a European Union fleet , since the Commission is our only spokesperson , our only representative in these international relationships .
For these reasons , we should give this report our full support .
While coherence is certainly needed between the common fisheries policy and development policy , it should not be forgotten that these agreements are essentially commercial in nature : though they should take the development angle into account , the funding for these fishing agreements should come from the fisheries sector , while funding for development policies should derive from elsewhere in the Community budget – from increased amounts for cooperation and development , to be more precise .
The inalienable right of innocent Israeli communities to defend themselves and the natural desire of Palestinians freely to determine their own future are , of course , among those arguments .
It is absolutely crucial to begin moving forward again following the logic of give-and-take , expecting each party to honour its commitments at every stage .
Unlike some of the honourable Members who have spoken here , our group doubts very much indeed that the solution is to send a military force made up of armed units from a coalition of countries to intervene in the area .
As we have reiterated on many occasions , there is no such thing as good terrorism , just as there is no such thing as bad terrorism .
It has persisted in the military occupation , in destroying infrastructure , housing and other installations , in carrying out targeted killings , and in holding more than 7 000 Palestinian prisoners , almost 340 of whom are children , in Israeli jails .
The Commission and the Council must table an initiative within the UN , demanding that the UN negotiations be concluded , recognising the Palestinians ’ right to dignity and to their own independent state , and sending international observers and a UN-backed peacekeeping force to intervene .     Speed limitation on-board systems for vehicles transporting passengers and goods have proved very useful in raising road safety standards , reducing the seriousness of injuries sustained as a result of accidents and reducing levels of air pollution and fuel consumption .
It will help restore productive potential in the affected areas .
We would like to emphasise , nonetheless , that this amount falls far short of what is needed , given the scale of the tragedy .
I welcome the European Parliament’s display of solidarity , its support for Portugal and the negotiating skills of the Portuguese Government , in particular those of the Secretary of State for European Affairs , Dr Carlos Costa Neves .
The amount of aid is at odds with the scale of the tragedy , and this raises the issue of assessing and revising the current criteria for mobilising the Solidarity Fund .     .
I would like to join the Secretary of State , Mr Costa Neves , in sincerely thanking the European Commission and the European Parliament for their speedy and efficient processing of Portugal’s application for Solidarity Fund assistance .
Decentralising the financial management of such assistance is of the utmost importance , since , as we know , elected local authorities are closest to the disaster and feel it most .
The amount now approved , however , is clearly insufficient given the costs of the direct damages , more than EUR 1.3 billion , and , in particular , given the total costs of the eligible damages , around EUR 104.3 million .
On 4 August 2003 , following the tragic summer fires in Portugal , the Portuguese authorities announced their intention to submit to the Commission a request for mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund .
The draft agreement also addresses the issue of better transposition of Community law into national law , whereby the institutions undertake to ensure that all directives include a legally-binding time limit for their transposition that is as short as possible .
We therefore voted against the resolution .     . – The trend towards increasing concentration and centralisation of capital is inherent to the capitalist system and is driven by the primacy of competition and the growing liberalisation and internationalisation of capital .
The rapporteur wants to go even further .
Since the rapporteur succeeded in introducing both these concerns , I voted in favour of the
