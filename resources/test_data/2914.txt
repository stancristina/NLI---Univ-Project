He brought forward some good proposals on baby food and the labelling of maize and soya .
It then took the Council eight and a half years to reach agreement on a common position .
Anyway , we are scarcely going to reduce world hunger and feed the starving masses by irradiating frogs legs , prawns , shrimps , mussels and so forth .
And does the print have to be so small ?
I believe that they should be able to tell if a product has been irradiated or not .
We in this Parliament naturally want to take part in the important decision-making process that lies ahead .
To me , it is absolutely incomprehensible , scandalous and brazen that you can say straight to our faces that according to Article 100a we have no further role in the process .
Yet again we are being treated just like stupid children who have to clear up the mess when we do not even have a say in things .
I am referring to Rule 72 , not to the sentence that you referred to , but to Rule 72 , 2c .
Are there any such limits , or are we in that Grimm 's fairy tale , the Emperor 's New Clothes ?
I believe Mr President-in-Office of the Council that we should not lose sight of one thing : if the European Union were able to work out a common position then perhaps the message to Saddam Hussein would be clear , that he cannot play around with the world community .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Vice-President Marín , I believe that each and every one of us in this House feels revulsion for Saddam Hussein and his regime .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say first of all that I find it extraordinarily regrettable that Commissioner Marín has already left the House .
The military option must really remain the undesirable ultima ratio and this only when the following conditions apply : firstly , a military strike must not be a punitive action and must offer the guarantee that all weapons of mass destruction will be eliminated by this strike ; and secondly , the formal discussions in the Security Council must lead to an appropriate resolution .
I quote paragraph 2© of Rule 72 : " An amendment ' , and that is what we are talking about here , ' shall be admissible if it seeks to amend a part of the text of a common position which was not included in - of differs in content from - the proposal submitted in first reading and which does not amount to a substantial change within the meaning of Rule 62 . '
Afterwards , I do not know how we will be able to take part in an honest election campaign in which we keep saying : Europe is working on behalf of consumers .
I cannot tell you how embarrassing that is or how we are going to go into a public election campaign .
The third point is that , as we have said , whilst the circumstances in Burma remain as they are , we will be against Burma being included here , on the basis of the treaty arrangements between the European Union and the ASEAN countries .
This is directed equally at the President of the Council and the representative of the Commission .
We are not a movable object which allows itself to be misused for tactical ruses .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I can subscribe fully to 98 % of your statement .
Fourthly , Albania needs a constitution , particularly for important investment projects .
I would like to ask you to answer these questions , which were before you in good time , in terms as specific as those in which they were asked .
My dear Mr Seal , I do not believe that the safety of passengers has been put at risk in any way by the liberalization of the air transport market .
You all know that the airlines make most profit on the North Atlantic route and not on internal European routes .
Mr Le Rachinel was , as it were , in the fortunate position after careful checking to be able to say : I need only one amendment .
Although on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party I completely support Mr Le Rachinel 's report and thank him for his work , it seems to me personally that the Commission 's proposal for a regulation is not completely logical .
The Member States should thus be obliged to produce the necessary legal and administrative regulations within 12 months of the publication of this directive .
I think it is in fact an important point if we introduce it in the European Economic Area but not in Switzerland .
In the letter there is no more explanation than here in the Minutes .
When it is a matter of domestic animal feeds - for canaries , cats and dogs , - then - as it states in the directive - the percentages must be given , but not in the case of farm animals , to which our directive now refers .
Of great importance in this will be the need to treat the natural fundamentals of life in a manner which is caring and long lasting .
Bio-technology and its application together will fundamentally determine the development of agriculture .
That urgently requires precise labelling of the use of gene technological processes in food .
Therefore it can only support explicitly the announcement by the Commission in its proposed Amendment to Directive 90\220\EEC that it will undertake a broad evaluation of the direct and indirect risks to human health and the environment .
