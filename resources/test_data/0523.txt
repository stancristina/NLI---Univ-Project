Amendment No 19 of the Grossetête report refers to this .
It is essential for us and it is essential for the Council .
That means to say that there would certainly be conciliation , Mrs Doyle , but it is not absolutely certain that we would obtain the results that we amassed today .
Although progress has been made in recent months , new confrontations over the last fortnight have weakened the chances of relaunching the peace process .
These agreements , let us remember , were aimed at bringing the hostilities to an end , ensuring a return to peace and stability and preserving the territorial and ethnic integrity of Côte d'Ivoire .
Compensation should be limited solely to the Natura 2000 areas and exclude non-profit-making activities , such as leisure pastimes , from professional activities .
Not only is it necessary to lance the boil of Eurostat ; it will also be necessary , in future , to make OLAF more independent and more capable of functioning , to improve the transmission of internal information , to treat as a matter of urgency the reform of the Commission ’s accounting system , and to put an end to both the culture of secrecy and the negligent attitude to financial control .
The prime cause is a combination of ethnically-based forces , openly racist ( whether their racism be intertribal , anti-white , or anti-French ) , engaged in dismantling the stability and prosperity that they inherited .
It is a very promising experiment and I do not think that we ought to restrict it too much .
We are counting on that .
I believe that the text we have come up with is balanced overall .
All the cell lines in question are existing lines and were created without the use of Community funding and outside the European Union .
Mr Zimmerling’s report is a step in the right direction , in that he has created a real instrument which guarantees the participation of citizens in developing countries .
In other words , it is not enough to create a good policy : it is even more important to provide it with adequate financial resources .     .
We should also note that women are excluded from participation , access and control in all sectors .
We need to ask questions , not about the viability of non-GMO production , but about the precautions to be taken to protect that production from contamination by GMOs .
I truly believe that if we do not protest – and by ‘we ’ I mean the UN in this case , and the European Union  – then that will be the sign that we are making a wrong move .
In this respect too , we must , clearly , take advantage of the framework offered by a multilateral organisation to develop regulations that , rightly , ensure equality for those entering , and those already within , the market .
European agriculture should not , however , need this intervention .
It is even less so because , in the area of foreign policy , the European Union does not exist politically and remains condemned to conciliate the positions of the Member States , some of which openly express unfailing solidarity with the US positions , for example … The answers are , therefore , eminently political and stem from the Member States .
Parliament does itself no honour by continuing to blindly defend a Draft Constitution that does not in any way plug the democratic deficit which , despite having been denounced for more than ten years , is spectacularly evident in a number of deficient areas , beginning with the social aspect and the non-governance of the euro .
This is incomprehensible and derisory !
Having gone before the Heads of State or Government , the Giscard draft appears to be deadlocked .
For Member States to adapt their respective infrastructures to put such a system in place would lead to disproportionate costs borne once again by the road user .
This is a major problem , and one that we must not put to one side by giving immediate authorisation to cultivate and market GMOs , as called for by the Commission .
We must first examine the possible extent of contamination of traditional crops , which at least 70 % of consumers would like to preserve .
Such a move towards standardising seeds – all-purpose GMOs – and the corresponding disappearance of traditional and organic farming would undermine both the agricultural diversity of European territories and the specific nature of what is produced .
For the period 2000-2006 , this aid amounts to EUR 316 million for Languedoc-Roussillon and EUR 340 million for Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur .
Our Parliament was also very active in this respect in asking for that mutual assistance to be put in place .
You said so yourself , Commissioner .
How was it that the local people knew , but the authorities did not act until disaster happened ?
The provisional toll of this disaster is particularly high : 30 departments are affected , eight of them severely , in particular Bouches-du-Rhône , Vaucluse and Gard .
Some are making their third damage claims and doing their third clean up in the space of a few months .
Who will pay ?
To conclude , the overhaul of the Structural Funds must anticipate this territorial justice : if populations are transferred from north to south , the funding must be transferred as well , otherwise we will become the Palestinians of Europe , seeing colonies of senior citizens from Northern Europe settled among us .
I should first like to express my utmost sympathy to the victims of these disasters .
Now more than ever , the process of economic reform must continue to enjoy EU support , so as to restore an atmosphere that is conducive to foreign and local investment
