questions raised .
First of all Mr Harbour ' s questions , which typically were perceptive and constructive , related to how far we thought that the commitment to the development of managerial skills and culture was being achieved .
I will just stipulate one or two points that are evidence of progress .
I would not claim they were perfect and this list is not exhaustive .
So far as training is concerned , which , as Mr Harbour knows , is fundamental to the kind of changes that we want to achieve , the comprehensive programme of training for all managers in the Commission which should continue over two years commences this month .
Secondly we are already embarked on the process of collecting mission statements from every Directorate-General .
Most have submitted theirs .
There is also the establishment of task assessments which we will do through a series of pilot schemes that will affect around one quarter of the Directorate-Generals in the first instance and then the compilation of job descriptions which will be undertaken over the period up to the end of July this year .
The process of evaluation of staff , and that of course includes managers at all levels , is being refined and will be introduced .
As Mr Harbour says , the role and activity of the Secretary-General in all of these activities and indeed in many others is crucial .
I believe that Mr O' Sullivan has a very strong commitment to the direction set out by the White Paper and will be a notable successor to his extremely talented and committed predecessor , Mr Trojan , who will take up a new post from the end of this month .
So far as empowering managers is concerned , the best instance we can give is that from May 1 we inaugurated the new internal audit service , the central financial service and we will shortly be having the first meeting of the Audit Progress Committee .
These are the first crucial steps in the decentralisation of financial control , which is of course critical to the empowerment of management at all levels in a money-handling institution .
Mr Harbour will be familiar with my view that as a consequence of making that central and measurable change , subject continually to examination , we will get a reverberating change of culture in the wider managerial style and operation of the House .
Finally , he is right to stipulate that team leadership , team working and team building are all critical to the effective operation of modern managerial skills .
We are nurturing that by the combination of structural change and supplementary training , evaluation and the appointment system .
Obviously too , the consideration of probationary periods in contracts of appointment for managers will be a strong supplement to the direction which we want to take .
But to do that comprehensively will require amendments to the Staff Regulations and I am looking forward to the cooperation of Parliament and the Council in gaining the changes in Community legislation which are necessary to facilitate that further development .
Mr van den Berg was correct , and indeed kind and generous , in re-asserting the fact that the Commission must be responsible for its appointments and its personnel policies .
I presume that he will follow through his enquiry as to why this question was asked .
I can only say that I welcome the opportunity to provide comprehensive information .
I am reminded that , in the hearings , correctly and forcefully , several Members of this House raised the question and indeed made assertive demands for de-flagging of senior posts , for the complete abandonment of formal or informal quotas and for the rotation of officials holding A1 and A2 posts .
Those are principles that I not only agreed with at the time , together with my colleagues in the Commission , but have actively been seeking to put into effect ever since .
If I can come to the point relating to new standards and outside posts , a point also raised absolutely correctly by Mr Dell ' Alba , who has a question down on these matters and I am looking forward to answering it , I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the course of giving my attention to a specific case , which related to the departure of my own Chef de Cabinet , Mr Andrew Cahn , it became very obvious to me that the current arrangements relating to authorising the movement of permanent and temporary officials to outside employment do not have adequate clarity or consistency .
In practice , the course of action and rigorous scrutiny which I requested to be applied in the case of Mr Cahn meant that his case was dealt with very thoroughly and entirely properly .
I do not believe , however , that the Commission , or indeed other institutions , should have to rely on individual motivation by officials or by Commissioners and on rather ad hoc means of applying principles , which are , to say the least , rather generalised .
I therefore asked the Director-General of Administration and Personnel to produce a draft for rules that would take into account best practice in the administrations of Member States and of other international public bodies and to give precision to procedures .
Having such rules would obviously be the best means of ensuring transparency , consistency and practical guidance which would be in the interests of all parties , especially when , as Members have reminded us in the course of the debate , Member States and institutions are increasingly keen to encourage more exchange between national and EU administrations and between the public and private sectors .
