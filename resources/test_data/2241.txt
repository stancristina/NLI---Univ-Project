Winds blow into its sails from every direction , not least from where our partners are in the Northern Dimension : Russia , Norway and Iceland .
Russia is a rich country , where there are a lot of poor people .
It would be good if the Commissioner put on headphones , as I do not suppose he understands Finnish .
Now that the good Commissioner is listening , I will continue .
The Northern Dimension must also cover cooperation with oil-rich Norway and energy-rich Iceland .
Its action plan should extend into the northern region to include Greenland and Alaska , to say nothing of the Barents Sea .
The fact that the EU does not always take part in the meetings of the Arctic Council , the Barents Council or the Barents Euro-Arctic Council says something about its indifferent approach to external relations in the development of the Northern Dimension .
There is a rather substantial difference .
I think that the Northern Dimension stands at a crossroads .
The second is that we start refocusing it , for instance towards the Baltic Sea .
I happen to have a preference for the second option .
I am also very happy to see that there are other non-Finns in the Chamber besides Mrs Wallis , who was the only non-Finn to speak about the subject in November 2003 .
Firstly , I think that the Northern Dimension should have its own budget line .
So give it its own budget line .
However , I fully agree with , for example , Mrs Korhola and Mrs Hassi , who said that we should refocus it on the Baltic Sea , because that probably is the sickest sea we have in Europe today .
To all the people sitting in the Parliament for the first time today , just remember that the Baltic Sea has an average depth of 59 metres compared to the two to three kilometres of the Mediterranean .
So let us get more focus .
They need to work together .
It has a considerable importance for this sort of cooperation between people and various organisations , and it has importance specifically for regional security , welfare and stability .
Whether it is a matter of the environment , health or culture , everything also has its northern dimension in the same way the EU’s policy on the Mediterranean does .
The EU’s northeastern border is at least as crucially important as its border in the southern Mediterranean .
On the Russian side , the economic and health statistics are on a par with Africa .
The aim of the latest programme is the control of these infectious diseases and the prevention of various dangers to society in our neighbouring areas : which will be no minor feat in the future either .
In order to develop the Northern Dimension’s importance in the Union’s external relations the Commission should be given two tasks .
My main message , however , is connected with what is missing from the Commission ’s report entirely : cooperation in the Baltic Sea region .
Until spring of last year , the Baltic countries and Poland were our neighbours and partners in external relations .
The Commission needs to take this into account when shaping the guidelines for the Northern Dimension .
Baltic Sea cooperation will finally contribute some real substance to those views of the Council which have emphasised the importance of the Northern Dimension generally and also in the internal development of the Union .
It boosts employment , standards of living , health , and the infrastructure of many developing countries .
This requires cooperation between the public and the private sector .
The second point is that , in my opinion , we need rules based on sustainable development .
I think we would do well to earmark financial assistance for this .
I spoke for two minutes .     .
The first is that my Group and I support Mr Bowis ' report , which is excellent .
These are issues that touch all of us and my Group therefore supports it .
My second observation is that this field needs more research .
Extensive work is being done , but more money needs to be invested and the Commission , and indeed the European Union , could be the right source .
For example , between the years 1975 and 1999 , less than 1 % of new medicines was for the treatment of tropical and epidemic diseases .
My first general remark is that I myself was an official participant in the Tampere European Council in October 1999 , exactly six years ago .
My second remark concerns the Constitution , which Franco Frattini was also involved in drafting .
It is regrettable to hear how those who opposed the Constitution here in Parliament would at the same time like a firmer policy on asylum .
Next , I wish to make three detailed observations .
What is most important is that this programme should now be carried out .
A list of this kind is necessary , and it is fine if , after the directive has come into effect , these decisions are taken by a qualified majority .
Obviously , this cannot be allowed to happen .
For that reason , I support the rapporteur on this point .     Mr President , I wish to make five brief remarks .
My first remark is that I like the way in which the reports focus on one fund and one programme , as this streamlines the way in which we conduct our business and makes it more effective and less complex .
Coming from Finland , I think it very important that we do not just focus on GDP but broaden our view and look at how difficult it is to get to a place .
I urge anyone who has
