And now we hear you , Mr President-in-Office , calling for a minimum of contact - that is what I heard - with the extremists so as to find a political solution .
What are Mr Badinter ' s views ?
If I remember correctly from what I have read in the papers , Mr Badinter said no to a state of two separate ethnic groups .
In other words , we are depending on the political will of the extremists .
There is no symmetry .
We therefore need more stable , more serious , more reliable support from the European Union for the unity and democratisation - and they go hand in hand - of this country .
Mr President , it is particularly worrying to see armed conflict persisting in a country which borders my own country at a time when intensive negotiations are under way for the sole purpose of settling once and for all the differences which gave rise to the conflict in the first place .
This time the main perpetrators are organised armed Albanian extremists taking advantage of what is often justified ethnic discontent on the part of their many , unarmed , fellow countrymen , as is always the case , in order to incite them to wage war on other ethnic groups .
The benefits to the people of a European type solution would be incalculable , but they presuppose abandoning armed violence as a method of forcing historical development and , on this point , the European Union has not excelled either in the case of Cyprus or in the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
It was the responsibility of the forces which intervened in Kosovo to disarm the KLA .
It is a well-known fact that the KLA is backed by drug dealing and by contributions which originate in our countries .
As long as we fail to act decisively where decisive action is required , it is hypocritical to say to nations clashing on the ground that they are responsible for the tragedies which befall them .
( EL ) The Gothenburg Summit will go down in history not just for what happened inside the conference room but also for what happened outside it .
When it comes to the tragic developments in the FYROM , the resolution approves both of the interventionist policy and of NATO' s intention not to get drawn into taking on a full peacekeeping role .
At the same time , because they know that grass-roots opposition to the prospect of integration is increasing in the candidate countries , they are trying to lure them with the prospect of taking part in European elections in 2004 .
.
( EL ) The report by the European Central Bank under discussion covers its 2nd year in operation following the start of the third stage of EMU.
It announces that wage policy is to be modernised , for which read flexible and insecure labour , and it is pushing for privatisation across the board in order to promote the competitiveness of and reward big business .
He probably agrees because he has told us that the executive board of the ECB is continuing to monitor wage developments and trends in domestic and foreign demand and that , despite the oil crisis , wage increases were moderate , which he described as highly positive , stressing that inflation will be kept to 2 % in 2002 thanks to wage restraint , while the monopolies ' profits will , of course , keep on rising .
We are therefore against the European Parliament ' s supporting the policy of the ECB , because it is a policy which generates more poverty for the many , i .e . for the workers , and more profit for the few , i .e . for the European monopolies .
Mr President , the report was excellent , as was the Belgian minister ' s speech , as were Commissioner Patten' s and Commissioner Vitorino ' s speeches .
We can make claims and demands on Moldavia , Latvia , Lithuania , certain African countries , certain former central American colonies , but when Mr Bush was here , who opened their mouth , who said a word about the death penalty ?
Mr Jospin ?
Why , when it comes to Turkey , delete the passage stating that the Kurds must be allowed to return or that the European Court decision on Cyprus must be applied ?
If human rights are to be respected in practice rather than merely in declarations , we need to defend them vigorously against the hated dark , reactionary forces which hamper dialogue and freedom of thought and conscience .
We also need to create the mechanisms needed to monitor and apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to give moral and financial support to organisations fighting for human rights , such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims .
Then along comes the Council with a proposal to give Yugoslavia macro-financial assistance to the ridiculous tune of a few hundred million - no doubt the thirty pieces of silver for the subordinates in Belgrade who , in the most disgraceful manner and despite a decision to the contrary by the country ' s parliament and supreme constitutional court , handed the former president of Yugoslavia , who was democratically elected in four elections , to a court set up on the orders of the USA and ÍÁÔÏ in order to try anyone who resists the new order .
I am certain that it will judge today ' s decision to be one of the ugliest moments in the life of the European Parliament .
Of course Milosevic bears a huge responsibility for the crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and he must be brought to justice ,
