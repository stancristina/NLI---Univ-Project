My group considers it very important that aid for the people of Congo-Brazzaville is intensified , and has submitted an amendment to this effect .
I should think only very few people in Europe know where Congo is , what is happening there , and what has been happening over the past few years in the vicinity of the political and military force in Zaire .
This may be right , but the most important thing in this issue is that it gives out the wrong signal .
The situation is now as follows .
In the eastern part of the country , the conflict is continuing , and we know that the rebels are assaulting not only the local population , but also the development workers there at the moment .
Our great concern must be that in the short term the problem of hunger is tackled , because many people are now in a dire situation as a result of endless bad harvests .
You , Commissioner , as the person responsible on behalf of Europe , have often compared your role with that of a referee , who has to take decisions , often in difficult areas , and who is therefore , depending on the circumstances , sympathetic or unsympathetic .
This is not Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom or Italy against France .
I can tell you , Commissioner , that we , a number of Members of this Parliament , have already taken on a renowned lawyer .
Principles are fine but progress in concrete matters is essential .
It is not a question of wanting to do away with democracy and national constitutional guarantees .
It is essential and I would ask Commissioner Monti , who is standing in for Mrs Gradin , to say whether the PHARE programme should not be far more used to promote justice and police cooperation .
We must make progress in this field as well and it is again a point made very clearly by Mr Bontempi .
But where are we seeking the solution for the problem ?
Direct initiatives to stop the current growth in organized crime are needed .
That is why I admire the courage of the rapporteur to offer criticism , difficult criticism in a Joint Assembly .
ACP cooperation can be halted if this does not happen .
Firstly , if the voting procedure is modified in the way proposed , then there is the risk that the effect of the Joint Assembly as a body for Members of Parliament of the European Union and ACP to meet , will decrease , because large groups can be outvoted on extremely important issues such a human rights .
Let us listen to the ACP countries when they point to our violations of human rights .
Exchanges of civil servants are taking place in order to intensify cooperation between the Member States ' judicial systems .
It is not possible to compare the effectiveness of Member States on the basis of this report .
It is important that these are charted better .
When the Member States flout these rules , sanctions should be imposed .
The rapporteur and other Members would then have seen that in the Netherlands the quotas are respected , despite that fact that the capacity of the fleet has not or has hardly been reduced .
But then the Member States should not be judged on just one aspect of the Common Fisheries Policy , but on the entire policy .
That cannot be a coincidence , but it any case it is a serious blow for the international fight against crime .
Madam President , the Herman report on improving the democratic functioning of EU institutions is missing from the final version of the draft agenda .
We cannot think of a good reason to postpone it .
It seems to me to be an argument for not tabling the Herman Report in this part-session but after the decision on 2 May .
That is the reason we gave in the Conference of Presidents for debating the Herman Report in May .
Not because we urgently need a new European policy for tourism as such , but to create an opportunity for greater consistency in policies on tourism .
Madam President , yes of course we must offer tourists protection and security , and assistance must be available in an emergency .
Now , that really is going well beyond subsidiarity .
Paragraph 10 states that the slots for tourists must be improved .
My second question is : when will we get the results of the study carried out into overbooking in hotels ?
Finally , it has to be said that one airport causes far more nuisance than another because it is located in an area with a far higher concentration of people , so that should play a role .
This way is not going to quickly lead to airport charges which reflect real costs .
How can that be reconciled with the internal market ?
I have to tell you that I thought that a highly acceptable proposal .
Personally , I find it unacceptable that the old lorries , of all vehicles , which experience has taught us breach the rules on driving and rest periods most , should be allowed to continue to run with the old equipment , which is so open to fraud , for ever and a day .
Now to my conclusions .
It is a neat bit of technology which has been improved over and over again by smart people in recent decades , but especially in their own experience by smart operators .
Kinsel was the first to propose a 1B solution .
What we already knew from the Commission reports , which were often seriously delayed , was confirmed .
Mr President , experts consider non-compliance with the rules
