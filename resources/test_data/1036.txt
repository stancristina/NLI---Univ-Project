of the right provided for in Article 6 .
The conditions for these loans are exceptional and beneficiary countries will be required to submit and adhere to a repayment schedule approved by ECOFIN.
In 1995 European Union openness was approximately 10 % as compared with 12 % for the United States of America and 9 % for Japan .
Madam President , we support the position of the Committee on the Environment of the European Parliament for four essential reasons : competitiveness , public health , improving the environment and enhancing the role of the European Parliament .
The proposal for a directive now under discussion and the amendments tabled will make it compulsory for employers too to prove that they are not discriminating on grounds of sex .
In the first place we need to get the message clearly across that fisheries resources are not limitless ; just recently the FAO even pointed out that over 60 % of fisheries resources were being over exploited .
The difficulty of the matter lies essentially in pedagogical reasons , in confidence and transparency , in matters bound up with income , already very low for fishermen and their families as a whole .
Some of them are directly bound up with direct investment which fishing equipment might entail ; others are concerned with the drop in income which might be occasioned by , albeit temporarily , by new methods because of the smaller catches .
Such a diversity of resources necessarily implies a whole range of different fishing methods .
Finally , I should like to stress that these methods are inalienable from the multi-annual fisheries guidance programme , the famous FGP-IV , the parameters of which need to be set with care and consistency in all Member States .
Although we had our reasons from the outset for abstaining on the Adam report on the proposal to introduce technical measures for the conservation of fisheries resources - which we explained in detail during the debate - then we are doubly convinced following the discussion , in view of the Commission 's answers and comments and above we see doubly clearly the real proposals and intentions of the European 'Executive ' in this matter .
Mr President , I should like to make one or two brief points on Mrs Fontaine 's report and also on this attempt to standardize the recognition of diplomas , which is a constant concern to me .
We are all aware that in any given country there are universities , polytechnic colleges or equivalent colleges which award diplomas which are not as good as those in other establishments in the same country .
Normality ends there , though , because for the past eight months roughly 70 % of Community rice production for the 1996/97 marketing year has remained unsold .
The other proportion , which is directly responsible for worsening market conditions , comes above all from the overseas territories of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands .
How will the situation develop ?
Ladies and gentlemen , either rice imports must in fact be controlled and measures must be taken to this end with a view to future rice marketing years or this sector will probably not have any future in the European Union .
I might tell you that , contrary to what the Commission said in reply to one member of my Group , there is only one factory in Europe producing such beer ; it is in England and is American owned .
It also needs to be pointed out on the other hand that the excessive freedom of access granted since 1991 to rice produced in the overseas countries and the overseas territories , which has caused imports to the European Union from these countries to multiply five-fold since then , rising from 58 000 tonnes in 1991 to 300 000 tonnes in 1996 .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , if courage could be imported through the overseas territories , even at high rates of import duty , none of this would be happening .
It is as well to remember that not everything which is legal is moral because the law often protects morally reprehensible activities , as unfortunately in our present situation .
And I do not think any congratulations are in order as regards the management of Community funds .
Lands colonized and cultivated for the past 150 years , lands which will once again be condemned to desertification and depopulation , unless you remedy the situation .
He began by saying that , of all European citizens , women are those who are the least convinced of the importance of Europe .
The fact that we have not yet found a solution to this problem , which we know to be closely linked to the need for economic growth at a higher rate than that achieved in recent years , results from the fact that the policies pursued and instruments used have not so far proved to be the best-suited for creating jobs .
However , even recognising the important role of the craft industry and small companies in job creation , there is a manifest incoherence in Community policy when it comes to implementing actions and support programmes which are frequently of diminished value , delayed or suspended .
This problem of filling in forms is a vital one .
Is the Commission really willing to simplify the whole process of access to Community funds by small and very small enterprises and , in particular , the craft industry ?
Rules on VAT should be changed so as to make people want to work .
We really must help young people and women in particular who make up two-thirds of all unemployed people .
The activities of craft industries may - and in many cases do - have characteristics of a cultural nature , the respect and transmission of traditions .
