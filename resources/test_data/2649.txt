I understand , Commissioner Kinnock , that the situation is very difficult in view of the prejudices that exist , but I cannot agree that things are developing particularly quickly in this area .
Zimbabwe has been discussed by us many times in this House , as I know it has also been in the other institutions .
The situation is alarming .
Human rights are infringed on a daily basis , and the opposition is harassed and persecuted in an unacceptable way .
All Mugabe ' s foreign assets and all those of his family should be frozen .
There is a small number of courageous people who , at risk to their own lives , are fighting for democracy and human dignity .
Afghan women have good reasons to be afraid , for we know that the Northern Alliance too has perpetrated crimes such as forced marriage .
Afghan women should not have to beg for the right to education as a favour .
We are delighted about the outcome of the Bonn Conference , but the work must go on .
The issue of guilt also needs to be examined , that is to say who bears responsibility for what .
It is the only way in which to bring about healing .
Mine dogs , which are extremely important in clearing away all this devastation , are also needed .
The same thing happened in Dover a year ago .
It is , however , we who make their status illegal by constantly making the visa requirements more stringent , by constantly sending out the signal that they are not welcome , by forcing the airlines to accept their liability as transporters and by giving shipowners the task of assessing who shall be allowed to seek asylum .
We must look forward .
The awarding of the Sakharov Prize is not only a grand ceremony but also an important demonstration , with echoes around the world .
That is not so in the cases of two former recipients of the prize : Aung San Suu Kyi , who received the prize in 1990 , and Leyla Zana , who received it in 1995 .
We have seen some softening of attitudes on the part of the Burmese regime .
Leyla Zana is held prisoner by a country that is applying for membership of the EU.
In this House , there is firm cross-party resolve to keep on reminding the world , including Burma and Turkey , of the fate of these two women and of the struggle for human rights , democracy and freedom of expression that they represent .
I myself , who had planned to go there in the course of the next few months , have , for example , been advised against travelling .
Illiteracy is another major problem .
Sixty-three per cent of men can read , but only 28 % of women .
One other problem is the fact that education is extremely politicised .
Those I spoke to did not agree .
Other developments in the country must , however , continue .
The developments in Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism have completely dominated the agenda .
It poses the right questions and will enable the Convention to work constructively and with an open mind .
It would have been good to have had people of rather more mixed ages and , as many in this House have pointed out , a woman in the Bureau , for more than half of the population of the EU does in fact consist of women .
We all know that the Winter War began with the ' Mainila shots ' staged by Stalin , and it is outrageous that the European School Portal should contain this type of error .
That is why it is a matter of such urgency that Spain should give priority to a dynamic and competitive Europe .
That is why unemployment is falling and prosperity increasing in Spain .
The Spanish Presidency must now increase the pressure and , instead of just talking , pursue a policy of prosperity , development and opportunities for the people of Europe .
Enlargement has now entered a crucial phase .
Good luck in what you intend !
Either we try , by means of directives and regulations , to ban or limit environmentally damaging activities ; or we try , by means of directives and regulations , to encourage private individuals , companies and public authorities voluntarily to act in ways that reduce damage to the environment .
In the two opinions for which I have been draftsman in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , we have clearly incorporated the opportunity for taking account of the environment in procurement .
This is above all the case with the proposal for a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts , public service contracts and public works contracts .
These changes are significant .
These criteria do in fact form part of the Sixth Environment Programme .
The Advocate-General has clearly come out in favour of its being my and the Committee on the Environment ' s view that is correct , and not that put forward by the Commission .
Mr President , it is good that we are holding this debate at a busy time in the House and that we are not just engaging in legal hair-splitting , for the directives on the coordination of procedures for the award of public contracts are among the most important methods we have for preventing administrative corruption in the most effective way .
There is a lot left to be desired .
I want to say , however , that , in this context , it is quite often a question of self-governing local authorities which operate in such a way that , if a mistake is made and people are not satisfied , the
