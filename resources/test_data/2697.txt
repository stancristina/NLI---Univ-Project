are finding it difficult to operate , which means that the prices which they are able to offer young artists have gone down .
After all there are no international binding standards which force us to adopt this legislation .
Such a study I hope would also give an insight into how the diversity of the art market would be affected .
Mr President , unfortunately I cannot pass on my congratulations for this report although I know that a great deal of hard work has gone into it .
The Directive , in its current format , takes no account of small national markets .
As I am running out of time to speak , I refer you to my proposed amendment and would unfortunately , as we say in Sweden , ask that both the Commission and the Committee do their homework again .
Above all I would like to concentrate on the issues concerning the Great Belt and the Ã–resund Bridge .
Above all , with regard to the huge new bridge between Sweden and Denmark , it is important that the money is used wisely and that this project is not favoured over other infrastructure projects which may be necessary .
Mr President , In the latest issue of the Journal of Palestine Studies the American researcher William Quant says that if Israel concluded a peace agreement today on the basis of the two State solution , everything which was being sought prior to 1967 would be gained .
I think it is important to remember that Netanyahu represents a particular brand of Zionism , revisionist Zionism which holds the view that it is not only Gaza and the West Bank which forms part of 'lawful Israel ' but the kingdom of Jordan as well .
One way of producing such counter pressure is through the support given to the Palestinians .
I do not want to go into detail here but I think that the Council really ought to consider how Netanyahu can be subjected to enough counter pressure to make him see that he must take the chance now to achieve peace .
In the latest issue of the Hong Kong Human Rights ' Monitor News Letter it is possible to read the following : ' History will judge Britain poorly for holding the Hong Kong people back from political life ' .
But it is obvious that democracy and human rights have an intrinsic moral and political value which must carry more weight than international agreements which have been entered into over the heads of the people concerned .
There is every reason to emphasise strongly the need for continuous monitoring of the events in Hong Kong and to be prepared for action on the part of the Union .
I am well aware of the fact that since then there has been an informal meeting between the labour market ministers in Rotterdam .
The statement that employment policy at European level is not the only policy is absolutely true .
It does not detract from what must be done at a local , regional and national level but is more of an additional measure in the form of a coordinated macroeconomic policy for example .
The plain fact is that obviously no one really knows .
This is the interesting question for the Member States involved .
I think it would represent a total rejection of all EU requirements for democracy if we were to accept that a country such as Turkey be allowed to dictate to us the conditions under which we should accept new members in the Union - I am thinking of course of Cyprus .
I would like to hear the Council 's views on this matter .
You certainly must have an insight into the work of the current Intergovernmental Conference and some influence over it .
I feel that it is perfectly reasonable on democratic grounds to clarify this legal hierarchy between National Constitutions and EEC law .
It is as follows : whenever we finance the Structural Funds or pay general fees to the Union , I have long criticised the fact that the GDP fee is based on GDP alone without any adjustment for buying power in the community .
Madam President , Parliament has previously shown its strong commitment to the environment as far as cars are concerned .
I fully understand the Commission 's attitude that a thorough analysis of the cost of the different measures is required together with a comparison of benefits in terms of a cleaner environment and the saving of lives .
Under normal circumstances this would not be a threat to the free market .
The proposal put forward by Parliament on the use of fuel in private cars is , in my opinion , unrealistically tough .
The motivation behind Parliament 's demands is carbon dioxide emissions .
The carbon dioxide emission from all private cars in the EU could in theory be compensated for by thirty or so reactors replacing coal power .
Positive discrimination in favour of women is after all forbidden by the European Courts .
It is particularly hard for us to prove that discrimination takes place at work .
Of course , equality is not just an issue covering women and our rights , but is also a problem which concerns the whole of society .
Sweden and Finland are both small countries .
We have overstepped the limit where fishing capacity exceeds the reproduction level of fish in most of our waters .
Now we are creating an uncontrollable system which will be impossible to live up to .
Otherwise we will have to oppose the proposal in its entirety .
I also note that he has said that there is a good supply of Baltic herring so we must be able to increase our efforts to fish herring from the Baltic Sea .
