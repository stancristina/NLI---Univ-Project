And that means the Swedish Presidency , which we all consider to be one of the most enlightened .
In 1997 , we introduced a referendum in Italy against the 1994 law which established the special powers of the golden share in Italy .
Otherwise - as frequently happens - this excuse is , in actual fact , used to consolidate national governments and majority parties ' power of veto over the free placing on the market of public companies ; the financial markets are unable to establish the best , most efficient , optimum distribution of power and therefore of the management of companies in sectors which are highly important , key , crucial sectors for Europe , such as the telecommunications or energy sectors in particular .
We must not advocate that governments use the golden share as a shield to prevent companies being bought on the market in order to direct the purchase of privatised companies towards preferred groups because , in the long run , this leads to non-competitive markets , as is happening now .
The Stockholm Summit was the first summit specifically dedicated to assessing our progress and to setting the priorities for the next 12 months .
As expected , the European Council assured President Trajkovski of its full support for the territorial integrity of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia but , at the same time , the Union called upon President Trajkovski to take the grievances of the Albanian minority in his country into consideration .
A year ago , at Lisbon , we were still suffering from a sort of inferiority complex before the strength of the US economy .
In this regard , I must stress once again the need to adopt clearer strategies to tackle the issue of our ageing society .
In fact , a clear unanimous political commitment has been made by the Heads of State or Government to implementing this project rapidly .
As recommended , a European Securities Committee will be set up , chaired by the Commission .
I sincerely hope that this situation can be resolved .
With regard to the demographic challenge , the European Council recognised the importance of ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances , social services , health care and pensions .
The surest way to lose that support is to increase the number of unfulfilled promises .
In my view , the President of the Commission is crying over spilt milk .
He is lamenting something which is the result of a policy that he himself helped to develop .
Just to go to Chechnya , nothing more .
What is currently happening in Chechnya is an outrage .
Territorial integrity is not a theory : it is a practical concept in which integrity means that the entire territory is guaranteed , not that anything goes .
I feel that this is extremely important : we must speak out for peace , but peace in respect for all ...
As President Prodi rightly said , Europe 's credibility is at stake : too many promises have been made and not kept after recent European summits ; there have been too many dashed hopes .
Another general point , then , was covered by many speakers : on the one hand , the conviction that globalisation is absolutely essential , and not just a necessity but an extremely positive debate for Europe , but , on the other , the justified - genuine - fear of some of the effects of globalisation .
I would like to end with one last point , which might appear minor but which I consider to be extremely important .
In addition , Parliament will , and must , be informed on a regular basis by the Commission of the Securities Committee 's proceedings and , If the European Parliament resolves that the draft measures submitted by the Commission exceed the implementing powers provided for in the framework legislation , the Commission commits itself to expeditiously re-examine those draft measures , taking the utmost account of Parliament 's position .
Mr President , as the elected representative of the Pensioners ' Party to this Parliament , I was very happy to vote for the Trakatellis report , a very important report .
Mr President , the European Union 's behaviour is inconsistent : we recognise that it is necessary to bring the citizens closer to Europe and that , in order to do this , the Union must show that it is able to guarantee rights , freedom and security , but when it comes to implementing these proposals , the Member States ' governments become highly overcautious and indecisive , concerned more for their own powers than for the rights of all .
Mr President , the question which arises is : what is preventing the developed countries from helping the poor countries more effectively ?
Question no 5 by (H-0299/01 ) : Subject : International Criminal Court In its answer dated 24 October 2000 to Oral Question H-0763/00 concerning the process for the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court , the Council Presidency stated that it was also possible to envisage substantial progress being made in the near future , since eight more Member States were quietly confident that ratification would take place before the end of the year .
We are forced to this point because the forecast contained in Article 4 of the regulation is dictated solely by the absence of a general Community legislation on the definition , assessment and charging of the costs of using the infrastructure , whether they are internal or external .
However , I cannot support the further extension to other offences - fraud and corruption , at least serious - as the existence of seriousness is made clear insofar as these offences affect the financial interests of the European Union , if , therefore ,
