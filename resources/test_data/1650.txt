and ineffectual proposal .
Hence we back the report by our Socialist coordinator , Mr Georges Garot , and the amendments approved in the Committee on Agriculture .
It must be said that this is actually a process on paper which takes time to turn into action , but it is going along the right road .
Right now , Madam President , I should like to stop talking and wait for someone from the Council to come here .
The Parliamentary Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy considers it to be a generally good proposal .
The proposals approved in the Committee on the Environment deal with enhancing transparency and consumer information ; ensuring the recall of products even when they are already in the hands of consumers ; limiting professional confidentiality to the bare essentials ; clarifying the definition of a safe product and a dangerous product ; including the monitoring of the safety of product installation and maintenance ( because sometimes this installation and maintenance may present a risk to consumer safety ) ; including the precautionary principle , a useful principle little used in the European Union ( if it were , we would not have problems such as mad cow disease , to be examined this afternoon , the dioxin issue , or other matters relating to genetically modified products ) ; ensuring a certain harmonisation of surveillance and follow-up programmes ( it is important that Member States should maintain some equality in these surveillance and follow-up programmes ) ; and in general arranging for consumers to be given information in the language of the country in which they buy the products .
Some amendments , such as Nos 1 and 18 , deal with questions that basically concern the United Kingdom , and it must be said that all the groups from the United Kingdom , whether socialist , popular or green , have supported them vehemently and they have been approved in the Committee on the Environment .
Women do not enjoy the same rights as men , there are still fewer women representatives in public institutions and also at decision-making levels in private enterprise , and they are still the main victims of domestic cruelty and sexual violence .
It is , moreover , a fact that social systems - protection systems - have been suffering from the influences and consequences of economic , demographic and public health situations , etc .
As you will remember , the Stability and Growth Pact stipulates close , on-going supervision of the Member States ' budgetary position during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union .
This is the second time we have updated these programmes : we did it first in 1999 , and now we are doing it again in 2000 , thereby including one more year in the programme .
The document presented by a Member State is assessed by the Commission and , on the basis of this assessment , the Council may adopt the recommendation that the Commission presents .
The Commission has opted for this second possibility ; hence , in our annual assessment , we shall now also review other aspects previously not considered in the past : first , the orientation of budget policy in each of the Member States according to the point in the cycle at which it finds itself , that is , whether these kinds of budgetary measures are procyclic or anticyclic in nature and to what extent they help the market situation or create tensions within it .
First of all , the three Member States whose stability programmes have been examined by the Commission today have made highly significant progress towards the restructuring of their public exchequers since 1997 , the year in which they made their decisions to join the single currency ; in fact , Finland already had a budget surplus in 1998 and the Netherlands in 1999 .
One of our concerns with the German programme is clearly to insist that this dip in the trend must be a one-year exception arising from these tax cuts and must not affect future years .
In the case of Finland , the national debt is already much lower than this target and is falling all the time .
Lastly , the Commission is delighted by the speed with which Germany , the Netherlands and Finland have presented their updated programmes .
First of all , the proceeds of the UMTS licences , as I said before , have been allocated to reducing the debt , so that the national debt is now practically down to the 60 % level .
The set of tax measures adopted by Germany affects the supply side of the economy more than the demand side but will also have some effect on demand , and we believe it will allow the growth potential of the German economy to increase in the medium term .
The overheating problem does not arise in Germany in the same way as it does in these other countries .
In 2001 it will be higher than the forecast we had also made in the spring , which was also about 1.8 or 1.7 % .
There are very important differences in countries such as Ireland , for instance , which has a very young population and which still has room for an increase in the activity rate compared with countries with higher activity rates and older populations .
They are also moving towards making a public pay-as-you-go scheme compatible with private pre-funding schemes , and of course they are also compatible with support for the setting up of specific investment funds , which may obtain long-term tax advantages and may help to deal with the ageing problem .
Mr President , I too will try to help in this miracle "timesharing " between the panel of Commissioners and MEPs .
