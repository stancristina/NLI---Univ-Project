forward to continuing our good working relationship with the European Parliament in order that we can succeed in completing the internal market , especially on the basis of enlargement .
- ( DA ) Firstly , we should like it to be noted that we strongly support revision of EU agricultural policy , that is to say , the actual aim of the report .
We should like the revision to incorporate the ' Sustainable CAP Initiative ' declaration , which has been approved by 85 environmental , developmental , agricultural and consumers ' organisations across Europe , including the Danish Society for the Conservation of Nature .
- ( DA ) In the Lagendijk report ( A5-0338/2002 ) , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy calls on the Council and the Commission to consider the possibility of suspending financial assistance to each of five countries - Albania , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , and also Serbia and Montenegro - if they do not comply with three political conditions .
We have chosen , therefore , to vote in favour of the report , but with the following reservations .
The UN currently represents the only international cooperation that admits the possibility of fair sanctions against individual states , and which is at the same time recognised by the international community .
By voting in favour of the report , we are signalling our agreement with the political demands on the Balkan countries , but not accepting the means .
We see this as a stage in the establishment of the EU 's own military rapid reaction force .
Mr President , one of the crucial principles of a properly functioning democratic society is freedom of expression and access to information .
Citizens must have access to information affecting their lives so that they can take part in the democratic debate and make their choices .
If they do not operate properly , then neither does democracy .
The consolidation we have witnessed may lead to less pluralism in the media .
Monopolies undermine democratic pluralism and lead to a decrease in democratic prosperity .
They had no control over what other media put out .
As legislators elected by the people , we are faced with striking a sensitive balance .
To what means can we have recourse to ensure free and diverse media without at the same time setting aside another cardinal principle of a democratic society - that of the distribution of power .
We want to set up basic rules that guarantee a level playing field without tampering with the actual content of the media .
Next , I should like clearly to emphasise that reform of the common fisheries policy must be based upon the sustainable development of fisheries .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is able to support the Commission 's proposals for reform , which contain a number of features aimed at sustainability and , therefore , the balance needed if the stock of fish is to be adjusted to the existing number of fishing vessels .
In that connection , we must respect the fact that fishermen all around the EU attend to their tasks in different ways .
The Commission must gather this data from the Member States and , at the same time , have the necessary technical and , especially , human administrative and supervisory resources available to it .
It is important for our third-country agreements to be given a central place in this connection .
Mr President , we are now approaching the crucial date .
In that way , we shall approach the objective towards which we have been striving , namely a single , reunified Europe .
We have carried out a trial run , and it emerged that having such a large Parliament with MEPs from 27 countries present here in Parliament is perfectly possible , as is the task of interpreting into 23 languages , as has been done .
It was an historic event we experienced this morning , and I think Parliament deserves to be applauded for having in this way demonstrated what we shall all be embarking upon in a year and a half 's time , as well as for having demonstrated that the process is feasible and for having in this way helped make the whole process irrevocable , so that there is no way back .
Yesterday , a ministerial meeting was , for the first time , held in Brussels with the participation of all 25 Member States .
It took place directly before the ordinary meeting of the General Affairs Council , and what we decided was of course what we had discussed with the new Member States .
That will provide time for the ratification of the accession treaty and , at the same time , enable the new Member States to participate on an equal footing in the elections to the European Parliament .
It was also agreed that they will be able to have their own Commissioners in the present Commission as from the date of accession , that is to say from 1 May 2004 .
This naturally presupposes an understanding with this Parliament to the effect that 10 Commissioners will be able to accede without portfolios and , presumably , without being approved by Parliament , its being specified however that , when the new Commission is appointed , presumably as per 1 November , all the Commissioners will naturally have , as always , to be approved by Parliament , which by that time will have been newly elected .
They have done an impressive piece of work in adjusting to all the criteria we have set .
The Copenhagen criteria have been the yardstick for measuring the countries ' political and economic reforms .
Democratic structures have been developed .
