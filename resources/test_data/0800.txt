It may be due in part to bureaucracy , and in part to the fact that the funds might not match up with projects on which decisions have already been taken in Sweden .
When such a differentiation is made , emphasis must be placed , in my opinion , on the criterion of poverty and on sustainable development .
In spite of the fact that the EU has tightened up the rules on animal transport , and in spite of the pressure of public opinion on this issue , the unnecessary and cruel transportation of animals continues to a large extent .
It is also good that Mrs van Dijk tackles the system more fundamentally in her report .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs van Dijk on this important report .
In reality not very much has happened .
Mrs van Dijk takes up technical improvements which must be made to vehicles and staging points .
So use them , for God 's sake !
So could you please check those too .
There are two charges against Mr Campos .
In that case it makes no difference from a legal point of view whether the charge relates to an event which occurred before or during the session concerned .
In this case it is quite clear that what Mr Campos is being charged with is a political matter .
We must therefore put a lot into this .
We know that in both the USA and Russia there are very close links between these issues and the military .
There we felt that the Commission should take it upon itself to promote the use of new satellite services of social interest .
It is therefore a little disappointing to see how little money has been added .
I really hope the Commission starts the reform of the agricultural policy so that we get to grips with this problem .
Madam President , I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Wim van Velzen on this report on employment and the proposals which he and the European Parliament will present to the summit in Luxembourg .
Nor should it be allowed to end in fine words and hopes .
Instead it must really try to arrive at a solution , particularly for the long term unemployed and with regard to youth unemployment .
This also means that the employment policy and the EU 's attempts to create more jobs are based on this growth rate and on encouraging companies to invest .
Working hours should be both shorter and , of course , more flexible .
I therefore believe the summit must discuss whether the EU 's own policies are not contributing to the creation of more unemployment because such massive cuts are being made in the public sector .
Convergence criteria for employment and unemployment should therefore be inserted into the Treaty on European Union so that they are given the same weight as requirements for membership of EMU.
Secondly , a switching of taxes with reduced tax on work for low and middle-income earners and increased taxes on natural resources , energy and environmental discharges .
Madam President , I share the rapporteur 's view that it is important that we talk in concrete terms before , during and after this summit .
This is therefore a criticism of the convergence criteria which were determined for economic and monetary union .
The problem with the van Velzen report is that it is only aimed at the symptoms of a market which is functioning poorly .
The fact is , we should be discussing structural problems instead ; the cost situation - our taxes are far too high ; regulations - there are barriers to taking people on ; enterprise - there are not enough new businesses in Europe .
Skills levels are sinking instead of rising at a time when skills are increasingly important .
I do not envy President-in-Office Juncker who has taken on a big role .
We live in a global economy and can learn from other countries and continents where the level of employment is rising and unemployment is falling .
I think it is really strange that so many people appear to believe that we can improve our lot by working less .
Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a good report .
Now there are these instruments in the Amsterdam Treaty .
We should not allow another meeting which involves lofty declarations which commit us to nothing .
Learn a lesson from this at the Luxembourg Council , and do not let it become another document like the rest .
What we can learn from EMU is the following : if you create clear , concrete objectives , countries will try to fulfil them .
In conclusion , I would also like to support Mr Malone 's views on the question of duty-free shopping .
We are now continuing on this road , totally blindly , without making any other changes when we see we are heading in the wrong direction .
And that is why I have actively voted against it .
I now feel that our hopes lie with the French and Italian governments at the forthcoming summit in Luxembourg , which I am sorry that we could not support .
It ought to be possible to keep it so in future , particularly if there is success in bringing about real reforms in the areas of agricultural policy and regional aid in the coming years .
I am opposed to the proposal for a publicity campaign which is in practice a form of political propaganda in favour of , for example , the euro or the Amsterdam Treaty .
In spite of that , these issues are not taken up in the Commission 's work programme , which must be seen as a very big mistake .
Paragraph 11 would then
