policy is concerned and the huge gap in this area , some Member States , including Greece , have decided to plug this gap with national legislation under the Tampere agenda .
Last week , the Greek government passed an immigration bill legalising and regulating the status of thousands of immigrants who entered Greece over the last ten years , thereby finding a positive solution to serious issues which the Council has stubbornly kept on the back burner .
Mr President , I shall overlook the fact that your reply was something of a " Lord have mercy " to Javier Solana .
What I should like to ask , just to clarify matters and to stop playing with words , is : do we assume and do we mean that the borders of the whole of Yugoslavia , a Yugoslavia with no more Milosevic , a Yugoslavia with Milosevic in prison , also include Kosovo ?
First of all , I asked a straightforward question .
And Mr Solana did the same .
( The President cut the speaker off )
There is also talk of leaving unmanned American aeroplanes on Bulgarian territory .
I should like to ask if the Council has faced up to such a possibility and thought out any action .
So I shall simply take this opportunity to say to Mr Dupuis , in connection with the previous question , you should show some respect , you really should .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as on every other occasion when a long procedure comes to a successful conclusion , now too we have reason to be satisfied , especially as the conciliation procedure achieved a result for sea ports , inland shipping and intermodal terminals .
We also note that the Commission needs to correct the maps attached to the text sent out as certain ports are missing , despite the fact that they meet the requirements which I have mentioned .
Where they apply to new lawyers and the confidentiality which has to govern their activities , the European Parliament is entitled to call for an exemption .
Following the recent discoveries of the dangers inherent in feedingstuffs , especially in the economically advanced countries of the EU and , in particular , the problem of BSE caused by using animal proteins as feedingstuffs , meat and bonemeal should have been completely banned as a feedingstuff and replaced with vegetable proteins produced in the Community , so that Community farmers would not be dependent on soya from the United States .
Instead of which , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has used various tricks , believing that the problem of BSE will be forgotten in time , in an endeavour to restore animal protein in animal feedingstuffs in six months ' time .
In other words , it is endeavouring to restore meat and bonemeal which , it has now been proven , is responsible for BSE , disregarding public health in order to serve the interests of the Community feedingstuffs industry .
Under this proposal , little or no vegetable proteins will be produced , even in countries with extensive set aside .
I believe that my vote will act as an incentive and that the production of healthy and suitable feedingstuffs will become the subject of an objective fight on the part of the people of the Community .
It is clear from their joint declaration that the Heads of State or Government of the ÅU are anxious about the increase in the number of pensioners , which they feel " will create substantial pressure on social welfare systems , in particular pensions , health care systems and care of the elderly " ; .
It is perfectly obvious that the imperialist plans for the region have not yet been completed and that the people will be unable to live in peace until ÍÁÔÏ withdraws .
It continues to rely on the USA for a satellite location system , now that the Galileo programme has come to a standstill , and questions relating to the electricity market are no further forward than they were at the Lisbon Summit .
The British police investigated the matter and they say : In spite of the statements of the Turkish Cypriot police to the contrary , all other available evidence indicates that Mr Tsiakourmas was taken from his vehicle .
If the Government of Cyprus had said this , I would believe it , but others might not .
In other words , this was a man with contacts with both communities , which the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot leaders wish to keep apart and at loggerheads .
Concern for the fate of the individual is one of the most noble traditions of France , your country and homeland .
Which is why I call on you and the Commission to evince an interest in his case .
The question , of course , is where the illegal occupying regime in northern Cyprus finds the nerve to take such action , especially in an area under British sovereignty .
Obviously , if the so-called international community wished to put an end to the occupying regime , it would have the means to do so .
At the same time , however , the European Union has huge economic , political and military interests in Turkey and it is obviously these interests that dictate its conduct .
Mr President , I should like us all to vigorously support the motion for a resolution on the liberation of Mr Tsiakourmas .
That is why , instead of falling into line with the terms laid down for it to become a member , it has become even more audacious .
The conspiracy of silence has been broken and it has come to light that Catholic priests and bishops are guilty of criminal acts against nuns in at least 23 countries
