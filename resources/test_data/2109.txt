.
The presence at the negotiations in Geneva of the Commissioner who is here today was also appreciated .
If the Doha Round is not concluded , the multilateral approach is at serious risk , especially in a situation of global uncertainty such as we are experiencing , that until the Doha Round is concluded , the other matters on the global agenda such as climate change and the rising price of food cannot be tackled .
Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Seeber on the work he has done , because his report picks up many of the concerns expressed in this House regarding problems that are crucial for the whole of the European Union : water scarcity and drought , which have now ceased to be a problem for only the southern European countries .
As you are aware , in March 2002 , the Council and Parliament came to an agreement , through conciliation , on Directive 2002/15/EC , which establishes the requirements that have to be fulfilled for the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities , in order to ensure their health and safety , to ensure road safety and also to align conditions of competition for all enterprises .
That is why , Commissioner , with the date approaching for the inclusion of self-employed workers - and we are neither clear nor convinced that there is still the will that existed at that time , and there are rumours that there are thoughts of reviewing the criteria - Parliament has produced this report with two objectives : as a reminder and as a demand .
We support the increased cooperation mechanism in this case as it will ensure greater legal certainty and stability , avoid 'forum shopping ' and take European integration forward .
As you said in your speech , one of the many aims of this programme is to convey a positive image .
The first aspect is the importance of the legislative process within the European Union .
In other words , regulation cannot be left in the hands of those who are subject to regulation .
It is true that , in recent years , improvements have been made in this respect as , through Parliament , the Commission and the Council working together , the comitology procedures , for example , have been amended .
However , we have set ourselves up not only as an economic and commercial Union but also as a Union of values .
Mr President , please forgive me for having disrupted proceedings by listening for a moment to some of your Members .
There has been some dragging of feet in recent years with regard to these and yet , for the supply of new alternative fuels , such as gas or hydrogen , they are now vitally necessary .
We also have to assess , in advance , the impact on health .
Any measures adopted in the fight against terrorism will have our support , but they cannot be presented in any old way .
The reason is that , without a single point of control for all medicinal products , there are too many avenues left open and the system is much more vulnerable to infiltration by harmful or unauthorised products .
Timeshares involve a property right , whereas holiday clubs are simply a services contract .
The Spanish delegation always argues for understanding , clarity and legal certainty which , together with full harmonisation , guarantee optimum consumer protection .
The first concerns the traditional amendment of the Frontex budget .
We are talking about a problem that concerns access to resources .
The consistent and precise application of monitoring mechanisms such as the Kimberley process is absolutely fundamental to this basic issue .
The Secretary-General has already recently visited the country on two occasions , following cyclone 'Nargis ' earlier this year .
If the European Union truly wants to be a credible political player , with a foreign policy based on the defence and promotion of human rights , and if it does not want to appear , as so often happens , to simply be serving the economic interests of major companies such as Total and Chevron , then this is the moment to prove it .
However , as we now all know , that was not the case .
I therefore want to ask whether this inability of the delegations forming the Council to reach a common position has any real explanation , and whether anyone can tell us who and what arguments are blocking reform of this regulation .
Mr President , Commissioner , as stated by my fellow Members , in 2006 we debated in this House the modification of the Solidarity Fund Regulation with a view to adapting it so that it could become a rapid and effective instrument of response .
In addition , we must be firm in proposing to lower the threshold for mobilising the fund from EUR 3 000 to 1 000 million in damage caused , not forgetting the regional component .
I want to welcome the rigorous work carried out in a constructive spirit by this Parliament , and in particular by Mr Schwab as rapporteur and by Mrs Ferreira - who is not here today , but is represented by Mrs van den Burg - and Mrs Starkevičiūtė , who worked in cooperation with Eurostat and the Commission to arrive at this debate .
I must conclude , Mr President , by once again thanking the rapporteur , Mr Schwab , and the whole of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent work aimed at giving the Union a more solid and reliable statistical structure which will , in a context of total security , prove extraordinary useful in these times of crisis in which the production of statistics , particularly statistics on public accounts , will play an even more crucial role
