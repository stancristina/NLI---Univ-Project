Mr President , my third , fundamental point concerns the implementation and the enforcement of legislation that has been adopted .
This is absolutely necessary .
A Turkish academic recently spoke of a poisoned atmosphere .
I am pleased that the atmosphere is still open enough for an academic to openly come out and say such a thing .
Voting time It is with great conviction that I voted in favour of Mr Casa 's report .
Missing traders then fail to remit the VAT to the national exchequer .
I hope that Mexico will have a successful outcome .
For technical reasons , SWIFT has to transfer bulk data , thereby violating the basic principles of EU data-protection law such as necessity and proportionality .
Why hide behind the Commission ?
Transfer and storage are , in other words , by definition disproportionate under the terms of the interim agreement and the Council does not address a European solution for the supervision of data exchange .
This is not about a battle of wills between the Council and the European Parliament nor is it about transatlantic relations .
That , Council , is the only way .
TFTP is not , and cannot be considered to be , consistent with the strongest European traditions on civil liberties .
In the short time that has been allocated to me , I want , on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , to set out three important basic conditions that we think are essential in evaluating the issue of the potential introduction of body scanners , which were not long ago being pushed as the miracle cure .
There are technologies that do meet all of these requirements , meaning that x-rays , radiographs and naked images must be outmoded , which is where we are going wrong at the moment .
If such spots are seen , the passengers in question are checked separately on the spot .
Commissioner , first of , I would like to wish you the best of luck in your new role .
I do not think , Commissioner , that we can accept that , and just sweep it under the carpet by arguing that many other sectors in Europe will benefit .
The Council has known about this problem for over two years and has done nothing in that time to deal with it .
When have we ever seen Hamas investigate its own actions ?
I should like to join my fellow Member and also you , Commissioner , in making quite clear our regret that a number of individuals with significant responsibilities in Belgium have sought to pass responsibility for the accident on to Europe or have at least given that impression .
Such a development plan exists .
In my country , a number of questions have been raised as to the nature of Europe 's approach to the railways .
Secondly , the Regulation on passengers ' rights contains a paragraph we hoped would never be needed : it concerns advance payments for people killed or injured in rail accidents .
By way of conclusion , Mr President , I should like to say that we must not lose sight of the fact that the railways are still among the safest means of transport around .
When I look at the infrastructure of the SNCB , the neglect is striking .
The report also envisages a strengthening of the parliamentary committees and the political groups .
This operation costs EUR 13.3 million on an annual basis , EUR 8.832 million of which is for assistants ' allowances .
In addition , I fear that this money will be used in large part for the recruitment of non-accredited assistants under national wage terms .
In addition , whilst the report does recognise that there is a serious problem of overfishing and that sustainability must form the starting point for the policy , it fails to recognise that fleet capacity and the subsidy and quota systems are at the root of this problem .
Only 5 % of world leaders are women .
Women and girls suffer oppression , particularly in Muslim countries , where there are underlying religious causes .
International Women 's Day , 8 March .
I harbour a very healthy scepticism about its implementation .
( Applause ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as our new Commissioner has already said , the legislative framework is no longer suited to today 's reality of a greatly changed travel market , which has given rise to very many problems and a great deal of frustration , not only among consumers but also among travel agents and tour operators .
Just recently , as a result of the problems with the Eurostar , we saw thousands of tourists running into problems because they were not given any compensation for hotels or theatre tickets they had booked .
This needs to be defined much more clearly , as consumers are inundated with information via the Internet but this is far from reliable and can even cause significant harm : in extreme cases , people have paid rent for holiday apartments that do not even exist .
Consumer rights must be clarified and stricter and more specific information requirements must apply in the case also of force majeure and a change in the range of travel services offered .
What we are calling for is a comprehensive impact assessment , covering not only the 6.3 billion positive consequences but also the negative impact ; this has been an omission on the Commission 's part .
If annual accounts are no longer compulsory and thus lost as a source of information , the only remaining possibility is to request the documents prepared for tax purposes .
That brings me to the first big issue , namely that of cartels .
High fines are an effective tool but
