implement its programmes such as mine action urgently , in times of crisis or when lives are at stake .
It seems to us that this was the underlying motive behind Mr Patten 's proposal for the rapid reaction facility .
I hope this is the case and I would ask for a reassurance on this point from the Commissioner .
It is a pity that the term " Rapid Reaction Facility " has been used for what after all should be a procedural matter , a financial management instrument .
It is easily confused with " Rapid Reaction Force " ; it has been confused in the media and even in Parliament 's own session news this week .
Perhaps in the interest of clarity and to avoid confusion , the Commission could change the title to something like " Urgent Financing Facility" .
We support the principle as I have described it , but one or two unfortunate elements seem to have crept in .
Firstly , instead of referring to the facility in the context of CFSP and the Commission 's own first pillar external actions , it has been put into the context of the common security and defence policy .
Now we have expressed our concerns about the EU meddling in military matters on many occasions and our reservations have not been eased by developments at Nice .
This is a separate issue .
The Commission 's financial facility should not be mixed up with these defence issues .
Secondly , there is a thread of political correctness running through the proposal .
I am baffled for instance by the idea that the fight against gender discrimination would fall into the crisis management category , triggering the use of the rapid reaction facility .
Thirdly , for us more importantly , Mr Newton Dunn , the rapporteur , has taken the opportunity to introduce an amendment in pursuit of one of his pet subjects , namely the establishment of a European public security force , in other words a European gendarmerie or armed police .
This is the main reason why we cannot accept this report .
We do not want a European army and we certainly to not want a European police force .
We do want the Commission to carry out its external assistance with greater efficiency and we welcome measures to that effect .
Mr President , my party fully recognises the need for the developed countries to make available resources for international crises and for our response to be rapid and effective .
In this context , the Commission 's proposal looks attractive in that it provides the mechanisms for affording a response to crisis situations .
However , we believe that for our efforts to be both rapid and effective , they should be planned , funded and executed on a truly international scale , utilising the resources and the capabilities of the whole free world , including the technical genius and the good will of the United States .
The mechanisms for ensuring this already exist in the form of the United Nations and its various agencies .
Although imperfect and always capable of reform , these agencies have provided good service and have relieved much suffering .
For the future , the way to ensure that responses are maximised is to continue working through these agencies , ensuring that resources are used wisely and efficiently .
As far as the Commission 's proposal is concerned , this is simply reinventing the wheel , putting the political ambitions of the European Union before the needs of suffering people .
People in crises need a European rapid reaction facility as much as a fish needs a bicycle .
We should abandon these grandiose plans and instead support and develop the existing agencies which have a better track record that the EU will ever have .
Mr President , in discussing this matter I very much welcome the proposal from the Swedish Foreign Ministry that I have just seen today for a goal-oriented action plan for conflict prevention , because as I have said before , we in the European Union should be sending a philosophy for peace to areas of conflict and not just armies .
The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution and that is something we tend to forget .
Look at the last century : the first half of it was marked by the worst conflict the world had ever seen : two world wars and millions of people dead and killed .
Yet who could have foreseen that in the second half of that century those same people would come together in the European Union .
As I know from my own experience , the principles at the heart of European Union will resolve conflict wherever they are applied in the world .
Therefore do you not think it is a very positive and sensible suggestion for the European Union to have a department that does precisely that ?
In other words , the Commission should have a department of peace and reconciliation and a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation to go to areas of conflict in advance and apply the principles of conflict resolution , particularly those principles at the heart of European Union itself .
Mr President , I am very sorry to have heard in the debate MEPs from my own region in the UK from different parties say that they will be opposing this report .
I am pleased to support the rapid reaction facility and I do so as a Member of Parliament 's Development Committee .
In the week that 600 people lay dead after the earthquake in El Salvador , this European Union must be able to move more quickly just as we failed to do in response to the impact of hurricane Mitch in that same country back in 1998
