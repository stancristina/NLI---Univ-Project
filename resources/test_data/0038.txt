, one further consequence of the Council ' s incapacity to act is , in actual fact , that it is the courts , instead of the politicians responsible , who take the decisions .
The Eurosceptics talk such a lot about democracy , but it can never be democratic to omit to take the necessary decisions and , in that way , to consign people to insecurity and to give the courts a degree of influence which politicians ought to have .
Effective implementation of the EU' s environment directives in the Member States is naturally of great significance in two ways : firstly , in terms of environmental protection - which is , of course , the whole purpose of the directives - but also in terms of our not causing confidence to be lost in EU legislative work through the Member States ' being able for a long time to get away with not implementing the legislation which they themselves have helped bring about in the Council of Ministers .
The Council has , of course , been rather irritated about the fact that Parliament is looking over its shoulders , but I think that the work on the reports has revealed how slack the majority of the Member States are about implementing EU legislation .
We often , of course , hear fine speeches about grand European visions and the Europe of the future , sometimes from Members of this Parliament .
It is also interesting to note that those countries which are often regarded as rather reluctant and critical in relation to certain aspects of EU cooperation are in reality those countries which comply best with EU decisions .
I was pleased to hear Mrs Wallstr√∂m ' s remarks on the reports .
I think , at any rate , that Parliament ought to provide as much support as possible for this work .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to congratulate my fellow MEP , Mr Parish , on an extremely good report .
I think that the image of farming - due to the many outbreaks of disease , dioxin scandals etc - is , at the moment , one of the really major problems .
It is undoubtedly very important that there should be transparency and that people should be made more aware of production methods and of the modern stalls and cowsheds that now exist , as well as being given information about the common agricultural policy and about the ways in which fields and animals are looked after .
No one has in recent years questioned the many millions of euros we pump into training lawyers , engineers and doctors .
I would also add that a conflict of this kind could escalate if , as providers of humanitarian aid , we were to choose as partners to help us implement the aid , organisations which could be seen as not being neutral in the conflict .
I understand the nature of the conflict very well indeed , as well as the feelings associated with the conflict because of its nature , but I believe that , in carrying out the task before us , what we are doing is right .
Mr President , like others in this Chamber , I am one of the fortunate group of people who has visited Bangladesh , not several times like the Commissioner but in such a way as to be able to form some modest impression , and it is against that background that I wish to emphasise how important it is for cooperation between the EU and Bangladesh to be continued and developed further .
Nor do religious wars .
Bangladesh can only hold its own if we are willing to help the country , and that means both the EU , as the Commissioner mentioned , and also the Member States , among which I can call attention to my own country , Denmark , which is one of the largest providers of aid in the area .
There is the need for good governance and support for democracy .
There is the need to continue helping to promote women ' s independence , for example by continuing and developing further our support for microcredits .
In this connection , I should like to say that women were precisely those who left me feeling most encouraged following my visit .
We cannot be satisfied with microcredits .
We must move on to the next phase of development , whether it be concerned with textiles or something else .
I come , then , to my third point , which the Commissioner perhaps takes a rather different view of .
Young men and women must be able to report for peace-keeping and peace-making service in the confident assurance that everything is being done in the interests of their safety .
It was , of course , out of regard for civilians that we intervened in Kosovo and Bosnia , and we did so on sound moral grounds .
If there are any reasons at all for concern , alternatives to depleted uranium must be invested in and , until certainty has been arrived at , its use may have to be suspended .
We shall hold him to this , and he will also be held to account if the promise is not kept .
It did in fact produce results and paved the way for democracy in the Balkans .
It was a moral duty to take that action , and we can be proud that we complied with that duty .
At the same time , however , we would emphasise that it is in practice impossible to separate desirable civil intervention from unacceptable military intervention .
We have therefore supported this own-initiative report which proposes greater efforts to combat the problems created by differences in social and fiscal systems .
