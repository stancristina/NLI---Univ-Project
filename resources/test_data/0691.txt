it is voted on later .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the passion with which Mr Belder has delivered his report on the Roma and on the East European situation .
It is the most extreme versions of racism on the edges of Europe which we are disturbed about .
When the debate about Austria - which has many elements , many complexities - was unfolding we realised that on the edges of Austria there were significant candidate countries which , while they were making progress in economic , progress in social aspects , represented a real problem with regard to their treatment of minorities .
In Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Hungary there were significant problems with the treatment of the Roma .
What we must realise is that , as we enlarge Europe , we have a significant responsibility for ensuring that any country that wishes to join the European Union must also reform the way that it treats minorities and the way that it treats the whole question of race discrimination .
I would make two or three other very simple points .
What the Roma situation shows , what Mr Belder 's report shows , is that an extreme version of discrimination clearly exists throughout the European Union , otherwise we would not be discussing this issue .
There are many questions we must discuss : How strongly will we push the question of Article 13 ?
Do we really want race discrimination protection throughout the European Union ?
The answer is yes .
We must have it quickly and we must have comprehensive legislation .
If we look around the European institutions and Parliament , we realise there are very few faces from ethnic minorities .
That situation is improving , but ultimately we have institutions which are bereft of representation .
It is representation and other similar issues that we must now tackle .
Racism is a complex issue .
We have begun to discuss it adequately but we have so much further to go .
Mr President , in this great debate about human rights it is surprising how infrequently we hear children mentioned - the people who are least able to protect themselves in relation to human rights .
Children are actually invisible in the EU Treaties .
Animals have rights , children do not .
Yet children are affected by the laws that the EU passes and the single market .
The electronic revolution seems to have given more freedom to exploiters , the paedophiles and the pornographers , than to industrialists .
In a twenty-first century where we regard ourselves as civilised there is still a slave trade in which children are bought and sold for sexual exploitation throughout the world .
We have problems in the candidate countries .
We have a scandal at the moment in Latvia which allegedly goes to the very heart of the government .
We have pictures on our TV almost every day of child soldiers fighting in conflicts throughout the world .
And of course , we have familiar tales of child labour .
We have to take tougher action .
We have to bring children up the agenda .
This is not to say that the EU should start to be responsible for children 's policy but we could start by ensuring that EU laws are child-proof .
We should ensure that measures developed by the Commission have a specific children 's dimension .
We should ensure that there is somebody in the Commission with responsibility for child matters .
In 1998 my own government appointed a child rights expert from Save The Children to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop strategies and practical projects in relation to children 's rights .
Why can we not do the same ?
We also have in Great Britain a Children 's Select Committee able to investigate child abuses and to interrogate expert witnesses .
Why can we not do the same ?
Can we make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a section relating to children ?
I know we have communications .
We have action plans and conventions but what we want is action , not good intentions .
The English philosopher John Locke once said that a country without law is a country without freedom .
Fifty years after the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights , twenty years after the Helsinki Final Act , ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and one year after the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty , there are constitutional provisions remaining in the heart of Europe which belong to the medieval age - provisions which have no place in a modern Europe .
For instance , Victor Emmanuel of Italy was forced to leave his native Italy as an uncomprehending nine-year old child , and for fifty-three years has been unable to return .
If he sails from his home in Corsica in the direction of Italian territorial waters , coastguards are mobilised using modern satellite technology instructing him with loudspeakers to turn back .
His twenty-eight-year-old son has only been to Italy once when his plane was diverted to Milan airport because of bad weather .
The plane was surrounded by police guards and he was told not to step off the plane .
What has he got to do with what his great-grandfather did during the Fascist era ? 80 % of Italians in a recent poll believe these people should be allowed to return without restrictions .
Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State .
This is not , as some have tried to claim , an issue affecting only a few people ; it goes to the heart of the European Union 's commitment to respect the Convention on Human Rights , to its own Treaties and to the rule of law .
There is much talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
