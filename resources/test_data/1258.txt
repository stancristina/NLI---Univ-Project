terms .
If this proves not to be the case , at least the responsibilities will be clear and easily identifiable .
By adopting this report , the European Union is giving an initial response to a call for justice which has hitherto been disregarded .
The first is the case of two Italian Alitalia pilots , Alberto Nassetti and Pierpaolo Racchetti , who died in France following an accident , in unexplained circumstances , during a test flight of an aeroplane .
Six years have gone by and , beset by hundreds of problems and prohibitive legal costs , their families are still waiting for justice , they are waiting to know the cause of these deaths and who , if any , the responsible parties are .
.
Ladies and gentlemen , the original foundations of a European Company Statute were laid over 30 years ago .
These events involve a huge amount of work , they are complex and they are held in a different place each time .
As you will remember , Madam President , the last time that I addressed this House , just before the Summit , I said that we needed a treaty with genuine added value .
Little or no progress was made on the sensitive issues of cohesion , tax regulation and social legislation .
Lastly , I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Chirac and the French Prime Minister , Mr Jospin , for making it possible to put paid to the main ambiguities of our commercial policy .
These changes have been accompanied by the launching of major reform of the way in which the Commission is organised .
This was inevitable given the approach taken , but the outcome was regrettable for two reasons : firstly because it made a qualified majority more difficult and a blocking minority accordingly easier , whereas logically , in an expanding Union , the exact opposite is required ; ( Applause ) and secondly because it has made the decision-making process even more complex , which runs counter to the legibility and transparency for which the citizens are calling .
This will enable us to move on to welcoming the new Members , in line with the Helsinki conclusions .
( Applause ) Like the Community structure itself , the process being used to produce institutional change is under stress and needs to be changed .
Mr President , I voted for the report on regulations relating to the performance of clinical trials with a view to finding new medicinal products .
In fact , I feel that it is right for all the States of the European Union to be on the same summer time " .
Mr President , in the coming weeks we shall have to carry out a rigorous , in-depth analysis of the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference and the fundamental questions which it has thrown up .
Well , the appropriate responses to both the institutional and political fundamental questions , which are our most negative legacy from the Nice Council , must be sought in dialogue , in the evaluation and development process which must be pursued under the title " the future of the Union " .
Mr President , President Chirac has played down the negative reactions of many of the Members to the outcome of Nice , describing them as unrealistic and not pragmatic .
We truly hope this will be the last Intergovernmental Conference , considering that the Summit revealed a breakdown in Community solidarity .
This is our next battle .
The principle of European military defence was accepted but , for now , its function has not been clearly defined .
Parliament and the Commission have declared that they would abide by it .
We are on the eve of eastward enlargement , a turning point which is throwing the strategy of doing things step by step into crisis .
We need to set in motion a large-scale debate on the future of Europe : this must be the post-Nice process if we want to revitalise Europeanism in a profoundly different environment .
This must not become a precedent in our institutions .
I would be extremely happy if you could dispel this doubt , for I am sure that all will then proceed very quickly .
The other reason why we will vote against the motion is because , with regard to the request to establish the post of European Public Prosecutor , it is not enough to have included a reference to the juge des libert√©s but we must ensure , once and for all , that there is a system of guarantees : indeed a Prosecutor alone with no system of guarantees is a step not towards democracy but towards an inquisition-like system which is likely to be dangerous , so much so that the proposal was not adopted at Nice .
This proposal could not be considered to be as laissez-faire as some say it is .
He states in the explanatory statement that he was forced to seek a compromise between hundreds of largely homogeneous amendments .
With regard to this , it would be as well for the Commission to conduct an inquiry to ascertain whether a private postal monopoly is not being created in Europe in the face of the process of liberalisation of the public postal monopolies , and to indicate what , in its opinion , the maximum permissible concentrations should be .
The questions that we should therefore be asking are rather : how great a monopoly is necessary in order to guarantee the provision of these means ?
It appears that the final solution is acceptable because it reconciles the need for competition with liberalisation and , most importantly , with the obligation for a universal service , and we know that there will be subsequent stages which will make it possible to assess the situation
