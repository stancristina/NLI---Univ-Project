They are root causes of violent conflict and our assistance must target them .
I just wish to add that these strategic papers were for the first time drawn up after prior consultation of the Member States , the World Bank , UNDP and , in some instances , the United States .
But I have no doubt whatsoever that we have to have a more mature political dialogue with our ACP partners and discuss the questions I have just referred to on a mature basis .
Firstly , since we cannot pay for or give assistance with any military aspects , should demobilization with the assistance of the army be seen as a military or non-military matter ?
It is a matter of rebuilding towns and villages from scratch .
Mr President , you only need to take a cursory glance at the budgetary developments in recent years , the restrictive tendencies resulting therefrom and certain rules that have been imposed , to be able to predict what has now been formally announced by the Member States in terms of finances .
As for the latter , the current beneficiaries will see their access considerably reduced .
I think that that would make sense and I do not know , since I have not yet had the time to read this enormous document , whether that is going to be possible .
The communication between European cultures through books and reading is being contemplated with a derisory amount of 7 million ECU for the years 1997-98.
What can justify the inexplicable contradiction in the European Union between the priority that it claims to give to a programme and the insufficient means that it makes available for it ?
I am certain that the next treaty , not the Amsterdam Treaty , but the next one , which this IGC helped to prepare negatively , will give cultural policy the central place that it must now occupy in the project for a Europe of citizens .
How many other people in Europe work between 1000 and 2000 hours a year ?
I do not see the same concern with fighting fraud or the billions of ECU of unpaid VAT , or the harmonization of tax systems wallowing in a criminal system in which violators are punished but where violations are paid for at bargain basement prices in today 's Europe .
May I remind my colleagues that I look after my own health and I do not ask them to 'look after my health ' - especially as in Portuguese the expression also means 'have me buried ' !
Smokers have a pact with the devil .
What is written is written and I take full responsibility and should like to say that I am very honoured to be defending those who work in the fields and grow crops , defending the environment and helping to discover varieties of tobacco that are less harmful to the health , and improving quality .
Thirdly , restructuring a farming sector like tobacco cannot be done overnight , it is very painful , very difficult and it is therefore unrealistic to think that reducing aids would speed up restructuring .
These are , however , objectives requiring the safeguard of personal interests , with compliance with rules and a harmonization of criteria .
Yet political declarations and international conferences are not enough to determine lasting changes .
Commitments without deadlines , figures or penalties do not fool anyone . on the Jarzembowski report ( A4-0243/97 ) The steps taken for heavy goods vehicles to pay tolls to use roads should be given our full support as it is the right way to take part in their funding and an incentive to use means of transport that are less polluting and lead to less congestion - such as rail , sea and rivers .
Contrary to what some people think , consumption would not go down , public health would not be protected , only the profits of the multinational processing companies would go up .
As they were rejected , the report is now a basis for alternatives to be found to the Commission 's proposal on reforming the tobacco COM , which merits our overall agreement and has even included amendments that we tabled during the debate in the Committee on Agriculture .
I shall not go on and shall instead take this opportunity to stress that , among the SOCRATES objectives , there are language-learning actions , vital in order to create understanding between the fifteen and the candidates for accession .
In that way , Mr President , we should in the near future establish a European language policy based on a broad consensus and solid academic , political and functional criteria .
We are talking about the local power of those of us who have been elected , and who remain close to the people and share with them their daily traditions and the appeals of modernity which can undermine identity .
Mr President , in the United States , I once asked a businessman why such a large part of his budget was allocated to cultural promotion , and he replied : ' it is the most effective way of creating better customers ' .
How absurd ?
We all agree , but when it comes to revising the treaty , we see what happens : zilch !
Mr President , at last a significant morning to deal with a significant issue !
It is not enough to define policies full of good intentions : if their implementation and the results obtained are not studied , they may not be sufficiently effective unless the politicians responsible are aware of what is happening .
We hope that this interparliamentary conference in Lisbon will help the Commission to draft a more concrete report for 1997 , effectively
