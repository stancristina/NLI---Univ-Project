We are eager to see , Commissioner , how you will explain to us in October that the hurdles you have erected here today have now been overcome .
I will therefore be equally straightforward in expressing my thanks to you .
What is the state of child care in that accession country ?     Commissioner , again and again we are shocked when cases of child abuse come to light .
Is any thought being given to this ?     .
But my answer today is : we must all do our homework at home , because that is the only way we will achieve our objective .     .
It is a very welcome initiative .
As an exception – and that is part of the compromise – it will be permissible to add it to feed for animals up to a certain age .
We are pleased that we are now no longer having to deal with the start or the height of the crisis but with its tailing off .
Secondly , the introduction of three risk categories simplifies risk assessment without jeopardising safety .
I would have preferred it to be clearly separated .
We in the European Parliament simply do not want fishmeal or any other animal products in cattle feed .
In my country , zero tolerance resulted in tens of thousands of tonnes of sugar beet having to be destroyed because animal protein was found in it when it was delivered .
The third point is that there should really be a tolerance of up to 0.5 % for animal protein accidentally present in feed ; be it a mouse , bird , small animal or bone in the field .
As Konrad Adenauer once said , there is no law against becoming cleverer .
The compromise reached , that is , that ruminants may be fed fishmeal until they are one year old , is an absolute maximum , in my opinion , and is really most accommodating to the fishing industry .
The budgetary resources for financing European standardisation must be approved annually within the framework of the budgetary procedure .
If carried out quickly , efficiently and well , standardisation offers prospects of gaining market shares in this field .
Despite this positive assessment , European standardisation and its institutional framework need to be improved and strengthened .
In this respect , I hope that we can make progress with these issues , too , within the framework of the Internal Market Strategy – with which not only the Commission but undoubtedly Parliament , too , will be concerned in the coming months .     – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to express my particular thanks for the very constructive spirit that has characterised this debate , and for the consensus that has emerged from it .
That was just an aside .
We members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs shall take him at his word .
Unfortunately , this idea is not popular with all European governments , who often lack the political will to make budgetary reforms .
Prior to the introduction of the euro , public budgets tended to be the preserve of experts .
For this reason , we do not need pessimism , but rather action , particularly with regard to the improvement of the economic climate and the further integration of the internal market .
What we have managed to secure is a reform of the Budget legislation , the simplification of the Budget Regulations , certification of EU programmes and reporting responsibilities for the Member States , more reliable financial planning and clear agreements when new agencies are to be established .
I should like to conclude by expressing my deep gratitude to the Commissioner with responsibility for budgets .
The mere fact that we have been able to achieve a result on a matter that is central to the European Union is something I regard as a triumph in itself .
Again , I thank you for the good negotiations and for your willingness to allow me the time today to say what I have said .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have considered these questions , and there are two main points I would like to put before you .
It is not just the people in the new Member States who are looking to the European Union for support .
Where the Council , regrettably , had left nothing over in the ‘Citizens ’ Europe’ , we have created a margin , in order that not everything should be used up in the multiannual programme , with no chance of doing anything more .
That is what we need to concentrate on ; that is what will win the European people over , but what has happened now ?
This House hears what the specialist committees have had to say on the subject , about development cooperation being unsatisfactory , about education , youth and research not being up to any kind of standard , about defective communications on our security missions overseas , about the dramatic reversal in rural development .
I am grateful to those who have negotiated on our behalf .
That is what the directly-elected European Parliament has managed to do with a budget like this one .
Certain Members of your House who negotiated with us – Mr Mulder and Mr Walter among them – have said that your House believes it has succeeded in getting the most out that it could .
Parliament has not merely bared its teeth , but has put forward simple and practical ideas and suggestions .
It is in everyone’s interest that a Europe characterised by such ‘egoisms ’ should steadily be done away with .     .
We want the European Union as a whole to
