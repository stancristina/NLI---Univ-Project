When it comes to creating a system designed to give a second chance , I share the views of the rapporteur .
However , I do not agree with the rapporteur in connection with the detailed plans of action for education .
The proposal made by the Commission is beneficial in many ways , but it is important that it is supplemented by the additional proposals and amendments made by the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
It is especially important that a substantially greater level of investment in research and development is made in this area .
This is , in my opinion , a growing problem as the vehicle parc is simply getting too old .
Of course , there is no doubting the serious implications of the possible close down of the Renault factory in Vilvoorde in Belgium .
I believe that we politicians have a greater opportunity for influence here , as parts of Europe 's car industry are already leaders , in areas such as for example increased safety measures .
I am convinced that Europe 's car industry can succeed in taking up the challenge and developing an alternative which is both competitive and commercially feasible .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Morgan for the work that she has done .
The main objective for us social democrats is to fight against the devastating unemployment affecting millions of people , many of them young .
To accept this does not mean that we are allowing technology to rule our lives .
Technology must be introduced in the classroom at an early stage and teachers must be trained and supported to enable them to exploit the vast potential of information technology .
It is in my opinion important to adjust EU price levels to those of the world market .
Commissioner Bjerregaard has brought us good news .
The farming industry would therefore do well to recognise that this method may be used for making environmentally friendly investments .
SEM 2000 has many beneficial part-projects .
In addition , not enough has been done on the personnel side of things .
I would be grateful for information about the number of people working for the Commission and maybe some figures as this would make it easier for people to assess whether the work is being carried out in a more financially efficient manner .
The matter cannot be waved aside with the excuse that you do not know anything about it .
Thank you for that brief reply .
In this case , I cannot see any profit for anyone involved .
For the Community this must be closer to 10 , 20 or 30 times more , in addition to the indirect effects of freight becoming more expensive .
May I thank the Council for its reply , even if I think it was somewhat negative .
These countries will be worst hit .
Employment is more important than abolishing duty-free trade .
The first question is : How many people will be without work if the EU decision to abolish duty-free trade between Member States is implemented in 1999 ?
However , the question also concerns a very specific political reality that I am sure Mr President is aware of , i .e . that the majority of the Swedish Parliament probably will decide not to be part of a single currency from 1999 .
Surely this is something on which the council has a viewpoint .
For a Member State such as Sweden , the question of military alliances is very important .
I do understand that the members of the Council cannot say at the present time what will come out of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Not , however , to elicit a reply from the Council as we can all read the documentation and understand the position of the presidency in this question .
I do still believe that there is good reason for general discussion here , particularly over the fact that the Third Pillar area is not working satisfactorily .
We need a majority decision to deal with questions concerning internal security .
That is why I would like to stress the impossibility of giving a satisfactory answer .
Mr President , as regards the voting on the Van Lancker report , item 49 , the second part of the final resolution , I am mentioned in the voting protocol to have voted yes .
Madame President , this is a good report that is being presented , the result of thorough and extensive work .
As mentioned earlier by Mr Tomlinson : if a mere 1 per cent of the transits are fraudulent then 4.5 billion ECU will be lost to us , or in the case of 2 per cent , up to 9 billion ECU will be lost to us .
So far , this has not been the case .
A computer system is however not one-hundredper-cent safe against tampering .
Criminals are well organised and exploit all of the system 's loopholes and are at present one step ahead of Member States and the European Union .
New technology is a must .
The Commission and Member States must actively carry out the recommendations made in the report .
We must lead the way for the new Member States to be respected and not impose religious or cultural restrictions but be open and democratic .
We strongly oppose the proposal from the Dutch presidency to alter the anti-discrimination clause and to remove matters concerning sexual preference , age and disability .
Furthermore , it is also necessary to change Clause 23 to specify that a civil foreign policy within the framework of an pan-European security system is needed and that all decisions should be unanimous .
We have simply not had a chance to look at these proposals properly .
I do on the other hand encounter constant criticism about the lack
