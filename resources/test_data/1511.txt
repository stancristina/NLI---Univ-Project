resolutions .
We do not intend to say give it or withhold it , we simply want to point out the conditions under which and the reason why this money is being given .
However , I should like to make a few comments .
Take a look at Turkey .
It is because of its political system that Turkey radiates these crises .
In this sense , given that these relations gamble with the political face of Europe and with Europe ' s prospects and principles , I am certain that Commissioner Verheugen will want to assure us that the Commission , as the guardian of these principles , intends to base the integration process for Turkey firmly on these principles .
We , as Greeks , want Turkey in the European Union , we want a democratic Turkey , because a democratic Turkey will be the beginning of the end of crises in the region as a whole , crises which we have lived with for many , many years and from which none of us has profited .
In the view of the Communist Party of Greece , they should be controlled by the public sector .
As far as we are concerned , the problem is not whether information will be controlled by American or European monopolies .
Yesterday , I came to Strasbourg on Olympic Airways flight 165 from Athens to Frankfurt .
When the plane arrived at Frankfurt airport , it was immediately surrounded by German police .
The worst thing is that this was not an exception ; this , I was told , is something that happens systematically at Frankfurt airport when planes arrive from Greece .
Mr President , I would like to begin by warmly congratulating the European Commission and especially Commissioner Vitorino , on its extremely constructive legislative proposal on the issue of family reunification .
This is exactly what is happening with this draft directive on the reunification of the families of refugees and migrants .
But at the same time I would like to point out and to highlight the enormous contribution that refugees and migrants make to the economic development of our countries , through their work and through taxation .
I am fully in agreement with the outcome of the conciliation procedure and I would like to commend both Mr Bouwman and the other Members who sat on the Conciliation Committee and Mrs de Palacio and her services for ensuring that we worked together to achieve this positive outcome .
But , here we are .
Only in this way can the work of the Commission and our own work progress more quickly , especially in our own committee , where there are many issues that directly affect our citizens .
Mr President , as a new Member of the European Parliament and as a permanent member of the Conciliation Committee for the first time , I have to say that I was satisfied with this procedure , which saw representatives of the main institutions of the European Union making every effort to achieve a happy medium , that is to say , between the possible and the feasible , bearing in mind existing conditions and possibilities , which are of course not the same for all Europe ' s ports .
It also leaves each port the option of having its own charging policy .
Something must be done .
These rules must contain clear conditions for all the countries involved , through which rivers that cross more than one country flow .
I will be able to give you a more complete text at a future sitting .
We are currently at the debating stage .
I have more or less the same statistics as you .
What prospects do we have of finding out at some point , albeit from one action if not more generally ?
I apologise for having to say this , but I have run out of patience .
And I think that what you have said thus far also speaks for itself .
Specifically on training , what do you believe and what do you propose asking the Greek Government to change in the 2000-2006 period by comparison with the previous period , during which we all have the impression that things were not going well , despite the fact that the statistics were not accurate ?
Mr President , the proposal for a directive which we are debating today is designed to restrict the marketing and use of azocolourants used in fabric dyes and leather goods .
However , we need a directive in order to harmonise the internal market and prevent such unilateral regulations .
I should like to refer to just two of them .
That is the purpose of Amendment No 3 .
Importers are , however , advised to develop a quality mark .
However , the substance which Mr Ferrer proposes is already included in the annex .
It is precisely because this is such a crucial issue that I should like to make two comments .
What we are witnessing , in fact , is the emergence of two productive systems and two social models .
One in which producers operate by analysing the responsibilities and costs imposed by the system and another in which they operate to the detriment of the former and society as a whole .
The various categories of people which supply it , such as immigrants , minorities , children , women , moonlighters etc . cannot all be dealt with in the same way .
Why ?
Why ?
Thank goodness we have President Buffet and the French Presidency which , I think , has taken up and taken a leading role in the matter of unifying and developing and strengthening our sporting structures .
Mr President , sport , like culture , education and health , is gradually being hijacked by commercialisation and the so-called law of the market
