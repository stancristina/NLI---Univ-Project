How much longer will Parliament feel obliged to express its confidence in this way , while waiting for an eventual SEM 2000 ?
Clearly , where there is underconsumption of appropriations , we must not persevere with pointless expenditure , but cut excessive budgetary estimates and take account of these facts , these observations repeated year on year , during the revision of the financial perspectives for 1999 .
Mr President , at a time when the peace process is in a critical state , victim of premeditated aggression and multiple provocation , we will not dwell here on the opening of a tunnel in the Arab town , the repeated cordoning off which prevents an entire population from moving around , the installation of new extremist colonists , the collective reprisals , the deaths resulting from attacks , and the repression .
There can be no compromise on this point .
The idea of mutual recognition of suspension or withdrawal of a driving licence may be perfectly acceptable in itself , but I simply do not think it has any place in a text which seeks to define a system of harmonized codes to be entered on driving licences .
Our Parliament is preoccupied with the defence of human rights in the world .
Excessive taxation .
Commissioner Silguy amplified this disturbing fact by verbally adding that Europe lost 1.5 million jobs at that time .
This mechanism rarely operates ( the last time it was used was in 1993 , for the benefit of Italy ) which is understandable because at the moment each country still has the right to pursue a separate economic policy , even if it is more or less coordinated with those of the others .
Whatever the case , if we , as a European Parliament , want to contribute to a good outcome and the development of mutually advantageous cooperation with China , we must not proceed as recommended in the common resolution , and my group has not signed it .
I think we must impress on the Chinese leaders that Hong Kong should become the model , that the system in force in Hong Kong should be exported to become the only system throughout China .
Other factors should also be considered , for example inspection , maintenance , elimination of old vehicles , improvement in traffic conditions , use of liquefied oil gas or natural gas for public transport , not forgetting electric vehicles of course , which are non-pollutant and silent .
I also want to remind Parliament that emission standards for new vehicles have been the subject of seven successive sets of measures since 1970 , decimating emissions from private cars .
The amendments from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection will lead to better air quality and encourage the use of bio-fuels , a more effective agricultural outlet than uncultivated land - commonly called fallow and not very respectful of our desire for harmonious land development .
Mr President , the proposal for a regulation presented by the Commission is intended to perpetuate stocks while improving the protection of immature fish .
Regarding the single net rule , it would pose major practical problems for multi-purpose vessels .
The rate of selectivity per species is therefore obviously not the same for the North as for the South .
All this is understandable .
I would be surprised if the request for a roll call is directed to Article 3 , part 3 , first paragraph of the directive .
I believe indeed that a decision must not be taken without evaluating the overall situation of the industry .
It is based on these principles and trying to combine them as intelligently as possible that I have reached my decision on how to vote .
Unfortunately , the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice has not been applied uniformly in the Member States .
Where then does this problem come from ?
Secondly , the draft treaty between Belarus and Russia can only be analysed within the much wider scope of the re-structuring of the CIS , a problem which cannot be put to one side , but which is nevertheless completely forgotten in the common resolution .
In brief , we are terribly behind .
You must admit that it is little ridiculous to ask that nobody should intervene , while those who are intervening prevent our access to the refugees .
What to do , how to help end the obscene contrast between the riches of Zaire and the depredation of the Zairean people , whose collective inheritance nevertheless represents 10 % of world copper reserves - of 3 to 7 % purity against a world average of 1 % , 80 % of workable reserves of cobalt - the price of which has doubled since 1991 , and deposits of diamonds , gold and uranium .
It matters that the European Union should take a stand on this subject .
Bosnia-Herzegovina :
Bulgaria , with its problems of an exceptional magnitude , raises the question as to whether the cooperation mechanisms with the European Union are up to the challenge .
Moreover , in its report , the Commission notes that the compensation mechanism by examination has remained the exception , whilst achieving adaptation training courses has not really caused any difficulties .
This is one of the requests we are expressing .
Even though the Commission communication does to its credit , break from the paternalistic approach adopted for far too long , it cannot overcome the problem posed by Article 235 of the Treaty .
As regards the second objective - better integration of developing countries in the world economy - I am much more sceptical .
We are agreed and I am sure that my conservative friends will certainly want to make it known that they voted against that report
