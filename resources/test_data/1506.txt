That would be made possible if we were to invest more in achieving diversification , something to which we are committed not merely as a concept , but also as an objective .
Is it possible , in such an eventuality , to connect up certain providers or consumers ?
Please allow me , though , to pass over the report and make a few brief comments on competition policy in general .
They are indeed making a considerable contribution to putting beyond all doubt this House’s willingness to make Europe more transparent .
Grateful though I am for this report , what I propose goes well beyond it : we in this House , as the representatives of the European citizens , should present the Council with an ultimatum , with the end of this year as the deadline .
Environmental standards , consumer protection standards , animal welfare standards and social minimum standards must also be laid down as goals for the WTO .
Making this a normative requirement was a milestone in the history of international trade relations , and it was and is the right thing to do .
Then there is democracy : as regards the democratic dimension , what I regard as definitely necessary is greater consultation – not only within the Inter-Parliamentary Union , but also with this House , with national and regional assemblies and with the public .
It is to be regretted that neither the Commission nor we Europeans as a whole have succeeded in resolving the issue of geographical designations of origin , important though it is , and we are talking here not only about places and names , but also about the knowledge contained in the products that come from these places .
It is important that I should point out that the growth and employment strategy is based on a three-year cycle .
Anyone who brings fresh air into this debate has my backing , for , if we consider the economic situation , we simply cannot afford to carry on letting debates be ritualistic and keeping fresh air out of this House and out of our debates .
I urge you , once and for all , to put cooperation with this House on a proper institutional footing , and then we will no longer need – and I thank Mr García-Margallo for pointing this out – to spend our time merely writing own-initiative reports , but discussions in this House will be on a different and stable basis .     – Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner Verheugen said that the right place for the employment policy guidelines is at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy , and in that he was right .
Only if there is real change in policy will Europe be able to face the great challenges in an effective way .     – Mr President , the task of those in this House , such as myself , who are both MEPs and authors , must surely be , in an avant-garde and constructive way , to use criticism as a way of waking up the great – who must , being thus awakened – respond to our criticisms in a practical way .
We demand budget consolidation measures on the part of the states with excessive deficits , for failure to repair our social security and pensions systems will bar us from participation in global competition .
According to the German newspapers , the government had decided against allowing cheap workers into the country on the grounds that it wanted to protect its own labour market from an influx of cheap migrant labour from the neighbouring countries , but that is a load of nonsense ; the transitional periods do not keep the migrant workers out .
Fundamentally , my group agrees with Mr Őry that we do not actually need any transitional periods at all , but this report is scarcely likely to promote awareness of the need for greater social responsibility on the European labour market .
This sort of posturing does no more than risk leaving our single European project by the roadside .     – Mr President , a few weeks ago , we , in this House , voted on the services directive , with a majority endorsing a compromise intended to help maintain high social standards , under the slogan of ‘no social dumping’ .
I can still find no evidence of usable accompanying measures from the Commission , and it is all very well for you to laugh , Commissioner !
We did this out of a desire to express solidarity with our colleagues in promoting our group ’s concerns , whilst nevertheless remaining convinced that employment policy is not a matter for the EU , and that this should be dealt with by the Member States rather than by us here in Strasbourg or in Brussels .
Matters are now in the hands of the Council of Ministers .
In a report it produced in December , this House called for an independent agency on the American model .
I know from my own , very close , contacts with the public over recent months that the issue of ‘Better Lawmaking’ , along with everything that is associated with it – perhaps not as a slogan , for many of them do not know what it stands for , but as a principle – is one of the issues of greatest interest to them .
The Presidency of the Council is glad to see that the Commission is not only pursuing the ‘simplification of existing legislation ’ by means of a general weeding-out of the , but is also planning to include in this the outcome of the Council’s efforts in this area .
As was generally stressed today , impact assessments must be produced to the highest possible standards
