Mr President , this is obviously something worthy of debate , and is an issue that can be raised at the tripartite discussions , but for the moment we are in fact actively seeking a solution that is acceptable among the governments of the Member States specifically .     .
For example , in attempting to improve employment for young people , it may be important to enact various measures removing barriers to education and mobility .
Member States are also responsible for most of the other policies connected with this issue , such as education policy .
The Presidency may nevertheless have an important job to do in raising these issues , especially while the work of the Council of Ministers is being organised .
The Council will be presented with a report by the Employment Committee which examines the Member States’ national reform programmes , including their employment policies .
This had been done , for example , by developing the transition from education to employment .
During the Finnish presidential term , the Council will discuss two issues that directly relate to improving employment for young people .
Special attention needs to be paid to deprived young people .
In March , the European Council asked Member States to include young people and youth organisations in the implementation process relating to the European Youth Pact .
To sum up , I will say that during the Finnish presidential term the matter of improving youth employment will be on the Council’s agenda in many connections .
For that reason it is very important , and this autumn we also propose to support the decision allowing endorsement of such multi-professional skills , in order to facilitate young people’s transition from education to employment as well , this being one of the thresholds involved .
I would refer the honourable Member to the concrete measures and initiatives which the Council cited in the general answer it gave this year to oral questions H-0440 , H-0455 , H-0473 and H-0478/06 .
Its third section specifically covers matters relating to the fight against illegal immigration and the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
All the countries attending the conference stressed their commitment to the rapid implementation of the action plan .
The conclusions also made mention of the significance of other immigration routes , especially in the Union’s neighbouring regions to the east and south-east , and the preparations that are under way for the next Euro-Africa Conference on Migration and Development , which Libya has promised to host .
It was presented to the Council on 24 July , and the Council will examine it at a later date .
The Commission and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union also reported back on the implementation of key measures included in the comprehensive approach at a meeting of the Council held on 24 July .     .
It is in the Council’s interests to strengthen cooperation in this area by developing forms of combined operations , and the Finnish Presidency intends to improve Europe’s integrated system for controlling external borders .     .
Mr President , it is obviously important that we also have adequate resources available to repatriate illegal migrants and to monitor that process , but I would also stress here the importance of the comprehensive approach to the problem of illegal immigration .
Mr President , the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union can also help in greater cooperation in the area of repatriation operations .
Because the Union is based on the principle of respect for freedom , democracy , human and fundamental rights and that of the rule of law , the Council is naturally concerned about any possible loopholes in the legislation that would mean that the rights of older people are not being respected .
This being the case , legislative action must be decided upon at national level , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
One of the criteria referred to is age .
We should nevertheless remember that it is the European Commission ’s task to monitor the implementation of , and compliance with , EU legislation in the Member States , and to submit proposals for justified legislative measures for approval by the European Parliament and the Council .
One of the priorities is the prevention of violence between people .
As I said in my answer , however , the issues on the safety of the elderly are to be discussed at the Council meeting on the subject at the end of November .     .
Mr President , the current Daphne Programme to which the honourable Member refers , and which is against violence , at present applies in particular to violence against women , but , as the honourable Member says , there are obviously also ways of exploring how the situation might be improved at European level with regard to elderly people too .     .
At present we need more internal procedures to have this agreement enter into force .     .
Mr President , the agreement on mutual judicial assistance that I just referred to will help speed up the assistance process , when it enters into force , in many kinds of legal problems , and could also be one key factor in faster and more effective cooperation between the Union and the United States .     .
The same values are also mentioned in the new treaty arrangements between the EU and Russia .
The Council is likewise concerned about the human rights situation in Russia , and especially in Chechnya .
Mr President , there is no longer any need to establish these common values as such , because they already exist .
These areas of dissatisfaction in the independence of Russian courts are indeed
