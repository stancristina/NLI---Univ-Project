a few examples .
But this also applies of course to the United States , and the same will apply to the other countries due to enter into negotiations .
I think that you have always set particular store by this .
We need to publicise the fact that the European Union is funding at least 62 % of public development aid in Central America .
However , it must also cooperate as efficiently as possible with the international organisations which have been working there for several years already .
I do not think that calling for more new posts in the European Commission every time a new challenge arises is always the right response .
Mr President , I should like to follow on from Mr Liese ' s closing comment on climate change , to which Mr Marset Campos also referred .
In other words , we too are an unwieldy apparatus and perhaps we too need to consider how we can speed up the process .
However , this means ensuring the same procedural law applies everywhere and is applied uniformly .
The second is the report , which I particularly wish to highlight , because the rapporteur really has succeeded in finding a broad consensus right across the political divide on a very delicate matter .
I call on them to consider withdrawing these proposed amendments so that the broad consensus can be maintained .
But here we are talking about the procedural , not the substantive right to asylum .
One way or another , we shall be voting in favour of Mr Schmitt ' s report .
That also forms part of the legal framework .
It was also agreed that freedom of contract cannot be invoked in order to limit the effects of the so-called anti-abuse clause .
But some have had to wait for it longer than others .
But it is too late for many small and medium-sized enterprises , family businesses and young entrepreneurs .
The procedures to be agreed in Feira for the future of the European Union represent a significant step along this path .
We need both majority voting and enhanced cooperation !
This is about paragraph 8 of the political groups ' motion for a resolution .
Feira should therefore give us an opportunity to bring the EU closer to the public , either by giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights legal force , or , which would be even more meaningful , by then stating its intention to include a list of competences in the treaties .
We wish to encourage you to prepare the way so that we take the right decisions over the next six months .
We therefore support the creation of an effective common security and defence policy for the Union , with its own identity .
Experience has shown that we need special strategies for the initial and concluding stages of programming periods and a flexibility mechanism for crisis situations like those which arose in 1997/98.
Benchmarking should also be possible in this policy area soon .
I expect the Commission to drop its "business as usual " approach and instead to become the motor of sustainable development in Europe again .
Mr President , in some language versions the motions are shown as being tabled on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists by Mr Wiersma and by a certain Mr Sumberg , who does not , however , belong to our group .
Nevertheless , this will not stop it organising demonstrations and displays of good will on the streets of Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia .
The prisons are certainly not in line with any convention , and contravene the Geneva Convention .
It also has to be said , because we do not know who the culprits are , that it cannot , of course , be ruled out some of the people responsible for these acts are possibly being infiltrated into Kosovo from Serbia as agents provocateurs , because they simply do not want peace in Kosovo .
It is virtually impossible because people stand a good chance of ending up in prison if they act in the interests of democracy .
It is humiliating that we have not succeeded in promoting tolerance or at least cohabitation in this area .
We have some opportunities here .
Mr President , we find ourselves gazing with bewilderment at each new act by the Milosevic regime , acts against its own people .
Quite the opposite - a realistic assessment suggests that there are only a few faint glimmers of hope on a dark horizon .
It is not , for example , as if objective reporting is not penetrating into the region .
I am also pleased , in view of all the laborious history of this , that the Council has now finally agreed to grant Montenegro an emergency support budget of EUR 20 million .
The Commission also supports UNMIK' s endeavours in the area of local administration by means of twinning projects and by advertising posts in UNMIK' s civil administration and the pillars of the reconstruction programme as widely as possible in all the Member States .
This is proof that Mercosur is more than just a free trade area - it is a political area in which democracy is protected .
There is now a further project entitled " Modernising the institutions " .
Nevertheless , I must say that what we have witnessed in Peru is nothing new .
We must not simply express our regret about this step , we also need to consider what we can do to strengthen Peru' s democratic institutions .
The aim of the Schmitt report is to extend this degrading and inhumane system to the entire European Union .
Asylum-seekers are accordingly denigrated as being a burden .
The integrated administration and control system is actually the central plank of our present agriculture policy .
