Allow me in conclusion to put in a good word for Amendment No 60 , which emphasises the value of families , family enterprises and the transition from one generation to the next .
Instead of having the quantitative targets found in two of the clauses , that is to say instead of writing 50 % etc , we just want to write 'significant reduction ' .
We had a long discussion between the groups yesterday .
We therefore agreed to add something to the wording for the purposes of clarification .
( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats support the proposal for the employment strategy .
It is important for the European Parliament to give its support to this strategy .
A proposal by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is based on the view that a general reduction in taxes is beneficial to employment .
The reason is that if the PPE-DE Group does not get this proposal through , that group will vote against the whole report .
.
All other issues should be dealt with at local , regional or national levels .
The same applies to labour market policy .
.
Joint funding via income tax is required for funding our common welfare policy .
We have demanded that the new rules be based upon open accounts that are easily accessible to public scrutiny .
We believe that salary levels too cause offence , since the new levels are very high .
Without a system of travel allowances in which refunds are made on the basis of actual costs instead of , at present , on a flat-rate basis , the new Statute will not lead to increased openness .
Because MEPs live in , and represent , their Member States , tax should , in the future too , be deducted on a national basis in order to take account of the cost of living and of social insurance systems in different countries .
We believe however that , with its major problems in establishing a fixed budgetary framework , the EU cannot , in the current economic climate , take upon itself the increase in costs involved in this activity .
From the start , I have supported Mr Fischler 's far-sighted ideas about coming up with proposals as to how we are to reform European agricultural policy .
I am concerned that , when they meet , the ministers too will make it still worse .
We must remember that most of the world 's food is produced at costs that are not covered by today 's low prices on the world market .
We must change the systems in order to create a healthy world market .
We must remember , however , that the world is not quite as simple as that .
We demand worker protection .
The route from high subsidies and collapsed prices on the world market to healthy trade and pricing must , however , be achieved via a change to the way in which aid is at present provided , that is to say through a decoupling of aid from production .
That is because the proposed decoupling puts less favoured areas at most risk , and we must deal with the risks as quickly as possible .
Prevention is better than cure .
Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , I am on this occasion to express an opinion on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
In my previous speech , I spoke mainly on my own behalf as rapporteur .
It does not help to bury one 's head , ostrich-like , in the sand and say that we have not noticed anything and that we do not wish to change anything .
As those of us in the ELDR Group have said , it is important and a matter of urgency that we should in the long term deregulate agricultural policy , but now it is very important , in the near future , to guarantee aid to a form of agriculture that is multifunctional and sustainable .
It is fantastic that we coped successfully with all these amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
To the President-in-Office of the Council , I wish to say that , if now we have taken a decision , I regret that we do not also have the right of co-decision .
Mr President , I wish to thank Commissioner Byrne for his answer .
My follow-up question to the Commissioner is about how we might follow up the protests in terms of practical politics .
We are concerned here with people who have had to pay a very high price for the sake of democracy .
When the Cartagena Protocol was successfully negotiated in 2000 , this was a significant success for the European Union .
It is only necessary for one country to ratify the protocol for it to come into force .
Compared with the proposal tabled by the Commission , the rules we are to adopt tomorrow are a little stricter and clearer .
The draft law now makes this crystal-clear , explaining that the absence of a response from the country of import may never be viewed as 'silent consent ' .
The legislation of the country of import must always be respected .
Overall , the text we are now to adopt means that the European Parliament has obtained a hearing for approximately 80 % of what we wanted to get through at first reading .
That has been possible thanks to a significant consensus between the Council of Ministers and Parliament .
They too deserve thanks , and the same applies to those with responsibility at the Commission 's Environment Directorate-General , who have been of very great help .
This shows very clearly how
