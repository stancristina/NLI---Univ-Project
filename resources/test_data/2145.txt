and the Council have perhaps been rather too keen in this matter to refer to the Treaty of Amsterdam and hide behind formal requirements .
For that reason , an informal dialogue free from the exact wording of the basic agreement , which the Commissioner mentioned in his speech , is more crucial than ever before .
Of the reforms in the public sector , that concerning state-owned companies is vital for continued economic growth in China .
Another important political question is how the economic life of the country is to be reformed , as that is closely linked with the fate of China ' s socialist system as a whole .
In our opinion , this is very welcome .
In our opinion , public opinion is at its lowest ebb now when it comes to the formation of military institutions for the European Union .
I would like to say that the Mediterranean strategy is a very important one .
I also warmly welcome the concrete action programme concerning the northern dimension .
It may at last help to make a serious attempt to resolve the immense socio-economic problem that exists , for example , in north-west Russia .
Tony Blair , whose government repeatedly prevents the taxation package from getting through , and Jos√© Maria Aznar , whose government blocks the notion of a European limited company , together declared that they approve of the economic structures of the European Union .
It is : let us attend first - and also -to the basic and important matters .
We may well ask whether the new spectrum network auctions , worth hundreds of billions of euros , arranged by the states , are promoting a consumer-friendly future for networking .
In the remote regions of the Union we are still wondering , after the Volvo-Scania episode , whether the Internal Market even exists , or is it so , in terms of competition legality , that only companies in the midst of the market may take advantage of the economics of corporate growth , and the sparsely populated remote regions are the markets for these privileged few .
The big visions , on the one hand , and the Austrian boycott , on the other , cannot be creating a climate of any great confidence in these countries .
I believe that the northern dimension action programme will help to increase regional stability and security everywhere in Europe and strengthen economic and political developments in Europe ' s northern regions .
There has been a change of power there .
I would ask you to send greetings to the new president .
We can certainly all be happy about this change of power , because no revolution can last seventy years .
Mr President , when we talk of discharge , there is a poor spirit prevailing among the groups .
Under no circumstances can we accept that certain documents , which would shed some light on the use of funds , have vanished .
Our group agrees with the conclusion that discharge may on this occasion be granted .
Everything spoke of a genuine desire on the part of the people of Zimbabwe to build a democratic civil society .
The events of Zimbabwe compel us , however , to consider the relationship between democracy and values , and this may be the right forum for that , as we refer to the EU as a society of values .
It is a matter of dialogue .
Why does a former hero of a nation , the father figure of a struggle for independence , now allow the use of violence simply to underpin his own authority ?
In other words : a person ' s virtue makes democracy possible ; on the other hand , his vices make it necessary .
That means that we are willing , in the name of democracy , to encourage people to take a critical stand as citizens .
On the other hand , it requires transparency in decision making and the flow of information .
In Zimbabwe I also realised very clearly that we cannot speak of human rights without the recognition of human dignity .
Owing to tight meeting timetables , they have been brought to the plenary session via my own group , and I hope that they may be adopted .
Amendment No 20 concerns innovative measures .
The appropriation must be kept at the level decided at Berlin .
Our committee is not proposing to move appropriations set aside under the URBAN initiative to be used for innovative measures : the compensating appropriations have to be found elsewhere .
The implementation in practice of innovative measures in the area of Structural Funds has not got under way because preparatory work on the part of the Commission has lagged seriously behind .
More attention should be paid to the success of projects at approval stage .
The report under discussion concerns Parliament ' s provisional position on the budget in the conciliation talks that are to be held .
Just as Mr Wynn said , the problems really mainly concern Category 4 : External Action , and the reconstruction of the Balkans .
Its total value is EUR 5.5 billion .
However , the use of agricultural expenditure for the reconstruction of Kosovo is not fair , as each EU citizen must play a part in the work and not just the farming community .
EU Member States have to bear the responsibility for the reconstruction of the Balkans , as most of them were keen supporters of the military action there , and many also took part in it .
When the Interinstitutional Agreement between the Council and Parliament , which contained the financial perspectives for the years 2000 - 2006 , was made , it was forecast that the reconstruction of Kosovo might call for 'fresh ' resources
