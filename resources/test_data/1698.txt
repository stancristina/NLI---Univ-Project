The European Union is the world leader in measures to protect the environment and combat greenhouse gases .
Therefore , we want to ensure that the Stockholm Programme , which was drawn up by the Swedish Presidency , is implemented .
We have , indeed , to decide on the organisation and working of the External Action Service , and we have to adopt , with Parliament , the Financial and Staff Regulations of that service .
The nine political parties taking part in Belgium in the federal and regional governments represent 90 % of the population of the country .
For we ourselves helped to bring this new world about , for instance , by our efforts in favour of a more equitable distribution of resources and power .
My colleagues and I look forward to a fruitful cooperation between our Presidency and you all , Members of the European Parliament , in favour of the ambitions for Europe which we all share .
In that respect , the flagship initiatives that the Commission will present by the end of the year will be critical .
I would also emphasise the importance of considering the future of our trade policy , which Commissioner De Gucht is working on , and which will be presented in the autumn in the form of a communication .
In this regard , I hope to maintain European leadership .
Then they return six months later to tell us that , for reasons beyond their control , the expectations they have raised have come to nothing .
There will not be any sustainable growth , recovery or fight against poverty if people 's purchasing power is not increased .
We can bring Europe closer to our fellow citizens by concentrating on what they feel is the biggest problem : currently in Europe , it is unemployment , the employment issue , those who do not have a job and those who are afraid of losing one .
In short , if there is one country that has a natural affinity with Europe , that has a European instinct , a particular vocation for Europe , it is Belgium .
In any case , of course , discussions are under way .
It extols fair competition between financial centres and the omnipotence of shareholders within financial institutions .
The European Parliament is being called upon to give its opinion on the draft legislative resolution presented by Mrs Liotard on the subject of 'novel foods ' .
Finally , and this is not unimportant , the cloning of animals is often synonymous with animal suffering .
In this regard , I voted in favour of a distinct legislative proposal expressly banning food derived from cloned animals and their descendants .
In the meantime , we suggest expressly banning food originating from cloned animals and their offspring .
This regulation also provides a framework for experimentation and evaluation methods with regard to nanomaterials .
During this crisis period , we need strong European environmental policy , but it must not bring our industry to its knees .
By making illegal operations more difficult , in particular as a result of the traceability imposed on importers , and by encouraging operators to work legally and therefore pay the relevant taxes in the country of production , the European Union is supporting the countries in question in their fight against tax fraud , thus enabling them to generate more resources which they will then be able to use for the benefit of the population . 20 % of the wood and derivative products that enter the EU come from an illegal source and illicit logging is a major factor in deforestation , which increases by almost 13 million hectares every year , resulting in a dramatic impoverishment of natural resources and biodiversity .
With one of the world 's three main tropical forests , this country , with which we have cordial relations , is particularly susceptible to illegal trading .
While they strengthen the supervision of financial players , banks , insurance companies , funds and so on , of which we can only approve , they effectively change nothing in terms of what is being supervised .
The European Systemic Risk Board ( ESRB ) is nothing more than an organ of the dominant Euro-liberalist thinking and the prototype of a method to bypass democracy .
Indeed , the latter is firmly opposed to the notion of the privatisation of profits and the nationalisation of losses , or their carry-over to society as a whole .
I voted for the McCarthy report on bankers ' remuneration , since the excessive search for short-term profits by an overly large financial sector profoundly destabilised the financial sector and contributed to the crisis .
The fact that the General Council of the European Systemic Risk Board ( ESRB ) is composed exclusively of representatives from the ECB , the Commission and the national central banks , without any Parliamentarians , speaks for itself , particularly as this new body would have to work in close collaboration with the IMF and the G20 , but would not have any contact whatsoever with the Committee of the Regions or the social partners .
The future supervisory framework must therefore seek to ensure sustainable public finances and economic growth , competitiveness , social cohesion and a reduction in trade imbalances .
For this to happen , we must remove the structural problems facing the EU.
I voted for this draft resolution since I warmly welcome the opening of membership negotiations with Iceland .
This is why we must dot the i 's and cross the t 's from the very start of the debate with our Icelandic friends .
While it was our intention to send a warm message of welcome to Iceland , which is already bound by numerous agreements and partnerships with the EU , we have made it clear , through a number of amendments , that it will have to
