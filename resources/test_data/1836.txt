It was on 10 March 1992 that Mrs Adelaide Aglietta presented the first major report to the European Parliament calling for a moratorium on executions , to be decided upon by the UN. 8 years on , as our resolution also highlights , the situation is serious and gives cause for concern , but international interest in the moratorium is constantly on the rise .
Mr President , in the same way as the Treaty of Amsterdam and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights , Parliament has repeatedly declared itself to be opposed to the death penalty which sadly , as has been pointed out , still exists in many countries of the world : countries with antidemocratic traditions such as Communist China and extremely liberal countries such as the United States .
I refer , in particular , to China , which , as the Commissioner too mentioned , issues a death sentence every day of the week and in general shows very little respect for human rights but which , regrettably , is also a highly attractive trading partner for all the European countries and one they cannot do without .
There is no doubt that victory would have been possible .
Regrettably , however , this has never been the case and it is not so now .
We are the children of Cesare Beccaria : we do not want our heritage to be confined within the borders of Europe .
But the shadow is still there .
A debate on the death penalty is a debate which harks back to the development of a civilised legal system , which is something Europe already has .
We need to shout it from the rooftops that the death penalty is against the law .
Climate change is evident all over the world and we in Europe are not so badly off as those in other regions - I have in mind the West Coast of America and also Bangladesh .
Commissioner , allow me to focus for a moment , in the context of Mr Da Silva 's excellent report and the situation which she has just described , which is important and full of potential for the future , on a phenomenon which is assuming dramatic proportions : the floods which affected huge areas of Europe last week , primarily northern Italy but also France and Spain .
We are acquiring the habit of describing our times in dramatic language : verbs such as to overflow , to flood , to burst banks , are part of a vocabulary which is becoming almost the norm .
We need a defence policy dedicated purely to following up the recommendations of the experts .
There is no provision in agricultural or environmental policy or in town and country planning for this role played by agriculture .
Houses , bridges , roads , factories , shops and entire villages were destroyed on that occasion too .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the changing climate in Europe has been causing natural disasters for a number of decades now , and these disasters have not yet been sufficiently analysed and evaluated .
It calls upon the Commission to grant financial aid immediately to the sectors affected , under Article 87 , Paragraph 2 of the EC Treaty , and to take into consideration the fact that a large proportion of the areas affected are eligible for assistance from the Community Structural Funds .
However , it should be remembered that the environmentalists are almost alone in fighting to stop construction on floodplains , to bring about the cleaning-up of water channels , to stop the concreting of river banks or uncontrolled excavations , and to call for measures on reforestation and the protection of mountains , the only operations which can reduce the amount of rain water and avoid landslides .
We expect the Commission to acknowledge the disastrous situation in certain regions in our country and to affect land rehabilitation , in collaboration with the national States , of course , but we also expect it to intervene with legislation to raise awareness at European level , so that the issue of floods and disasters , the victory of ill-omened nature over man and organised society - can in some way be changed for the better .
In order to be able to continue to work , producers are calling for the adoption of legislation which will support the development of the fruit and vegetable sector , not hamper it .
Madam President , Commissioner , the Lisbon extraordinary European Council set a basic strategic objective for the European Union : that of becoming 'the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world ' .
There are parties who have much to lose and , in Italy , there is a conflict of interests between the State as regulator and the State as owner or controller of some of the main telecommunications services companies .
( IT ) The Members of Parliament belonging to the Lega Nord voted against the draft budget not because they oppose the idea of Europe but because they wanted to show their disapproval of the distorted way that this idea is being put into practice .
The budget that Parliament has today approved at first reading could be described as uncontroversial and unspectacular .
We realise that this review represents , once all the available instruments have been employed , from the redistribution of funds to the use of flexibility margins , the only way of addressing onerous and unforeseeable commitments .
Madam President , it is a well-known fact that I am highly responsive to all measures concerning the harvesting of various species of fish , measures which by enlarging the holes in fishing nets allow smaller fish to survive , live longer , grow old and potentially become pensioners too .
I have to say that despite approving of the contents of the explanatory statement
