connection , the Commission wishes to stress the efforts of the Council and Parliament in making progress with the work on the proposals , above all , the compromises reached as the basis for a possible agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading of the proposal for an implementing regulation .
I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Blokland , the Danish Presidency and the Commission for making a real effort to arrive at a solution which is satisfactory and acceptable for us all , even if not all of our amendments have been adopted .
I am extremely pleased with the proposal , therefore .
The aim of this whole exercise and of the Convention is to improve the control of the trade in hazardous chemicals and to place joint and increased responsibility on importing and exporting countries .
I really hope , therefore , that we obtain a large majority , perhaps unanimity , in favour of this report tomorrow .
That is because we think that the EU 's money can better be used in other areas where it is really needed .
The fact that the EU also subsidises tobacco cultivation is particularly worth noting .
We welcome the fact that the appropriation for combating HIV/AIDS is up by approximately EUR 200 million , or 60 % , on the Council 's proposal .
We believe that , before we can approve the whole of the proposed amount , it is important for the Commission to be able to clarify how the aid for Israel and Palestine is to be used .
We believe it is wrong to provide subsidies , to the tune of EUR 7 million , to European parties until such time as there is a legal basis for doing so , and we regret that the proposal to remove the appropriation was voted down by 393 votes to 76 .
In that context , it is depressing to see that the EU 's budget contains an incredibly large amount of unused resources and that there is a complete waste of money in certain cases .
It is quite incredible that this issue can never be resolved , in spite of the fact that so many people purport to stand up for this principle .
We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted against the amendments aimed at increasing the subsidies for agriculture .
Instead , the agricultural subsidies must also be considerably reduced .
For quite a few years , the common sector in the Member States has been the victim of major cutbacks .
In that context , it is depressing to see that the EU 's budget contains an incredibly large amount of unused resources and that there is a complete waste of money in certain cases .
Another detail we have insisted on every year is that travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament should only be reimbursed in the case of actual costs that have arisen in connection with travel on EU business .
The directive as a whole has an important role to play in creating a free and more efficient financial market demanding sound consumer and investment protection .
We believe , for reasons of justice , that two levels of compensation for passengers would be the best solution , in practice one within the EU and one outside the EU.
Political leadership on this issue is incredibly important .
Almost the same situation applies too to the candidate countries that wish to become members of the EU but that have still not ratified the treaty .
What , then , will happen after 2012 ?
What is it intended should happen during the forthcoming period ?
We quite often point out the need to ensure we help the developing countries fulfil what is required of them by the Kyoto Protocol .
To repeat Parliament 's old demands , it should soon no doubt be time to incorporate shipping and aviation into these talks .
I mean that we must seek equal rights for all citizens of the world .
The committee certainly adds the rider that this is to happen in the long term , but what is nonetheless required is for all citizens to have the right of access to good , renewable energy on equal terms .
That applied above all , of course , to the Iranian people .
Journalists , intellectuals and critics of the regime disappear and are tortured , imprisoned and put on trial for trivial reasons .
The fact that this is happening in 2002 is completely unacceptable .
I would also draw attention to the fact that Parliament has its veto when it comes to acknowledging possible agreements , and this is something we shall use if the situation does not improve .
I congratulate you on the honesty of your statement .
When it comes to the agreement concerning Russia , we know that a debate is under way about what is waste and what is nuclear fuel .
Now , we are just about ready for marriage and , as a liberal , I feel incredible pride at the fact that it is a liberal government that is finally blessing the union between these countries .
I think it is important for us to do as you did and clearly and unambiguously encourage the forces of reform in Turkey , as well as welcoming the positive signals coming from the new government in Ankara .
The more I hear about these , the more confusing I think they are .
We know that there are Member States which do not at present fulfil the Copenhagen criteria .
Thirdly and finally , it was good that a settlement was reached concerning agricultural policy , which was one of the biggest obstacles to the timetable for enlargement .
Agricultural policy needs to be substantially reformed
