Many of them have lost their jobs and , with this , comes violence against women , sex discrimination and the trade in women .
However , the fact that the existing laws are not enforced and new ones are not created means that the governments of Europe are indirectly allowing the Mafia to continue with its activities .
In conclusion , I would like to say something about the men - and it is the men that I address .
- ( SV ) While in principle we adopt a positive view of the European Parliament and the Council ' s recommendation on mobility within the Community , we would like to state the following : We believe that , from the point of view of equality and justice , it is very important that third-country nationals resident within the EU should have the right to utilise the provisions of Community legislation on the same terms as the Union ' s own citizens .
We are therefore opposed to Amendment 38 concerning the introduction of common tax regulations for volunteers .
We have therefore decided to vote against this amendment , but we support the report as such .
Many of Mr Titley ' s proposals and comments in the report represent improvements to the Council ' s original report .
Despite the request from the Group of the Greens , the rapporteur has also consistently failed to discuss Turkey which , through its membership of NATO , is in practice excluded from the codes of conduct .
- ( SV ) It is good that the European Union wishes to implement a code of conduct to restrict arms exports .
I must therefore welcome the purpose of the Commission ' s work and of Mrs Van Lancker ' s report .
Many of her proposals are extremely commendable and deserve our full support .
It is therefore the social authorities in each country upon whom demands must essentially be made .
I believe that the impetus must come from below and that it is a question of providing aid at a problem level .
On the contrary , I am very critical of the amendment .
Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased to see you all here .
The Commission therefore proposes to tackle the problem with a combination of measures .
The Committee has submitted 49 amendments .
It is also incredibly important , not to say fundamental , that the various Community actions , the framework strategy and the Member States ' measures complement , and do not counteract , each other .
We have come up with a new shock proposal , which is really a reiteration of what was stated in our opinion on the budget .
This is , of course , something which needs not only to be observed but also to be combated , and with the help of vigorous measures .
We have touched upon the idea that the plan must be to increase accessibility and also scope for active participation for non-governmental organisations .
We naturally want to include the strategy in the Council decision , too .
What we mean in the Committee by strategy is , of course , not the Commission ' s opening gambit , but that strategy beginning as from paragraph 2 ( ' The Strategy ' ) .
It is therefore important that non-governmental organisations should obtain influence in the course of implementation .
Mr President , I think it would be a great shame if Nicole PÃ©ry were not also to seize the opportunity to state her opinion now that she is here , so that we might hear her points of view , too .
One of the absolutely basic principles of EU cooperation is that competition between different companies , products , countries and regions should work well and be fair and correct , as well as be for the benefit of consumers .
Commissioner Monti is to be congratulated in this respect .
This double role makes special demands in terms of openness , control and predictability .
A clearer definition and further discussion are needed in this area .
I hope that the Commission is now also prepared to broaden the discussion and shed more light on the rules of competition on the basis of these assumptions .
What is really worrying , however , is that what might be called a form of blackmail is being perpetrated against those who , when it comes to reforms , do not wish to go further than they have been authorised to do by the Member States .
Re-weight the votes in the Council , but not in accordance with the principle of double majorities .
I am glad to see that the Swedish Presidency will be contributing to this .
A Union of this kind would be centralised in character and give the small countries less influence than that which the United States ' s two-chamber system gives to small federal states .
Nor would the Union become more efficient .
Now , the moment of truth has arrived in which we must be prepared to defend the little influence we have .
If by chance she should nonetheless do so , it is doubtful if she would be any the wiser .
This is really quite unacceptable .
It is time to review the Treaties .
The people of Europe need , deserve and , according to opinion polls , want a common constitution clearly expressing the EU' s values and objectives and clarifying the division of power and responsibility both between the institutions and between the institutions and the Member States .
Naturally , people must be enabled to participate in this work , especially citizens of the candidate countries which will hopefully be members in a few years ' time .
This is necessary if the EU is to be able
