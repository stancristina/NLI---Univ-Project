, is the most difficult aspect , because it will entail a radical change of mindset and behaviour in an era of fierce competitiveness and thirst for profit .
Any act of terrorism against a Member State should be viewed as an attack on the EU as a whole and on the shared values that form the basis of our civilisation .
Accordingly , we hope that the Commission will , at the earliest opportunity , present us with proposals on prevention , protection and the fight against terror .
Such a measure would be disproportionate and it is highly doubtful that it would work .
In view of the necessary technical evaluations , and given that Slovakia has introduced a request to cover the damage resulting from the storm of 19 and 20 November 2004 , we therefore have a duty to support the mobilisation of the Fund in question .     .
Transferring funds from the market pillar to rural development is a way of introducing cofinancing by the back door , which amounts to the renationalisation of CAP costs .
This report addresses the surplus resulting from the execution of the budget for 2004 .
To conclude , I voted in favour of the Garriga Polledo report , as I had no objections to any of his pertinent observations .     .
As regards the issue before us , it is important to make a subtle distinction between employers ’ responsibilities and the precautions that all workers must take in both professional and private life .
Education syllabuses must include Internet education programmes aimed at children , but also for adults and parents , and information campaigns must be set up to alert the general public to the dangers posed by Internet use .
It also proposes measures that the European authorities could take to improve the gathering and exchange of information .
This is a field of research that is capable of bringing us great joy in terms of fighting disease .
In this context , I welcome the initiatives aimed at simplifying the processes of charging , paying and refunding VAT.     – The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains the question on which peace in the Middle East hinges .
This is a positive scenario , but one based on a particular set of circumstances , and the opportunity could go to waste .
This is terrific news , but the Gaza that has been handed over to the Palestinians urgently requires an airport and the Israeli authorities have an unacceptable veto over this project .
Peace is possible provided we do not waste this opportunity .     – In this debate on the Middle East situation , we must not overlook the fact that the territory returned to the Palestinian people belongs to them by right and that they have long been fighting for it .
This is the background to our report on the future of sustainable tourism in Europe .
At the same time , it should be understood that tourism is first and foremost a sector in which private initiative prevails and in which , on the basis of the subsidiarity principle , policies come mainly from the Member States’ authorities .
The most symbolic proposal on the table is , without question , that of creating outstanding European tourist destinations , along the lines of the European Capital of Culture concept .
In the area of security , we have proposed that a contact group be set up with a view to coordinating information on how to manage crises , such as health crises and acts of terrorism , so as to ensure a rapid response in the event of European tourists needing protection and to support tourist operators affected by such events .
Lastly , in the area of transport , we have advocated the importance of investing in quality , by boosting the capacity and improving the accessibility of the various means of transport , by using integrated ticket offices to simplify ticketing systems and by establishing suitable links with air transport , which is the main form of tourist transport .
In a Europe in which private initiative is at the forefront of growth and development , our role as public decision-makers is to support it and to ensure that it is an integral part of a journey that will hopefully be laden with success .
If we are to meet the pressing need to combat the growing problem of precarious work and exploitation affecting workers in the sector , work must be appreciated , decent wages must be paid , the security and stability of working arrangements must be guaranteed and vocational training must be provided .
As I come from Portugal , and from a region , the Autonomous Region of Madeira , in which tourism is one of the main tools for development , it stands to reason that I have a vested interest in supporting this report .
The Union should support , coordinate and complement the Member States .
This is therefore a timely and welcome report and I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Svensson .
It is known that domestic violence , genital mutilation , the trafficking of women , prostitution and all manner of sexual trade are at the root of serious health problems and deaths among women .
Health policy falls under the competence of the Member States , but the Commission could and should do more in this area because there are many situations that go beyond national responsibilities .     – It is always vitally important to bring to the fore the importance of gender mainstreaming in the public health strategies of both the Member States and the Commission .
We welcome the adoption of this resolution , to which we made a substantial contribution .
Human neglect , however , is a further factor that should not be discounted
