So in social terms , we believe the consequences of certain types of tourism need careful evaluation .
But I have to say to the Honourable Member that it is not the Commission 's intention to superimpose the 'drift nets ' dossier on the 'technical measures ' dossier , which the Commission intends to conclude in the Fisheries Council on 30 October .
The idea we are developing inside the Directorate General is a questionnaire to be distributed as widely as possible , in other words trying to have a bottom-up approach , at least in the first stage of the process , so that we can take stock of all the concerns , and indeed suggestions , which emerge from various quarters of the sector , although some subjects , obviously , may be less controversial , while other ideas may be usefully taken into consideration .
Provided , of course , we understand quite specifically what we mean by regionalization because , as far as I can understand , throughout the fisheries sector the Member States have quite different views on what regionalization is supposed to mean .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , I think this evening may result in a further contribution to ensuring that Parliament discusses the merits of certain important proposals from the Commission , but I also the debate will give you encouragement , Mr Commissioner , to pursue the policy of reforming the CAP.
Specifically looking at durum wheat , I think the proposals should be rationalized to provide for a maximum area for durum wheat set by the individual countries and then distributed at territorial level .
We consider it a choice the Commission and the Council must accept after the united support of Parliament and its Committee on Agriculture .
Mr President , this year 's agricultural price setting is like a Chinese box .
There is a packet inside a package .
The various outstanding problems in the agricultural sections are going to be dealt with by the reform under discussion , not in the price setting forum .
But then , at the heart of the budgeting , he gets there despite himself .
We know that the imbalances in the CAP are generating serious problems , including financial ones .
That is not everything , but it gives a first signal , takes a first step towards responsibility .
If , on the other hand , you want to do battle on serious issues , you know that , even where there are justified differences , the Socialist Group is ready to discuss those issues seriously .
First , the reduction in the monthly increments in intervention prices for cereals and rice and storage refunds for sugar to take account of the fall in interest rates .
There is also an important reduction in the milk and milk products sector , particularly in the supplementary withdrawal rate which remains to be declared for 1995/1996 , and is estimated for the period 1996-1997 .
I hope the lesson of sorts that we are learning in this debate will help Parliament find the right road in its relations with the Commission and the Council .
And if it is , must the provisions of the regulation be respected or not ?
Mr President , I have asked for the floor on a point of personal explanation .
The gap between the candidate countries and the 15 Union countries is vast , and in some sectors it seems downright unbridgeable .
The President of the Santer Commission has said that if we do not prepare properly for the enlargement we may be heading for a rather negative situation .
It is true that article 113 has increased the powers of the Community , but at the same time it has reduced the powers of Parliament , and reducing the powers of Parliament in this respect strikes us as rather dangerous .
Yet we know that without real European democracy , without transparent and simplified decision-making processes , without an improvement in the procedures and methods of the Community institutions to put them in a position to neutralize what has been very effectively defined as the renationalization of minds , the Europe we want will not come into being .
The idea of entrusting power in this field to the Secretary General of the Council is not only an anti-democratic solution - at least the Secretary General of the United Nations answers to the General Assembly - but it is also unlikely to be effective .
Madam President , I too would like to compliment Mr Spencer on an excellent report , but I also want to express my disappointment at the fact that , once again , this Parliament is just having a nice chat .
Madam President , the proposal we are analyzing today is certainly not intended to transfer responsibilities or powers from the national parliaments to the European Parliament , far from it !
We are working together to simplify legislative procedures , we are working together on common urgent intervention , we are working together , above all , to help the citizens understand why the two major institutions that represent them exist and how they function .
So , especially after the hearing we have held , and after the strong warning that has reached us from the seven European judges who launched an appeal from Geneva just a year ago , it is clear that , given these difficulties and this powerlessness , we need to consider new instruments for a European legal area , new instruments for the European taxpayer where fraud is involved , but for the European citizen full stop in terms of the way this organized crime affects their safety .
So I think the moment has come , with these questions , with this debate , but above all faced with the appointments which await us - the ratification
