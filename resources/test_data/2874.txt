less alone .
The terrorists and their accomplices have projected a completely distorted image of my country , its people and history .
They participate actively in peaceful organisations and organisations dedicated to development cooperation , sexual equality , ecology and the environment .
Those murdered have ranged from the police to the military , town councillors , businessmen , journalists , teachers , pacifists , taxi drivers , shopkeepers and bicycle sellers .
Democracy and human rights are the very raison d ' être of the European Union .
Some are trying to confuse us and seem intent on creating confusion between the people of good will in Parliament .
In the wake of the latest atrocity , the debate is especially difficult for this Member , and this is something I commented on to four of the five people that signed the declaration against terrorism in Spain .
If ETA refuses to renounce violence , we shall refuse to renounce the law and dialogue , which are our weapons .
On 14 December 1995 , Parliament adopted a resolution in which it reiterated its rejection of any type of dialogue with anyone who collaborates with , protects , incites or carries out terrorist acts of any kind , and on 15 October 1998 , Parliament adopted a resolution in which it reiterated its refusal to enter into dialogue with anyone that collaborates with , permits , encourages , supports or carries out criminal acts .
A few days ago in Strasbourg , President Nicole Fontaine herself made reference to all of the democrats of Europe , men and women alike , and especially the Basque Country in Spain , which , in her view , continues to believe in political dialogue , despite the climate of terror that exists .
Allow me , if you will , to make a small personal confession .
Political dialogue should take place between democratic parties , whether they be nationalist or not , with Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya , with Convergència i Unió , with the PNV , with Eusko Alkartasuna , with Izquíerda Unida , with the PSOE , with the governing Partido Popular , and within the institutions , transparently and clearly , on behalf of the people and answering to all Spanish citizens .
We are , however , in favour of responsible and democratic dialogue in order to achieve peaceful coexistence and to strengthen democracy , which is so essential to us .
( Continued protests ) The moving remarks from the victims of ETA and the Spanish repression prove better than anything else the tragedy of permitting this excellent opportunity to be wasted .
I stand by these two statements made by the Partido Popular party and make the point that Europe is no longer an international affair in our view and Parliament must mediate politically , not between the terrorists and the government , but between the Basque Government and the Spanish Government , between the PP and the PSOE and the PVN-EA , as this is what is presently lacking in Spain , over and above the terrorist violence .
The local councillor of the governing Partido Popular party , José Luis Ruiz Casado , was firstly shot in the back of the head and , on falling to the ground , was finished off by his killers .
John Hume has also reminded us on many occasions in Parliament that the European Union is and must continue to be an example of conflict resolution .
This is why - and here I recall the ever enlightening and splendid words of Commissioner Vitorino who called for common definitions to be established in the field of organised crime and similar rules to be laid down regarding the sentences imposed and the time served - this is an issue that must be studied in the long term , as the idea of "vérité en deçà des Pyrénées , erreur au delà " [all that is truth this side of the Pyrenees , all that is falsehood beyond] , cannot hold true .
I would ask , nevertheless , that we please stick to what has already been discussed and to the list of votes .
The Socialist Group accepted this proposal , which is why we , together with the Liberal Group , abstained from voting today on all of the amendments that do not refer to this new consultation .
These people have an exclusive and partisan vision of nationalism and have nothing to do with any of us , or any European socialists , or with any ideology that is not based on exclusion and racism .
Madam President , I believe that , after the visit - on your invitation - of the Presidents of the Israeli and Palestinian assemblies last month , we have sufficient moral legitimacy to address our partners in the Middle East in the strongest terms , while offering them our services .
However , we cannot put all forms of nationalism into one pigeonhole .
That is what Mrs Fontaine was referring to , because , as I have said , I witnessed the whole of her visit .
I must say that , in general , the joint position of the Council largely includes the criteria of the European Parliament ' s position .
We are therefore perfectly able to accept that the Commission should commit itself to granting these requests provided that the Member States involved can objectively justify that it is difficult for them to immediately apply the provisions of the regulation .
It simply remains for me to express my satisfaction at Parliament ' s support for the work of the Commission , and to thank the rapporteur , Mr Knörr , for his cooperation and his excellent work in relation to this text .
There is no doubt that this speeding up will depend on the Member States ' ability to implement certain measures .
