Given what is happening in the rice sector , perhaps the Intergovernmental Conference currently under way could reword as follows Article 39 of the Treaty , which relates to the objectives of the CAP : the Community undertakes to comply with every diktat of the US foreign trade department .
The resolution calls on the Commission to analyse the functioning of the COM.
That alone , Commissioner , is a clear indication of where the main fears now lie as regards the incredible , untenable state of affairs in the rice sector .
In this way , we shall also avoid considerable economic hardship .
I would also point out - the Commissioner did not say this - that the proposed safeguard clause was adopted by mutual agreement between Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Pinheiro : it is therefore a joint proposal from DG VI and the directorate-general responsible for development cooperation , DG VIII .
Europe is increasingly beginning to dialogue via the Internet ; unfortunately the governments of the Member States have some difficulty controlling it , unable to see the illegal and harmful messages sent over the Internet ; furthermore , different States use different legal instruments to regulate national security , the protection of minors and human dignity , economic and information security , the protection of privacy and personal reputation , and even the protection of intellectual property .
Madam President , in an interview on this subject our rapporteur described himself as an old liberal - in the sense of old-fashioned - and not an excessive moralist .
How else can standards of quality or a code of good conduct be set , what other basis is there for the regulations we hope to see ?
We are talking about eighteen million small and medium-sized firms , which directly employ seventy million people , 70 % of the European Union 's current labour force .
Instead of underestimating the great potential of these firms , especially in certain sectors , the banks need to make life easier for them and not make entrepreneurs spend half a day arguing about 0.2 % plus or minus .
Remember , the 1997-2000 programme can provide acceleration for all sectors : a small firm today may be a large firm tomorrow .
Despite this , small and medium-sized firms represent 99.8 % of all Union companies and their ebullience stimulates them to create jobs and boost the economy of the whole of Europe .
On top of the recession , jobs are being blocked by basic failings and imperfections which are not dealt with adequately even in the important documents being discussed today .
The Commission 's document , for example , mentions coordination of Community instruments and state action to implement the measures effectively , but does not explain how to achieve this or who is to carry it out .
Finally we are asking for the introduction of measures genuinely designed to promote an entrepreneurial spirit and a spirit of initiative amongst small and medium-sized firms , rather than create bureaucracies within them which limit action and , above all , development .
I would just like to make one point : very small firms , individual craftsmen , are weak in the world market ; they cannot make it .
So we support the Commission 's objectives but we also support all the amendments passed in committee and the way the report has been presented by the rapporteur , whom we thank .
The human factor is basic : 80 % of all maritime disasters are precisely ascribable to the human factor .
Parliament has called many times for an aid plan , including financial aid , to stimulate activity in this sector , including a precise definition of the concept of European shipowner , but many proposals have never reached the stage of legislation because of the Council 's inability to take any decisions on the subject .
This would simply encourage the exodus to flags of convenience , through the natural advantage to the aforementioned balance sheet .
It has a magnificent heritage and represents one of the most ancient and noble facets of European identity .
But the fishermen must be closely involved and above all the plan must be voluntary .
Proposing a research programme to identify the real impact and take account of the comments which have been made by the environmental associations and the fishermen 's organizations themselves , will be an important signal to fishermen .
We think the Commission 's conversion proposal is correct and we entirely agree with the Parliamentary committee 's amendments except for one : we do not understand why a European standards agreement should contain a reference to the agreement with the unions .
That is why the various national and international institutions are usually determined to limit certain fishing activities .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first I would like to clarify why I and six other Italian Members of the European People 's Party have not thought it right to sign up to two of the amendments which will be put to the vote in this House tomorrow .
In that connection , I expect the Union to protect its own fisheries policy consistently and coherently , in this sector too , in Euro-Mediterranean association agreements .
As many of you know , we have opened a dialogue to establish codes of conduct , at the Venice Conference especially , because the legal instrument does not allow us to intervene with third countries in international waters .
The Commission 's text makes no reference to the issues in some of the amendments because there is no reference to them in the plan presented by the Italian government .
So obviously the Commission cannot deal with other issues .
Ladies and gentlemen , I repeat : if you have any means of pressure , the Commission would be very grateful if you would be kind enough to apply
