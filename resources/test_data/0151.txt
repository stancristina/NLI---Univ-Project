The European funds from the Solidarity Fund must be added , as Mrs Miguélez has pointed out .
The disaster , which has been mentioned here , did not lead to any human victims and Galicia recovered quickly , as a result of the rapid action of marine regeneration , but this latest tragedy has left us with human victims and burnt areas that all the experts say will take 20 , 30 or perhaps even more years to recover .
Given the European dimension of this disaster , it falls to us in this Parliament to emphasise its magnitude and also to call for the resources necessary and assistance available to alleviate its dramatic short-, medium - and long-term consequences and to cooperate so that we can find out what has failed , in order to stop it happening again .
I would also like to point out that , in Galicia , the number of ‘yes ’ votes in last year’s referendum on the European Constitution was far higher than the average for the rest of Spain .
I hope that this suspension is provisional and that the talks are not reduced to ashes , but rather that a phoenix can rise from them – as the Commissioner has said .
There have been a series of contacts and bilateral meetings during August and I hope that the Commissioner can tell us about any opportunities for progress .
We would like to point out , however , that a failure of the Doha Round would be a failure for international trade and for the multilateral system , since it would jeopardise the achievements such as tariff and trade preferences and would lead to a multiplicity and overlapping of rules , thereby making companies ’ lives more difficult .
Despite the hopeful ray of sunlight offered by the G8 a few days earlier in St Petersburg , the minds of certain negotiators clouded over and the negotiations of the development round were suspended .
Is the principle of the single undertaking still valid in the Commission ’s strategy ?
As well as the budgetary increase already mentioned , I would like to stress certain important contributions made by Mrs Gröner’s report : firstly , the specific inclusion of people trafficking and forced prostitution as forms of violence , and the absolutely clear reference to genital mutilation and honour crimes as forms of gender violence that have a serious impact on health .
The law was necessary , and that is what we said , but , as we can see , unfortunately a law is not enough .
Let us not forget that its ultimate objective is to save lives .
This is the direction that the rest of the Union must take , making decisive commitments in the conviction that to do nothing at this point would mean turning our backs on thousands of women who are expecting us to respond .     Madam President of the Republic of Finland , ladies and gentlemen , Mr President of the Commission , the European Parliament , which always advocates that there should be more women in politics , is delighted to be able to welcome you to this House today .
We welcome the first woman elected – and indeed re-elected – to occupy the highest post in the Republic of Finland .
Furthermore , your country holds the Presidency of the Union .
Tampere entered the history books as the place where , seven years ago , Europe began to deal with the problem of immigration .
This is a live and controversial issue within European debate , and I have no doubt that Parliament will have much to say about it .
A reasoned and reasonable report ; a reasoned report , looking at the past and seeing that , by means of our model , we have achieved the largest area of economic and social progress in Europe and reached the most important stage in that progress , and a reasonable report because it enables us to look to the future not just on the defensive , but also proactively , in order to make a success of the great challenges of globalisation .
The same goes for the incorporation of women into working life , where we need innovative formulae for reconciling work and family life and for making working hours more flexible .
I would like to say the following : the Commission ’s letter of notice made it very clear that , in the Commission ’s view , the content of Directive 85/337 , which makes environmental impact studies for this type of public work essential , had not been respected .
Lebanon could be a successful test of a form of international intervention that would guarantee peace in Gaza and the West Bank and a peace agreement .
Let us not forget that that difference is also based on values : the European Union’s values .
Only when the European Union speaks and acts as one and in accordance with its weight in the world , and in accordance with its commitments , can it really be effective .
Reception centres are overflowing , there is no way to return the immigrants to their countries of origin and the commitments made by 16 countries have not been fulfilled , except in the case of your country , since Finland , together with Italy and Portugal , has sent a naval unit .
In this case , I believe that we must do so while making the values that we consider to be fundamental to a good , fruitful relationship very clear .
The death penalty ?
As if the People’s Republic of China could tell the European Union what kind of relations and what kind of policy we should implement here .
Our group is therefore going to vote against this report tomorrow , because I believe that it moves in the wrong direction .
In the meantime , in a market that is becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues , private
