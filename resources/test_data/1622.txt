guidelines .
In short , the transposition of the policy intentions under implementation and the implementation of the guidelines leave something to be desired .
This was with the intention to establish a sustainable and social market economy in the European Union .
It seems that the integration of economic and social policy is more obvious than integrating environmental policy into economic policy .
Furthermore , the same government leaders who agree on this are , in Brussels , often those who are reluctant to actually implement the attendant legislation .
This would cut down the building costs to 3 billion .
It will therefore remain possible , Monsieur Savary , to send a letter to the remotest corner of Provence .
According to him , they stay in their cars while , 50 metres further along , people are being gunned down .
Soldiers are also billeted with the villagers .
It does not take them seriously , in other words .
Could you use your authority to contact not only those international organisations , but also the Commission , to confirm that these refugees cannot return to Kosovo ?
Careless lorry drivers are driving into traffic queues because their reactions are too slow .
In a year 's time the elections are coming around again .
As far as we are concerned , reimbursing travel costs on the basis of the costs actually incurred is even more important .
Why was the Belgian Government 's compromise involving a supplementary national tax rejected ?
If an agreement on the Statute is rendered impossible , we are back to square one as regards the travel costs , too .
That is unacceptable to many Members , myself included .
Unfortunately , that is not the case .
In all fairness , I must say that Parliament has invested a great deal of effort , and I was not expecting the result that we have now achieved .
It has been made clear that not one Member State may deviate from this , because there is a requirement for the Commission to produce an amended directive , which then has to pass through the whole parliamentary and Council process once more .
This is the way it should be , too .
Only then will we be able to convince our citizens that liberalisation is a good thing .
Of course , as a parliamentarian , one wants more , but , given the point of departure , we have achieved an enormous amount .
Particular attention will have to be paid to the way in which the distribution network is to be used , therefore .
In conclusion , it can be said that an important step has been taken in the opening-up of the energy markets in the European Union , but that a close watch will have to be kept over the way in which this opening-up is realised , on an ongoing basis .
Short-term aid does not seem to me to be efficient .
This is waste management .
They are as follows : redefining heavy fuel oil as waste , establishing a European coastguard service , and an obligatory percentage of ship inspections per port and not per Member State : otherwise , in 15 years ' time , we shall have the same problems with the double hull tankers .
In any case , Mrs Mann 's report constitutes an interesting contribution to this , and for this I thank her .
Which legal basis constitutes the required solid legal basis ?
This opinion on the legal basis is widely held in the European Parliament .
The 'complementarity ' criterion invites three comments .
By way of conclusion , I should like to thank my fellow Members , in particular , for their constructive cooperation .
That is a good thing , too , as we are voting today , and it is very good to hear that the things which we have already decided in the Committee , and which we hope to have adopted today and here I back the appeal by Mr Hughes to the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats are being discussed there so that we can reach further decisions .
By way of conclusion , I think that it is important that we take the local and regional approaches and the involvement of national parliaments very seriously .
Upwards of 92 % of all convictions are based on plea bargains .
That is partly due to the procedure followed .
Who is extradited ?
In short , this is an agreement that cannot just be rushed through .
For example , there must be no cooperation with exceptional or military courts , and no extradition if this could lead to the death penalty .
The agreements have to be approved by all the national parliaments before they can be ratified .
The texts of the draft agreements have been kept secret for too long .
.
( NL ) Mr President , I should like to make a couple of points by way of explanation of how I voted on the Members ' Statute .
.
The allocation of ever fewer seats in this House to each Member State prevents smaller movements from being represented .
It is a matter of some importance to us Europeans that capital punishment exists over there and that innocent suspects first need to admit their guilt before they can negotiate a reduction of their sentences .
In my view , an exception should therefore be provided for in the regulation .
Can we then look forward to other reductions , other degression standards ?
Should we repeat this mistake ?
As is evident from my amendment , it is only fair that the Member State that makes the saving should be able to use these monies for rural development within its borders
