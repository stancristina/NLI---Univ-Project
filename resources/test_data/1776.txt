As we know , the field of biotechnology is a difficult one as it has an ethical , moral and religious dimension .
It is not at all in our minds to politicize this body but , on the contrary , to guarantee its independence and that of its members and , by doing so , to strengthen its authority , just as we do by appointing the members of the Court of Audit which in the past has enabled us to avoid certain over-politicized appointments .
Secondly , and dealing more specifically with that European Council , I should perhaps add to what I said earlier : among the initiatives adopted in Amsterdam there is one that relates specifically to extending the role of the EIB , in three ways .
In my speech just now I spoke in general terms about the approaches that have been selected , both in terms of co-ordination of economic policy and in terms of employment policy , and what we were going to do to follow them through .
I would refer you to Article 104c of the Treaty , which states that the Council may resolve upon sanctions if certain conditions are present .
Commissioner , I should like to take another brief look at the specific proposals to boost employment which the Commission believes it can implement as a direct outcome of the European Council resolution in Amsterdam .
Mr President , there is a rather unusual , not to say original , question I should like to put to the European Commissioner .
So that will simplify the situation .
That was , as it were , a preliminary question which I put to the Legal Affairs Committee before any consideration of the merits of the instrument .
I hope with all my heart that this House will approve the views expressed by its Legal Affairs Committee and its Social Affairs Committee in favour of this directive and the amendments we propose to give concrete form to our desire for transparency , equity and social equilibrium in the European single market .
The four reports before us do in fact touch on several areas of the information society : finance , standardization , education and training , the change in the value of 'work ' , and the quest for dominance by the information technology multinationals .
Children are going to have to learn by using the new technologies , not just learn to use them .
But in the meantime , what happens ?
So let me make a solemn appeal to Honourable Members : do n't sink your own ship , do n't suffocate the European information society just when it needs all the air it can get .
So there is nothing new about the matter , and I will spare you the historical details .
If the Americans want to make us eat meat with hormones in it , their motive is not just the pleasure of selling us meat - the main motive is to make us accept the hormone principle , because of course the real profit comes from the production and marketing of the hormones .
What I , personally , will not accept is that anyone should tell Europe 's citizens that they have to eat poisoned meat because the Americans need the money .
As for the CFSP , the handful of useful adjustments made to the existing provisions , in order to reflect the lessons of experience , show no signs of any genuine political will on the part of the Member States to equip the Union with the institutions and procedures that would enable it to take an active part on the international stage worthy of its economic importance .
Unfortunately , as others have already said , Amsterdam was not a success .
Even the adoption of a future official status of European Member of Parliament will require a unanimous Council .
The European Commission , for its part , is responsible for defending the overriding interest of the Union .
The extraordinary European council on employment , this autumn , will provide an opportunity for the peoples of Europe to obtain a hearing for their demands , expressed by the Europe-wide social movement .
The Amsterdam Treaty is not a satisfactory conclusion to the Intergovernmental Conference .
As far as they are concerned , adapting the institutions to deal with enlargement means , quite simply , speeding up the application of their unending programme , first by generalizing majority voting on the Council .
At previous key moments - the Single European Act , Maastricht - disappointment has been tempered by the feeling that , however slowly , Europe was moving forward and that its progress should be encouraged .
The European Union , then , must very quickly go into greater detail with its proposals to favour growth and social change and to counter unemployment , while at the same time reopening the debate on the European institutions , which must be very swiftly adapted and reformed if a crisis is to be avoided .
The issue here is not legalistic quibbling but the future of the enlarged Union .
Let us ensure that this review takes place more democratically and transparently , so that the peoples of Europe can begin to understand it and , consequently , to support it .
The rapporteur , Mr Tomlinson , worries about excessive reliance on monies obtained from the European taxpayer .
The Committee on Budgetary Control also receives a quarterly report on the implementation of the budget .
The case of the hormone-treated meat shows , yet again , just how many defects and injustices that treaty contains .
The first is the underimplementation of the Structural Funds .
Mr President , I have a question that I should like to put to you concerning the
