undergo reform .
We have to remember that its ability to grow , enlarge and face up to ever newer challenges has made the Union both unique and long-lasting .
We Finns now hold the Presidency of the Council for the first time .
For my own part , I would like to emphasise the fact that the work of the Council also has to be advanced .
The Council is expected to provide political leadership to give real added value to the lives of our citizens .
During its Presidency , Finland intends to embark on new projects to improve the work of the Council .
We would also like the General Affairs Council to assume a relevant role in managing the work of the Council .
I am very happy to see that the new Commission 's policy corresponds word for word with the key aims of the Finnish Presidency .
The European Union must be ready both politically and financially to invest in developing the Western Balkan region , so that democracy and stability can take root there .
On Monday , the European Union 's General Affairs Council stressed that the Union furthermore intends to help the Serbian people , who are suffering from the disastrous policies their leaders have pursued .
When we finally start to put an end to the sanctions we imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia we will realise that the government in Belgrade and the Yugoslavian people are two different things .
We agreed on Monday that first we would remove the sanctions that were imposed on the people , such as the flight ban and the avoidance of sporting links .
Next , we should be defining the ways and means by which we can make their situation easier .
Furthermore , we confirmed the decision taken by the Heads of Member States and Governments in the General Affairs Council to set up an agency responsible for the rebuilding of the region , and we decided to hold a South-Eastern Europe Stability Pact Summit in Sarajevo .
We discussed this at length on Monday in an open sitting of the General Affairs Council .
We were all unanimous on the subject of developing this area , and adhering to a tight schedule .
However , I hope we will remember that the Union is by no means solely responsible for the restructuring programme in Kosovo .
MEPs have , in many different connections , stressed the great importance of the Union as a driving force behind , and a guarantor of , peace and stability in our continent .
In one respect at least the next phase of enlargement will differ from all those that went before : co-operation within the Union itself has reached a level that will place very great demands on all applicant countries .
Enlargement is a process which must move forward constantly and which cannot be allowed to be compromised with empty promises .
During the Finnish presidential term , accession negotiations will continue in a spirit of determination .
The European Council in Helsinki intends to reach a decision , on the basis of a report by the Commission , to include new applicant countries in accession negotiations .
We have already begun preparations for an Intergovernmental Conference , and we intend to draft a chairmans ' report on it for the European Council in Helsinki .
Turkey is an important partner for the Union .
In this connection , I would like to stress the fact that the Union opposes the death penalty everywhere and in each and every case .
It is a common aim of the European Union to do away with capital punishment .
If the sentence passed on the Kurdish leader , Öçalan , were to be carried out , it would be an unfortunate turn of events in Turkish policy .
It is to be hoped that Turkey will continue to postpone the implementation of the death penalty until it is abolished entirely .
One of the common values of the Union is to refrain from carrying out the death penalty .
Many matters of current interest , including Russia and the northern dimension , are thus certainly on the agenda , but I would still like to raise one question that is of topical interest : the outlook for the peace process in the middle East since Barak 's government came to power is brighter than it has been for years .
The European Union is actively promoting the peace process in both political and economic terms .
Regardless of whether we speak of the proliferation or the prevention of conflict , there is one thing we can be sure of : we can only assist others if our own wealth is assured .
During the coming months , we will scrutinise how the information society can be utilised in order to enhance our ability to compete .
We can only create new employment opportunities if our economy is doing well .
I know that all these problems are important to this House , and that the European Parliament has carried out important work in promoting them .
I was talking before about how the Union can have an impact on strengthening security in Europe and the world in general .
At the Tampere European Council , there will be an attempt to create a more uniform , more united policy on immigration and asylum-seeking and increased efforts to prevent cross-border criminality .
The European Parliament will play a crucial role in the process .
It is important to point out , as the Foreign minister made clear in her speech , that together , the internal reform of the Union and the strengthening of civil societies all over Europe will form the cornerstone of EU development in the future .
Emphasis on these goals can be seen very clearly in the Finnish Presidency programme
