that 12 000 human beings have drowned or otherwise gone missing over the past ten years .
My third point is that Frontex has still not solved one problem which you , Commissioner , raised when you said that we should contribute to bringing down the number of dead and missing persons .
There is no point crying crocodile tears over deaths and humanitarian incidents when we do nothing to defend our coastline .
The Member States were supposed to establish income thresholds and an obligation on anyone entering our countries to demonstrate that their funds are legal .
In the report we emphasise the key reasons why the WTO and trade multilateralism require a new , stronger , more dynamic and democratic structure .
The guiding criterion for the Doha Round has been to involve all member countries in negotiations on a whole range of matters , whereas in such a broad-based organisation efforts should be made to develop a plurilateral approach incorporating a form of 'variable geometry ' .
As concerns transparency and the parliamentary dimension of the WTO , the transparency of international dispute settlement proceedings needs to be increased so as to improve the WTO 's external image .
I would make the most of their political and , as it were , technical support this evening to point out to the Commission once again that no time must be wasted .
Taking global responsibility to combat climate change is a crucial task that has to be achieved at various levels : not just in the world of enterprises and institutions , but among individuals as well .
I consider that it is essential for the European Union to achieve the goal of 20 % of consumption from renewable sources by 2020 .
This has resulted in high bank charges , particularly in Italy .
The Commission expects inflation to peak in the near future due to soaring food , energy and commodity prices .
It is partly because of financial speculation that the food crisis is spreading across the world .
Unfortunately , all too often , as with the report that we unanimously approved in committee , European policy is in fact the policy of the Member States .
It is difficult to have a European policy on human rights when Member States impose their national interests to this degree .
That is true !
We believe that this is important for migrants and for asylum-seekers , who are often expelled from our countries and sent to places where individual freedoms and fundamental rights are not guaranteed .
Never before has the Commission been so weak in terms of proposals on human rights and democracy throughout the world , as demonstrated , for example , by the refusal to deploy the democracy clause that Parliament voted on two years ago .
In my opinion , the Kurdish question is the key to the future of a democratic Europe , all this together with general and generic formulations about human rights , which smack of double standards .
The advice I would like to give , which is contained in the report , is to talk more about assessing results than about the individual instruments obtained .
It argues for non-violence not only as the absence of violence , as pacifism , but as an active campaign of disobedience and sabotage of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships .
Since the activities of the Fund are important for the citizens of the Union , and will continue to be important in the future , as the Commission has underlined , we consider that its continued financial support is necessary for 2007 and for 2009 .
This also results in a trade deficit of over EUR 1.2 billion per annum .
I would also like to point out that perhaps there is a fundamental misconception here : this report is not concerned with and takes no decision on prolonging aid payments to tobacco producers ; it is merely a question of voting on a report which advocates prolonging the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund .
The report is extremely balanced and represents a rare and positive example of integration between the EU 's agricultural and health policies .
To offer consumers better protection , Mr Lehtinen 's report proposes improving the existing legislation in the relevant areas , making it simpler and smoothing out any regional differences .
This would mean that , when docked , ships would be encouraged to use a land-based electricity supply .
We are not do-gooders , but there have been episodes of extreme violence , intolerance and racism , which must be called by their real name if we want to start putting them to rights .
Yesterday however , with its partisan decision , it chose a different path , although perhaps this was just for the benefit of the media .
We wonder , however , why the Roma situation in Italy was not picked up by Mrs Moh√°csi last year , five months ago , or even a year and a half ago .
Why is Parliament talking about this today , five weeks from the vote , when it failed to address the issue clearly when it was obviously urgent ?
The fight against discrimination and the commitment to integrating the Roma is enshrined in parliamentary votes .
The Kurdish issue cannot be reduced solely to a social matter .
Anyone who uses them is evidently acting in violation of international humanitarian laws .
We confirmed this in 2006 with the adoption of a resolution on chemical weapons and inhumane conventional weapons .
Take action .
We must acknowledge that a solid way of accelerating , rationalising and where necessary , making these processes for validating alternative methods more transparent is envisaged Our debate this evening will now become a touch more formal .
May I therefore express my thanks and appreciation to its senior management
