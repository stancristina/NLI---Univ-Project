been concluded with Turkey .
Although the decision at issue here relates only to the technical aspects of the customs union , it is appropriate in this connection to state our well-founded concern at the human rights situation in Turkey .
However , in the debate on the situation in Turkey it needs to be stated plainly that the outside world must respect every country 's election results and a religious trend must not in itself be a ground for disapproval .
It is impossible to work together if one side continually takes an indifferent attitude to the conditions for cooperation .
It also gives rise to difficult ethical problems .
What , for example , happens to those human embryos which are 'left over ' from artificial fertilization ?
Or can the genome be changed by any specific gene ?
However , immediately afterwards , the declaration states confusingly that the welfare of the individual should be paramount alongside the exclusive interests of society and science .
The articles of the declaration also take up a position on consent procedure .
There is also a problem that it is in any case not healthy always to understand what the doctor is saying .
The Green Group voted in favour of the report because it is important that we now take up a clear critical position towards this international agreement .
For example , the lack of any reference to genome research is dangerous .
However , the report suffers from two failings : firstly , it does not admit NATO 's position as the cornerstone of Europe 's security structure .
Secondly , the report does not make sufficiently clear the importance of neutrality as a part of Europe 's developing security system .
Neutrality is not necessarily an ancient dogma carved on stone tablets , but in the current situation it is a positive element in the stability of Europe , particularly northern Europe .
The debate has centred on Karadzic and Mladic but I am not so na√Øve as not to see that there are some 30 people on all sides in this war , as Carl Bildt mentioned , who should be brought before the Hague Court .
For the rest , I-For 's operations are in my opinion a good example of the fact that , although we have not yet got common defence policy guidelines , because some of us are neutral countries - not non-aligned , but neutral - we have all worked together in the I-For troops , our neutral Finland as well as the NATO countries .
Madam President , at last we have got round to discussing freely those recommendations which the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted unanimously , with the exception of two members , as long ago as April .
I do not intend to take you all through the long history , which has led to there being a People 's Republic of China and a Republic of China , referred to hereinafter as Continental China and Taiwan so that there will at least be no confusion in interpreting , as sometimes happens .
First of all , in the 1980s there was the remarkable economic development which led to democratization , and also in the 1980s there was a rapprochement between Continental China and Taiwan and an improvement in relations between them .
The fact that Taiwan had repealed the laws from the period of martial law as early as the 1980s , did not help this cooling off in the 1990s .
President Li was re-elected Taiwan 's President in the general elections in March this year .
In his discussions since the election he has stressed his desire to hold a dialogue with Continental China on cooperation and the relaxing of relationships .
I have myself drawn up a report on the subject in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , which was adopted here , as I mentioned , in April this year with only two members opposing it , but which owing to the opposition of the Socialist Group and for technical reasons it has not been possible to debate in this house .
All the European Union Member States have their own information offices in Taipei , and I have therefore proposed that the European Union could also open an information office there .
In my opinion we in Europe should feel a sense of responsibility because we have demanded democracy from Taiwan , and Taiwan has gone a long way down that road .
The Finnish translation should say 'in the activities of bodies answerable to the UN General Assembly ' and in point ( d ) 'the Council urges the Commission to adopt measures ' .
The Finnish language translation is quite inappropriate , even though the original language of these recommendations was Finnish , and I do not know how this entirely inappropriate Finnish wording ended up here .
Madam President , I should like to state very briefly that we should not be hypocritical and two-faced in this house but should discuss matters openly .
And that is what we are talking about today - not about the fact that the Socialist Group wished at all costs to prevent the subject of Taiwan being discussed as an urgent question .
If we oppose something we must oppose it openly instead of saying that we have never opposed anything but its being debated as an urgency .
Mr President , the green fields of Ireland made a great impression on this Finnish Member when I visited Cork and its surrounding countryside a little while ago .
I also agree with the rapporteur , Mr Gillis and the Agriculture Committee fully that a disaster which affected sheep-rearers as a result of a sudden drop in prices should be compensated responsibly .
It is rather difficult to understand the Council 's line on sheepmeat production .
