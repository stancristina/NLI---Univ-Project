The action plan for sustainable development is after all to be presented by the Commission .
These should be the ecological element , the economic element and the social element .
We have every confidence in the Commission ' s ability to produce a strategy for sustainable development that makes Europe become even greener .
In the order that was established in connection with the European Council meeting in Cardiff , there are a number of factors that each Council constellation must observe in its work and which are then put together .
For obvious reasons , I cannot go into more detail about how the Commission will draw up its strategy , but must instead ask that the question be put to representatives of the Commission .
These negotiations are based in the first instance on the existing common regulations , but this still leaves us opportunity to point out to the applicant countries the important issues concerning sustainable development that the Council is in the process of discussing , in this case in the area of transport .
I will attempt to answer them as briefly as possible .
As far as concrete indicators in the area of transport are concerned , I would ask the Member if we might return to this when , in April , the Council has adopted a resolution that concerns precisely integration in this area .
There are great many concrete plans , but the Council has not yet had opportunity to discuss this .
We shall then be able to obtain answers to the questions that the Member has put .
The Commission report to which Mrs Paulsen refers deals in the first instance with transportation of animals .
Once these proposals have been submitted , the presidency will start work in the Council working party as soon as possible .
The Commission can also , so to speak , be pressed to produce proposals faster and more effectively .
I know that there are legislative shortcomings , but it is better to force through the observance of laws that already exist than to wait for additional new laws .
I can assure you that the presidency regards this matter as having the utmost priority .
The facts in this area are in many cases horrendous .
( SV ) Let me first of all point out that the Council does not comment on documents - including articles in the press - that are put to the Council outside the institutional framework .
I would remind you of the important debate on this matter that we had in his Chamber approximately a month ago .
Recently , we saw drowned people washed up on the Spanish coast .
Such tragedies occur around Europe every day , if not always in such spectacular forms .
Joint efforts are required here at EU level .
The smugglers must of course be punished , and airlines that allow persons without valid documents to board must pay fines .
I do not believe it is .
The report written by the rapporteur is an important modification of the French proposal , because he attempts to see the nuances .
It is also important to emphasise that the purpose of this proposal for a directive is not to make it more difficult for people to seek asylum or migrate to the European Union .
In spite of the fact that the Member States have agreed to establish a common immigration and asylum policy , all energy is being focused upon producing proposals aimed only at making it more difficult for people to enter the EU , whether they be refugees or people looking for work .
Europe needs a common immigration and asylum policy characterised by humanitarianism .
By means of a policy which affirms both asylum seekers and immigrants , we can get on top of organised crime and the human tragedies for which traffickers in human beings are responsible .
Korakas Report ( A5-0022/2001 )
We also oppose the demand to establish new Community financial aid to producers ' organisations , as tabled in Amendments 18 and 19 .
We also oppose the demand , made in Amendment 22 , to secure permanent support for the nut sector by means of new flat-rate aid per hectare aimed at preserving existing income levels for producers .
There were nonetheless a number of wordings which were of central importance to ourselves in the ELDR Group and which made it all the clearer that the Stockholm Summit will also have to debate important reforms in favour of a competitive Europe .
I would add that , as a new Member , I have possibly not become familiar with all the parliamentary conventions in the course of a year and a half .
I voted against Mr Bullmann' s report , mainly because clarity is required if Parliament ' s views are to be accorded any value .
It is important to emphasise that politicians do not create jobs .
Unfortunately , the situation appears to be getting worse and worse .
The ELDR Group is very worried about this and appeals to the Commission and the Council to put increased pressure on China regarding human rights issues .
Catholics report systematic persecution .
We know that there are now at least 600 political prisoners in Tibet , most of whom are monks and nuns .
Thousands of cases of torture , atrocities and ill-treatment are also being reported , as is the fact that thousands of people are in work camps and countless individuals have been punished with imprisonment following summary trials .
It is , of course , that much more repugnant when journalists are in danger of being executed just for doing their job .
In January , the newspaper Frontier Post published a reader ' s letter , following which the newspaper ' s staff were taken into custody
