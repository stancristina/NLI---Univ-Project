We condemn those fuelling Israeli aggression .
The ΕU continues to provide economic support for Israel through association agreements and to arm it .
The continuing conflict in Georgia concerns us all , because it creates the conditions for the destabilisation of the Caucasus as a whole , with repercussions on the strategic security interests of the European Union and its Member States , the Balkans and the south-eastern Mediterranean and Middle East as a whole .
Strategic planning is required , together with strong economic aid in the form of assistance from the European Investment Bank and preferential trade relations with Georgia and the other countries in the Caucasus .
The European Union needs to dynamically integrate relations with the Caucasus into political dialogue with Russia .
Within the framework of this huge effort and of massive competition , science is contributing by finding new solutions which promise great performances .
We therefore find ourselves up against a new reality , the much-publicised doping .
Even though WADA updates its list of banned anabolic agents almost daily , the social problem is becoming more acute and it is the young people watching their models humiliated who are the victims .
We therefore need immediate solutions and action at global and , more importantly , at social level in order to identify the problem and promote the necessary legislative arrangements .
Just the other day , one of the best baseball players in the United States died of a heart attack due to excessive use of anabolic agents .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the problem of doping is contrary to the ideals of sport , as you quite rightly said .
In other words , some 3 700 000 European citizens use these substances .
Secondly , by creating a legal framework – and I am delighted that you corrected the point that WADA should be an organisation under public law – which will allow the European Commission to participate efficiently in its work , in accordance with everything we had the opportunity to discuss together .
The European Parliament 's Committee on Culture and Education , which I have the honour of chairing , decided at my initiative to organise a massive public hearing in November entitled ' Doping – An Obstacle to the Sporting Ideal ' .
Two and a half years have passed since then and we have seen neither the one proposal nor the other .
The Commission should therefore draft a directive on the basis of public health and the European Parliament should give it its urgent attention .     – Mr President , the real reason behind the huge problem of doping is the commercialisation of sport , the admission that there can be professional athletes and that there is therefore such a thing as professional sport .
Victory is so instrumental to commercial success that any means are admissible .
Every form of professional sport needs to be abolished , the umbilical cord between sport and business and sponsors needs to be cut , mass amateur sport needs to be consolidated ...     – Mr President , the Commission replied to Mr Staes ' written question last January , relating to the taking of measures against doping , that it had no plans to harmonise this particular sector of sport .
The financial interests of the huge multinationals , the companies which sponsor professional sport , are only served when the performance of the athletes is outstanding .
This , ladies and gentlemen , is the direction in which we need to move .     . – The aim of the proposed amendment to Regulation (EC ) No 1268/1999 is to approve the pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe which did not join in May 2004 , Romania and Bulgaria .
That is why we also disagree with pre-accession programmes designed to bring the rural economy of the applicant countries into line with the CAP.     . – The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the resolution on the ratification procedures of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the communication strategy because its basic aim is to mislead the people of the Member States and to pervert the history of Europe .
We cannot fail to observe that the resolution makes no mention whatsoever of the need for objective information or even the facility for choice on the part of the people ; on the contrary , it emphasises support for the historic importance of the agreement .
The future directions defined by the Commission for Tampere ΙΙ speed up the general attack on the personal and political rights and freedoms of the people .
They reinforce the opaque , centralising services and the security and information systems of the EU.
They result in drastic limitations on the granting of asylum .
That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report .     – Mr President , a meeting of the PPE-DE Group in the Committee of the Regions was held in Athens on 15 October at the initiative of the Mayor of Athens , Mrs Bakogiannis , on the subject of ' Cities ' Safety and Security Policies ' .
The present price rise appears not to be simply a short term or speculative rise ; on the contrary , it also reflects structural changes which may well result in multiple reviews of the global economy .
As a result of these negative developments , there is an urgent need for the Commission and the Council to proceed with immediate action and medium term interventions .
Secondly , we should stress the need to configure a stable and effective European framework for dealing with upward trends and sudden fluctuations in oil prices .
Finally , we
