Circumstances have also revealed the need for the so-called 'rapid reaction facility ' , as proposed by the Commission .
Remember Romano Prodi' s major speech in this Chamber a few weeks ago .
I should therefore ask both the Council and the Committee on Budgets here in Parliament to think in terms of foreign policy and not only in terms of budget strategy when they concern themselves with foreign policy .
Mr President , in submitting the Budget for the coming year , the Commission has this time chosen a new method of presenting the figures .
We have the expenses distributed among policy areas and according to activities .
The educational aspect lies in the fact that we shall all be better able to see what we are getting for our money .
As elected representatives , we are of course delighted with any move to make the Budget more easily understandable .
When , however , expenses are allocated according to activity , this also paves the way for the Budget ' s being seen more in terms of a political tool , in which the distribution of expenditure reflects clear political priorities .
That is the sort of question we must ask ourselves when we study the Budget , for it is of course questions of this kind that our voters will quite rightly be asking .
There are major organisational changes under way , and there is a need for a new culture involving both a genuine desire to accept responsibility for implementing the individual parts of the Budget and acceptance of the fact that there are consequences if the responsibility is not fulfilled .
As Commissioner Schreyer has already mentioned , there are many political announcements coming out of this year ' s Budget : the reorganisation of agricultural policy , new structural programmes , measures to ensure better implementation of the structural policy , and steps designed to follow up the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit for creating a stronger and more competitive EU and for combating social exclusion .
There is a great need for EU aid in both the applicant countries in the Third World and in the Balkans .
All of us - the Council , Parliament and the Commission - agree that we must be thrifty , and we have all kept dutifully below the established ceiling for expenditure .
I do not think our electorate will appreciate technical justifications in terms of the Budget for the fact that we cannot in harmony find the money for Serbia and the Balkans without reducing our efforts in other countries .
There is no popular demand to the effect that there must be no revision of the financial perspective .
There is , however , a popular demand that we solve the problem of how best to provide aid to Serbia .
Their purpose is not to kill but to disable and cause the worst possible pain and distress for the victims , their families and their countries .
They are , unfortunately , incredibly cheap to produce and wildly expensive to find and destroy .
It was the Liberal , Jan Willem Bertens who raised the matter five years ago in Parliament , and I think this Parliament can really pride itself on having set the ball in motion so that we are now on the way towards a ban on mines .
More still can be done , however .
I have seen such a machine in Kosovo , but it was idle and not in use .
Mrs Bonino and Mr Patten are right in saying that it makes obvious sense to destroy the stockpiles , because the cost of destroying a stockpiled mine is only a hundredth of that of destroying one which has been transported to a place where it is difficult to find .
Mrs Bonino and Mr Patten are also right to say that Parliament and the Council should not interfere with the administration , and I listened carefully to Mr Patten' s remarks on this point for he obviously thinks we should interfere still less .
We should refrain from getting involved in the administration .
We should not , however , be controlling the Commission from a distance .
The Commission must have the freedom to exercise its powers , and we for our part should be free to slam the Commission - if I may use that expression - if it does not do the work well .
It is refreshing to have such an experienced rapporteur .
My own country took all too long to do so , unfortunately .
There is a problem in the report .
In my opinion , there is a tendency to try to relieve the CFSP of civil assignments .
What I mean in actual fact is that , in addition to carrying out their normal developmental and humanitarian activities , the Council , the CFSP and the Member States should be required to match any amount spent on military activities with at least a corresponding amount for civil activities , for example mine clearance in the relevant areas .
The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the report on action to be taken against anti-personnel mines .
Denmark has participated in humanitarian mine clearance on a number of occasions when the intervention concerned has been civil rather than military .
The actions were financed with resources from many different budget lines .
Parliament supports this solution because the present structure , with many different budget lines , is not transparent and does not contribute to coherent intervention .
It is therefore also difficult right now to predict whether the initiative will clash with the Danish opt-out .
It will , however , be annoying if Denmark cannot participate in a project whose purpose is completely to do away with the feared and inhumane
