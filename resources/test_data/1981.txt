We in the Liberal Group have had discussions , as have others , on what the absolutely correct model should be .
What is crucial for us is that something should happen , that the fraud unit should be strengthened , so that we are in a better position to combat internal fraud and corruption .
It is vital that the system be strengthened now , so that we are better able to combat corruption and fraud .
Madam President , we must strike a blow for consumers , not because some elsewhere might think that the European Parliament lacks faith in itself , but because the consumers ' interests need to be brought into focus .
I am surprised that the Commission then only gives public health , research and transport as examples and does not mention the integration of consumer concerns into areas such as agricultural policy , competition , financial services and , last but certainly not least , the EU 's food policy .
This rule makes it impossible for many smaller consumers ' organisations to take part in projects , because they simply cannot afford to pay the remainder themselves .
Also consumers ' organisations in the smaller countries , including the Consumers ' Advisory Council in Denmark , have problems with this form of financing .
The EU should pursue consumer policy in such a way that it is actually feasible , for smaller consumers ' organisations too , to take part in projects .
And it must also be remembered that it is often the EU , rather than the consumers ' organisations themselves , that wants to launch various campaigns , and that in this context the EU needs reliable consumers ' organisations , indeed organisations like the Danish Consumers ' Advisory Council , to take charge of these campaigns .
Also we find it unacceptable that the administrative part of the EU 's consumer campaigns is often so complex that it demands an incredible amount of patience for the staff of the organisations to take part in these EU projects .
Finally , having said that , I would like to thank Philip Whitehead because , once again and - as usual - in an excellent report , he has struck a blow for consumers ' interests .
Its sights should be set on the fastest possible transition to sustainability , with renewable energy sources explicitly stipulated as the main aim of the energy policy and energy prices clearly reflecting the real environmental costs .
Apart from a zero contribution to CO2 emissions , renewable energy sources offer long-term security of supply and remove the element of threat from the geopolitical context .
The Danish experience is unequivocal .
Good results were obtained by providing stable growth opportunities for private popular initiatives with satisfactory economic terms for the consumers , and without interference from the State .
There is instead a need for a broadly based effort , in which energy solutions for the future grow out of local initiatives promoted by both high-profile consumer groups and smaller institutions and firms .
I would welcome a framework programme based on the principles I have outlined , so I strongly urge you to support the Green amendments opposing nuclear energy , in particular Amendment No 17 .
Mr President , I would also like , on behalf of my group , to congratulate the Nobel Committee in Oslo on such a splendid and well-balanced choice .
We know John Hume here in Parliament as a man who has consistently worked for peace - certainly during the 19 years I have known him here .
My group has also had the opportunity to meet David Trimble on a few occasions and have only words of praise for the Protestant side in the peace settlement .
I do not know how many group chairmen in this House would put forward proposals if they were part of such an obvious minority in their groups .
I think that Mr Trimble has made a very impressive contribution to the peace process .
I therefore feel that the Nobel Prize Committee is fully justified in awarding the prize equally to both sides in the conflict .
I urge all the other groups to hold study days in Belfast , to get to know that beautiful area and see how , together , we can lend a hand in the peace process in Belfast , for they deserve it after so many years of war .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner Kinnock , I will be brief in what I have to say on this excellent report , on this excellent initiative .
Standards and rules are quickly taken up , whether they relate to motor vehicles , boats , trains or aeroplanes .
Point 9 of the report describes the cooperation between the Member States and the Commission .
We need to have an overview so that we can ascertain whether what we have agreed is being implemented .
Education and examinations are one thing ; how safety is assured in everyday practice is another matter .
I am sure that the Commission wants to get the Member States ' cooperation in such a scheme on a voluntary basis .
I will say to Mr Kaklamanis that , if only we can get this report by Mr Koch adopted and implemented , then we shall have achieved a great deal .
We must do that another time .
But I wish the Commission every success , and of course we support the proposal .
Mr President , the biggest problem with the nitrates directive is - as Mrs McKenna has said - not the directive itself , but the lack of action to implement it in the Member States .
It cannot be the intention that tough environmental rules which are adopted in the EU should be simply shelved in the
