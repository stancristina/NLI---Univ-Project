The costly investment involved , which is almost entirely to be borne privately , readily becomes concentrated in densely populated areas and , even there , among the affluent .
As a result , we shall develop society as a whole , and not only networks .
Changing operators does not present any problems , and is part of the everyday routine .
Competition is completely open .
Our country is remote , but we still are not making any progress towards attaining democracy in the new networks , and we need it .
If I had known that one day I would be reporting to the European Parliament on regulations concerning the maximum speed of tractors , I should certainly not have let the chance slip .
But as technology has progressed , manufacturers have also placed on the market more powerful tractors , which can travel at 40 km/hr .
It is now intended that new type approval provisions should be adopted , to enable tractors with a design speed of 40 km/hr to obtain EU-wide type approval .
This does not in itself have anything to do with increasing the length of the procession of tractors when farmers hold demonstrations : it really is mainly a matter of a reform required by tractor manufacturers .
We raised such questions as the possibility of seat-belts .
The third point which Parliament wanted clarified was the possibility of regular inspections .
It has also been noted that attention should be devoted to driving safety .
It was not possible to concede Parliament 's third demand , that an amendment be introduced concerning inspections .
As rapporteur , I can perfectly accept that we should not concern ourselves with inspections here , and I strongly recommend that Parliament approve this common position at second reading .
I can only advocate that this recommendation be approved and that the measure enter into force as soon as possible .
Everyone can breathe a sigh of relief and I hope we can then bring this proposal into force at the earliest possible date .
The purpose of the ad hoc procedure for agricultural expenditure is to arrive at a budget which is realistic in the light of the latest forecasts .
There are many reasons why it is difficult to estimate expenditure accurately .
In addition , the budget has been affected by the BSE crisis and swine fever , which could not readily have been predicted .
There is a need to invest in the longer term in the EU , for example by adopting agricultural policies and budgetary frameworks valid for between seven and ten years ahead .
I should like to conclude by asking Commissioner Liikanen 's opinion of the reserve system proposed by Mr Mulder .
The cooperation between the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Agriculture was open and really quite constructive .
Long experience has shown that rapidly changing market conditions and constant over-budgeting have affected appropriations for agricultural expenditure from year to year .
Cereals , in particular , are a sector where it is well known that various persistent uncertainties exist .
Agriculture there is significantly less productive and viable than elsewhere .
Experience of the ad hoc procedure has been reasonably good to date .
Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioner Bonino for her excellent answer .
Such flouting of EU rules and the export ban further undermines consumer confidence in beef , which is extremely regrettable given that the EU 's beef sector is already facing a serious crisis .
There ought to be harsher penalties for gaining financial advantage by means of deception which even runs the risk of endangering people 's health .
Mr President , the Commission 's proposal concerning enlargement of the Union is , in my opinion , a success .
A number of adjustments need to be made to the reform of agricultural and regional policy .
In this CAP reform , the special national agricultural support which the Union adopted because of Finland 's special northern conditions , but which Finland currently has to pay for by itself contrary to the general principles of the CAP system , must be incorporated in Community funding .
It is welcome even though Parliament has had to give way as regards the budget it was calling for , and although only ECU 7 million is to be allocated to the two-year programme .
Its purpose is to increase the knowledge and dissemination of works representative of the Member States ' culture .
It is intended that cooperation should be extended to third countries , especially in Central and Eastern Europe .
Further vocational training for translators is , quite rightly , one of the priorities of the programme , and is essential in the interests of promoting a high standard of translation .
The professional status of translators should be clarified , and up-to-date guides and databases should be established to assist their work .
I am glad that these opinions expressed by the Committee on Culture and by Parliament as a whole have been taken into account in the conciliation decision .
I hope that the Ariane programme will be a successful first step in efforts to develop and renew the whole European book sector . on the Fontaine report ( A4-0246/97 ) Madam President , it has already been mentioned here that Finland and Greece have not signed the Brussels agreement or declaration on a complete ban on landmines .
Unfortunately , Mrs GÃ¼nther , even in this house there are undoubtedly Finns who think that whatever is left unsaid is simply not true ; you have said yourself that not everything which is so needs to be said .
It is , after all , an external border of the European Union .
I know that this is a very sensitive issue , but nonetheless I should like to ask you
