to withhold their assent , as we saw in the Netherlands and France .
The ‘no’ votes should be respected .
Thank you , Mr President – if there is , in fact , anything to say thank you for .     Mr President , it is unacceptable that , in our relatively enlightened times , we permit a huge number of chemical substances in our environment , without having registered them and without being aware of their harmful effects .
We are in a situation in which this Parliament is divided , and the whole complicated proposal constituted by REACH could collapse into nothing .
We must note with regret that there is no majority in favour of the original proposal by the Committee on the Environment .
I do not believe that REACH is the last piece of legislation we shall adopt in this area because we are always acquiring new knowledge about the need to protect our planet’s environment .
The proposal now acceptable to Parliament’s large groups represents clear progress , however , and is far better than the present lack of clear legislation .
I am therefore able to support the compromise proposal .     Mr President , tens of thousands of chemicals surround us in our everyday lives .
They are in our clothes .
They are in the ball-point pen I am holding .
Unfortunately , we do not know very much about the effects of these substances .
We do not know what damaging effects they have on our health .
With REACH , we are being given the opportunity to obtain the basic data and to adopt a number of principles , which will be incredibly important .
It will thus no longer be up to the authorities – as it is today – to prove that a substance is dangerous with a view perhaps to withdrawing it from the market .
The second and very important principle whose implementation we need to arrange for is the substitution principle .
If there is a substance on the market that is dangerous and another that is not so and is thus a better alternative , it shall be compulsory to exchange the dangerous substance for the less dangerous one .
On the contrary , it is the chemical industry ’s only hope for the future that REACH be worded with just such stringency and that it force the chemical industry to innovate , to invest in research and fully to commit itself to those parameters within which it will have to compete in the future .     Madam President , I also wish to thank Mr Mandelson for advocating free trade and speaking up for those industries that benefit from free trade .
The kind of impression given is that the Commission has panicked at having been put under this pressure by forces in the EU that fear free competition .
It took place , however , in duly romantic and exclusive surroundings , so the odds were all on your side .
I therefore have a practical request to make to the Presidency and the Commission .
We all know of course that this necessary work needs to be carried out by the individual Member States .
The EU can and must , however , complete the work on creating a fully-fledged internal market for capital and services .
While the effects of the relationship therapy can still be felt , I would therefore call on the Presidency and the Commission to work towards ensuring that the European services and capital markets are fully liberalised .
I am convinced that , if this process is a success , it will yield genuine labour market reforms on the basis of the motto , ‘There is no alternative’ .
I should also like to put a clear question to you , Mr Straw .
Are you prepared to set a good example and ensure that you and the United Kingdom assume responsibility for administering an EU subsidy in your country , something that , unfortunately , your Chancellor last week refused to do ?
Thank you for your attention .     Mr President , I naturally agree with both my own group and the others that have put forward arguments against the Commission ’s proposal , and I shall not go over these arguments again in this Chamber .
We have seen dreadful pictures from China of bears kept in cages for the sake of their fur , but it is not , of course , only bears with which we are concerned here .
Fox farming is outright cruelty to animals .
I should like to emphasise that we must broaden our perspective in order to avoid legitimising the brutal treatment of animals on farms in both China and Denmark .     Mr President , there are three important reports we are debating in this Chamber this evening .
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in connection with the report on weapons of mass destruction , I think that the report is sound , robust and well-balanced .
It is a very comprehensive report , but the subject too is , of course , very important .
In the period in which we live , in which the threat comes not from the Cold War but from rogue states and terrorist organisations , it is crucial that monitoring should take place of who possesses these weapons and crucial that the latter should not fall into the wrong hands .
We must , however , constantly work to ensure that countries that must not have nuclear weapons give up developing them .
We must also work to ensure that countries that possess nuclear weapons illegally , that is to say Pakistan , India and Israel , sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT )
