call upon the Council to take up the initiative of organising an international convention on the use of live tissue to prevent human embryos being marketed and used for unnatural purposes .
Question No 58 by (H-0602/00 ) : Subject : Delay in issuing a 'certificate of specific character for foodstuffs ' In 1994 , after a long process of preparation , research and discussion in the Italian sector concerned , an application was drawn up in respect of whole virgin honey in accordance with Regulation 2082/1992/EC .
I am aware that , since then , the common position on the directive has been redefined and that Parliament is expecting to hold a debate on the subject .
Let us be honest , we are all aware that we started the conciliation procedure from very opposed positions - there was even a certain amount of interinstitutional tension between Parliament and the Council - with many national differences in terms of both experience and interests .
So far , we do not have detailed documentation for all the States ; that is , we do not know the extent of the problem in all the Member States .
I would just like to use the rest of the time available to mention an amendment which is particularly important to me and which I believe people found difficult to assess objectively : the amendment on illegal child labour , which I will summarise now .
The system of sport which the European Union must aspire to must make the right to sport for all citizens a practical reality and aim to preserve the social function and traditional values of sport , while taking into account its economic and legal development .
Europe must be more forceful in the fight against doping , a phenomenon which , unfortunately , is growing very rapidly and is no longer confined to the world of sport : the spread of this scourge has led to an increase in highly lucrative illegal activities , in which many criminal organisations have been involved , and we need to recognise that entrusting the fight against doping solely to sporting organisations has been a complete failure .
Europe must also call for sportspersons ' professional qualifications to be recognised at European level and for their vocational training to be promoted .
I think we all agree on the role and importance of sport which , at both competitive and amateur level , is an excellent tool for the education and social integration of both players and spectators .
But I would suggest that we are going too far with these directives , and that we are taking up too much of Parliament ' s time discussing such technical subjects , such technically important subjects .
Would it not be preferable to authorise the Commission to decide in a single directive which new harmful elements should be marketed , thereby avoiding spending so much time on each occasion that this comes up , going through the procedures to ban the placing on the market of new products yet again ?
It is unthinkable that in sport , which stands for honesty and competitiveness , there are athletes who win because they use drugs .
I have tried , drawing on my wealth of experience , to make the Members of the European Parliament understand this .
This line was included in the pilot project which Parliament opted for in the 2000 Budget , providing for a large-scale anti-doping campaign .
I hope that this report will lead to the introduction of subsidised sporting events for the elderly .
I would like to make it clear that some of the points I had proposed were not approved , such as the status of sportspersons and the sporting contract etc .
I will mention but a few , listed in the last e-mail I received from Amnesty International : 50 civilians were killed last month by paramilitaries ; 400 civilian massacres took place during 1999 ; 3 500 victims of police crimes ; 1 000 abductions ; 250 000 Colombian civilians have been thrown out of their homes for political reasons .
It is Parliament 's responsibility to call for a system of rules and rights to be re-established , within the Colombian State , most importantly , as well as condemning the current situation in Columbia .
The elderly in the Member States have no opportunity learn , have no help from national states and are not even allowed to use school buildings , which accommodate children in the morning and could accommodate old people in the afternoon .
I would be grateful if you could pass on Parliament ' s concerns , its fierce condemnation of this act and its sympathy to the young Catholic teacher who was so brutally attacked because of his Jewish origins .
Mr President , we support and value Mr Skinner ' s work , although we do feel that , given the premises and , above all , the implications of the issue , he could have been a little more incisive , in view , moreover , of the fact that eleven years have passed since the first directive on the subject was produced and of the shortcomings of its amending directive which entered into force five years ago .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mr Evans on the quality and weight of his report .
These allegations are completely unfounded .
It is generally understood that agreements signed between competitors are likely to restrict competition to a much greater degree than other types of agreement .
Consumers will benefit from these economic advantages , but only if effective competition is maintained on the market .
However , a compromise does need to be reached between the businesses ' interests in exploiting the results of their own research and the public interest , in guaranteeing competition on the new markets .
