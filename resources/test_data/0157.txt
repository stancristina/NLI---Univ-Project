States , in order to analyse their causes , repercussions and results and has examined examples of good practices which are working in certain Member States .
The Commission is also involved from the point of view of theoretical and political proposals .
We have already submitted two documents incorporating all the experience and proposals on how to combat racism at Community level , together with our experience in matters of education , training , research and policy for young people in order to address these matters .
Policy is based , at European level , on an institutional arsenal which we strengthened with the Treaty of Amsterdam but in which there is still room for further effort , by creating structures to study and analyse this phenomenon and support governments , by supporting a European network between various agencies so that they can increase public awareness and , of course , by exchanging and supporting national policies on education , the mass media , policies for young people and information at national level .
However , whether some of us like it or not , Europe is already a multiracial and multicultural continent and no racist is going to stop people intermingling and intermarrying .
The package of measures which Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already presented is , in my view , an integrated proposal and may provide a convincing response to the racism and xenophobia which we are witnessing today in the European Union .
We also need to mobilise political circles in the way suggested by the Commissioner and other honourable Members .
I should therefore like to make it clear that , as far as Turkey ' s candidature is concerned , the criteria have been laid down quite clearly .
( EL ) The plague of undeclared work is spreading through all the Member States of the Union at an alarming rate , especially in the less developed regions .
The constant harping on at summits and in other Union institutions about the need to reduce the famous "non-wage labour costs " is encouraging companies to implement this reactionary approach on their own initiative , by generalising undeclared work and extending it to a surprisingly large number of workers .
We need agencies and institutions to keep a close eye on companies .
Unfortunately , the European Parliament report under discussion goes in completely the wrong direction ; it basically backs employers and calls for even more neo-liberal measures on the job market , ostensibly in order to wipe out undeclared work .
Madam President , as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , transport and Tourism and as a Greek Member of Parliament , I wish to raise the subject of the sinking of the Express Samina last Tuesday .
We here in the European Parliament must undertake as quickly as possible to examine the Commission ' s proposals on safety standards at sea , especially the so-called Erika package , which contains the Commission ' s proposals on safety at sea following the accident last year involving this tanker .
I think that competition can help standards to improve .
Madam President , thank you for the message of sympathy which you sent the speaker of the Greek parliament in the wake of this unprecedented tragedy in Greek waters .
It is true that there are shortcomings in the application of regulations both , national and European , and the Greek government is addressing this matter with the utmost diligence .
That is why they have been banned from sailing , not because these people tragically lost their lives .
The unaccountability of shipowners is and always has been defended by successive Greek governments .
Who can possibly be opposed to that ?
That is the factor which we want quantified , Madam President .
I think that errors such as this should not recur in our official documents and that we should use official names , at least those which still apply .
It has used various means to highlight the important role of small and medium-sized enterprises in creating jobs and introducing technological innovations .
It is a public outrage to propose promoting a single European capital market , ostensibly to serve the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises .
For example , as regards the subject under discussion , an extensive hinterland which is currently served by a large number of ports could start channelling traffic to just a few of them in order to ensure that they meet the more stringent eligibility criteria .
And what about the cohesion we are all fighting for ?
Mr President , Commissioner , this is a highly technical subject , aspects of which affect the daily life of European citizens , not to mention the single market itself .
This legal limit has not explicitly been harmonised at a European level since it was not included in Directive 96/53 .
I should point out that , even in countries in which 15-metre buses are officially allowed , in practice they are refused entry or are sent back at the border .
Obviously , competitive considerations push some operators in the direction of longer buses .
Three axles give better circulating conditions and cause less wear on roads .
Adaptations of the maximum length of rigid buses will very probably bring about a demand for a similar change in legislation for rigid trucks designed to transport goods , although there may be not an overwhelming demand for such vehicles .
The reason is that buses - both inner-city buses and coaches - often have to operate in narrow streets in city centres during the rush hours , when many other vehicles , motorbikes , bikes , and pedestrians are on the road .
If this period were to end on 31 December 2009 , it would be very short , given that it would severely limit the service life of buses longer than 12 metres which are already licensed .
