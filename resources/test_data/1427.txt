Forests create peace .
A dead tree is sympathetic , and you can lean against it , whether it is warm or cold ; you can only lean against a rock when it is warm .
Now the basis of the activity is changing and the focus is on new approaches .
Furthermore , the Commission deserves thanks for a new type of communication , in which a field of industry has been comprehensively examined from the point of view of global competitiveness .
Our group supports the views set forth in the report and most of the amendments to it .
We ourselves are tabling a few amendments , which we ask you to support .
When it is at its best , the forestry sector can serve as a model for other sectors regarding how renewable natural resources can be exploited , how carbon from the atmosphere binds in products and how the materials supply chain works in an environmentally sustainable , yet , at the same time , economically profitable , way .
This importance is particular evident in the area of employment .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission and Mr Seppänen , who produced the draft report .
The report calls for the inclusion of the peat industry in the forest cluster .
This is most justified .
Peat will reinforce the situation regarding our self-sufficiency in energy and its guaranteed supply , which , alarmingly , are in decline ; and it will promote the combined production of electricity and heat , and bring with it the synergic benefit of the use of wood and peat for energy .
On the whole , peat should be compared to wood rather than carbon , for example , which is now how it is classed by the EU , going against what is factually correct .
Its origin is in principle exactly the same as that of other biomasses that derive from plants , for example wood .
Owing to its origin and essentially renewable nature , peat must be classified as a biomass fuel , but because it regrows substantially more slowly than other plants , a new , third category should be established and placed between fossil fuels and energy sources whose renewability rate is fast .
Peat is a biomass fuel with a slow renewability rate .
The Kyoto agreement does not include emissions from burning wood in the overall emissions burden , as the carbon that is sequestered in wood would be released in any case when the wood decays .
The area devoted to energy use is very small compared to the areas of marshland used in forestry and agriculture .
For example , in Finland we use less than half the annual growth of peat each year .
This need for coordination and coherence would in particular appear to apply to peat , and one important step on the road would be to change the way it is classified and its status , to correspond with its true nature .
The Commission is happy to adopt the report and the draft resolution .
We particularly agree with you that intangible factors , such as professional skills , innovations and research and development work , are cornerstones of the position regarding competition in European industry .
It accounts for 10 % of all industrial output in the EU , whether measured in terms of value added or number of jobs .
Five main areas of the industry form one of the biggest industrial sectors in the European Union .
The value of its output stands at more than EUR 300 billion , its value added at EUR 110 billion .
In the Commission communication the state of competitiveness in the forest industry and industries related to it was examined by viewing the sector in a new way , as a cluster , in which each sector ' s performance affects the competitiveness of the other sectors .
That is why the Commission has made a series of sectorial studies of the forest industry and industries related to it .
One is an advisory committee on forestry and forest-based industries , whose work got under way again in 1997 , and the other is a forum for forest and related industries .
The first forum was held here in Strasbourg at the beginning of September , it was made up of people of authority , and I might mention that the rapporteur , Mr Seppänen , was also present .
There were also discussions about publishing , which Mrs Flesch mentioned : ecommerce and industrial and intellectual property rights were discussed .
That will focus on a closer look at how forest-based and related industries can , for their part , promote sustainable development and optimise their contribution to the protection of the environment at all stages of the production chain from forestry itself right up to the end products .
Forest-based industries are those in which all the economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable development are closely dependent on one another .
The problem for the Commission has been that the resources of the Directorate-General for Enterprise have fallen by 20 % over the last year .
I am nevertheless prepared to take this matter up now as a subject for discussion again , mainly with a mind to looking at in which sector or in connection with which sector publishing would best be placed .
I will be in contact with representatives of the industry after this debate .
As the Cambodian judicial system is still frail , the trials are to be organised in such a way that both international and local judges will be presiding .
This concern is well-founded .
Last spring I myself was able to see how ordinary people were aiming at forgiveness , so that life could go on .
It is not always easy
