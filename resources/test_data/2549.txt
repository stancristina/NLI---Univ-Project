The amendment proposes that the obligation set out in the Seveso II Directive should be restricted and only cover mining operations concerned with ore processing , i .e . metal extraction .
There was widespread agreement when we discussed this matter in committee .
Thank you for such excellent cooperation .
Ladies and gentlemen , political movements which have long supported the very principles found in this document have been mocked in many contexts .
We also have a situation whereby we want more sea traffic without wanting to provide protection .
It is said that exhaust gases will be cut by half .
I , myself , have a boat over 30 years old in my boat house which would not meet these standards ; I believe it is a classic boat .
I therefore think that Amendment No 15 is unworkable , and that is also the point made by the rapporteur .
There is much to be done if we are to be able to engage with the recreational craft sector .
We have been greatly interested in the fact that the Commission has now tabled this .
Mr President , the Greens/EFA Group would , of course , like to congratulate the rapporteur .
Now , many aid organisations and non-governmental organisations are desperately waiting to receive money .
What plans are there for achieving this in practice ?
Sweden' s Christian Democrats do not support items 5 and 11 , which propose that the European Union should be given its own powers of taxation .
This is a development which we do not want to support .
Responsibility and duties must be linked to rights and eligibility .
Mr President , Commissioner , no one is unaware of the loathing felt in this house for the death penalty , wherever it may occur .
This requirement is irrevocable for membership of the European Community .
It is important to note that 90 per cent of all executions occur in only four countries .
The worst by far is China with over 1 000 executions this year alone .
Just the suspicion that one single person has been falsely executed - and we know this has happened in the US - should be sufficient reason to abolish the death penalty .
Here in Strasbourg , a successful conference was held two weeks ago .
It is encouraging that this is also the view of this House , and I hope that the Council and the Commission can work with the European Parliament to bring about such a day .
That is the theory , despite the fact that a large number of participating countries are brutal dictatorships which hold both democracy and human rights in contempt .
Beijing is the capital of one of the world ' s most hardline dictatorships .
In recent days , 15 women in a Chinese labour camp were tortured to death , with the authorities saying that it was suicide .
In a report on Beijing ' s candidature for the Olympic Games , the International Olympic Committee writes the following : ' The overall presence of strong governmental control and support is healthy and should improve operational efficiency of the Games organisation . '
The ELDR Group would therefore like to appeal to all members of the International Olympic Committee to vote against Beijing on Friday .
There is a way to influence Belarus via Russia .
This shows what kind of regime we are dealing with .
I am thinking firstly of the White Paper on governance and secondly of the communication on the Information and Communication Policy .
Having studied these documents , I am quite confused about the way in which the Commission intends to help us supervise the application of Community law and about how it intends to prioritise the issues concerned .
The June communication now tells us that the Commission is considering how the system is to look in the future and that the tasks of the lawyers concerned are perhaps to be transferred to national administrations .
I believe that we need to do some serious thinking , and I think that the Commission could have been more practical when it came to how this very issue was dealt with in the White Paper .
Moreover , the occupying power has the full support of the United States .
In occupied Belgium , did you treat your resistance fighters in the same way as the occupying forces ?
According to yesterday ' s SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung , the EU - or , properly speaking , the big five Member States of the EU ( we other , small countries are not asked ) - is now , according to a non-paper , to pursue a Middle East policy approved by the United States .
What has become of its ambitions to supplement its excellent economic and administrative support for the Palestinians with a powerful and well thought-out policy ?
Mr President , I would ask you to check the second part of recital M. The Swedish-language version states that it is a question of strengthening European citizenship .
The presence of a successful Western Europe and of political visionaries such as Kohl , Reagan , Thatcher and , for that matter , Gorbachev , is partly responsible for this success , but it was , above all , individual people ' s longing for freedom which made possible this revolutionary change to the age in which we live .
The enlargement process must be seen in this perspective .
Just as the Coal and Steel Union succeeded in its task of securing peace in the participating countries of Europe , we must now make sure that the European Union increases freedom and the opportunity for more people to participate in freedom of movement and that it increases prosperity , promotes diversity and contributes to solving our common problems involving crime and the environment
