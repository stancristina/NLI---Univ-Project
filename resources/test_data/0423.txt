abolished , people will go to Germany and buy cheap petrol and heating oil .
The taxes will end up in the German Treasury instead of the Danish Treasury .
We shall then be forced to lower our taxes and duties to the German level .
We have greater equality between people in Denmark than in Germany and the rest of the EU.
There are only guaranteed minimum prices for wind energy in three countries : Germany , Spain and Denmark .
Solar energy and wind power must not be exchanged for nuclear power .
Mr President , at the end of the report , the rapporteur describes the intention of the proposal as 'a major step on the way to tackling fiscal evasion and the distortions to the functioning of financial markets at Community level ' .
In other words , is it enough to take measures against tax evasion on interest income at EU level ?
It is necessary to take measures on a worldwide scale in this area .
I do not think there is any need in this House to remind you that there are tax havens in other parts of the world , outside the EU.
The possibilities are there .
But is not the real issue something different ?
Surely what this is really about is that , after the introduction of the single currency , the euro , on 1 January 1999 , some people cannot wait to bring about further harmonisation of the whole area of taxes and duties .
The former President of the European Commission , Jacques Delors , said that EMU was a launching pad for political union , and you cannot say it more clearly than that .
Why not say quite openly that , if monetary union is to function satisfactorily , it means that there must inevitably be a common policy on finance , taxation and redistribution ?
Perhaps the reticence is due to fear of the reaction which would come from the people if the unvarnished truth were told .
Mr President , the June Movement sees free access to information as the very cornerstone of democracy .
The public must retain the right to information and education at libraries and other publicly financed institutions .
In this context , consideration should be given to the weaker members of society .
A second general principle is that artists should own all the rights connected with the exploitation of their work .
In Scandinavia , we have a long successful tradition of solving difficult copyright issues with the help of licensing agreements , and we need to retain this option .
Such a principle is contrary to both copyright law and agreements , and would entail an unreasonable commercial risk for the newspapers .
In other respects I am in complete agreement with Mrs Thors with regard to this directive .
Mr van den Broek , you spoke about an EU charter of fundamental rights , but all the Member States have incorporated human rights into their own constitutions and there are also international rules on human rights , so what would the EU achieve through having a special EU charter on human rights ?
I would like to ask Mrs Bjerregaard whether there is such poor communication between the environment ministers and the Commission that the Commission is also unaware , as Mrs Ahern points out in her question , that in December 1998 the Scandinavian environment ministers complained to the UK Government about the radioactive pollution which also affects Scandinavian waters ; whether against that background it is not a very long time to wait until the year 2000 to start inspections ; and whether it would not be more relevant to immediately send the inspection team to Dounreay , as Mrs Ahern is asking the Commission to do ?
Madam President , the title of this debate is so boring that many people must believe it makes no difference .
In practical terms , the common position means that painters will now have information about what they are working with .
You may ask yourselves whether this kind of information ought not to be a human right .
In Denmark , we call it the painter syndrome .
We have finally silenced the oil industry , which tried to block the directive with every means at its disposal .
It should be clear to everyone that the EU is developing in the right direction and that the working environment and public health are now being improved , which is the only way to go if the EU project is to have public support .
Chemicals are still on our agenda in the EU.
Cooperation on the euro requires self-discipline , which prevents certain acts of stupidity and forces countries to show more consideration to each other .
It will benefit employment and social stability .
But it is still the Social Democrats who believe they can protect us against the effects of the euro through new centralised control instruments .
On the contrary , the euro is what protects us against old-fashioned social democratic policies of devaluation , deficit and interference in the operation of central banks .
We look forward to being able to join the euro and so enjoy its full benefits .
I appreciate that the Commissioner is being polite and diplomatic , but will he not give an opinion on paragraph 10 of the report ?
That is what I would like the Commissioner to give an opinion on .
The Commission usually says what it is for and what it is against .
Is the Commission in favour of paragraph 10 ?
The June Movement is opposed to union , so we are voting no .
The report 's proposal means that we can go to the polls , but that we as Danish voters will never again be able to change the law .
