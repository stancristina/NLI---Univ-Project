Finally , I should like to thank everyone who has been involved in doing a really great job : the Commission , the staff of the Commission and our people in Parliament .
Mr Asadbeg and Mrs Marina Buk Kristensen , in particular , have done an excellent job .
To my three colleagues , who do not wish to grant discharge , I would like to say that it would really have worried me if they had said that they wanted to grant discharge .
For some people it is a way of life to be at cross purposes and oppose everything .
It is quite all right that three groups should be voting against this report , in which case the rest of us will take responsibility .
Commissioner , thank you for your contribution .
I should like to ask you , Commissioner , if it is not correct that , when we implemented the single market in 1992 , there was an agreement that the national veterinary borders should apply in the event of a disease breaking out in any of the Member States .
A very restrained thank you as I am none the wiser .
There is an ongoing debate in Denmark about Denmark ' s position .
Article 5 is a very simple rule specifying that , if the other Member States subject to Title IV of the Treaty should decide to develop the Schengen acquis , then the Danish government and the Danish parliament may , in accordance with the constitution , decide , within a period of six months , whether Denmark should or should not take part .
Currently , there is the issue of the EURODAC Regulation which I believe is very closely linked to Schengen cooperation and the Schengen system .
The question is how far we are prepared to go in applying Article 5 in developing the Schengen acquis .
We no doubt all remember that , during the Schengen negotiations , it was emphasised how important it was for the Nordic countries that the Nordic Passport Union which is nearly 50 years old and which ensures that Nordic citizens can travel freely in the Nordic countries without their passports - or other identification documents , for that matter - should not be affected by the Schengen Agreement .
The exemption from the requirement to carry passports , which we have enjoyed for nearly 50 years , no longer applies .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Would you please answer the two other questions I asked on how the rules have been interpreted in other countries ?
I would very much like to hear your answer , as the debate in Denmark and the proposals put forward there seem like an April fool ' s joke .
I should like to have it confirmed that this point , referring to Article 75 , is about a development of the Schengen acquis .
In principle , this is about a development of the Schengen acquis , a fact which I should like to hear confirmed , and when it is claimed to be about extension of freedom , that is quite ironic for me personally , as I believe it would become quite a burden for those of us who travel around with many types of euphoriants in our bags due to our delicate health .
On behalf of the Liberal Group , I should like to thank the Swedish Presidency for its skilful leadership and the good start it has made .
On that point , we can all learn from Sweden .
That is something which must be changed .
We are delighted to see the Swedish foreign minister , who of course comes from a neutral non-aligned country , travelling around with her new travelling companions , the Commissioner for External Relations , Mr Patten and NATO' s former Secretary-General , Mr Solana , and we are delighted when , today , we hear the Swedish Prime Minister speak in favour of a common foreign policy .
We hope that he too will discover the value of using the European institutions , that is to say the Community method , rather than the intergovernmental method he has so far been a little too fond of .
That is the only way to peace .
In that way , it would be the moderates and not the men of violence who obtain the credit for the results .
That is more important than anything else for securing peace , freedom and prosperity in Europe .
We in the Liberal Group hope that you will listen to our colleague , Mr Olsson , who has proposed holding a round-table conference with the new countries on the subject of future agricultural policy .
We wish you every success , Mr Persson , and , regarding the Lisbon process , my fellow Liberal MEP will take the floor later and comment on what you have said .
Madam President , the Swedish Presidency began well but will now be remembered for having introduced more secrecy and less democracy .
The Lamfalussy report transfers legislative power from elected representatives in open assemblies to officials behind the closed doors of committee rooms .
Sweden has identified transparency as a key issue and has a culture of transparency from which we can all learn .
On 19 March , the Council also decided that future relaxations in the rules of confidentiality must be adopted by qualified majority voting and not , as is the case at present , by a simple majority .
It is those three countries which are the villains in the negotiations concerning transparency .
How can a German , Green foreign minister accept responsibility for secrecy ?
The Council cannot itself alter the Treaty ' s regulations from simple to qualified majority voting .
Nor has the Swedish Presidency submitted the rules to the European Parliament .
Those three countries
