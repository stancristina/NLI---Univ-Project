forgets illegal immigration and the essential fact that today one in every two people emigrating to the industrialised world does so illegally .
Mr Pirker poses some complex questions , but the answers are inadequate and even dangerous .
Others , who rejected any criticism of immigration , are suddenly seeing a potential terrorist in every foreigner .
In that respect I welcome Mr Vitorino 's statements .
I believe that that would be unreasonable and politically tactless .
We need to do this quickly , and that is why I said that we must , at the Laeken Summit , try to re-launch the European dynamic , because otherwise the outcome would be negative and not a true reflection of our opinions .
They believe that this is a useful , perhaps even essential , dimension in the solving of such problems .
I believe that there is no doubt at all that the two reports we have seen today prove that we need a common policy on migration and asylum .
We must ensure that the countries that receive refugees really do have the means to do so .
We can imagine what it will be like for the workers of Poland , the Czech Republic or Hungary , who will not even have the chance of compensation or early retirement .
Its evil deeds were denounced by Commander Masood , and it must now be destroyed , something which I hope will happen very soon .
We shall therefore be faced with the development of a very critical situation , because infrastructures on the Atlantic side are lagging behind .
The Commission raises the question from a general political viewpoint , and I can assure the honourable Member that when speaking to the authorities of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia we have always urged the need for decisions to be taken as quickly as possible .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to have the opportunity today to let you have an initial account of the results achieved at the Third United Nations World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , a conference which was held in Durban from 31 August to 7 September .
Here too , I would like to emphasise the difficulties arising from the use of the concept of 'race ' .
I should therefore like , for a moment , to come back to the result .
It presented an image of unity and consistency , and it supported the use of firmness , depending on the circumstances .
I am very pleased to have succeeded , on behalf of the European Union , with the support of the Commission , with the support of the Council , and with the support of the fifteen Member States , but also - which is very important - with the support of the thirteen candidate countries , to have succeeded , in fact , in saving this conference .
The second trap is the issue of reparations .
The European Union is perhaps not at the bottom of the league table when it comes to combating racism and discrimination , but there is still a great deal to be done .
On the other hand , the dynamism of the international NGOs is also noticeable , in the way they challenge power , assert principles , or , then again , consolidate a power already in place , hence in some cases their lobbying activities and their nickname of VGOs ( Voluntary Government Organisations ) .
Several countries , including European countries , were secretly relieved to see the conference focus on the Middle East question , which allowed them to dodge the issue of excuses and to put off dealing with the colonial debt .
This is because a small number of NGOs have been busy trying to equate Zionism with racism , and , even worse , have distributed texts and writings , examples of which I have shown to Mr Michel , in which they patently extolled the merits of the Holocaust .
This is , therefore , the time to seize their demand to respond with practical measures and start talking .
By this I mean that , if we had a more concise text , with a specific number of principles that can be generally applied , I feel that we would probably be able to produce a stronger text .
Yes , they naturally lack a number of points .
I am obviously giving these examples in order to convince you that your concerns were relayed and were expressed in Durban , but unfortunately we could not achieve everything .
I did want to bring up one particular subject - which Mr Sylla mentioned , I believe - that of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference , which is one of many forms of discrimination .
First of all , we must accurately monitor the funding , initially estimated to be in the region of EUR three billion , as well as the partners chosen , particularly private industries , and their involvement .
Europe is a major player in the aviation and space industries , but the European Union does not have aviation and space power , since it has never had a policy in this area until now and , as Mrs Langenhagen said , GALILEO is a historic beginning for us , our first Community programme .
Some may be in favour of a total liberalisation of trade , whereas others , myself included , believe that the system of Community exhaustion responds to the need to develop the integration of the single market , a favourable way of supporting Europe in the face of global competition .
The second aspect is that , on several occasions , the Court recognises that disparities do exist in the treatment of the Members of the European Parliament
