of Article 2 on the duties of the agency which makes the text clearer without altering its content , a reference to transparency and the protection of information , the removal of the reference to the seat of the agency , not that this will stop me from referring to it , the special adoption procedure for the work programme in the event of disagreement by the Commission , the representation of all the Member States on the administrative board and the participation of professionals not representative of branches without the right to vote , the power of the administrative board to examine specific issues without the presence of its professional members and the possibility of appointing or dismissing the executive director by a special majority of four-fifths of members .
This ensures the balance between the Council and the Commission , if at the expense of making the decision-taking procedure more difficult .
Obviously , I am referring to Luxembourg ...
For the rest , I too am in complete agreement with the rapporteur that , where there are alternative methods which allow animal testing to be avoided , we should use these alternative in vitro methods .
I must reiterate and stress that , as there are no satisfactory in vitro methods available , it would be irresponsible and absurd to do away with every facility for which there is , as yet , no alternative method .
Incidents such as we have seen in the past in the European Union , where people have lost their lives due to contaminated blood , must not be allowed to happen again .
Of course , it goes without saying that the confidentiality of personal data is assured because third parties will not have access to them .
Under the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the human body and its organs cannot be treated as commodities .
Consequently , I agree with the principle of voluntary , unpaid donation because I believe that , apart from the ethical implications , this impacts directly on the quality and safety of blood .
- ( EL ) ?he text of the decision on social inclusion following the vote on the amendments is a far cry from the original text of the Figueiredo report approved by the Committee on Employment .
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report , even though it retained a few positive points , including those I referred to in my intervention yesterday ( free , compulsory education for 12 years ) .
However , I am also disappointed by what the presidency had to say and I should like to ask a few specific questions : What are the real problems ?
We did not come here to provide a shoulder to cry on .
I agree with what Mr Lannoye said about our policies ; they have to change .
We really do have to say something to persuade them .
There are huge efforts which can be made both on the question of trade relations and on the question of funding , without overturning what was agreed in Doha and Monterrey .
( The President cut the speaker off )
The question of the 1994 aid , which the Commission approved , is being reopened but , at the same time , the Commission has failed totally to react to comments made in the European Parliament by Members such as myself on the competition for the sale of Olympic Airways .
Mr President , we are all extremely satisfied to have reached the end of the procedure to reform the 1976 directive on equal treatment for men and women , a directive which has played an important part in the life of working women in Europe .
The new directive will therefore be an important tool in achieving sexual equality in the workplace .
So we need to ensure that it is transposed into law in the Member States as quickly as possible and , more importantly , that information is broadly available to citizens , especially women , social agencies , the judicial system and the administrative system .
Mr President , a basic political problem has overshadowed all our debates over recent months : how to resolve the structural weaknesses in all areas of research in Europe .
I think that , together , we can find suitable solutions which will ensure that the European Union can safeguard the future and respond to its citizens ' expectations , given that today 's European economies and societies are going for knowledge-based development .
This was encouraging and came just at the right time .
Attracting new researchers and overcoming obstacles is something which concerns not just the countries of Europe but candidate and third countries as well .
And if I reiterate this issue , Commissioner , it is because I think that you agree on its importance .
But I think that the Bologna procedure and the common initiative we are waiting for from Commissioners Busquin , Liikanen and Reding will be of immense interest here .
However , I believe that a great deal of work still needs to be done in the society and science area , mainly strategic , structural planning .
Mr President , the European Council in Seville will be meeting in the wake of elections in a number of countries which have been marked by a rise in far-right and neo-Fascist forces as a result of the neo-liberal policies of their left of centre governments .
We are actively opposing these policies , this future of Europe .
The Council 's position has been improved by a number of amendments made by the European Parliament in connection with transparency , forwarding the agency 's findings to the Member States , the role of experts on the agency 's administrative board and combating fraud .
