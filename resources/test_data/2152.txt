'flexicurity ' and demographic change .
We have just heard that , if we were to stick at 20 % , the earth would get warmer by 4 or 5 degrees , in other words , that the adverse predictions of climate change would then turn out to be much worse .
We are talking about better regulation and about energy and climate change , but not in any way about the now long overdue beginning of a socio-environmental reconstruction that really would counteract the social division and climate-related catastrophe about the latter of which everyone is currently talking .
It is not sufficient that Europe leads the way in energy conservation and combating climate change ; it must convince others to take this course too .
The task of remedying this falls not only to the Commission .
The present distillation , representing EUR 600 million out of a total of EUR 1.4 billion , is certainly not an option for the future .
The fight is for purely material things , therefore .
My colleagues and I are agreed that this gross misconduct on the part of the representatives of the former Social Democrat/Green Federal Government needs to be investigated .
We continue to attach high priority to anti-terrorist cooperation with the United States .
If it were to be possible , for a joint effort , for example by way of the Quartet , to resolve the Middle East issue , that would take much of the wind out of terrorism 's sails .
Or are they the potential victims of those whose promises to them ultimately result in their deaths ?
Mr President , honourable Members , I would like to thank you for the many important things you have said , but also for being realistic enough to see that it is not , of course , possible to agree on everything .
We cannot accept that employment policy should be biased towards those who are already in work .
After all , this is not something dreamed up by one party or another ; it has become clear that the promotion of renewable energies represents an important element .
Its job is to assess , on the basis of various indicators , how to regulate the money market at the end of the day , including in the matter of interest-rate increases .
The problem here is that the traditions and , in particular , related legal consequences , rights of challenge and similar points vary greatly between Member States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank all of you for attending this debate on Tibet - particularly now that we have reached an important point , with solutions to a problem that has been smouldering away for decades within reach .
I do , however , call on Shias and Sunnis to follow in the great tolerant tradition of their forefathers and once again afford the Christian communities in Iraq the protection that they have enjoyed in that part of the world for over a thousand years .
The Commission calls on Europe 's businesses to make CSR a European brand and to compete for the best ideas .
I would like to stress once more that Mr Howitt 's report contains numerous valuable suggestions that the Commission will be happy to take into account in the further development of its policies on CSR.
Reference has been made in this debate to the existence of an ISO standard for corporate social responsibility .
One reason why was that the owners of preference shares are paid more than are others ; a second was that company law limits them to a maximum of 50 % of capital , so that they can never , in fact , tie down more of the capital than can the actual ordinary shares , which carry with them an entitlement to vote .
The Commission is now planning to publish , in the autumn , a recommendation on the principle of proportionality between capital and control , which will be based on the results of an extensive study .
You say in the introduction that these measures meet the citizens ' expectations of where Europe should act .
The European Commission has in its hands a key to regaining the public 's confidence .
We want the Commission to spearhead the movement , demanding clear instructions as to where the European future is actually to go .
For the sake of being closer to the citizens and of making this document easier to handle , we would like you to say precisely what are legislative initiatives , what has nothing to do with legislation , what are new initiatives and what are follow-up measures , so that we really know what concrete steps we can expect in the coming year .
For one thing , it is rather like a store catalogue and the priorities are not established clearly enough .
From now on , European air carriers will be able to access the US market from all parts of the EU without national restrictions .
It is that sort of even-handedness alone that will make it possible for the forthcoming review cycle of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to progress successfully , and it is on that , though , that the joint decisions to be taken by the review conference on the reinforcement of the treaty depend .
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament base this thinking on a concept of security that relies on dialogue , diplomacy , disarmament , prevention , and on sustainable and fair development .
Mr President , the reason why I venture to say that with reference to the non-proliferation treaty and the review thereof , is that these things are interconnected , and I hope that Mrs Merkel , having announced that this issue will be put on the agendas of both the G8 and the EU , will see to it that it is .
