struggle that has lasted over 100 years , affecting millions of workers and their families .
The fact that there was a clear discrepancy between the majority vote in the committee responsible for employment-related matters and the committee responsible for industry-related matters is , in itself , symptomatic of the imbalance to be found in the version put to the vote and in many of the amendments put forward .
We are here to remember , to acknowledge and to build .
What some have referred to as the ‘European civil war ’ was witness to the inhumanity that man is capable of visiting on man .

Through external action , Europe spreads a new style of governance around the world , characterised by the active sharing of democratic values and respect for human rights .
If we are to have a coherent Europe , with a clearly defined strategic vision based on multilateralism and on a new system of international law , we need to ensure that the institutions interact in synergy with one another and that there is permanent internal consensus .
Lastly , how will it set out the chain of responsibility , including the chain of democratic responsibility ?     . – We are not following in the slipstream of those who seek to shirk their responsibilities with regard to the objectives of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) talks and to the manner in which they conduct those talks , and who , having attempted to impose the blind and brutal liberalisation of world trade , with its extremely damaging economic and social consequences , are now trying to pass the buck and blame China for all of the world’s evils .

Speaking about them is not in any way the same as following them up .
The actual aim of this resolution is to condemn the Soviet Union .

The surest way for people to achieve progress , peace and human development is for them to have the opportunity to produce , to place what they produce on the world market and to be able to acquire new products , based on fair competition rules , on proper monitoring , on respect for the principles of defending human rights , on protecting the environment and on sustainable development .
This will be complemented by an interinstitutional strategy aimed at strengthening the EU’s image and at stepping up cooperation between the Commission and Parliament , in order to make the best possible use of human and material resources .
