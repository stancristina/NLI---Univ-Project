This is ridiculous .
The only acts of violence committed were the extremist and intimidating language – laden with hate and intolerance – used by the supporters of the Dutch group ’s nautical circus to condition the Portuguese people and dilute their rights as citizens , the bias on the part of the media , which was in thrall to the boat trip’s demagogical populism and the vandalism perpetrated at our party ’s headquarters .
How , therefore , shall we , the European Union , condemn these women ?
What if the were a train , or a TIR lorry ?
Commissioner , it is crucial that action is taken at this time , so that we are not faced with the warped logic of ‘more of the same’ , also in the EU.
They have spent years observing them and hounding them ; legal professionals have spent years of working time – in an already overloaded , understaffed and poorly equipped system – putting women accused of abortion on trial .
It has done this by using totally disproportionate methods , police and even military resources , without hesitating to use warships .
These measures are specifically intended to prevent them from travelling and from using their own personal effects .
I share the environmental concerns of those tabling the motion for a resolution .
As the date of parliamentary elections in Belarus approaches , indications are growing that there has been an alarming rise in the illegal repression and restriction of rights , freedoms and safeguards in that country .
Accordingly , whatever the reasons behind the genuine ethnic cleansing that is taking place in Darfur , we have an obligation to condemn acts against civilians that have already led to over 30 000 dead , 1 million persons displaced in Sudan and more than 200 000 refugees in Chad .
We must not let up in the efforts already under way , which have already begun to achieve such good results .
Parliament must use all of its political influence and weight to obtain the hostages ’ immediate release .
On what is this consensus based ?
We know that we are with those who reject the illegal and unjust nature of the war , the invasion and the occupation that were perpetrated .
The additional contribution proposed by the Commission , which I welcome , is a sign of this commitment .
The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) is the main legal instrument in the world for defending and protecting wild fauna and flora .
Discrimination against different ethnic groups , the confiscation of property , and the existence of political prisoners , forced labour , political rape and child soldiers have been well documented , as well as the burning down of villages .
All members of the Committee on Development who have spoken in the debate feel strongly that the EU should not participate in the ASEM Summit in Hanoi with Burma .
The situation is so serious that an EU delegation was denied access to those detainees .
It is time that the European Council took firm measures , turned Parliament’s opinion into action , suspended the Association Agreement with Israel and demanded compliance with UN decisions .
My participation today in this debate is extremely simple , because I could limit myself to saying that I welcome the resolution tabled by Mr Bourlanges , virtually in its entirety .
My second point concerns the question of priorities .
I feel that the second priority is the question of transposing legislation that has been passed into national legislation .
What I should like to reiterate , therefore , in this final debate , is that what the Commission has found – based on the public consultation that we have carried out , and in the process of tabling our own proposals – is that the citizens have three fundamental concerns .
I appreciate that , with regard to this question , we are still a long way from creating the conditions needed to approve joint legislation .
I wish you all the best for the future .
I would like to believe that the European Council of 5 November will be what Parliament was asking for in Mr Ribeiro e Castro’s resolution .
Special attention must also be paid to aspects such as controlling migratory flows , running the Border Management Agency , starting up the Visa Information System (VIS ) and the second generation of the Schengen Information System , and stepping up security in the area of travel documents and visas .
Therefore , their requests for asylum have been analysed by the authorities in the field .
I hope that we can count on the support of the House on the Commission 's proposal on this matter .
The proposals for change before us , which are based on extensive experience , fulfil , in my opinion , the objective of greater efficiency in monitoring Community support , which is of major importance within the framework of preparations for the accession of future Member States .     .
The Commission has proposed a series of amendments to the regulations , however , and this raises some concerns for us .
Whilst the proposed amendments offer a degree of flexibility , they do not provide an effective response to the problems of implementation , nor do they consolidate the existing appropriations .     .
The unanimous vote in the Committee on Agriculture demonstrates the consensus in this House as regards the issue of providing information on and promoting agricultural products in third countries and in the internal market .
Accordingly , I do not believe that we should suggest that the Council set out coordinated approaches for scheduling national ratification processes or that it encourage Parliament to take control and to mount
