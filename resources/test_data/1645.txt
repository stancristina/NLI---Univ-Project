Lastly , Mr President , I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which , if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised , can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area , preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies .
Firstly , the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet , but , furthermore , there are certain questions to be borne in mind .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration , on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions , and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March , so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way .
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development , in particular based on local traditions , techniques and practices , on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy .
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory .
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border .
With regard to INTERREG , we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation .
But what were the Commission ' s arguments , from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular , for eliminating the URBAN programme ?
If we have success in this threefold sense , I believe that these families , these people , these European citizens , will believe more in Europe , and this seems to me to be very important because , ultimately , the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life .
Firstly , this is welcome because it explains , to our fellow citizens , what we are intending to do and what we are already doing .
However , to focus on the European Union as it is today , and on the subject of government and governance - a word which , at least in Spanish , brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs , although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government , and , since President Prodi always defends his home town , Bologna , I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand : the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti , which speak of bon governo [good government ] and mal governo [bad government] .
On the other hand , we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe , which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon , and a European Union at the service of the citizens .
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us , I would say that we are very much in agreement .
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue .
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity .
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions , for which Europe has an enormous responsibility .
In order to make these reforms , however , and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme , we must be very sure , not only of the strengths of the reformer himself , but also of the opinions of others .
I would remind you that this Group , the PPE-DE , does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones .
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years , in view of the reform which must take place in 2002 .
.
This is all the more serious , if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission , Mr Prodi , has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy , which you are legally required to do in 2002 .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People ' s Party , the delegation of the Spanish People ' s Party , with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí ' s resolution on the area of freedom , security and justice .
Finally , we have to put our trust in , and support , the institutions which are closest to the citizens , that is , the local councils and bodies .
Nevertheless , given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction , this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion .
We consider that , given the hydrological characteristics of Spain , where transfers of a structural nature are carried out , the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources , and these decisions should , of course , always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water .
However , Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water .
