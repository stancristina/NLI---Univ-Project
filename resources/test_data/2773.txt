to lead to distortion of competition in the transport market .
The existence of the European Union has further reinforced this trend , in part through the introduction of a common currency , great freedom for tax-free aviation and the construction of cross-border motorways .
The Commission has at least tried to make a distinction on the one hand between the car and the plane , which are placing an increasing load on the environment , and on the other environmentally friendly transport by rail and water .
All kinds of liberalisation proposals may turn out to have a negative impact on people and their living environment .
What is missing for me , and here I concur with Mr Piecyk , who was talking about avoiding traffic , is what we in the Netherlands call transport prevention or transport limitation .
I think that it is indeed necessary , but I also think that there is an absolute need for the emission problems of rail compared with the other modes to be tackled seriously .
Its implementation seems less easy .
That is certainly true of the accession countries , where transport policy is moving in an undesirable direction .
I therefore commend our amendments to our fellow MEPs .
It is therefore high time for the Commission finally to come forward with the Pricing Directive .
The Commission has been talking about it for a long time and there is a loud clamour for this document , not only in this Chamber , from the people who are sympathetic towards the environment and traffic safety , but also in the Member States , who are keen for the real polluter to pay .
And the first political question of course is why are we not doing the same in Europe ?
This puts an extra barrier in your way , an extra step that you have to take and , for the very small businesses in particular , that is extraordinarily wasteful , so I would say that this must not happen either .
First of all I want to thank both rapporteurs very much for their work , their sharing of responsibility and above all their effort in producing such an excellent report .
I also think it is important to bring the regions where 3G is already in development close together because people learn from one another .
Public information must therefore be made available to the citizens free of charge or at marginal cost for reproduction and distribution .
It is also important that the same conditions prevail in all the Member States .
Intervention may however be necessary to guarantee competition .
That is why it is good that the Commission is keeping its finger on the pulse and keeping the minds of the leaders of the Member States on the matter .
My group therefore welcomes the evaluation report from the Commission .
The Lisbon document raises a large number of issues , some of which do , but most of which do not , fall within the jurisdiction of the European Union , and for these we have the fine term 'open coordination ' .
It is true that a large number of obstacles would then have to be removed .
The credibility of the Council rests on this , and at some stage we must take up a position on it .
What is important is getting a roadmap , so that we can see , in practical terms , who is going to do what and when .
I think that we are also over-emphasising the knowledge-based economy , as we also need jobs at the bottom of the labour market - but I do not hear anyone talking about this .
The path to better jobs is still long , and we have done far too little in the way of the modernisation of the organisation of work .
I have already said it : the policy is too one-sided with regard to knowledge and innovation .
In so doing , the European Union makes itself look ridiculous and the Council is not meeting its responsibilities .
The emphasis will have to be placed on financial soundness , on full liberalisation of the services sector , the creation of a knowledge-based economy by investment in research and development , and radical simplification of the regulatory environment .
Back then , we took - as we , particularly , do now - as our starting point scenarios based on excessively high growth rates .
There is a great deal of talk about employment effects .
Finally , a good deal has been said about cooperation in the field of universities .
I think that that is very important .
The Spring Summit must therefore pay just as much attention to these , and not spend hours on the economy , minutes on social aspects and only seconds on environmental policy .
I would like to speak about the letter that three Heads of Government - Tony Blair , Gerhard Schr√∂der and Jacques Chirac - have drawn up ahead of this Spring Summit .
It is absolutely absurd that , in the self same letter that has now been drawn up ahead of the Spring Summit , it is proposed to set up a kind of Hartz Commission that reinvents the wheel , instead of now working constructively on that directive and a decision being taken on it in March , within the Economic and Social Council .
Believe me , if we carry out enlargement of Europe with unemployment still hanging over our heads , we will be heading for an utter fiasco .
I hope that now , some action will be the result .
In the plenary debate on this issue , which took place yesterday , I gave as my opinion that any kind of redistributing road-transport capacity throughout Austria has to be distrusted .
