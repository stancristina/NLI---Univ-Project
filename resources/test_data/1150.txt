quote a man of the future : Alcide De Gasperi , whom we remembered yesterday .
With a budget that cuts spending and sets a ceiling of around 1 % , with a budget that only guarantees existing privileges , there will be no investment in either growth or competitiveness or cohesion , Mr President , and Europe will be betraying itself .
For these reasons I have voted ‘No’ .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , the European Commission considers it our moral , institutional and political duty to ensure that the fundamental rights of every person are always respected and upheld without exceptions or derogations of any kind .
Thirdly , it is important to ascertain the truth behind accusations deriving from press sources , because if the accusations were shown to be true they could have grave political consequences , since they would constitute a serious breach of the Treaty . ‘Ascertain’ , ladies and gentlemen , means finding evidence : according to the rule of law , no accusation can be considered proven if there is no evidence , and until evidence is found I personally have a duty to respect the word , and thus also the denial , that I have been given by all the governments I have consulted so far – and I repeat so far .
These judicial authorities are conducting investigations using the powers of the courts .
At the moment there is no evidence to confirm the accusations , but we must continue to work in close collaboration with the Council of Europe and with this Parliament to seek out the truth , and that is what I shall do .
It is the case of Abu Omar , who was kidnapped by CIA agents right in the centre of Milan , transferred to an American base in Italy and tortured for 12 hours ; he was then transferred to Egypt , where he was detained and tortured for more than a year .
A committee of inquiry needs to be set up to shed light on all these points .
We have a duty to find out , and that will be for the good of Europe , because it cannot preach human rights and yet tolerate violations and abuse .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in view of the extremely serious matter raised by certain newspapers , and if what for now remains mere supposition or fantasy is actually confirmed , then I too consider that Parliament has a duty to play its part in shedding light on the matter and ensuring that there is complete transparency in the relations between the European Union and all non-EU countries .
Nobody , of course , wants to deny Parliament’s crucial role in guaranteeing and monitoring respect for human rights and protection of the freedoms of individuals and peoples .
The truth is that this did not generate all the scandal that everyone has been talking about these days , which was due to some news items that appeared in the press .
At the moment , says the Commission , there is no proof .
It was out of this sacrifice , too , that Europe emerged , founded on a specific idea : respect for the law as an inalienable prerequisite for freedom and democracy , with no ifs or buts .
Our Parliament also calls for a different United States , one not subject to the fanaticism and economic interests of the George W. Bush Administration .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that this afternoon’s debate has revealed a widely held position in this Parliament , and it is one that I too fully endorse : there can be no compromises with terrorists , but there can be no compromises , either , on the protection of people’s fundamental rights .
Today you have voted by a large majority for an important measure , a useful measure in the fight against terrorism , and one that achieves a balance between security and freedom .
We shall all be stronger , whatever the outcome , because the truth can , I repeat , either make us discover something or make us discover that this something did not happen .
When I asked the European Commission , it was unable in fact to offer me any clarification , and I was also disappointed with the replies I received from Commissioner Rehn to my enquiries .
That is not to mention – and here I absolutely underline what a fellow Member has already said – the international adoptions problem , to which no solution has been found even under the new law .
As the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe we shall support them , because we want the situation to be duly acknowledged by the Romanian authorities and a solution to be found to it .
The situation of the Romanian market today is no different from that in which Spain , Portugal , Greece and the 10 countries of the fifth enlargement round found themselves 12 months before their accession .
I therefore take this opportunity to warmly thank all my colleagues from the Committee on Budgets , its chairman Mr Lewandowski , the political groups ’ coordinators and staff , and the Secretariat and all its members , above all the administrator who made certain that I received the constant , loyal and expert assistance of Richard Wester , assistance that tied in well with the meticulous expertise of my assistant , Annalisa Gliubizzi .
Secondly , the section of Amendment 209 relating to line 19 08 02 01 – on the MEDA Programme – is approved in the sum of EUR 25 056 550 .
Fighting homophobia does not mean showing understanding towards a specific group in the population : first and foremost , it means upholding human rights .
