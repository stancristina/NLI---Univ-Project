We look forward to the reforms you are to present , and I wish you good luck .     The June Movement is a strong opponent on principle of a common Members ’ Statute , which would turn Members of the European Parliament into the EU’s representatives in the Member States instead of Denmark’s representatives in the EU.
We in the June Movement are therefore voting in favour of this compromise , at the same time as holding to our opposition on principle to the Statute , which was unfortunately approved by the Treaty of Nice .     The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Cashman’s report on establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders ( A6-0188/2005 ) .
We are , however , alert to the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and does not therefore apply to Denmark , cf . the protocol on Denmark’s position .     Regarding the matter before us , we believe that NAFO is right in stating the need for a rebuilding plan for Greenland halibut .
We are not , therefore , voting against legislation by the EU.
We believe that the EU’s fisheries policy has foundered for , in spite of extensive measures and bureaucracy , stocks are still threatened .
Then there is the hidden transfer and sale of quotas and rights and , in addition , the great uncertainty attached to bycatches in other fisheries .
We believe that there is a need for Parliament to demand a review of the EU’s fisheries policy , including the rebuilding plans .     Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Professor Trakatellis , who , in my opinion , has shown a unique ability and a unique willingness to bring about compromises .
It deserves to be thanked .
Almost six years have had to go by before we have been able to get such important legislation affecting our children’s health adopted .
This is an issue that affects everyone in Europe every single day and is very much on people’s minds , and yet such a long period has elapsed .
I am therefore all the happier about the result that we have obtained and that is now before us .
It is a genuinely positive result .
Secondly , we are to have the three second—most dangerous substances banned in all forms of toys that can be put in the mouth , and that is of course at the heart of this proposal .
I would , however , emphasise that this is a basic and significant example of legislation on which Parliament has stuck to its guns .
Industry has not been allowed to force through its position .
Naturally , a sense of proportion must also be kept , but it is our children’s health that is at issue here , so the precautionary principle must be applied .
Our children’s health was at stake , yet people were unwilling to apply the precautionary principle .
I presume that there was a translation error , as I had understood them to be parts of the compromise that people were unable to support .
These amendments are not part of the compromise .
The compromise does not include the parts to be found in Amendments 22 and 23 .     Mr President , phthalates are used for softening plastic in toys and can harm foetuses , cause liver damage and impair people’s reproductive ability .
The directive is concerned with six different softeners divided into two groups .
That is a tightening-up of the Danish rules , in which the ban only applies to toys intended for children under three years of age .
This would involve a relaxing of the Danish rules , which impose a complete ban on that group of substances in all toys intended for children under three .
There is no sense in distinguishing between children under and over three years of age , for it is difficult for the EU to monitor whether baby sister borrows her big brother’s toys .
If the proposal is implemented without a health guarantee , some countries , such as Denmark , will have a lower level of protection in some areas than they have at present .     Mr President , Commissioner , you gave a very lively description of the current situation in Belarus .
You mention a long list of programmes that are under way .
I believe , however , that Mr Klich was quite correct in saying that many of the EU programmes are intended for neighbouring countries with some form of democratic structure .
It is different when we are dealing with a dictatorship , as in the case of Belarus .
As is well known , Tacis has many resources for solving environmental problems and resolving issues of border surveillance .
I therefore think that the proposal contained in the resolution on which we are to vote tomorrow is perfectly correct .
It is important for us to support the right to free opinion-forming in Belarus , and we have an obligation , pure and simple , to get down to some of these projects which , from a financial point of view , will be extremely modest but which will mean an incredible amount for the morale of those in Belarus who are fighting for democracy .
In fighting , they are putting themselves on the line and are in great danger of their own lives .
We have a responsibility , and I think you should explain to us how , in practical terms , you will go about matters .     We are voting in favour of the report on the mandate for the 2006 budget conciliation procedure .
This mainly requires reform of agricultural policy
