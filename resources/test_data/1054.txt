problems using shops , post offices and banks , buses , trains and ’planes .
I did not , therefore , want my name to appear on it .
It was a very long way from the truth .
That is something we can do if , in regulated and open ways , we try to cooperate and to do what many speakers have said we must in order to reduce suffering through diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s .
I view with great satisfaction the committee’s Amendment 11 about removing the demand that all alternative methods must have been examined .
I have received an answer from the Carolingian Institute to the effect that they only have three well-characterised stem cell lines now available to them .
There is of course a value in countries ’ determining their own taxes because these fund a significant proportion of welfare provision which , as is known , differs from one Member State to another .
There are a number of drawbacks to having different tax rates on diesel fuel in the Member States .
I have myself worked in the transport industry , driving heavy lorries .
We work an unnecessary number of hours on the roads , and the number of accidents is increasing .
The environment , road safety , employees ’ conditions and fair conditions of competition will be the overall losers if we retain an arrangement within the EU involving large differences in fuel costs .     Madam President , Commissioner , this is a sensitive subject .
We see this from the many vicissitudes that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has gone through since we dealt for the first time with the issue of tax on diesel fuel .
This time – this once , I hope – I must however inform you that the majority of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party do not share her conclusions .
Firstly , the ELDR Group’s amendment is about tax coordination , not harmonisation .
Tax competition may , I agree , be a good thing , but not if the environment suffers as a result .
A modified Commission proposal would be good for the environment , strengthen the internal market and improve competition .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
The intention has already been erased .
Competence in the ports and the safety of those who work in them must be guaranteed .
Our own regulations , which make it difficult to apply for , and obtain , visas , also mean that there are more and more traffickers in human beings .
I believe we should have an arrangement that strengthens the asylum procedure .
It would be interesting to hear the answer to that question .     – Mr President , it looks as if , on 1 January 2004 , we are going to be given a European Network and Information Security Agency .
The fact that Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement in the course of the first reading entails , in this case , losses for both Parliament and the industry .
The agency’s management board has become too large , with a representative for each Member State , and the industry has had to give way , together with other areas of civil society .
In other words , the Council’s wheeling and dealingwith authorities that infringe legislation , and vice versa , continues without any democratic scrutiny .
Ensure that network security is achieved in accordance with the common guidelines that have already been approved in a Council resolution and that have been signed by ten of the Member States , together with six other countries .
Through this agency , we can now jointly develop data protection in all its different dimensions , and that is good .     The Moderate Party’s delegation to the European Parliament has today voted in favour of the report on women 's rights and EU international relations .
We also think it good that these agreements include clauses concerning democracy and human rights so that the agreements can help improve the situation for the people of these countries .
The existing systems are funded from fees , whereas the desire is to fund the new system concerning sheep and goats from Community funds .
Recital 5b reads : ‘The entire cost of introducing the new electronic identification system should be met from the Community budget since this is a food safety and control measure affecting the whole production chain and since it is the producers who will have to put into operation and manage the system’ .     I have supported the rapporteur , Mr Liese , from the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in his ambition to introduce stricter ethical guidelines for the EU’s funding and monitoring of research .
Research into embryonic stem cells is incompatible with the Irish Constitution and banned by law in Germany , Austria and Portugal .
My hope is therefore that the Council will reject the European Parliament’s majority view .
We can expect new applications for membership and new requests for close cooperation in the future .
The EU must , in the future , be open to new members from our part of the world , irrespective of whether or not they follow old school maps ’ demarcation of the European continent .
Moldova belongs historically and culturally to South-Eastern Europe .
It is my hope that the Commission will try to establish a form of cooperation with Moldova that takes account of this and opens the way to future Moldovan membership of the EU once Romania and Bulgaria have joined .     Mr President , I suppose I must thank you for your answer , but I cannot say I am happy with it
