After all there are no Community competencies in matter of public health which are sufficient to lay all of the blame with the Commission .
This would open a crisis which could actually take the focus off efforts to bring about a single currency which are mobilising both the institution and the states and , by extension , the full democratisation of the European Union .
With a few individual exceptions of honour this Commission is undoubtedly responsible because it has failed to focus on a situation which could easily become explosive and even uncontrollable .
Most of this is due to the seriousness and dynamics of the body , led in particular by Lord Plumb , who is here with us , but also due to the quality of the reports which have been presented before the Assembly .
Mr President , I think that the Baldi report is a very interesting analysis of this matter , and I think that to add anything to it would be superfluous .
The Commission also goes along with the rapporteur 's finding that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is the lack of interest shown by certain Member States towards strengthening this co-ordination .
That is why we thought of trying to attack this problem through practical cases of lack of co-ordination , lack of coherence and lack of complementarity .
I am sure that , if the European Parliament had to play a fundamental role in discussing the European Development Fund 's budgets , some of those aspects of policy co-ordination would play a leading role , not only in reports drafted by some of those members of the European Parliament who are most interested in the subject but by the European Parliament as whole .
Indeed , Community humanitarian aid significantly increased between 1990 and 1995 , unfortunately as a consequence of the growing number of crises which arose in those years .
It is also very important to make European public opinion aware of the importance of development aid in the medium term so that we can show the cause and effects of relationship between poverty and humanitarian crises .
Madam President , the Commission wishes to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Fassa , on his report and is in general very favourable to its conclusions and recommendations .
Another crucial point is the need for better targeting of aid to the people in need .
The Commission clearly recognizes the serious difficulties involved in providing humanitarian aid in these situations .
The Commission is also delighted to see that the rapporteur deals specifically with gender and that this issue has also been highlighted in the opinion delivered by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy .
It is all too easy to destroy fragile and fledgling markets with ill advised or poorly focused programmes .
Indeed , as linking relief , rehabilitation and development is seen very much as an approach which is widely applicable to a variety of situations , its influence has been pervasive and its progress rapid .
Others have been in place for longer such as in Liberia .
Madam President , I am sorry for speaking at length but this is the kind of report and subject in which much of the substance of our day-to-day action in many of the most difficult areas is at stake .
This evolution has led to others in the cumulation of discriminations and the situation of assisting spouses of selfemployed persons , usually referred to as the wives of self-employed persons , to which particular attention should be paid .
The set of proposals made in the report deserve our agreement in principle and can act as a good working basis for a new directive aimed at dealing with situations which must not lead to the enshrinement , by old and new means , of discrimination against women in the world of work , because , in this case , of the virtual lack of visibility We must also support , as a complement to the prerequisites of the directive to be replaced which have not been complied with , the concretisation of initiatives such as debates and round tables giving the interested persons a real chance to take part in defining their needs , status as well as the wording of the new directive .
Women still very often see it as their duty to help their husbands or companions without being paid and they look upon this huge work - which is not included in the calculation of the GDP of any country - as an obligation which their status of spouse requires .
Finally , I would call on self-employed workers associations to regard it as their binding obligation to fight for the social situation of the spouses of their respective partners .
The Commission has not implemented it and the Commission has actually suspended it by means of a letter by two Directors General .
Stop lying , Sir Leon Brittan !
Is the Commission trying to replace the co-operation process with a process of simply consulting the European Parliament ?
The Council of the Representatives of the Member States rejected in January the list of countries which the Commission wanted because the Commission had included Canada and Russia even with a preamble saying that it was provisional .
Through Renault , they will find out that there was a time when labour was made more flexible and precarious , when social rights were reduced , when modernisation took place , and when workers thought they were going to have a fair share of modernisation and all they got was unemployment and social exclusion .
Whoever has the job of writing today 's history will find some very strange and incomprehensible matters .
Along these lines , more importance should also be given to the use of small and
