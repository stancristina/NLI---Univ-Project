carrying a bird in her mouth .
We support the Council ' s common position because it represents a balance which marks a new stage in the opening-up of the rail market , pending the adoption of provisions ensuring balanced competition between and within modes of transport .
The railway system is a technically diversified system which , in any case , whatever the organisational solution adopted , requires substantial coordination .
Mr President , I voted for the Wieland report because there needs to be an increase in professional requirements in the European Union .
The poster will not specify exactly what this amount corresponds to in Italian lire , and this will force all the citizens to find out the value of EUR 500 in lire .
Although the protection of consumer health is by far the most important criterion , it cannot be our sole objective in establishing an efficient system for the identification and registration of bovine animals during the production and fattening stage and a labelling system based on objective criteria during the marketing stage .
This directive will ensure not only that the meat on our tables can be traced back to its origins but also that the consumer is provided with clear , essential information .
Mr President , since the issue of Regulation 820 in 1997 , we have been discussing rebuilding a relationship between the consumer and the production world , and I have to say that a great deal has been achieved on both sides .
We feel that a precise reference to the point of slaughter and to the provenance of the minced beef would contribute to maintaining this relationship of trust that we are building between producer and consumer .
Finally , considering development of investment in the European cinema industry to be extremely important , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy calls upon the Member States to pursue a policy of making sums reinvested for the creation of new jobs tax-deductible , and stresses the importance of establishing a guarantee fund as one of the measures necessary for the development of the independent audiovisual industry which encourages new talent and develops a cultural content of European tradition .
I am sorry but we are not satisfied with the response and we would have preferred to have heard the Commission 's position in this debate and not through press statements .
In any case , we call for an increase in the budget and we hope that Parliament and the Commission will be able to achieve unanimity and an agreement on this issue as well .
Seventy-seven per cent of complaints received concern the Commission .
We are currently required to create a complex , comprehensive , harmonious , functional legal framework , and we must therefore also create judicial mechanisms such as the Charter on Rights , a body of law establishing criminal , civil and administrative law , the agreement procedures for the mutual recognition of judgments passed by Member States , Europol and the sectoral agreements , the establishment of the European Fraud Investigation Office as a tool for investigating abuse of the law , the likely institution of the office of European Public Prosecutor which should be the investigating office of the Court of Justice , the separation of the careers of judges responsible for giving rulings and investigating magistrates , and the separation of criminal , civil and administrative responsibilities : all these are instruments which advance the progress of the European Union .
All these factors are difficulties which we will have to overcome .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her thorough , responsible and unreserved report .
We feel that there has been a lack of serious monitoring on the part of the Commission .
Among the various missing data which would have been useful , it could also have provided the results of the questionnaires sent to the Member States and the results of the coordination of relevant laws and activities by the European Standardisation Centre .
Therefore , benefits should not be cut considerably during this period and pension funds should not be affected either .
Mr President , I would just like to say that the Radical Members abstained from the vote on the Virrankoski report because the Council was trying to secure for its own budget the costs arising from missions conducted by military advisers or others within the framework of the CFSP.
Therefore , in my opinion , we need to focus our efforts chiefly on protecting the indigenous ethnic groups , so that the indigenous Fijians do not share the fate of the South American Indians or the indigenous populations of Central and North America , and to ensure that their culture is preserved by controlling illegal immigration , so that what is happening there and has sadly already come about in the Balkans does not occur in Europe as well .
I would particularly like to call on my left-wing , socialist and communist friends to stop using double standards !
I therefore sincerely invite my socialist and communist friends to vote for this resolution and this amendment , in order to make sure that , at least this once , Parliament is at the forefront of this battle for freedom , democracy and non-violence .
This is the first point of our conclusions in this resolution .
I would like to be totally clear , even at the risk of appearing antagonistic .
We must guard against hypocrisy .
Their favourite victims are children and adolescents because they are vulnerable and easily influenced .
Madam President , in our resolution on the death penalty which we agreed with the other groups , we appealed to the Governor of Virginia to spare the life of a person sentenced to death
