Yesterday we debated in this House the ten years of Economic and Monetary Union .
In the case of Hungary , we have acted in cooperation .
As a result , I would ask Parliament , when discussing this issue in the future , if this proves necessary , to show the same willingness that I am pleased to witness here today .
As stated by Mrs Berès , these will also be conveyed to Mr De Larosière so that his group can present its findings within the period set for its work , in other words by March .
I hope that , from now on , given the circumstances not only in Hungary but also in other EU countries due to the crisis and excessive volatility in many financial indicators , particularly in exchange rates , this type of comment and recommendation will be heeded more .
In 2008 the deficit will be clearly below this figure , in fact it will be below 3 % , and in the commitment made by Hungary as a condition of this help , the target deficit for next year is 2.6 % .
The ' Blue Card ' offers an opportunity for migrants to settle with their families and work in our countries .
In 2007 , nearly 300 000 highly qualified Europeans left to work outside the Union .
This Regulation will be repealed by the present proposal and its substance will be fully incorporated into the single CMO Regulation .
This event , combined with the acts of piracy which so far this year have involved almost 100 boats being hijacked along the coast of Somalia , constitutes a wholly unacceptable humanitarian situation .
The Socialist Group does not agree with the amendments tabled at the last moment , which have not been duly negotiated .
This item must therefore be kept on the agenda for the present plenary , as the Conference of Presidents of the political groups itself decided .
The Commission updated these announcements in the Ecofin Council only yesterday .
We specified the extent to which we will contribute with European resources and measures , both through the EU budget and through the actions of the European Investment Bank and the EBRD.
That is not the Commission 's position , of course .
That is the message that the Commission put across to the Ecofin Ministers yesterday .
Should there be a joint issue of national public debt securities ?
Mr President , Mr Novelli , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I am very grateful for your comments and observations and for the interest you have shown in the Commission 's initiatives , particularly the recovery plan that we have been discussing this afternoon .
Since it is not working well , the economic forecasts that Mr Rasmussen mentioned , which I presented a month ago , are unfortunately no longer the forecasts that I would present today .
As the decision on the Solvency II draft directive is about to come before Parliament , let me tell you that the reaction in the Council still does not always accord with the Council 's own statements on what needs to be done in terms of financial regulation and supervision .
I saw the President of the Commission repeat to you in this Chamber , on his recent visits , that the Commission is going to regulate hedge funds , and that is what we shall do .
The Central Bank is meeting here in Brussels tomorrow .
Read the plan and you will see that there is no obligation involved , as indeed there could not be .
It is a fact that the situation in Gaza is worse than ever .
In that way we will be able to move ahead .
We do want more and better relations with Israel and with the Palestinians , and we have to demonstrate that through clear conditions and clear actions , and not just words .
It seems to me that making one conditional on the other does no favours for what we have been discussing , namely peace and the control of arms exports .
The imperfections of the real world , however , did not stop you from achieving the goal that you had set yourself , with , may I say , the help of the Committee on Development and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
Madam President , I must start by regretting that the Commissioner responsible is not here with us , although I am not really surprised , because there is plenty of noise and not much substance on this subject : great rhetorical statements about combating VAT fraud and very few measures with which to do so .
The problem comes when the Commissioner starts telling us what kinds of action need to be taken .
Full stop .
Lastly , to make it easier to pursue fraudsters , we are setting up a register of individuals who cannot evade tax by setting up companies .
I am not surprised that they have told us what they are thinking of doing , because what they have actually done is very little , as I said before .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our adoption of this climate change and energy package should serve as a letter of intent , enabling us to send out a crystal-clear signal to the whole world to reach an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen next year .
These include financing World Food Programme needs , work involving various organisations to assess countries ' needs , aid for small farmers ( in the short term , and also an analysis of food price volatility in the long term ) ; long-term challenges in the area of production and productivity , neglected research plans , and the need to find risk management solutions ( such
