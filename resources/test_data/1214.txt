for investment , low inflation and improved public finances are the basis of this recovery .
The introduction of the euro has helped to make the outlook favourable .
The European Council said that the coordination of economic , employment and structural policy must be enhanced in accordance with the recommendations in the Council ' s report .
The debate on these issues will continue at the Extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Lisbon in March .
We were unable to reach consensus on the taxation package .
The tax package is thus holding together , and it cannot be said that anyone got away scot-free in this matter .
This , along with items in the tax package , will be reported to the European Council no later than June 2000 .
The European Council decided to attempt to make it possible for the Member States to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before the year 2002 .
The main event of the Finnish Presidency in the context of the work of the OSCE was the Summit held in Istanbul on 18 and 19 November .
The Charter is founded on earlier commitments and reinforces the establishment of democracy , peace and human rights .
It is particularly important - given , also , Russia ' s action in Chechnya - for the Charter to reinforce the notion that commitments also have to be complied with in internal conflicts of States .
At the meeting we also approved a declaration on topical political issues .
In addition , the parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , the so-called CFE , also signed an adapted Treaty at the Istanbul Summit .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , my group would first like to acknowledge to those representing the Finnish Presidency that you , as compared with the European Parliament , have improved transparency and the flow of information .
I would like to tell you that this draft regulation has been leaked to the public , and that is worrying .
Regarding enlargement , I wish to say that we are very satisfied that the Council has now finally agreed that each candidate country must be assessed on their own merits .
This is exactly the strategy we proposed from the outset .
With regard to Turkey , our opinion is that the European Council should mean what it says , in other words , that the same criteria should apply to Turkey as with the other countries that have been accorded candidate status .
We were not inclined to agree with those in the European Parliament who have been keen to narrowly define the borders of Europe in the belief that Islam is somehow non-European .
We are very dissatisfied with the way in which the European Council and preparatory discussions have paid little heed to public debate and public opinion .
We want you to strengthen civil crisis management , because , as we all know , it is the wisest thing to do .
The non-military prevention of conflicts is always more important , and for every euro invested in military crisis management at least as much must be spent on civil crisis management .
I am certain the European Parliament ' s calls to put economic cooperation on ice have had an effect , and we believe that you will remain firm in your opinion that this is not a situation in which we can act as if nothing has happened .
Now it is a spirit of European militarisation .
The Member States committed themselves to releasing troops from their own authority to form a fifty thousand strong European army and assigned troops equivalent to a whole corps for the joint deployment of the EU.
At Cologne it was already a common security and defence policy that was mentioned .
Since then , many , following the lead of the Commission , have started talking about a common defence .
The EU has started to become a war alliance and a military alliance .
In Helsinki a standing committee on political and security matters was set up .
Consequently , talk has begun of the need to increase military appropriations .
Can Heads of State and Government extend the role of the EU without the approval of Parliament ?
The NATO countries doubtless intend to put the decisions of the fiftieth anniversary conference of the " Alliance " into effect .
They have assumed the right to attack other countries without a mandate from either the UN or the OSCE.
There was no decision at Helsinki to mandate crisis management or forcible peace-making .
If the meeting were historic this was mainly in the sense that the EU is being militarised .
In the fight against unemployment , we wish Portugal better success that Finland had .
Although I am therefore satisfied with the Finnish Government ' s strong grasp of leadership and the fact that either considerable progress was made with the key issues or they were finally resolved , it is clear that the good results of the Presidency stem from the desire by the whole of the Union to develop a common European structure .
The bases for the security of people in a democratic Union that is committed to a market economy and respect for the principle of the rule of law are economic growth , increased employment , internal security to combat crime , and a common foreign , political and military security system .
The northern dimension was overshadowed by the open crises in Kosovo and Chechnya .
In this area , Commissioner Liikanen will have both an interesting and mighty task ahead of him .
Among the disappointments we must once again include certain important issues with regard to the development of the single market and the Union ' s decision-making system
