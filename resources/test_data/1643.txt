the European Union’s territory .
I also agree with Mrs Roure in particular , who mentioned the national parliaments .
You see , ladies and gentlemen , if we succeed in concluding the agreement – the talks are taking place in two parts and we start tomorrow ; I cannot say whether an agreement will be reached , but I hope it will – we shall in any case need it to enter into force straight away , even while we wait for certain ratification procedures , which in some countries will take time , as Mr Alvaro pointed out .
The second goal to achieve within a very short time is the implementation of what was termed the ‘push’ system by the rapporteur , to whom I am grateful .
Mrs Roure has asked for general information about the London meeting : I shall be pleased to provide it to the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs next week , when I shall go into much more detail .
To avoid what has been said about ‘negative profiling’ , which is profiling on an ethnic or religious basis .
I should also have liked a more precise clarification of the concept of small traditional communities : the term ‘traditional ’ is too vague and might lead to a lack of differentiation in the way that resources and commitments are used .
That means first of all improving overall conditions in the countryside , including not only restoring and preserving architecture from both a monumental and a landscape point of view , but also taking into consideration the people who live in and share the reality of small rural villages .
That is not the case : some Member States , some countries are playing a role .
The problem concerns North Korea , Thailand too of course , obviously ourselves as the European Union , and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
He emphasised that the Commission remains absolutely committed to playing an active role in trying to break the stalemate .
At the same time , the Commission is maintaining a very close dialogue with Zimbabwe’s neighbours , particularly the members of the Southern African Development Community and the South African Government .
Greater mobility within the labour market and an effective lifelong learning system are the basic , essential conditions for this .
In its current state , however , and as it is conceived in the Commission proposal , the European Qualifications Framework does not appear at all clear ; it needs to be made more understandable , and certain aspects that now appear inconsistent need to be revised .
We call on you all to support these amendments , which uphold the trade unions ’ position .
In particular , we found a tragic situation in Turkish Kurdistan , that is , it was a completely militarised zone .
We believe that the future can bring a Europe that is multi-ethnic and multi-faith , but there must always be respect for everyone’s human rights .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to focus above all on one aspect of Mr Eurlings ’s report : the dialogue between religions .
Its aim is to encourage dialogue between Christians and Muslims , between Christianity and Islam , through a strong message from this Parliament .
Let us exclude extremism , let us isolate fundamentalists , and let us hold a dialogue with those who truly want to build peace in the Middle East and Africa .
In that respect , I agree with paragraph 50 , as proposed by the rapporteur , on the Armenian genocide issue .
We are against arranged marriages : to get married you have to know each other and love each other , and that applies to Turkey’s ambitious goal as well .
I thought , instead , that the dream – the inspiration , the creation and the dream of a federalist Europe – was precisely to expand the area subject to the rule of law and democracy .
If these two conditions are fulfilled , the date laid down by the Council of Ministers will be a firm date for joining Schengen .     .
We shall reassess it , but everything depends on the added value it provides .
It is important , therefore , to continue to ensure cooperation among the European institutions – the Commission , OLAF , the European Central Bank and Europol – making it possible to identify those areas where counterfeiting of the euro occurs most .
Involvement concerns not only the economic agenda , but also the more direct involvement of citizens through partnerships and the mechanisms of governance at various levels , in the context of which the cohesion policy is managed , in order to achieve the Union’s objectives of growth and employment .
In the same year , the reform of EU regional policy achieved notable results , including its official recognition as an instrument for growth and employment under the Lisbon Strategy .
I should also like to point out that , by adopting this approach , we have by no means eliminated the risk that , if we refuse entry at the borders to people arriving by boat , we will be seriously breaching the right of many of them to seek asylum , insofar as they are being sent straight back to the place from which they came .
Today’s debate also shares this characteristic : the fight against terrorism , the CIA flights , PNR and police cooperation are all being mixed up with immigration .
I have a proposal to make to Mr  Frattini : let us build a monument , an eternal reminder of the migrants drowned at sea .
This is a real commitment , and it is also demonstrated by the increased financial resources that the EU will make available over the next seven years for the purposes of consolidating an area of freedom , security and justice
