Mr President , I was not only present , but am sure that I signed and I am not on the attendence list either .
Cloning animals and human beings Mr President , we had the opportunity to hear the workers in question last week and we are amazed that they are so surprised at the decision of a company which shows a total lack of respect for their work , their effort and their future - and for the future of the region in which the company is located .
Now it seems that is not enough ; greater productivity must be sought ; greater competitiveness .
It is a decision by the management of Renault and we express our solidarity with the Vilvoorde workers .
There is just one more question - would this debate have taken place had not Vilvoorde been the Commissioner 's home town ?
Intangible concepts such as the market heartlessly and mercilessly dictate plant relocation or closure and concentration .
Dialogue between both sides of industry is the best instrument for settling labour relations .
Maritime industries include not only the building of naval vessels and ship repairs ; they include also the harbour services , the industries which use maritime resources such as fishing , the farming of fish , shellfish and algae and above all the industries engaged in extracting oil and gas from under the sea .
We have over 40 abandoned oil rigs which need to be scrapped and I do not know whether we are prepared with the industry which that requires .
They all have problems in adjusting to the great challenge which the European Union itself accepted with the GATT Uruguay Round and its effects for progressively greater commercial openness at world level .
The information society provides an opportunity to reduce the educational and cultural disadvantages of the handicapped , people living in rural areas or those who for economic or other reasons do not have access to the traditional channels of education and culture .
The multimedia products thus produced give easier distribution of and access to this cultural heritage , particularly for young people .
Mr President , I must devote the first few seconds of my speech to a matter unrelated to the Trakatellis report , but bound up with collective ethics .
The President kindly announced to us a few moments ago the immediate response of the Presidency of Parliament to the latest ETA terrorist attack and I am deeply grateful , as a Spaniard , for the solidarity of the citizens of Europe ; but the citizens of Europe , whom this Parliament represents , should know that this feeling of outrage at each ETA murder is difficult to reconcile , from the moral point of view , with the retention of the right of asylum within the European Union for citizens fleeing Spanish justice in connection with these terrorist activities .
In fact , as the Commissioner has told us , the cooperation agreement with Uzbekistan signed in June 1996 has been ratified by Uzbekistan only .
Mr President , there is no doubt that the response , as the Commissioner said , is not at all satisfactory .
If that is so , then the ECU 1 000 million reduction in payment appropriations suggested by the Council at its July 1996 meeting seems all the more incomprehensible to me , since that reduction in payment appropriations referred only to Community Objectives 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 - and excluded Objectives 1 and 6 .
We see that there is still some doubt , but there is still hope from the Commissioner 's words .
Although there have not since 1994 been the serious disputes seen in previous years , that was because inspection vessels were permanently deployed by sea-bordering countries as well as a Commission monitoring vessel .
Other sections of this Article might be mentioned , but I think that is sufficient to make the point that promises are not being fulfilled with regard to these nets .
It is argued that fleets from third countries are still using such nets .
They are not very selective , affect other fishing activities and place those fishing with selective methods at a distinct disadvantage .
Fishing in the Community and throughout the whole world is facing an unprecedented crisis caused by the lack of resources and the problem of the market .
Balance means in the second place equal treatment for all .
Although they are not sufficient , the two vessels chartered by the Commission and other measures taken with regard to fishing for tuna in coastal waters were decisive in reducing tension and avoiding the sad events of 1994 .
It would be absurd if , in a situation where there was over-capacity when the new multi-annual guidelines were being discussed , we were to continue to allow the use of non-selective fishing techniques .
I have approached the Commission on several occasions concerning the harm being done in the Balearic Islands by this type of fishing .
It has been said here that the Commission asked for these nets to be discontinued from the end of this year - Parliament has repeated it on many occasions - and it appears , ladies and gentlemen , that we are going to have to keep on repeating it .
We therefore request the Council to show political responsibility and coherence .
Something must therefore be done .
This is one alternative - the other is to carry on with an unresolved environmental problem , a latent conflict in Community waters , vast Commission expenditure , gaps in the legislation described annually in the Commission reports and finally the threat of commercial sanctions by the United States which will adversely affect the entire Community market unless the Italian problem is solved .
This , it seems to me , is a question of
