governance , towards a united reaction to this crisis from the EU.
The clear choice is to move towards a Europe that resolves its shortcomings , which were demonstrated when this extremely serious crisis arose , the like of which those of us here in this House have never known .
We need to deepen solidarity in the euro area , which is why the aid to Greece was so right and why the decision was so right to create this EUR 750 million fund - for a three-year period , so it is not yet completely permanent - to prevent possible difficult situations with public accounts or imbalances in public accounts .
Thirdly , we need to commit to competitiveness .
I would ask Parliament to support these very significant and very important points , which would be a step forwards towards what is being described as the economic governance or government of the Union , so that a decision can be made on it as soon as possible .
Indeed , it is already used in some countries .
The action plan should mean that the 60 000 people who are currently hoping to receive an organ will see their life expectancy considerably increased .
Having changed the title , which now includes the reference to the Europe 2020 strategy , the main aim of the report is to defend Cohesion policy as a strong , well-financed policy , and one that is present in all European Union regions , as well as its key role in the Europe 2020 strategy .
Thus , a certain flexibility should be allowed for .
However , it will not be possible to implement the Europe 2020 strategy successfully without the participation and full approval of regional and local authorities , as well as that of civil society .
We agree that fostering personnel mobility between research centres and companies , promoting private sector investment in R&D , and ensuring that universities provide the job market with well prepared personnel , are all essential actions .
The UfM cannot continue to be blocked or paralysed by the conflict in the Middle East but , at the same time , neither can it ignore it .
These are obviously clear obstacles for any institution that wishes to have that type of relationship between both shores of the Mediterranean .
There are even conflicts , such as the conflict in the Western Sahara , where the European Union is doing precisely nothing .
This is important also in the sense that has been mentioned by Ana Gomes .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a great deal of care needs to be taken with this year 's budget .
We will of course all act responsibly during this financial year ; of course we will find areas of the budget where savings can be made , but let us not forget that a European Union strategy for economic growth requires an adequate EU budget .
Contrary to what we have been hearing and reading in recent days , I would like to say that it is also an improvement to give each corridor a one-stop shop as a management tool .
Finally , I hope that we will also be able to improve transparency and the integration of Parliament 's role in the future project , because it has been somewhat laborious to arrive at our position in this debate .
This meant that the work could be sped up .
( The speaker agreed to answer a question asked under the 'blue card ' procedure ( Rule 149(8 ) ) ) Madam President , Commissioner , to be honest I do not think I am going to use my four minutes , because at this time of night and with so many Members present , there is no need to give a lengthy explanation .
I think that this a good approach .
Based on a public-private model , we must prevent it from being controlled by a single entity or group of entities , and halt any attempt by state or supranational authorities to control the flow of information to the network .
All Europeans must be given access to the Internet effectively and , above all , a particular effort must be made without discriminating in relation to those who live in rural areas , in line with the Digital Agenda adopted by Parliament .
First of all , my congratulations to the rapporteur on his report and its excellent timing given the proximity of the next meeting of the Internet Governance Forum ( IGF) , which will be taking place in the EU for the first time .
I am convinced that we in Parliament are going to contribute to the existence of supervision from 1 January 2011 and , furthermore , cooperate in supervision projects in order for there to be a stricter regulatory framework .
Can the actors themselves choose who examines them ?
As far as legitimacy is concerned , can agencies maintain so much influence over our economies with such little control ?
The European Council also established that decisions on all aspects of the report could be taken on the basis of the report itself , and that it would be taken into account for the purposes of the preparatory studies for the subsequent financial framework .
I must stress the importance of adopting the Lisbon legislative package as soon as possible so that the new requirements established by the new treaty can be transposed to legislation without excessive delays .
I will give you an example of what I believe we must not do and what I have unfortunately heard here .
Well , here we are in mid-2010 and Parliament is having to ask the other two institutions an oral question in order to find out whether or not they are going to meet the commitment that they should have met last year .
