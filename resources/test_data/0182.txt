neighbouring countries on the southern side of the Mediterranean .
Mr President , at this point in the debate , I believe that nothing new nor original can be added but , as a member of the Committee on Fisheries and representative of the citizens and interests of Spain and Andalusia , I would like to make two brief points .
Morocco and the European Union have a mutual interest and need , and intransigent positions and insults are the enemies of cooperation and understanding .
Mr President , very briefly and in support of Mr Seguro , I would like to say that the awarding of the Sakharov Prize by this Parliament to Mr Xanana Gusm√£o does honour to this Parliament .
Mr President , the PSE group supports the Protocol which extends the fisheries agreement with Angola .
In relation to the Cunha report on the conclusion of a new Protocol which defines the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the agreement with the Republic of Angola for the period from 3 May 1999 to 2 May 2000 , I would like to point out that this is a classic Protocol , which allows for access to fishing resources during a certain period and sets a financial contribution .
The first is that we are in the European Parliament and , last Friday , we held a debate without the Commission and without the report from the experts .
I believe they are unrelated .
I would like to concentrate - so as not to repeat part of what has already been said - on the contribution which the Commission made to the technical debate on 29 October .
But this 2 % , as an annual average , reflects a different performance .
The document analyses the conditions necessary so that the policy mix may continue to be as balanced as possible , thereby allowing us to achieve longer-lasting growth .
Secondly , I would like to point out that there was also absolute agreement on the key principle of the macroeconomic framework , which I referred to earlier .
Lastly I would like to point out that the representatives of the Commission underlined the fact that the supply of labour currently seems to respond more positively than it did previously , but that there exists a significant reserve of qualified and available labour .
On the other hand , I would like to refer to the participants who must be taken into account in the macroeconomic dialogue and I would dare to suggest that three more should be added : the representatives of two institutions of the European Union itself , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - two institutions which represent an extremely important economic and social dimension and , in the case of the regions , clearly , some of them have an absolutely essential role in guaranteeing these objectives - and finally the organisations of small and medium-sized enterprises .
Neither does the dialogue intend excessive consensus nor authoritarianism .
They could undoubtedly make an interesting contribution despite the different nature of the participation of the businessmen and workers in , for example , the Economic and Social Committee .
Is it necessary to pursue a policy of greater demand in the present context ?
And I believe that one of the great successes of this measure is the fact that we are following up an agreement between the social partners themselves , which guarantees - I believe - the effectiveness of this agreement .
I agree with the rapporteur that this form of cooperation must be promoted in the Latin American region as a whole and that we should provide impetus for the negotiation of the agreement with Mercosur , an agreement which - I think we have to accept - I believe has come to a bit of a halt or , to put it another way , has not proceeded at the speed which we expected in 1995 when we approved it and when the Agreement on Interregional Cooperation was signed between the European Union and Mercosur in Madrid .
Consumption decreased , during this period , from 17.8 to 8.7 litres per 100 kilometres .
Therefore , I believe that this list we are talking about of the ten most efficient cars could also be , if we carry on like this , the list of the least inefficient , and in no sense will it be the list of the best .
Today the impression is still that the internal market is the concern of the multinationals , the major companies , the bureaucrats , Brussels , the technocrats who are far from the concerns of the ordinary people , where many initiatives pile up on top of one another without order or harmony , with no guiding ideas , which , in many cases , are perceived as one more nightmare in the onerous task of living in a developed Community or having a small or medium-sized business .
Firstly , this Parliament wishes to be closely involved with each and every step in the process which is planned for the internal market , with the selection of strategies , the selection of second level objectives and the selection of specific objectives .
We want the fourth freedom - the free movement of persons , which stands between the internal market and the policies of justice and internal affairs - to be a reality .
Clearly , the Commission has had little time to draw up this document , and we have had even less time .
And I would also like to point out that Mrs Peijs is very right to say that one of the difficulties which we have today in the Community field is that Community law is interpreted and applied in a different way in each of the fifteen Member States .
