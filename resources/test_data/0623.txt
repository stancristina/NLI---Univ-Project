take priority over the demands of the market in more cases than this single example .
Of course , the staff who have helped me to reach this agreement have also played an important role .
I would just like to illustrate this chemical to you all .
We know , everybody knows , and all the studies show that , if dichloromethane is used correctly in such a way that the health of the workers involved is protected , this substance is both uneconomical and unecological .
Mr President , a civilisation 's level of development can be judged by how it treats the most defenceless living creatures found in that civilisation .
This was an area in which we were to improve the situation .
Then came the first directive in 2005 .
I demand that the Commission fines these countries immediately .
The answer in many cases is unfortunately not .
We need to revisit the conditions for animals during transport .
Who would want to be transported under such conditions ?
We talk about costs .
They result in a very real reduction in value .
I do not understand how we are to be able to conduct an election campaign if we do not at least have a proposal from the Commission that demonstrates that we will now - finally - improve conditions for animals .
This is not currently being done .
Animals are reared in one place , they are slaughtered in another place and the meat is transported to a third place .
For the EU-15 , it was determined that 22 million quadrupedal animals , such as pigs , horses and cows , as well as 500 billion poultry , were transported each year in all directions between the Member States of the EU.
I would like to ask the Commission when we will have the new Animal Transport Directive .
Mr Kyprianou did , of course , promise that we would have a new directive during this parliamentary term .
You say that five Member States have not submitted reports , a state of affairs which is , of course , quite shocking .
So , when will we have the new directive with an eight-hour limit , and can we have an analysis of the reports from the Member States ?
Now , however , the world 's economy is in a very deep crisis .
The last time , it brought Hitler to power .
Country after country introduced duties , quantitative restrictions , 'buy domestic ' rules and competing devaluations .
We are seeing the first signs .
Those countries that are currently badly affected around the world and within the EU will be tempted to promise their workers and their undertakings protection against foreign competition .
The EU is the largest trading bloc in the world and therefore has considerable responsibility .
However , the campaigning by France and Germany to get the EU to buy in milk powder and butter and to start subsidising the export of dairy products does not bode well .
Thank you for the opportunity to speak .
I am , of course , particularly happy with the three proposals that I managed to get accepted in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and which I hope will be retained through the vote today .
The first proposal is that a child should be classed as such until he or she is 18 years old .
This means that those who commit crimes will never be able to be sex tourists and exploit the poorest and youngest children and young people in other countries because prosecution and punishment will await them when they arrive home , wherever that is in the EU.
Thank you .
Tackling tyre noise is not the only way to reduce traffic noise , but the best results are achieved by a combination of measures , of which dealing with noise emitted by tyres constitutes an important part .
As regards lorries , 90 % of tyres already meet the noise levels contained in the compromise .
The four Nordic Member States have written to the committee about this regulation , stating that it increases citizens ' trust in the EU and that it provides the greatest possible degree of transparency .
This time , too , the PPE-DE votes will probably be significant for the final outcome , which will presumably come during a new Parliament .
A number of amendments , around 40 to 50 of them , which relate to the Commission 's right of initiative , have caused some discussion .
This requires those involved to know what the rules are - that being the aim of the proposal .
Transparency is an important part of democracy .
Transparency and public access create a sense of participation and confidence in the political system .
Our citizens see this , of course , and that is one reason why we have a low turnout for elections to the European Parliament .
Citizens find it difficult to penetrate and understand the decision-making process within the EU system and feel , quite rightly , that decisions are taken and legislation is created at EU level without them having any real opportunity to study all of the documents .
In order for this to be meaningful , we need to do everything we can to provide citizens with information and awareness .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and I have submitted amendments to , among other things , broaden the definition of documents , make more documents accessible to the public and prevent any individual Member State from being able to submit a veto .
Therefore , for the sake of democracy , vote in favour of the GUE/NGL amendments and increase the citizens ' ability to get involved
