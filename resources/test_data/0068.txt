What is shown on television reflects the spirit of our time , but it is also part of the opinion-forming process .
Let us therefore fight together to ensure that this opinion-forming is worthy of our democratic and humanist culture .
There is one area in the report which I would like to comment on in particular , namely the question of atypical jobs .
It is mainly women , young people and immigrants who get caught up in this system .
We would of course have preferred a report which had not been so watered down by the more conservative forces in the European Parliament ; we would rather have kept the more forthright formulations of situations and proposals that Mr Rocard started out with .
The starting point of the Greens has always been that working hours reductions are beneficial for many different reasons .
I am thinking here , for example , of the 'green' taxation option and investment in new energy and transport systems .
I therefore think that 'adjustment ' or 'flexibility ' should not come to mean that social or labour law rules are invalidated .
When there are not enough jobs for everyone , they must be rationed and shared .
The age distribution in a decade or so will be such that we risk serious generational conflicts .
Otherwise , in a few years ' time we shall be faced with a social trauma of immense proportions .
In Sweden , an overwhelming majority takes a negative view of EMU.
Certainly , that is for different reasons .
The two arguments he cites are neo-liberalism and federalism .
That was not regulated .
It will not do , of course , to say that all this is due to adjustment problems in connection with EMU.
What proposals does the Commissioner have to bring down unemployment ?
The reason why I ask the question is that there is great hesitancy with regard to EMU all across Europe , and that worries me .
In the longer term , however , I see no conflict between the fight against inflation and the fight against unemployment .
The document refers to another document from the Legal Service of 13 December 1995 , which states that there are problems in applying the so-called environmental guarantee to the new Member States .
According to a document from the Commission , they are 500 times higher than normal in Europe .
Something must be done .
It is not just the future of the Kola Peninsula that is at stake , but the future of Europe as a whole .
What is the EU doing ?
Mass unemployment is Europe 's biggest problem today .
No single measure is sufficient on its own ; a whole battery of measures is needed .
But we also need a reduction in working hours in order to create jobs for those who are without work today .
I think that a reduction in working hours , together with other measures , will make a worthwhile contribution to the fight against unemployment .
It is an important contribution , but it is also important for other contributions to be made .
Madam President , unfortunately abolishing unemployment is not a simple matter of cutting working hours and paying everyone the same as they were earning before .
The proposal to investigate how and whether working hours reductions can bring down unemployment may appear , if not commendable , then at least harmless .
But the real action bears no relation to all the talk .
High employment also requires an improvement in general education , a higher standard of training at elite level to promote leading-edge technologies in production , better working conditions for small firms and a reduced tax burden to encourage individual effort , which for many will mean longer working hours .
Sweden has suffered from this quite a lot through acid rain , mainly from Britain and Central Europe .
The EU is taking an important step in setting up a reciprocal exchange of information on air pollution between the Member States .
A common fund of data on air quality in the Union will provide a strong argument for firm action against acidification and eutrophication through air pollution .
That is why information on environmental pollution must be made public .
Madam President , this is an old issue in which the Greens have played a pioneering role .
As I said earlier , Mr Virgin is taking a 'green' stance on this issue , like a good environmental party man .
I was in Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia the other day .
It is a question that should be taken up as soon as possible , and I hope that Mr Virgin , and indeed his whole political group , will allow the environment to take precedence over free trade considerations in this case too .
It is customary to congratulate the rapporteur using some empty phrase of courtesy , but I do not propose to do that .
On 1 January 1998 , a ban on the export of waste comes into force .
It is our task here in the European Parliament to press for a corresponding development .
The use of chemicals in agriculture is of course an environmental issue and a consumer affairs issue , not just an agricultural matter , as it may easily be if Article 43 is retained .
Responsibility for cutting down on the use of chemicals in agriculture cannot be placed on the shoulders of the individual farmer or the consumers .
The coordination of several directives on limits for pesticide residues would make for clearer legislation .
The use of large quantities of chemicals to produce food is not a sustainable route for the future .
We cannot therefore support it .
The resolution stresses the seriousness of
