We owe it to the future members not to delay accession for any longer than is absolutely necessary .
This means that there is a need for certain transitional arrangements .
It has been suggested in Parliament that the 2004 elections to the European Parliament be held on an earlier date , for example 9 May .
The matter was discussed in detail over many years in connection with the revision of the Common Act on direct elections , which has recently been amended ( published in the Official Journal of 21 October 2002 ) .
Unfortunately , I do not believe that further attempts to change the date will bear fruit .
I hope that Parliament appreciates the situation that the Commission will find itself in during the period between the accession of the new Member States and the investiture of the new Commission .
The Presidency hopes Parliament accepts that the interim Commissioners from the new countries will not be subject to hearings or approval by Parliament .
This avoids any possibility of prejudicing the new Parliament 's opinion of the new Commission .
It is of course unacceptable to the new Member States that 'their ' Commissioners should be approved by a Parliament in which the new countries are not yet represented by MEPs with voting rights .
It goes without saying that , if the Commissioners from the new countries do not have a portfolio during the period up to the investiture of the new Commission , there is very little point in Parliament 's specialist committees holding hearings of the new Commissioners and examining them in specialist areas they do not have .
Lastly , there is the question of the full participation of the new Member States in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
The new Member States must be placed on an equal footing with the old Member States in the negotiations that will shape their and our common future .
We cannot in decency do otherwise .
I am looking forward to our debate .
The Council will discuss the institutional consequences of enlargement once more at the General Affairs Council meeting on Monday and Tuesday .
It has already been agreed that I shall be present myself at the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on 10 December .
This will be an opportunity for me to brief the competent parliamentary committee on the latest developments , and for a discussion on their significance .
The Seville European Council instructed the Danish Presidency to continue working on the question as to how the presidency will function in the future in an enlarged EU.
This will mean that we can have an initial orientation debate on the subject there .
It is not the intention that the European Council will take a decision on the models .
At the meeting in Copenhagen , the Chairman of the Convention will give a report on the progress that has been made in the Convention .
With the presentation , last month , of a draft Constitutional Treaty , the work of the Convention entered a decisive phase .
The basis for the Convention 's end product is now being created .
In this connection , it is good to see that the draft Constitutional Treaty has given rise to a Europe-wide debate on the form the Europe of the future will take .
It bodes well for our common ambition to create European cooperation which is more democratic and has grass-roots support .
As will have been clear from my statement , the European Council has an extensive and ambitious agenda for its meeting .
In Copenhagen we hope to be able to take a historic decision on the greatest enlargement in the history of the Community to date , and I also dare say the enlargement with the most far-reaching consequences and the broadest historical perspective .
And , as I said at the start , this great project can only succeed if the three institutions work closely together .
Mr President , my thanks also to the Danish Presidency , the Commission and others .
First , the praise .
It was a splendid decision and means that many of my worst fears have fortunately not come true .
I also wish to praise the Presidency for its hard work on enlargement .
I think , however , that it is worth remembering that praise is also due to the applicant countries for the herculean task of adapting themselves , and for the formidable tasks the populations of these countries have had to undertake in connection with this whole process .
Besides the fact that we have not quite completed the whole project , the people of these countries will of course also be voting on whether or not they want to join us .
I hope that the citizens of the applicant countries do not look at the two things side by side and become frustrated .
As regards Turkey , I also agree that the time has not yet come to give that country a date , but I think that the right thing to do would be to give it a date for a date ; in other words , set a combination of a timetable and a roadmap .
What are the deadlines ?
When must the individual parts of the human rights and democracy projects be implemented in Turkey in order that we can set the final date ?
A date for a date , however , would be the right thing to do .
There are a couple of things , however , that have disappointed me about the Danish Presidency .
I am disappointed that it did not manage to do something about the Statute of the Ombudsman .
Not only to be permitted to sit down somewhere and read them , but also to have those documents handed over which he has asked
