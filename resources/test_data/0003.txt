Mr Jarzembowski , I have a word of advice for you .
It says : 'people who ride oxen get there too ' .
You are very concerned about certain principles in this matter .
On the other hand , there is always room for improvements .
On the contrary , there is cooperation here , but the important point is to get something on the table and to make it stick , so that it has real meaning .
From that point , we can take things further .
Even this proposal can be improved .
It is irritating that we should be talking about it on the last evening , during the debate on the last transport item .
We are working towards environmentally friendly transport , and it can still be improved .
It is in order to appeal to you personally , because I believe we have misunderstood each other on this matter .
I too would like to say Gracias , Presidente on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group , and to acknowledge the fact that something happens to our Presidents when they are first elected .
And you are no exception in this respect .
You have continued the work of Mr HÃ¤nsch , and I would very much like to thank you for that .
I suppose that I can now be counted as one of the veterans of the House , and I can recall how at one time the political group chairmen would lead the way when it came to wasting expenses and being driven around in limousines with chauffeurs paid for by Parliament , while in the meantime travel refunds were being drawn from the Members ' cash office for the same trips .
Since 1994 , the President of Parliament has been at the forefront of the clean-up operation .
But there was also a time when this House was a ' Mickey Mouse parliament ' which acted most irresponsibly in financial matters .
Hopefully this will now happen , but we must first get through an exercise this afternoon .
So in this area at least , a change has taken place , but unfortunately the political group chairmen are still in the minority in this House .
Hopefully , the chairmen will get a majority behind them in the Parliament that emerges after 10 June , so that a clean-up can finally take place with regard to travel expenses , because we are certainly not there yet .
So there is still some way to go .
And so , Mr President , I would very much like to thank you for having also played a part in the campaign for greater openness within the EU.
Over the past five years , a consensus has been created within Parliament with a view to working towards greater openness .
There is a consensus on this stance in Parliament , but unfortunately this is not yet the case within the Commission and the Council .
Finally , I would like to thank Mr Santer and Mr Oreja , because after 20 years ' work we have succeeded in getting the Commission 's internal telephone directory officially issued , with a covering letter stating that within a few months everyone else will also be able to get hold of it , once the prototype has become a real telephone directory .
Thank you , Mr President , for your helpful collaboration .
I have a question for the President-in-Office concerning Regulation No 1408/71 .
I would like to ask directly how the President-in-Office views the Danish early retirement benefit in relation to Regulation No 1408 .
The fact is that the Danish Government has been given until the end of April to respond , and I would very much like to know when this question will come up in the Council .
With due respect , Mr President-in-Office , there really is something which you do not mention in your reply .
This gives it six months in which to produce scientific evidence in order to maintain the more stringent basis which it requires in its own country .
You actually said that yourself in your reply .
It is therefore not possible to maintain stricter rules unless evidence can be produced that they are necessary .
In some countries , things have been permitted because it has not been proved that a very small amount of pesticides in baby food is harmful , whereas other countries do not tolerate any pesticide residues at all .
There should be clear scientific evidence on the table so that the Member States can maintain stricter rules .
I would like to thank you for your reply , but I do not understand why the terms of the Staff Regulations are being disregarded , since there is after all nothing to prevent us from respecting the Council 's existing rules during the integration process .
There is no reason for us now to be recruiting large numbers of staff without them having to sit the recruitment tests , so I have still had no answer to my question as to why the existing rules are being disregarded .
As far as I can see , this all smacks more of what one might call national nepotism , in other words that there are a number of Member States that wish to have some staff placed somewhere in particular , and the other Member States are therefore nodding this through .
It seems to me highly reprehensible that the Council is venturing to disregard the existing rules .
It is a well-known fact that the People 's Movement against the EU , which I represent , is opposed to the Schengen system , as I am myself , mainly for reasons of public security .
I presume that we all more or less wholeheartedly share the objective of establishing a humane refugee policy
