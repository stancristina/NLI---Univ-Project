I should like , Mr President and Mr Eurlings , speaking in a personal capacity , to express two regrets about the nature of the debates that we have just held .
Basically , we have only discussed our own internal or bilateral affairs and the clear , tricky and obvious difficulties , the undeniable difficulties presented by this accession .
If we wish to achieve this , however , welcoming a country with such a large population which , geographically speaking , lies outside Europe does not seem to me to be the right way to go about it .
I think that Mr Brok is right , but I do not draw the same conclusions as he does : to set out a half-hearted accession strategy is to prepare for failure .
The question is : ‘ What kind of Europe do we want ? ’ We have always wanted a political Europe in tune with world affairs , a Europe of integration and not of differentiation , a Europe of common policy and not of variable geometry .
As we have said , it has been a democratic revolution .
We are told today that we have gone too far to turn back , yet at the same time we are told that there will always be time to address this question in ten or fifteen years .
We must firstly , therefore , be consistent with ourselves and with our previous commitments , so that everyone is treated equally .
Thirdly , if Turkey were to join the EU in 2015 , it would be the most populous country with 80 million inhabitants , which would give it the highest number of Members of this Parliament and significant weight in the Council .
I should like to say another word or two about my initiative to develop joint strategic objectives .
This would constitute a social dumping machine , a sort of flag of convenience covering all services .
We share this aim , in particular as regards growth and employment , and , in order to restore confidence among the citizens of the European Union , the Union must clearly demonstrate its capacity to revive our economy .
Women constitute one such category .
This is why I wish first of all to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets , and in particular our general rapporteur , Mr Garriga Polledo , for supporting and putting to the vote in this House most of the amendments submitted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We have now reached payment appropriations of 1.05 % of GDP , which is above the milestone of 1 % .
In return , however , we have obtained an unhoped-for result for the flexibility instrument that will allow us to finance our priorities in the short term thanks to an agreement on Heading 2 .
My group has never argued in favour of a rash increase in the Union’s budget .
As has already been stated several times , a heavy millstone is currently weighing these negotiations down : the need of the six countries which are net contributors to the Union’s budget to have this limited in the future to 1 % or 0.9 % of gross national revenue .
Ten years from now , consequently , the European budget will have doubled and the question of European taxation will have to be addressed .
When will that debate take place ?
Today it is in Strasbourg , and I think France and the citizens of Strasbourg are happy to welcome it and are doing all they can to make us feel at home .
One might mention a number of interesting authorisations which are cases in point ; for example , State aid to and to was allowed , as was aid to and other programmes of the same kind , because they were compatible with the rules .
The Commission has in fact made support to the health sector and institutional support for democratic transition part of its 2003-2007 strategy for cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo .
I am also aware of the renewed abuses and renewed and extremely serious acts of violence that the region is again witnessing .
Unfortunately , Mr Staes , it is beyond my power to resolve the problem myself , and I can only hope that my powers of persuasion will have an effect this time .
All organisations signing the partnership agreement by virtue of which they work with ECHO therefore commit themselves to upholding the fundamental humanitarian values and principles I have just mentioned .
Information reaches us more reliably and more quickly , and on the basis of that information we can either continue our work , negotiate to try and get the aid where it is needed , or quite simply break it off .
But everything must also be done to prevent our entire system grinding to a halt in the process .
Given the restrictions on the exercise of civil liberties in the context of the war on terrorism , and the measures taken in the aftermath of the attempted , 2003 may be regarded as a year of regression on the democracy front .
Indeed , it is virtually a forgotten country .
At a time when the Commission and the Council are preparing to open the gates of Europe once again , can we continue to operate with a budget that has not developed since the 1990s , even though the European Union has subsequently taken on many new Member States and been accorded wider powers under a series of new treaties ?
Europe , however , must not be the sole focus of our attention in this respect .
We want more accessible , fairer and better organised asylum systems , and we must rectify the defects in the present systems .
Rest assured that the Commission will not falter
