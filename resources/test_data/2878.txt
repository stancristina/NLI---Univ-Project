All eastern European countries , Russia included , are on the path to democracy and a market economy .
Mrs Lalumi√®re 's excellent report originally gave the impression , and still does to some extent , that there will be a new bi-zonal Europe made up of Russia on the one hand and the rest of Europe on the other .
We hope everyone will approve this addition .
Nuclear waste and environmental pollution are a threat to the whole of Europe .
A country like Finland should remain non-aligned , even if the EU were to have a common foreign and defence policy .
We should not , however , adopt double standards when we look at the Russian issue .
An equal basis for dialogue and cooperation requires the EU to look to Nordic policies .
The most important problem with the report is the lack of examples .
The Finnish government aims to put the Union 's Nordic dimension on the agenda during her Presidency in the latter part of 1999 .
Russian stability will not be aided by grandiloquent , celebratory eulogies even in this House .
The danger is that the bank and its directors will withdraw from normal society and that exaggerated price stability will , in the end , pose a threat to peace within EU society .
This must be prevented by the board of the ECB becoming involved in institutional dialogue with the other political bodies .
They must be stated publicly , and I am totally convinced that public opinion will still accept that the European Parliament has a key role to play in this matter , and in the monitoring of democracy .
But it is quite clear that the European Parliament should propose bold amendments to the Treaty of Rome .
I think it is essential that everyone should be in a position to remind the Central Bank 's Executive Board of its mortality .
Mr President , when the European Central Bank begins operations , it will have immense economic power .
Seriously , it will take decisions on all economic policy , because , for example , the hands of financial policy will be bound by convergence criteria .
Whether or not we find an Executive Board for the bank made up of six men and women with practically supernatural abilities is the old sixty four thousand dollar question .
The Board must work in close cooperation with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
Ladies and gentlemen , the euro has to create stability for Member States .
Mr President , it was important that the European Conference should get under way and that European integration is a step nearer .
Dealing with issues of the environment with all applicant countries right from the start is essential .
The EU 's unique and comprehensive process of enlargement makes security on a broad scale an even more urgent notion in the EU decision-making process , and that of its various bodies .
In this we need to make the most of the ISPA financial instrument and derive from it the means to solve environmental problems as far as possible while negotiations for membership are still going on , so that the transition periods involved can be as short as possible .
We know the problems there are with protection of the Baltic .
Without the presence of Russia in all of this there can be no sustainable development or improvement in environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the High Level Panel has done an excellent piece of work .
We know that progress has been made with the other three freedoms , but that has not been the case in this field , partly because of a lack of legal instruments but also , I believe , because the political will is not there .
The report also reflects the fact that national legislation has ceased to reflect human reality .
We have experienced cars being seized when the authorities in one of these two countries take the view that the person in question is actually domiciled in the other .
I would therefore like to emphasize the proposal of the working group that , in regard to taxation , we need a common definition of residence .
I also think we should adopt the proposal that Member States should be able to read other Member States ' so-called " smart cards ' when it comes to entitlement to social security benefits .
Finally , I would like to point out that there is an error in the Swedish version when it comes to the national ombudsmen 's duties , but this does not apply to the other language versions .
It is an extremely important one .
That is why this report is an important one .
I voted for it , although I cannot completely agree the solutions which were approved in the part-session .
Mr President , Mr Adam has produced an excellent report on the EU 's involvement in constructing a shelter which will cover , once and for all , the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl .
The report shows just how problematic the issue is .
Progress is slow ; the work consumes 6 % of Ukraine 's gross national income .
That is why the report 's proposal that the EU should contribute ECU 100 million is justified .
The overall cost of the operation is going to be pretty enormous .
It is a matter of concern that only half the funding is clearly available .
That is true of the Ukrainian nuclear industry .
When they start production the power stations in worst condition could be shut down .
Mr Adam proposes in his report that finance should come partly from the TACIS fund and partly from a specially constructed
