It is a matter of concern that most illegally produced synthetic drugs originate in Europe - according to data compiled in 1999 by the Swiss Federal Criminal Investigation Office , the Netherlands alone accounts for more than 50 % of world production .
.
I feel that the report has achieved a reasonable balance on this point .
Furthermore , all committee documents , with the exception of confidential documents , of course , should be accessible to the public .
I share these concerns because my country has a long coastline , which is highly dependent on maritime resources .
With regard to social and labour legislation , the rights of workers in EU ports must be safeguarded .
The issue lies in whether or not to exclude pilotage activities in those covered by this directive .
Lastly , where the directive makes significant economic amendments to the port operating system , I believe it is also crucial to provide for transitional systems that protect the rightful interests of those operators who have nevertheless accepted ongoing obligations imposed by national legislation and whose economic balance could suffer irremediably .
We are now seeing further problems with defining priorities , such as that given to the Lisbon strategy , or to issues of immigration and asylum .
( PT ) The Copenhagen European Council confirmed the outcome of the accession process involving ten candidate countries and negotiations were concluded on the basis of a financial package totalling EUR 41 billion , which will enable the financial perspective to be adjusted and will form the basis of the budget for 2004 , which also increased with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice , on 1 February 2003 .
( PT ) The 2004 budget will be the first in a European Union of perhaps 25 Members and we must emphasise the historic importance of the forthcoming enlargement , which will bring to an end the artificial division of Europe ; until then , a considerable number of measures will have to be adopted in 2003 and 2004 , to ensure that the European institutions obtain the necessary means with which to complete preparations .
Mr President , first of all , I wish to congratulate Mr Mann on this report , which makes an excellent contribution to defining a future strategy for employment and social policy in the European Union .
The importance of the role of the social partners , civil society and non-governmental organisations in achieving the objective of full employment and of better jobs for all cannot be over-emphasised .
In this speech he expressed his concern at the downturn in the economic cycle , but also emphatically criticised an inflexible and dogmatic enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact regardless of changing circumstances and consequently called for adjustments and the introduction of more sophisticated criteria for implementing the Pact .
All of this coincides with the increased difficulties that the European economy has been displaying .
Many countries , incidentally , have enshrined principles and rules in their Constitutions establishing rules - some more rigid , some less so - for budgetary deficits .
It makes no economic sense to set the same budgetary deficit threshold for countries that have different levels of development , and nor is there any economic justification for sacrificing everything in the name of zero deficit .
The rapporteur himself , in his explanatory statement , sets the tone , by stating that this proposal will contribute to the development of the financial markets , acknowledging that the common position lacks balance between taking into account the social security of the beneficiaries and the aim of creating a simple framework for capital markets .
This time , however , Saddam Hussein will not be able to continue to defy international law .
Lastly , Mr President , and in addition to all of these reasons , we are not remaining neutral because we take the view that it is our duty always to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies , in good times and bad .
( PT ) I broadly share the rapporteur 's concerns about the need to adapt companies ' obligations to file information to the digital age .
This directive would also need to be updated with regard to the types of company it covers and with regard to its references to accounting requirements .
I am pleased to note and endorse the rapporteur 's recommendation that the Commission should 'be cautious and undertake in-depth studies and wide-ranging consultations before considering proposing any legislative initiatives ' .
I am of the same mind as the rapporteur on the need to establish a legal framework that will enable the use of alternative fuels for road transport to be promoted and developed , not only because of the security that this guarantees for investors but also because of what it represents for the worldwide effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , particularly in the framework of the commitments given in Kyoto .
I am sorry that the Council has removed the mandatory nature of targets for bringing biofuels onto the market and has even allowed Member States to set targets lower than those proposed in the directive .
I am therefore happy that Parliament has rejected it .
Nevertheless , I must praise the intense work and efforts made by Mr Mann and I fully support the idea of promoting new initiatives for the strategy for employment and social policy in the European Union , in line with the Lisbon Strategy .
( PT ) Given the current situation of employment , caused in particular by the relocation of undertakings whose priority is profit , without any consideration for the importance of the 'function of work ' to social development , to the mental
