economy .
We also need to give special attention to the most vulnerable groups of women , such as immigrants , women in rural areas and elderly women .
Their basic functions are being privatised , they are increasingly controlled by business interests and they are forced to operate as enterprises subject to competition and the laws of the market in general .
We are fighting for state universities and state universities alone , subject to academic , not business control , which will meet grass-roots and social needs .
Another dimension we need to be aware of is the role of universities in promoting European unification , by cultivating a European conscience and promoting a European nationality .
What we all have to understand is that convergence and promoting educational cohesion can be achieved with all due respect for diversity and , at the same time , by introducing systems which recognise and promote the added value of the special attributes of our universities .
This sort of policy will also bring about better conditions for the professional mobility which the European Union is striving to promote .

That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the Van Brempt report .
How come the federal government of Nigeria is unable to make the Islamic fundamentalists respect the very constitution of the country ?
We need to send out a very strong message from this House today both to Nigeria and to any other country in which crimes are being committed against women because , as we know from the press , sentences of death by stoning are also passed in Iran .
I have the photocopy in question here , which I can give you .
( The President cut the speaker off )
The Danish Presidency simply calls this murderous attack unproductive and the delegate from the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs has advised the Palestinian Authority to reorganise its security services and isolate extremist elements .
How much longer , Mr President , honourable Members , will the governments of the European Union refuse to listen to the word on the street ?
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece - and I believe the people of Greece as a whole - are opposed to any such eventuality .
Do you realise that what we have here is the worst kind of terrorism , targeting anyone who refuses to accept the hegemony of the United States , which has granted itself the right to attack anyone it considers represents or might represent a threat ?
Mr President , Commissioner , we all know that the events of September 11 and the war on terrorism are being used as an excuse in several Member States of the European Union to block progress on an integrated European asylum policy .
At the same time , according to statistics from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , most mass movements of refugees are offered refuge by neighbouring , equally poor countries ; fewer are opting to flee to the West , that is when they manage to get here at all .
It is not just that strict controls do nothing to prevent asylum seekers from heading for Europe ; they encourage many to try and enter illegally , creating work for gangs of smugglers .
And as a result , we end up counting corpses on our borders and coastlines and trying to deal with new forms of slavery and exploitation .
Mr President , I subscribe to the minority opinion of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms on this Commission communication , which is shot through from beginning to end with the notion of Europe as a fortress to which hundreds of thousands of victims of imperialist policy are denied access .
It sets out new repressive measures , such as front security checks , a biometric database such as the Eurodac fingerprint system , gathering DNA etc. , and all at a time when the percentage of asylum applications approved in the Member States of the European Union is already tragically low .
As part of improved coordination , Member States are obliged , contrary to all notions of national sovereignty , to collate a minimum number of facts on so-called terrorist-related crimes and pass them on to Europol and Eurojust .
The Commission proposal on the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms unfortunately does less than the Cartagena Protocol which it is supposed to apply .
Three : full responsibility for the movement of banned genetically modified organisms should rest with the country of export ; it should not be shifted on to the country of import .
Capitalism is in a state of deep crisis ; all it can do now is cling to the stability pact and anti-labour policies , chip away at workers ' rights and their standard of living and pensions , cut farmers ' incomes and choke the life out of small and medium-sized enterprises .
The common agricultural policy and quotas have created a huge , EUR 25 billion trade deficit in the European Union , jobs are being lost and unemployment is rising .
We reject the modus operandi of the monopolies , we are fighting with the workers to overturn these plans and we demand a different sort of policy , a policy which will bring about economic prosperity for the workers and secure their rights .
Ten million jobs have been created in Europe , as the result both of economic growth in previous years and efficient reforms on numerous job markets .
Much still remains to be done and this is set out every year in the Commission 's common report and guidelines .
Your motion contains some very interesting ideas on how we need to proceed and we need to draw on what we have learned to date so that we can make a number of changes .
