However , we believe that the Commission has drawn up proposals which it is difficult to accept .
The problem is that if we wish to apply the LEADER model , access to the alternatives envisaged under that model will perhaps be far more limited .
In my view , this is another indication of the European Union 's goodwill and readiness for dialogue .
Consequently , I would call on the Commission once again to defend our fishing rights , since the European Union is just as sovereign as Canada , and to defend Community interests in accordance with the Union 's international weight , which is far greater than the results achieved recently would suggest .
Of these four reports , two relate to the conservation of fishery resources - an issue of concern to the European Union - in two areas : the Baltic and the Antarctic .
Mr President , I shall concentrate my remarks on the question of fishing in the NAFO zone , and especially on the problems of a fleet which has undergone one of the toughest decommissioning programmes in the European Union over the last few years .
I would urge you - with your customary firmness , which has brought such good results for the Community fishing industry and other sectors - and the rest of the Commission to play a leading role in securing the amendment of this TAC , the application of which is not based on sound scientific data . 93 % of the Terranova Great Bank lies in Canada 's exclusive economic zone , and the Community fleet , operating in international waters , must not be made to pay for Canada 's mismanagement in this area .
These facts are keeping the tension alive .
We are discussing the halibut dispute , which was caused by a bad decision in the allocation of the corresponding TAC quotas .
I said that this was a clear mistake on the part of the minister in question , but I did not refer to the Commissioner at all .
And it is not the fault of our minister , but of the former socialist government .
I had hoped that this question would provide an opportunity to set out some specific guidelines for the future for the many small tobacco farmers in southern Europe - Greece , Italy , Spain and Portugal - and , more specifically , in the north of the province of CÃ¡ceres , Extremadura , which is the area that I am familiar with on a daily basis .
These restrictions , if applied , would give rise to different conditions for the practice of the profession in a host Member State for migrant lawyers and lawyers who are nationals of that Member State , and this would obviously be a violation of the right of establishment , which is based on the principle of equal conditions .
Mr President , the proposal for a directive which we are discussing today is undoubtedly one of those measures which , to paraphrase Robert Schuman , strengthen the building of Europe .
For let no one doubt the fact : European integration must be based on the rule of law .
I am coming to the end , Mr President .
Mr President , firstly , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Fontaine , on this report on the proposal for a directive on the practice of the profession of lawyer .
The successive postponements of the entry into force of Regulation No 3254 cast doubt on the Commission 's political will to comply with Community law , when it should be setting an example in this respect to the Member States .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , the European United Left , I should like to make three comments which reflect three general but deep concerns .
We are calling for the requirement of Parliament 's assent for any revision of the Treaties to be recognized swiftly and written into the Treaty .
Lastly , I wish to express my clear support for the stance of the President-in-Office .
I would also point out that the original French version of paragraph 3 refers to the need to 'induce ' the UK Government to face up to its responsibilities .
With regard to the profession of lawyer , these are different concepts , I believe .
And I stress this because many people are now questioning the wisdom of holding the elections on the date which is planned ; of holding them throughout Bosnia ; of applying the principle of conditionality ; of bringing firm pressure to bear to remove those accused of war crimes from public office , arresting them and bringing them before the International Tribunal in the Hague - something which some people even believe might be considered a provocation .
I shall draw attention to some of these , of which everyone is aware .
Many of us believe that it is not a question of the date itself , but of meeting our responsibility as the international community to ensure that the conditions are as favourable as possible by the planned date .
Mr President , following the signing of the Dayton agreements , peace at last seemed possible in the wartorn territories of former Yugoslavia .
Consequently the REX Committee , like the rapporteur on humanitarian aid , believes that for peace to be genuinely possible , over and above the Commission 's own emergency measures and the priorities it has established in its communication on the prospects and guidelines for humanitarian aid , there is a need for such aid to be reoriented towards measures which facilitate the return and social reintegration of the refugees and displaced persons .
Mr President , we have held countless debates in this House and adopted numerous resolutions on the tragedy of the war in former
