to developing countries .
How can it be that , even now , only 10 % of both public and private research is dedicated to studying these diseases which are responsible for a good 90 % of disease in developing populations ?
A great leader listening to Mr Fatuzzo : naturally , I am pleased about this .
That coffee was so bitter !
Who knows then , ' I continued , 'whether with this report Mrs Hautala can give us , throughout Europe , a fairytale landscape in which to live , like that in her region , Finland . '
All of these pensioners said to me : ' Mr Fatuzzo , Mr Fatuzzo , Mr Fatuzzo , what a short memory many MEPs have , what a short memory many people have .
I knew how to explain why I voted for the report and , above all , that I should make a suggestion .
Not least for all those who firmly believe that the role of the Union on the international stage is not just to be a vassal but to endeavour to bring about democratic globalisation , it is clear that the election of President Lula da Silva and his government is cause for hope and huge expectations , as you will certainly have noticed , Commissioner Lamy , since you were in Brazil in the days immediately following Porto Alegre .
We need to have the courage to uphold positions which are sometimes uncomfortable but which can make it quite clear that the European Union is not blindly following the lead of the United States but takes its responsibility towards the world seriously .
' Do not give us your milk , do not give us your agricultural products , please , because your giving us milk and wheat represents unfair competition for Peruvian farmers ?
We must not continue to let the United States carry off the prizes for genuine liberalisation of the agricultural markets .
It outlined a range of constructive proposals for world policies on the environment , peace and freedom of expression and combating hunger and disease .
Indeed , not only can the European Union become the model for a similar political initiative in Latin America , but its very existence and independent international structure will benefit from a decisive boost in a world in which , thanks , not least , to President Lula da Silva and Latin America , multipolarity is developing , although that multipolarity is currently under great threat from the intention of the United States and some of its most faithful allies to declare war on Iraq unilaterally .
Thus , the idea which emerges of cutting export subsidies is an idea which is certainly attractive and which I certainly support , but only on condition that other subsidies causing the distortion of the international trade market are also regulated .
The production costs sustained by the European agricultural economy differ substantially from those sustained by the developing countries , for the standards of quality , safety and health and hygiene are different .
There is therefore a need to redefine the negotiating modalities , removing the Blue Box chapter altogether and thus irretrievably eliminating the possibility of safeguarding direct payments in a multilateral context .
Indeed , one might say that this directive lays the foundations of dual citizenship - national and European citizenship - as formulated in the draft Treaty discussed in the Convention too .
Another merit is its clarity and , in this regard , I feel that some of the rapporteur 's amendments , not least , have helped to simplify the excessively bureaucratic sections as far as is possible .
I have saved the most controversial issue until last , as always happens when debates are introduced in this Chamber : the family , its composition and the definitions of couple and spouse .
To sum up , it has to be said that the rapporteur 's approach is , for the most part , in line with that of the Commission , which has produced a coherent , objective text which , as we already know , also expresses the Council 's position .
We are convinced that , just as rights such as the right to divorce or to have an abortion are ingrained in the psyche of the majority of Europeans , so there is also a clear need to make effective the right of those who wish to live in a country other than their own , who wish to live alone or with a same-sex partner or to build a family without being forced to marry .
We do not think that in providing for the free movement of persons within the European Union we would automatically be introducing same-sex marriages throughout Europe , but if same-sex marriages are recognised in one country , when the same-sex couple moves to another country , its rights in terms of free movement - not in terms of all family rights - should be recognised .
Mr President , we would like to have Belarus as one of Community Europe 's neighbours and , perhaps , one day , as part of it too .
An extremely high level of corruption , poverty and disorder catapulted Lukashenko to power in 1994 , but his remedy was too brutal : he eliminated some of the corruption but his authoritarian tendencies were combined with the sort of dirigisme which had already led to the break-up of the Soviet Union , and there has been little change since then .
I am not happy about this , and so I advise Mr Fatuzzo to vote against the motion . '
Therefore , would it not be better to give everybody free movement without visas and deal with us separately , if you do not want us , to stop us getting in and causing damage ?
