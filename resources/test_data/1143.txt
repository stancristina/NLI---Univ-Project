I therefore hope that the UN can be given a common and permanent military force to deploy once all peaceful means have been exhausted .
You must not only be secretary of a Security Council whose members are in disagreement .
In war , you must be commander-in-chief of all the generals , for , without UN permission , it should again be prohibited to go to war .
We would do well to transfer a couple of hundred euros in aid from each EU cow to those whose need is greater , namely citizens who today have to place their children in something that is not a bed , following something that is not a meal and perhaps with an illness that makes life before death all too short .
The question is , whether we are now seeing the start of a similar development in occupied Iraq .
Now , I hear that the leader of the Organisation of Women 's Freedom in Iraqis under violent attack from Islamic groups .
I should very much like to ask you to protest , on behalf of Parliament , against the attacks on women’s rights that are now gathering speed in Iraq , and also to protest to the occupying forces , that is to say the alliance of so-called volunteers , against this development .     Mr President , the Commission has prepared a draft amendment of a directive relating to the EU labour market .
The directive nonetheless makes it possible for the employee , by means of his signature , to permit this maximum of 48 hours per week to be worked only as an average over a whole year .
Employers are accorded flexibility at the expense of employees ’ welfare .
This has , for example , led to millions of Britons increasing their working time to more than 48 hours per week since the directive was introduced .
The directive supports the principle of individual agreements that is contrary to the collective agreement model that exists in Denmark .
Employees use ballots to agree upon the conditions under which they wish to work .
The proximity principle must be taken seriously .
The report on revising the directive proposes closing those gaps in it that employers have misused to exploit the unfair individual agreements .
This individualisation is unacceptable as a basis for labour market agreements .
Pressure is being exerted from two sides .
This comes firstly in relation to the individual opt-out .
Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mrs Lynne are very enthusiastic about these individual opt-outs .
Why stop here ?
There is also a prevailing misunderstanding that it is the individual opt-out that makes it possible to work long hours .
Nor , at the same time , must we of course forget that we are concerned here with health and safety in the workplace .
We also know that the statistics are clear in their implications .
Moreover , it is generally known that the number of sick days is increasing and that long working hours do not in actual fact mean higher productivity .
I am certain that the right-hand side of the Chamber too will appreciate that this would be very unfortunate for the European economy .
The second pressure on the working time directive stems directly from the fact that the Commission has neglected to say what it intends to do as a consequence of the Jaeger and SIMAP Judgments .
These rigid judgments have sent shock waves through the national and regional health authorities which simply cannot imagine how they are to make ends meet if on-call hours are to be fully charged for .
We badly need a revision of the directive that abolishes the individual opt-out but that constantly provides for flexibility where there is a need for this , for example in the health sector .
We are all asking for flexibility , but we must not of course destroy the principles behind having legislation in this area .
I say this not just to harp on about time-honoured Danish practices , but also because this method of implementation puts a stop to the individual ways of doing things and , at the same time , provides for a very high-level implementation of the directive .
There is therefore no reason for the EU to seek membership and appoint people to work in the ICES.
Secondly , there is a limited number of qualified researchers .
The June Movement’s three Members of the European Parliament , Ulla Sandbæk , Jens-Peter Bonde and Bent Hindrup Andersen , chose to vote against the report , a decision for which the following explanation of vote was given .
In principle , the June Movement believes that all attempts by the EU to dominate the ICES should be voted down .
This ought to be a national concern .
Instead , the June Movement proposes a halt to European tax and expenditure .
For 25 years , I have tried to obtain detailed information about how the EU uses the money we pay in quotas .
We have still not seen statements of account from the secret accounts in the Eurostat scandal .
This state of affairs does not provide the necessary permission for sending funds via Brussels .
The subsidies to the present EU agricultural systems can be phased out by 20 % per year over five years .
The poor countries and the new Member States should be exempted from paying quotas so that there is real solidarity and not only a redistribution from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poorer countries .
With such a reform , the net payers will get away with paying less tax , at the same time as the net recipients will be in a significantly better position than at present .
At the same time , allow details of each appropriation and item of expenditure to be accessible on the Internet .
Finally ,
