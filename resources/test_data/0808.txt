must continue to prioritise support for the regions lagging the furthest behind in development terms , for future Member States but also for current EU Member States .
Ladies and gentlemen , whatever the level of expenditure in relation to the increase in disparities , I think it safe to say that any cohesion policy will be credible only insofar as it is supported by adequate funding .
I formed my own assessment in the same spirit and on the same bases as yourself .
My whole team in the Directorate-General is going to participate in presenting the results of the assessment of this snapshot and open the debate over the next two years , in an extremely transparent and open manner .
The first option is to continue to apply the strict threshold of 75 % of Community GDP which is the current threshold below which regions are eligible for Objective 1 status , and therefore a greater concentration of appropriations .
The Voivodships in Poland have only been in existence for two years .
I should also like to say , in answer to your specific question with regard to specific regions , Extremadura , southern Italy or the LÃ¤nder of eastern Germany , that it will depend on the level of income achieved by around 2005-2006 .
So , discussing the money involved at this stage would be a poor way of opening the discussion .
We might continue to discuss possibilities , Mrs Darras , but I should like to point out that we are not too far off the real situation when we work on the basis of the standard of living , of per capita GDP , because it can be observed that where there is the lowest standard of living there is also the highest rate of unemployment , the worst environmental conditions , and the lowest levels of Internet access .
This is why , a few weeks ago , the Commission published an important report on adjustments or exceptions in the field of structural aid , and aid for agriculture and fisheries which , overall , have been well received by the authorities in these outermost regions and I think that , pursuant to Article 299 of the Treaty , we must continue to have a special policy for these outermost regions precisely because they are our outermost regions and , as such , our most remote active frontiers in the Indian Ocean , the Atlantic or near the American continent .
There are many areas of conflict , which are liable to jeopardise the entire Barcelona Process .
We also need to lay down policies on temporary migration , similar to what the International Labour Organisation is currently proposing , without entitlement to permanent residence .
I think the Commission should take this situation into account .
Mr President , although the Barcelona Process raised hopes and expectations , today we must register disappointment .
To sum up , in order to create an area of peace in the Middle East , the European Union needs to take much more direct and resolute action .
Even today , we believe that it is the duty of the southern European nations , or rather the northern Mediterranean nations , to work together with the southern Mediterranean countries , firstly , the three Maghreb countries , Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia , to create this area of solidarity , which is a part of our history and geography and that is , moreover , of importance to us in the century that is just beginning .
Commissioner , last November , you yourself said in the French press that the objective of the Barcelona Process was both simple and ambitious , i .e . an area at peace , enjoying shared prosperity , promoting the emergence of civil society while respecting human rights and ensuring the mutual understanding of different civilisations .
Commissioner , our relationship with the South needs the input of more than just words and political symbols .
The problems of modern times are most serious within towns and large cities .
It is the same question that I asked you in the previous debate , Mr Solana , when you could not find the time to give an answer .
We know that our aid is vitally necessary for the Palestinians whose economic situation is desperate , but we would like to export much more than just euros .
The world community , particularly the European Union , would not allow the fair balance to be upset , putting either party at an advantage or at a disadvantage .
This plan provides direct support to the murderers , by which I mean the paramilitary groups , that have already killed over 150 people since the start of the year and whose close links with the army are obvious .
We should be cautious , as this liberalisation of the transport of goods will have an adverse effect on both local planning and social cohesion , particularly if the service provision no longer has any respect for the concept of a comprehensive rail network and the idea of providing a service for the population as a whole .
Although we welcome the decision made at the France-Italy Summit to build a new railway between Lyons and Turin , the European Union should be far bolder in its infrastructure plans .
Mr President , Commissioner , speaking on behalf of the Greens at the time of the parliamentary resolution on the BSE crisis , I told you that the European countries which claimed to have no cases of mad-cow disease were the countries that were not looking for it .
After beating your breast about the BSE crisis today , Commissioner , do not now go on to promote genetically modified organisms .
This systematic destruction also disposes of healthy carriers of the disease .
