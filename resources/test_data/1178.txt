It is most important both to me personally and to my group that the need for lifelong learning has been highlighted , thereby ensuring that doctors , who are the focus of this directive , have a high standard of future-orientated professional qualifications .
Individual job descriptions , training courses and pre-requisites vary enormously within the EU.
Mr President , Mr Duisenberg , ladies and gentlemen , the 1999 report before us from the ECB is both the first ECB report for a full year and also the first report since the introduction of the euro .
For example , as I see it , we cannot accept an inflation rate of over 3.3 % simply because it makes it easier to achieve secondary objectives such as economic growth and employment policy .
I myself come from the world of information and communications technology .
What caused this initial drop in the exchange rate ?
This is not just a question of improving communication , it is also a matter of providing clearer explanations .
Or could it be - and I would like an answer to this - that the European Central Bank is opposed to growth rates of over 3 % because it thinks they could jeopardise its stability policy ?
I hope that it will at last be possible to have a serious and essential debate with you about this trend and about instruments capable of influencing it , such as the Tobin Tax .
The argument that the euro ' s weakness is also a consequence of Euroland ' s enormous bureaucracy , which - in the words of acknowledged experts - has a Socialist tendency and limits individuals ' freedoms , was rejected by a majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for clearly ideological reasons .
According to opinion polls , not enough companies or private individuals are using the euro , and awareness of it is still too low . 30 % of companies do not yet see any need to make preparations well in advance and in some cases even think that they do not need to complete the changeover until 2002 .
We need to increase the involvement of elected representatives , by which I mean not just Members of the European Parliament , but also all representatives elected by the public from municipal level to European level .
This working group was specifically referred to in the budgetary remarks , and that is how it should stay - and that comment is particularly for the ears of the Commission !
This means that the European single currency is already leading to greater competition in this area , and that in turn this competition is leading to the public getting goods and services on more favourable terms .
The euro must become part of education across the board .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this highly informative report .
My Group called for this framework agreement , and it is very much committed to it .
Firstly , the issue of openness and transparency as regards documents and information is extremely important for my Group .
I have therefore rejected the solution opted for in Article 6( 4 ) of the common position .
Until it has been proved that all phthalates are harmless , there is no place for plasticisers in toys for children under three .
I therefore totally fail to comprehend the whole lobbying campaign being mounted by the chemical industry .
All phthalates should be banned from plastic toys , not just six .
The content of all the measures approved is to be modified so that proof of meat ' s origin is valid as a guarantee in order to apply environmental control procedures and if necessary impose sanctions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , may I remind you that we have been talking about beef labelling since 1997 .
One thing is certain : I do not intend to be held hostage by the Council .
We want a workable system , and we have always said that .
I therefore support the adoption of Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 .
Where was the animal born ?
I would therefore first of all like to sincerely thank the rapporteur and everyone who cooperated with him for the excellent and rapid progress that has been made with this .
It was only possible to achieve all these joint solutions between the Council and Parliament because the Member States agreed that no more national beef labelling schemes would apply after 2002 .
What we are talking about here is really industrial processing of minced beef to make burgers and similar products , and nowadays that is a continuous industrial process .
Categories have already been compulsory in the Community for 20 years as far as whole carcasses are concerned .
That can surely not be in Europe ' s interest .
You see , it can work !
All we shall achieve by adopting them is to make businesses quit the system .
My Group also attaches particular importance to the participation of employees and their representatives .
Mr President , I believe that tomorrow 's vote will truly be a litmus test of whether we regard EMAS as an instrument of ecological progress or as a mere sham .
It therefore stands to reason that we are particularly supportive of the proposal for a limit value of five micrograms per cubic metre of air .
We consider it far more important - as you yourself said , Mrs Breyer - that , after a delay of half a year , this instrument should now enter into force as quickly as possible , so that it can play its part in improving the quality of the air we breathe in Europe .
In the Alpine regions , for
