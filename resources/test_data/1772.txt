We adopted a declaration , the Brussels Declaration , which had our full support , and I believe we should take the lead in the implementation of the measures it called for .
I hope that this can carry on and to this end I hope that the Convention will grant Parliament and the Council co-decision powers , as the Commissioner requested , in the field of justice , freedom and security , because the citizens must be secure in this area , and that the Commission will have its right to initiative returned so that progress can be made logically and coherently .
Last year the Spanish Government proposed the banning of several social organisations - media and cultural associations - that had denounced the political repression suffered by Basque dissidents .
Mr President , I am not going to waste a single second - which is what he wants - so that I can defend what we have to defend : freedom , democracy and the area of freedom , security and justice .
Furthermore , we must not forget this Parliament 's constant appeals in favour of protection and support for the victims of terrorism .
I must say to him that the Member States have already presented the plans of the rural development Regulation , which was approved in 2000 , but which has not been able to take account of fire prevention plans .
I believe that considerable efforts have been made , both by the Council and by this Parliament , to reach to a compromise agreement , with compromise measures which ended in 2006 .
It appears that it has not been possible for the Commission to reach this agreement .
I also believe that it would most advisable for the time periods to last one year , and that there be a pilot period , which needs to take account of the frequent interactions of the experts .
When we talk about forests we are talking about one of the most important ecosystems on Earth given their wealth and importance for the international community , since they offer both productive and protective services .
We will therefore support Mrs Redondo 's report , and we ask the Commission to be sensitive to her amendments , and also , the great majority of the speeches of those of us who are trying to support the report by Mrs Redondo .
I would ask , 'where ?' , Commissioner .
It will not be possible to increase the amount proposed without reducing other policies in the same heading , because the financial ceiling has already been reached .
I believe we must be coherent with what we approve on this new regulation and we must use it , because that is what differentiates us from a secondary school assembly .
That conference represented great progress , by correcting the political view of population which traditionally focussed on demographic objectives , and since then it has focussed on women 's rights .
That commitment - made many years ago by the international community - must be reinforced at this time when we are faced with a cut in the funds allocated to sexual and reproductive health by certain governments which take a false and hypocritically moral approach to life .
The illnesses and consequences which women in the poor countries suffer principally originate from their reproductive role .
It is a question of prioritising the right to life , particularly the lives of the most vulnerable beings , because this right is more important than any other and is the basis and the principle on which all other rights stand .
For those whose political doctrine consists of a social market economy , this involvement by all social elements seems to us to be significant .
I will therefore vote in favour of this excellent report , on which I congratulate Mr Harbour once again , and I would also like to thank him for his kind words for Mrs Palacio , not the Commissioner , but her sister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs , who has cooperated so fully in the work to implement the internal market .
Every Member will express his or her opinion in this Chamber on how risks are to be prevented and reduced .
In my own country - and I heard the Commissioner say that he is now ready to approve this option - a pilot programme is to be carried out in one autonomous region , specifically Andalusia , involving chronically ill people who have completed re-integration programmes and entailing controlled doses of heroine being administered professionally only to those drug addicts who have shown that they are unable to give up the drug .
This gave rise to the STOA report , according to which there was apparently no evidence of a relationship between silicone implants and , for example , cancer .
Mr President , I am intervening to ask the House 's services to arrange for an error that has occurred to be rectified and for the term 'woodland ecosystems' , used in one of the approved amendments , to be replaced by the term 'woodland ' . I would ask for this change to be made , noted and taken into account .
Today , the country is undergoing a political , economic and social crisis that has produced many victims , as did similar crises this weekend in Colombia and , in the past , in Bolivia .
This is a Venezuela that , in the past year , has experienced two completely new events in its domestic life that , in institutional , political , economic and social terms , have changed the ways in which the country can be governed .
I should also like , however , to see support for the amendment tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro , asking
