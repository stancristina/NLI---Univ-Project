The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is always particularly concerned about minority rights , which is why we are greatly worried by the unrest within the Roma group in Slovakia .
Instead of hindering freedom of movement , we should welcome the fact that it embraces more and more people .     We are very keen that the directive on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States come into force as soon as possible .
The transitional rules are being introduced on the grounds that there is a risk that the present Member States’ benefit systems will be misused when the borders are opened to the new EU citizens this spring .
At the present time , it is sufficient for people to be employed for ten hours a week in order to gain access to their new country ’s welfare system .
This already applies to pensioners and students .
The reason for this is that we consider that issues of culture and education should be dealt with at national level where the decisions are taken as close to the citizens as possible .
These issues must be considered at a level that is closer to the citizens .     We chose to vote against all proposed amendments to the Commission proposal and against the report as a whole .
We therefore support the Commission proposal .
For us , these are important principles that must be taken into consideration in the Union’s agricultural policy , particularly in relation to cotton and tobacco .     We Moderates are of the opinion that direct support for the production of tobacco , olives , cotton and hops should be phased out .
The Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats sees increased subsidies as a problem of principle and , where tobacco is concerned , there are strong ethical arguments against the aid .
We consider the Commission proposal to be a step toward reaching the goals relating to the Union’s agricultural policy .
The aim of the EU’s agricultural policy is to grant farmers greater freedom to produce what the market demands , which would lead to production being adapted to the consumer .
The Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats sees increased subsidies as a problem of principle .
This may be commendable , but is often a way to protect against outside competition , in other words it is a hidden trade barrier that renders free trade difficult .     We Swedish Moderates agree with the demand that the Guantánamo prisoners be accorded a fair trial , and we have therefore voted in favour of the tabled report .
As members of the EU they will , just like the rest of us , gain full freedom of movement to promote increased solidarity and strength throughout the whole Union .
In different ways during my work with enlargement , I have met many ambitious , hard-working people .
This freedom of movement would mean a necessary injection into our slightly stagnated labour markets .
We need , of course , to ensure that the new Member States have organisations that provide support and control and that they can tighten up food standards and the monitoring of animal and plant health .
Romania has been in a more difficult situation and has further to go in order to catch up but , even this morning , we have received reports that things are happening , and of course we must recognise this and approve of it .
The candidate countries have their responsibility , but the existing Member States must also take responsibility .
Having tried to follow the developments in Central and Eastern Europe for almost 40 years , I feel sincere joy at being able to welcome these countries both on 1 May 2004 and during 2007 .     – Mr President , the European Parliament agrees totally with the political assessment of the Commission and of the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement , Günter Verheugen , that a failure to reach agreement on Cyprus could pose a serious obstacle to Turkey’s ambitions to become a member of the European Union .
First , we must ensure a good environment to live in and , second , we must ensure that there is employment , particularly for our young people in the future .
This must also take place in the peripheral northern areas where we have close trade relations with Russia , for example .
The Haparandabanan line is a missing linkIt is a mature project that involves the upgrading and new construction of railways on the Swedish side in order to raise the standard , and a rational track gauge shifting facility at the national border in Haparanda - Torneå .
The section of the project relating to track gauge shifting facilities will provide experiences that can be drawn on also in other places in the EU that have problems with the linking of railway networks with different track gauges , for example between the Baltic countries and Central Europe and between Russia and the EU.
It is here in rich Western Europe within the EU that they are degraded .
Do you consider that it might be difficult to maintain full freedom of movement bearing in mind the situation that prevails in the Middle East , Israel and Palestine and the terrorist attacks that Israel is subjected to ?
Can you agree with the political assessment that it might be difficult for Israel to maintain freedom of movement bearing in mind the fact that the country also has a right to protect itself against terrorist attacks ?     Mr President , Commissioner , so here we are again , and I
