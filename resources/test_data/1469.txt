We must also bear in mind that those who are committed to construction will find it hard to support destruction .
I cannot leave out the chairman of the PSE , Mr Barón Crespo , who is predicting victory for the Spanish Socialist party in the Spanish elections of 14 March , with the consequent change in position of that country ’s government .
The Council and the Commission must adopt practical measures , which are clearly indicated in the report , in various areas of the AFSJ.
This has led to repressive measures being implemented , specifically in conjunction with the US , which undermines freedoms and fundamental rights and guarantees and which the motion neither criticises nor condemns .
The report is obsessed with ensuring compliance with the rules of the capitalist ‘internal market ’ and signals its approval of applying ‘safeguard clauses’ , which are tools for blackmailing and pressurising these countries .
I shall therefore vote in favour .
This report ‘on Bulgaria’s progress towards accession ’ describes the underlying economic and political aims of the current enlargement of the EU.
The Commission recommended , however , that Bulgaria should not be part of the first wave of enlargement .
These efforts have now been acknowledged , and the rapporteur calls on the EU to strengthen its support , with the aim of preparing for accession at the earliest opportunity .
The aim of which , as the report explains , is to generate business that is attractive to direct foreign investment , in other words , to place the strategic sectors of Romania’s economy under the control of the large corporations from EU countries .
I acknowledge , however , that important steps have been taken in order to achieve accession – most importantly the Constitution was amended last autumn .
Media freedom is not safeguarded .
It is equally important that we succeed in developing competitiveness , with a view to increasing growth and jobs .
I am therefore in favour of the Miller report .     .
A network of European reference centres for diseases must be created , in which a particular concentration of resources and specialist knowledge is required , with a view to improving the use of current EU capacity .
All Member States must therefore cooperate more closely and in a more structured manner , including those acceding in May , in order to define best practice in the sector .     .
There must be a balanced geographical spread of suitable facilities for health care and long-term health care between urban and rural areas , and Structural Funds must be used to create infrastructure to provide health care and long-term care .
All of this was carried out by the captains of industry and by sectors connected with the oligarchy that has exploited the Venezuelan people over recent decades , and which was actively and brazenly encouraged and supported by the US administration .
The maturity with which Spanish society has behaved , as in other communities afflicted by appalling man-made disasters , confirms Spain as a country that is rooted , both civically and democratically , in Europe .
We must make the point time and time again that Cuba must respect human rights and that the tyranny of the Cuban regime is outmoded and out of step .
Indeed , we received a most welcome contribution from the Article 29 Group , containing the nineteen essential items of information that strike me as sufficient to protect passenger security .
It should be noted that this scandal is only the latest in a long line of scandals .
This is one of many , such as the scandal of the holding group set up by the Naples Camorra – involving large dairy companies from France , Belgium and Germany – to adulterate butter with beef tallow and oils .
These are the important questions that require answers .     Mr President , in this debate , four key issues must be raised .
Other areas , such as vocational training and social security , are covered by other directives , although we must look again at these areas in order to improve the content and to eliminate discrimination based on sex in all areas , particularly in occupational social security schemes .
It is unacceptable that insurance companies include gender as a factor in risk calculations or that banks discriminate against women when granting credit .
Despite this limitation , they very clearly express Parliament’s position on the need for the agreements to go beyond what is known as ‘political dialogue and cooperation ’ and become genuine association agreements .
The ACP countries are attempting to prevent this in the economic partnership agreements and , amongst other issues , to prevent various forms of liberalisation being imposed in areas for which they are attempting to find solutions that are best suited to their national situations , specific characteristics and processes .
With this proposal , the Commission has proposed three measures : to provide a legal basis for relations between the Community and the United States in the field of air transport , to create a legal framework for ongoing negotiations and for all other agreements and to ensure an appropriate division of competences between the Community and the Member States .
