However , it cannot and must not replace the extension and reinforcement of independent mechanisms in the Member States .
Practice over recent years confirms that the fight against 'terrorism ' is designed to stifle and direct the grassroots movement , the class , trade-union movement .
These personal data may be kept for an indeterminate period of time by decision of the prosecuting authorities and will be accessible , in addition to the police and judicial authorities , to the secret services , Europol and Eurojust , who will have the right to pass them to third countries or organisations ( such as the CIA and so forth ) .
The EU 's ambitions to encircle and exert pressure on Russia , with one eye firmly on the Russian market , especially the energy market , within the framework of the vying and infighting between the imperialists are hiding behind self-righteous pronouncements about respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and condemnation of the independence movements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The statements by the Council and the Commission and the European Parliament resolution are a blatant and unprovoked attack on Syria , from which they want a statement of apology for its policy and its subjugation to imperialism .
We voted against the report in an expression of solidarity with the peoples of Syria and the Middle East which the American and European imperialists have in their sights .
They are the basic route by which European capital can appropriate public infrastructures and services and circumvent the obstacles and problems which it encounters .
The basic point is not how public procurement rules will apply and how franchise contracts will be configured .
Using the case law of the Court , the Commission is proceeding to overturn even these defective and limited rules of protection acquired by the workers and to abolish all controls on posted workers by the host state , thereby undermining the Collective Work Agreements and the social rights of workers in general .
Mr President , the main objective of the proposed directive is to achieve a good marine environmental status .
This strategy is more urgent today than at any other time , because the marine ecosystem has deteriorated significantly .
The money budgeted for this action is very , very little .
Secondly , we need coordinated actions .
In other words , we must agree on common measurements .
Maritime pollution , climate change , shipping and coastal developments continue to threaten the marine environment and to have an adverse impact on human health .
Furthermore , actions by the Member States must be based on the principle of prevention , on an approach based on the ecosystem while , at the same time , account must be taken of accurate evaluations carried out on the basis of current European legislation , as referred to in Amendments 23 , 49 , 45 , 51 and 60 .
On the other hand , however , it is worth our emphasising that the Commission proposal tries to improve the outcome of this highhandedness on the part of the European Council towards both the institutions and the Treaty itself .
Secondly , in order to give the Commission the time needed to present an integrated proposal which responds to the real needs and the real rural development support mechanisms , without renationalising the CAP.
You will find my group in agreement with such a policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , the SESAR is a very good idea , but you will , however , need to tell us directly something that not even you know : what will its scope be ?
A few months ago a Turkish military aeroplane shot down a Greek military aeroplane southwest of Rhodes in European airspace , while a passenger aeroplane from Egypt was flying overhead within eye contact .
Fine , we shall succeed in the air , but what is happening on the ground when , for various bottles , perfumes and so on , we delay another half an hour so that someone does not take an extra gramme of deodorant .
The proposal for a regulation makes provision for certain safety procedures because there is a clear danger of disrupting the natural biodiversity in an area once non-indigenous species have been introduced and released .
On the other hand , the facility to import such organisms and the possible economic benefits which will accrue can be counterbalanced by fishing and/or cultivating them in countries where they constitute natural populations - in other words , with no danger to natural ecosystems .
This would also allow these countries to develop , for the benefit of their peoples too , in direct disproportion to any economic results there would be in the Member States of the EU.
Transferring 20 % of resources from the first pillar , in other words direct payments , to the second pillar , which is basically reaped by businesses and large holdings , means a reduction in income support for small and medium-sized holdings .
This sort of modus operandi has been used in the past .
Today 's proposal will be yet another blow to the cumulative and major problems of farmers , which is why we reject it .
We need to start the application of programmes promptly , so that the appropriations are taken up and , more importantly , European taxpayers ' money is used for the benefit of social and economic cohesion .
Within the framework of the purely legislative initiative , there is the question of the Solidarity Fund ; in other words , the fund which covers problems which arise from natural and technological disasters .
We need together to convince the Council which , for some reason - perhaps because the Ministers of Finance , who are competent , do not want to give any more
