So far as the September communication is concerned , it is unprecedented .
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands .
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision .
That is a sensible forecast to make , it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain .
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control .
I would emphasise , too , that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise " - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means .
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations , both in the public sector and in the private sector , in the last decade or so .
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks .
Financial control will be absolutely secured , both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes , and because we will introduce a completely professional , independent internal audit service .
As I said earlier , our ambition is total security for money and value for money .
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us .
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that .
I am also grateful , at the risk of being repetitive , to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which , if she will allow me to say so , she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating .
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage .
First of all , I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly , but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control .
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation .
However , because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control , and audit under the present terms , it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role , no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it .
So , the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all .
Coherence , consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures .
One is to ensure high quality training , another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system , another is the establishment of a central financial service , as honourable Members will see from the White Paper , to ensure that those standards are set and supervised , and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service .
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper , there are very strong assurances .
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control , and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General .
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control , the ex ante system can be used .
Naturally , there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage .
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system , it most certainly can be used .
Lastly on transition , I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called " soft law " .
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law "
