Lastly , with regard to OLAF , it is crucially important to guarantee its full operational independence , the full cooperation of the Member States and an appropriate human resources strategy , which it most definitely needs .
There is talk of over 500 deaths in the past three months .
We therefore agree that the various ethnic groups in Nigeria find in their different religious faiths the ideal pretext for perpetrating acts of mass violence against one another .
Each square metre of our territory has to be cared for to preserve the soil and retain water so as to prevent erosion and to supply the aquifers , including through direct reinjection of surface waters .
From this perspective , I have endorsed the idea of voting against paragraph 5 , introduced by an amendment of mine tabled in committee , to emphasise that the appointment of the 18 new Members will have to comply as far as possible with the provisions of the 1976 Electoral Act , which requires that Members be elected directly by the European citizens .
In order to assess the impact of the measures discussed , we need to analyse the statistics quoted by the Commission .
In this way , we can encourage users to opt , in the long term , for cleaner vehicles or modes of transport , to use less congested infrastructure or to travel at different times .
They discourage individual initiatives in favour of competition among dealers and repairers and encourage the development of the sector .
The European Commission has calculated that ICT-based systems can cut energy consumption in buildings - currently put at some 40 % of overall energy consumption in Europe - by up to 17 % , and transport carbon emissions by up to 27 % .
It is therefore a good idea to harmonise the methods for measuring and quantifying energy performance so as to have data that enable us to develop innovative energy-saving strategies and to prevent the phenomenon of 'green disinformation ' .
Although the draft White Paper is at present only an initial framework of reference , I believe that it certainly makes a significant contribution , especially where the management of emergencies is concerned .
The instruments that currently exist , such as the JESSICA Fund , are one of the few financial engineering instruments that a region or municipality can use to finance urban development projects .
Furthermore , the Bank has developed new risk-sharing financial instruments , simplified lending procedures and accelerated the implementation of projects in the Member States and in the sectors that are most severely affected by the crisis .
In fact , women are too often forced to sacrifice their own career ambitions for the sake of taking on a role and a workload arising out of the absurd presumption of dedication to their families .
The aim of the new regulation is therefore to allow manufacturers , users and consumers quicker access to innovative products containing new fibres ; a subject close to the hearts of European consumers , sector enterprises - including both textile and clothing businesses - and also national administrations .
I would like firstly to thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for approving the report on 8 April .
The amendments proposed in this area relate to the proposal tabled in 2005 by the Commission , concerning the origin marking of many important product categories , including textile products .
Regarding Amendment 63 , which aims to remove toys from the list of products excluded from the obligation of labelling , I would like to remind you that the key issue as far as toys are concerned is safety .
I would particularly like to bring your attention to standards relating to the indication of origin .
Despite our different political outlooks , we have managed to find real common ground that we hope represents the best way of protecting the interests of European citizens and of the European Union itself .
Today , the situation we find ourselves in is shrouded in some confusion , because the origin marking is shown on some products because it suits the manufacturer , yet in other cases , it is not included because it does not suit the manufacturer ; in other cases , it is included but under the regulations of other countries , because the products are also exported to the United States and to Japan and so they are made with these markets also in mind .
Defending the textile sector means defending thousands and thousands of jobs and , at the same time , defending citizens ' rights .
In my opinion , in allowing the harmonisation and standardisation of aspects of textile-product labelling , the report under discussion both facilitates the free movement of these products in the internal market and ensures a high and uniform level of protection for consumers within the European Union .
This office will be responsible for providing specialised assistance .
It will be the job of the European Parliament to appoint its executive director , implementing principles of transparency and democratic control .
Energy efficiency means not only saving energy , but also reducing CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions .
By voting in favour of this report , Europe has taken a step towards reaching a common policy on asylum .
The setting up of such a fund must serve two purposes : it must support refugees who arrive in our countries , often on our coastlines , seeking help , and also those States that receive the greatest numbers of these desperate people due to their geographical location .
For this reason , I join Mr Coelho in emphasising the need for the Commission to implement the new second generation SIS system as soon as possible .
