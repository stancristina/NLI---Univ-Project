Here too there is at least some progress .
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it , in other words , unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council .
That is a more reasonable system .
That , too , is a step forward .
But on our other two criticisms , we are less satisfied .
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored , scrutinised , controlled if you like , only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament .
The legislative authority , Council and Parliament , should be equal .
We confer implementing powers on the Commission , but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure .
Parliament has no equivalent power .
True , we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system .
We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee .
We will have the chance to scrutinise , to debate , to question .
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation .
In other words , we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content .
And in a democracy , Parliament should be able to challenge the content .
Not that we do so every week .
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions , but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary .
That is lacking in this new system , or at least is only there in embryonic form .
Finally , our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back , not to both branches of the legislative authority , but to the Council alone , which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure .
That is not correct .
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission .
If such implementing measures are referred back , it should be to both branches , not to one branch alone .
Overall we have a system which has made some progress .
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome , but that could not change the basic decision of the Council .
Even here , we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise .
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that .
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision .
We must be very vigilant .
So it is a step forward .
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward .
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni .
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years ' time .
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject .
Mr President , our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers , which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today .
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure , safer , higher returns .
Despite their image of danger , derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance .
A contract that , for example , pays a substantial sum if , say , the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls , causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises .
Is this speculative ?
Not at all .
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident : they have good management , good prospects and they are good investments .
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse , as it did in 1987 .
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash , but that would be to waste your research into the winners .
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall .
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls .
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper , perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index , you would still have the portfolio and the shares , but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse .
In exchange , you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets .
In this case , which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers , you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk .
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund .
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation .
Heavy-handedness - a
