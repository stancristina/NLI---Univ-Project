As the Commission line is broadly acceptable , Parliament should support it without watering down the issue to any greater extent .
PAHs are everywhere and they occur as multicomponent blends .
Accordingly , we should agree common testing procedures in order to bring emissions under control swiftly .
For a long time now development and testing work has been conducted on tyres , and , indeed , the first tyres containing a safer oil are already on the market .
Traffic emissions are one of the commonest and worst spreaders of PAHs into the air we breathe .
This PAH is the best-known and worst carcinogenic substance .
Accordingly , it is an urgent matter to establish a new one .
That is why Parliament’s conclusions are clear and sound .
The summit discussions were dominated by the quarrel between Great Britain and France over Britain’s rebate and the EU’s agricultural policy .
Perhaps the only solution to the argument is to be found in the joint financing of agricultural subsidies , which Parliament is hinting at .
Without one , we could of course draw up an annual budget on the basis of Article 272 of the Treaty , but it will not guarantee sustained and balanced development of the different policy areas .
The new legislative plans for these areas are now being debated in Parliament , but it is difficult to make the final decisions when one does not know how much will be available in the form of appropriations .
The situation mow seems quite wretched .
The funding would already have been halved in the proposals for a compromise , and now we do not have any finance policies at all .
When financing for the present programming period was decided at the Agenda 2000 talks in Berlin , just six months before that period began , the outcome was that structural policy should be put on hold for nearly three years .
The next country to hold the presidency , Great Britain , cannot expect to while away the time doing nothing : we expect it to come up with proposals and solutions .     Mr President , the European crisis that has resulted from two referenda is a clear indication that the political elite is not in touch with the people .
The mood now is that a referendum can be organised on any issue at all , and the answer will always be no .
The same leaders , who in speeches complain that the Lisbon strategy is very much late in coming , allow a situation where not even the decisions agreed in one country are implemented in their own .
Instead , Brussels is blamed for the problems and setbacks .
National governments and parliaments should have the courage to make the necessary decisions .
The first point is that we should not blame Luxembourg ; quite the contrary : it did an excellent job with the presidency and showed what small countries can do while running presidencies in general .
I am sick and tired of listening to everyone blaming everyone , coming up with scapegoats .
Quite the contrary : the best thing that has happened to us in the past ten years are the last two rounds of enlargement .
We must avoid protectionism and we must avoid nationalism .
It is clear that France and Germany are no longer the engine of Europe .
If Tony Blair is the person , he needs to do two things .
If he can do this he can grab the leadership vacuum , but unfortunately what we have seen and heard from Tony Blair when he has tried to get into the heart of Europe in the past is something that can be called ‘NATO’ : ‘no action , talk only’ .     .
The new information and communication technologies can help promote European democracy , skills and expertise , and competitiveness .
The Union’s legislation must , however , ensure that this is actually the case .
Mobile communications are not affected by restrictions such as prime time viewing or viewing times that are too short .
That way we would bring about an increase in much needed , distinctive and versatile software .
That is a problem we all have in common .
Europe’s prospects for economic success are bound to structural reforms ; many of our colleagues have mentioned this .
In an economic climate characterised by unsatisfactory budget deficits and widespread unemployment , several points deserve special emphasis .
The new framework for the future of the SGP has now been adopted ; it has some good as well as some bad new rules .
Second , we can harness the energy of European competition by adopting and implementing the Services Directive as soon as possible .
Third , the reforms undertaken by national central banks to adapt their structures to the new institutional framework are paramount to reversing our current downward trend .
Lastly , I congratulate the ECB on its sound decision to support ratification of the Constitution .
The choice to integrate under a constitution can only lead to a stronger political union .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to say a sincere thank you to all of you who have been involved in preparing this parliamentary report .
They will provide an encouraging opportunity simultaneously to strengthen European growth , competitiveness and employment prospects , and to improve environmental protection .
There is a growing global market for ecotechnology .
The Commission ’s communication on an environmental technologies action plan is an attempt to show the direction in which the EU and its Member States should be moving for new insights and feasible ideas to come into being , and it will also show how we might create impartial and competitive market prospects for eco-efficient
