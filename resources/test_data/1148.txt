Mr President , I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs ' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece .
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements , which we must solve .
There is , of course , the question of pre-accession aid , and this belongs in category seven .
Last year , Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four , and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe , as they , in fact , should be , according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit .
This is the crux of the matter .
With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report ( EUR 130 million ) , I also want to say , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money .
( DA ) Mr President , I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999 .
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role , especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development .
In order to be able to develop , the countries concerned must , however , become actively involved in the global economic system .
With regard to trade with our partners in development , the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries ' special economic and social limitations .
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with .
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is , in actual fact , of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned .
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lom√© Convention , I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament ' s Committee on Development and Cooperation , namely , that the door is open .
Once they have done so , we shall adopt a position on the matter .
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba , as outlined in the EU' s common position , but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex .
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget , I can say that this is being considered .
Concerning Article 366A , I can say that , during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement , a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed .
It is now the case , following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty , that Parliament wishes , on the basis of Article 300 , to be kept fully informed of all decisions , and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament ' s decisions on this subject .
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions .
Finally , I would refer to the South Africa agreement , which the rapporteur also touched upon .
So the " Grappa War " is over .
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has , on the whole , been quite positive , and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question .
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker .
Criminal law is part of each individual nation ' s own cultural tradition , and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts .
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this , and with good reason , because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction .
In that context , I want to ask the following question of the Commission ' s and the Council ' s representatives : is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate ?
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States ' obligations are laid down in detail .
In my view , this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis .
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work , which has been carried out under difficult conditions .
There are two reasons why we are saying no .
This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support .
The other main reason , however , is that , even though we are concerned here with a Convention ( and therefore with international cooperation ) , there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal .
And the trend is towards creating , in the longer term , a common European area of jurisdiction , common EU criminal law and common EU administration of
