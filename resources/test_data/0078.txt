as ever when judging the results of the Commission it is a case of pluses and minuses .
I think the result is best summarised by a colleague of mine who said : it is less than we hope for , but more than we expected .
The most important issue seems to me the much welcomed presidency and the result they have delivered in looking forwards to the follow up .
I would like to ask the Prime Minister if I may interpret the text to mean that the Netherlands is allowed to see where the ground lies , in other words is be able to start the experiments .
The results are extremely important .
A key role in an historic summit in Luxembourg , a fine employment summit ; good work has simply been done by Luxembourg , and I think this ought to be mentioned .
Then there is the issue of the European central bank .
You will not hear me say that the Commission has not done anything .
I said a short while ago that if there are unpleasant words in the resolution , Mr Oreja , you should not take it personally .
The Commission removed it after the first reading .
But you cannot let the rapporteur begin , send for the Commissioner , make sure all speakers are present and then after the introduction say that the debate is now suspended and will resume tonight at 9 p.m.
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , colleagues , although not everyone in my group agrees with me , I am a strong advocate of a strict anti-tobacco policy and I fully support Mr Valverde LÃ³pez 's report .
The price increase soon turns out be an extremely efficient tool for reducing consumption .
I only hope that a proposal will not be too long in coming .
In Australia , for example , sport and cultural events are funded by a special levy on tobacco products .
The fact that tobacco is not a foodstuff , but a stimulant , cannot ...
But in this case it is not possible .
We started it as far back as in 1991 .
That is why I fully agree with colleague Pimenta .
Unfortunately , Turkey did not do so either .
I have to get it off my chest that I think the continuation of agricultural subsidies for tobacco growing is an absurd kink in Community policy .
Paragraphs 17 and 34 assume in advance that a higher tax on rolling tobacco is justified .
This is because it is partly due to the perseverance of this Commissioner that the European Union has been able to play a leading role in the Conference in Kyoto .
The Commissioner herself pointed to this .
Burden sharing between countries in Europe has to be looked at again .
The EU environment ministers were relieved with the result which was achieved .
It is a major plus that even countries like the United States and Japan have now agreed to the reductions .
Secondly , to work towards a global awareness that things cannot go on as they are .
A great deal of questions still need to be answered .
Finally , Madam Commissioner , I would like to support the plea that we in the Union should keep to this reduction of 15 % , whatever the commitment of the other parties may be .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , as you know , at the beginning of this month an important step was made towards a global ban of anti-personnel mines .
We all know this , but we need to hang on to the momentum .
This is a big task which requires a great deal of effort , as well as a great deal of money .
Yesterday it was one faction , today it is the other ; who will be the perpetrators or the victims tomorrow ?
What will have to change , or can be changed in a peaceful manner ?
This has to be stated .
This vindicates the alarming report by the organization Human Rights Watch on the situation in Burundi .
But these are few suggestions in which we can merely co-participate .
China , Russia , France ; Belgian firms are active .
It is a good thing that the Council has extended the sanctions against Nigeria by one year .
Amnesty International has informed us that the conditions were degrading , and it is no surprise that this eminent person , someone we had only just got to know of , died .
We ask the European Commission to genuinely step up its measures .
Thankfully , the European Union does give some assistance in those camps , but it now looks like more help is needed .
Mr President , our group , the Liberal Group , hopes that we will be able to give the Croatian government a clear and unanimous sign of disapproval .
Finally , Mr President , the Union must in the meantime devote itself to further development of democracy , free media and non-governmental organizations as part of the Phare democracy programme .
In that sense I regret that the words "politically motivated ' was deleted from the joint resolution shortly put to a vote , as demanded by the Christian Democrats .
Journalists are taken to court .
And I would also like to remind everyone that the European community institutions , including this Parliament , continued to defend the Yugoslav utopia to its dying day , until Germany was the only country the have the courage to chose the side of the Croatian people .
Nor will I approve the resolution , as I refuse to put Croatia on a par with countries like China , North Korea , Nigeria , and so on , who are rightly admonished here .
