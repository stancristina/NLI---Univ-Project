The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds .
This is the purpose of these guidelines .
The first is rural development , and let me say , Mrs Schroedter , that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time .
The Commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document .
Before concluding , I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France , Austria and Germany , in particular , in the last few weeks , and at the same time we shall once again be discussing , together with my fellow Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio , what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France .
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union ' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC .
I should also like to make a few comments , firstly , Mr Berend , regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report .
When there is growth , it must be better distributed , but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness , be they the most remote or island regions , is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades .
Nonetheless , I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond better to these concerns .
You see , ladies and gentlemen , we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union ' s enlargement on our structural policy .
Having better , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded , must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies .
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .
The Internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the American army .
So our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .
The Commission report confirms that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .
Public opinion , although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows , is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution : a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General .
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission .
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised , high-level training of safety advisers , but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training , with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates .
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted .
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .
Paragraph 26 , for example , " Draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union " .
For the period 1999-2006 , the total appropriation for this Objective will be ECU 22.5 billion , a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999 .
In fact , taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade , and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States , the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements , and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion .
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power .
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness .
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid .
In the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission
