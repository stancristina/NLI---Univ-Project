As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated .
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months .
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .
One area though is extremely important , and this House must be involved in it : namely scrutiny .
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised , that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it .
And we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries .
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on .
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime .
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about .
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system , for example .
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this , but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail .
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard ' .
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is .
A scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible .
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so .
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry , Mr Costa , and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed .
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terr√≥n today shows .
I would like to make three brief points .
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament .
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together ; we have been sizing each other up , we have had a few minor spats , but we need to work effectively together .
Let us stop the shadow-boxing .
Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate .
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process .
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area .
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission .
We have established a new Directorate-General , yet it has only 70 people all told .
There is an agreement to double this number , but I understand that , so far , not a single new person has arrived .
We are setting the Commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs .
Finally , on the content of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .
All good things come in threes , especially in our policy area .
Two hundred years ago it was liberty , equality and fraternity , and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others .
Now it is freedom , security and justice , and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security , important as it is , above the equally important needs of freedom and justice .
Thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council .
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog .
However , forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me .
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately .
Will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in February , to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the Council has passed legislation , rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list .
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?
Mr President
