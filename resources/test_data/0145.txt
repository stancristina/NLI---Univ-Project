This potential extension with the passage of time , precisely in order to prevent infringements of the directive based on today 's criteria , is , I believe , one of the directive 's strong points .
I would , however , like to make some comments on what Mr Watson said .
We will insist that the rules of competition must be applied , and we believe we will be successful .
The main aim of the amendments must be to extend and assist the collection and processing of reliable facts and figures , and especially the provision of information both to the institutional bodies and to the Member States for the elaboration of measures and policies .
Besides , we must stress that the policy of broader information dissemination via networks and telematic applications to all the decision-making centres , and to the wider public , will also contribute positively towards the appraisal of solutions and help make people aware of the justification and use of environmentally friendly technologies .
The amendments proposed are , I believe , necessary if the Agency 's valuable work is to continue at European level , especially with the challenges the European Union will be facing when the forthcoming enlargement takes place .
Madam President , I think that notwithstanding the above , this Parliament could pass a resolution which firstly categorically opposes any military intervention in Iraq - regardless of the situation , whether reprehensible , etcetera - and secondly , defends in the same integrated way a political and diplomatic solution .
Madam President , I have asked to speak on a point of order , as follows : yesterday , at exactly this point of the proceedings , I submitted an explanation of vote in writing , specifically on the Blak report .
Madam President , today , with great surprise , I saw in the Minutes that there is no mention of my written statement .
Mr President , the situation and lot of Albania has often been debated in this House , and frequently with some intensity .
In any case , we have all expressed them on the Committee on Foreign Affairs , and we meant it very sincerely .
As for the European Parliament , regardless of any preference we may have for one side or the other , we must continue to support truly democratic procedures in Albania , offering our experience and assistance to the extent that we can , to help that country find its European orientation as soon as possible .
Mr President , I must say that the joint resolution which has been circulated is a text which , I think , will attract wholehearted support from Parliament because it is well balanced and reflects not only common positions but also the common anxiety of us all about what is going on in Albania .
I must say that a very important proposal is the one included among those agreed by the tripartite delegation in which Mrs Pack and Mr Imbeni took part with parliamentarians from the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , that is , the proposal that an advisory group should be formed .
Having lived in that area , I think that if the advisory group is set up it will be able to achieve a great deal on a day to day basis , giving advice about the operation of parliamentary committees , about what issues to put before the plenary Chamber , etcetera .
Those people deserve better luck and wholehearted and devoted support from Europe 's peoples and governments .
The Spartans were not regarded as models for civilization , nor for dialogue and debate .
I was not a Spartan , I am much more an Athenian .
You refer in some way to future plans .
I would therefore like to ask you , to the extent possible during your Presidency , to speed up the use of the means at your disposal , because otherwise I think it will be too late .
I raise the issue as a question .
Now , he tells us most cynically that it is no longer even provided for .
Then why this debate ?
Today it concerns Greece .
I want to state that , Mr President , because I have served in this Chamber for about 20 years and never have I directed personal comments against a colleague and far less against holders of office in the Council or the European Commission .
This year we decided to dedicate Women 's Day to those women who are oppressed by religious fundamentalism .
We spoke at length about these women during the previous part-session .
We must think about the women who have become refugees of the recent wars .
Mr President , I wish to say that the report that is being submitted for approval by the part-session is one that we must support since it is the culmination of long and assiduous research and debate in the Committee on Budgetary Control and , I assume , in the Comment on Budgets .
I wish to say that , in this case , there are grounds for a minority opinion , and this is contained in the explanatory statement of the report .
I will finish with a request and a reminder , which I am constantly repeating : the European Parliament , the Presidency and the political groups must consider and must face the problem of the reorganization of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I do not intend to talk about what was discussed so positively in this report .
I remind you that not long ago , in this Chamber , we voted on a budget in which expenditure on tourism was drastically reduced , despite the attempts of several of us on the Committee
