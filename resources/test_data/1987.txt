Of course , we reached a compromise in Helsinki with Mrs de Palacio 's help .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , without doubt , the European railways need reviving and that is precisely what the legislative package under discussion is attempting to do .
Of course we are on the right track and of course we understand the problems facing certain Member States in directly , or almost directly adopting all the new measures proposed .
Finally , I must in all honesty congratulate our two rapporteurs on their sterling work and ask for their understanding where special , objectively-identified circumstances exist .
( EL ) Mr President , I see from the Minutes that the question and answer exchange during question time with Minister Moscovici has been wrongly recorded .
Apart from the fact that he was curt with us , he gave I think almost all my fellow members more or less one-word replies or claimed that he had replied , although he did indeed reply to the written question which I had submitted .
The same happened to other fellow members who , if they are present here , can confirm this .
I should like the Minutes to record that I submitted two specific questions to Mr Moscovici and that he did not reply .
The European Parliament is the only institution in the Community which is entitled to exercise any , albeit ex-post , control over the European Central Bank and its policy .
The workers paying the price for this seriously negative neo-liberal policy have no confidence in it , nor do they share the European Central Bank 's ambition or the support given to its policy by the European Parliament , the other institutions of the European Union and the governments of the Member States .
Mr President , the first annual report by the European Central Bank gives us a chance to thank the executive board of the European Central Bank for its hard work and to congratulate it on its successful administration in connection with the introduction of the euro .
The rapporteur quite rightly reminds us here that the fluctuations in the euro 's predecessor currencies were far greater than those recorded so far for the euro , so there has been no deterioration there .
We could even forgive it all that , because conservatism and perhaps even a little dogmatism go with the job of central banking .
Economic recovery in Europe has mopped up all our spare productive potential and needs new investments if it is to continue .
According to the agreement between the European Union and Cyprus , the cost of participation in the programme by Cypriot undertakings will be covered in full by the Republic of Cyprus .
However , the equivalent cost for candidate countries in central Europe is covered out of Community funds .
The people of Cyprus are clearly being wronged here .
- ( EL ) I should like to use the vote on the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cyprus on small and medium-sized enterprises to raise the issue of the new provocative action by the Denktash regime in Strovilia , where the occupying forces have advanced their position on the green line in an arbitrary act of aggression just a few days before proximity talks are due to start in Geneva .
The issue has huge implications for the democracy and freedom of communications .
.
New applications and technology cannot be stopped , but nor should they be allowed to develop with no regard for man and his needs , and under no circumstances should they be used to undermine political values and human dignity or to attack basic and inalienable rights such as the sanctity of privacy and personal data .
This perception is not a guarantee for , it is a blatant threat to the future of society and mankind : uncertainty , insecurity , a breach with man 's own needs , categorisation of citizens and workers who will no longer shape their environment but will be shaped by it in order to serve those who define it in the best , fastest and cheapest way possible .
The current protective framework and the proposed standard contractual clauses are inadequate in the extreme , riddled with holes and inefficient .
Mr President , the regulation which we are now examining forms part of a series of interventions designed to rectify the situation inherited from the mad cow crisis and introduce a policy to prevent such situations from arising in the future and restore consumer confidence in beef products .
The product label will give the consumer rudimentary but crucial and useful information on the meat being purchased .
We now have a situation which I shall explain in simplified terms .
The monitoring system has been strengthened .
The question , therefore , is do we wish to insist on amending the current wording of the regulation ?
This may take us into a conciliation procedure , thereby delaying application of the regulation and the European Parliament , let me remind you , is in favour of applying the regulation at the earliest possible date and has blamed and continues to blame the other institutions of the European Union for the intolerable delay .
I should now like to address the matter of the Committee on the Environment , for which I have the honour of acting as rapporteur .
I trust that the wisdom of the House will find the best and safest way of ensuring that this regulation is applied quickly and solve what I hope is a temporary difference of view between the rapporteur and his committee .
In the last two lines I expressed my personal opinion , with a great deal of chagrin , so as not to have to take the floor again as a speaker .
What bothers
