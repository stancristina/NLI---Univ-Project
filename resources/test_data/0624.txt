Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur .
We can also dispute a number of the wordings and examples , but I believe we can probably learn from the work in time for next year 's report .
It is good to look elsewhere , but sometimes it is good to look at one 's own situation .
There is perhaps , however , cause to stand up and ask ourselves whether the end always justifies the means .
Might the repressive means that the democracies are sometimes compelled to use in the fight for democracy and the open society also constitute a threat to the values we are defending ?
An adjacent and current topic that is really only indirectly related to this , namely the debate on torture in the United States , addressed by , for example , The Economist , obviously influences us too here in Europe .
My own country too is criticised in this report .
Allow me in conclusion to emphasise asylum and refugee policy within the European Union .
Opinion forming is important .
These are by way of clarification .
This weakens the basis of democracy .
In tackling these issues from a perspective other than that of this broad spectrum of views , I am amazed that there are no rights to good governance and democratic elections .
The Convention should reflect upon these issues .
Data protection and the right of access to documents are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
The issue clearly needs to be explored further .
Mr President , I want to begin by thanking my colleague , Mrs Swiebel for the sterling work she has done on this report .
It is an important issue that affects what is most basic to a properly functioning EU - mutual trust between the Member States .
I want to make it clear that the Swedish Government had been responding to the criticism for a long time and had instituted an inquiry that was completed last year .
Our young people travel throughout Europe .
Trafficking in human beings , particularly women and children , is a fact in this EU of ours .
It turns the EU into a favourable market for traffickers in human beings throughout the world .
We must make great demands of ourselves in the EU , now that we are making demands of the candidate countries .
Mrs Swiebel would have to search high and low in the UN Charter on Fundamental Rights , the European Convention 's Charter of Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights for a reason why these issues should be included in a report on fundamental rights .
I would also ask Mrs Swiebel why , in addressing so many new subject areas , she makes no mention , for example , of the fact that the Netherlands has legalised prostitution .
Why is no mention made of parents ' right to allow their children to grow up in a drug-free society in which parents know that the law is on their side ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Markov , for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report .
Minimum rules throughout the internal market would also guarantee that there was no distortion of competition .
It is rather odd that there should be proposals to reject this report .
I myself can see that there is poor compliance in my own country .
We also think that the minimum requirement in terms of the working environment is that a driver must not be compelled to spend his long weekly rest period in the cab .
Paying drivers on a piecework basis is quite unjustifiable .
There must , for example , be guarantees that , in the future too , rail services will cover the whole of the EU and not leave less profitable stretches of track unused , something that would be devastating for countries with large surface areas and small populations , such as Sweden .
The Member States are not homogenous .
With the democratic deficit in today 's EU , it is more important first and foremost to develop the role of the national parliaments .
It is very positive that , in recital G , the European Parliament clearly states 'that the protection and strengthening of regional and local autonomy in the various European countries represents an important contribution to the process of European integration based on the principles of democracy , proximity and decentralisation of power '.
Together with non-governmental organisations , the committee arranged a conference for women from Afghanistan .
It is because I see extremely few traces of it in the joint resolution .
Women 's rights are quickly forgotten in the man 's world in which we live .
The strong and pro-active Minister for Equality in the provisional Afghan Government was removed , and the role of Afghan women is now all but totally eclipsed , in spite of the fact that probably two thirds of the population consist of women and children .
Are no demands concerning women being made of the Afghan Government ?
I agree with that criticism .
The fact is that the body that should be criticised in this case is the EU Council of Ministers .
I have rarely seen more energetic , competent and vigorous leadership of a parliamentary delegation in a conciliation , and it felt very good being able to collaborate with Mrs Roth-Behrendt .
I think you are an excellent and outstanding example , not only of an accomplished parliamentarian but also of what we are so much in need of , namely energetic women in politics .
I can fully understand the animal protection organisations ' concern about the fact that it will take such a long time for
