area in which there must be very strict controls .
He was already doing so before the creation of the European Parliament’s Urban Housing Intergroup , of which he himself is Chairman and I a member , and which is working very well .
That is why I believe that today we need to engage even more with this subject , based on the experience that this Parliament has already acquired .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the urban dimension represents man’s way of life today and in the immediate future .
They should therefore try to sustain themselves by focusing on certain priorities : reduction of waste production and improved recycling of resources ; and planning of efficient horizontal dimensions , which depend not only on what a city produces and how it produces it , but also on how a city interacts with other urban centres and surrounding suburban or rural areas .
Extending a hand to the cities of the new Member States is therefore a vital means of creating the equality to which the EU aspires for all its Member States .
Consequently , social problems – spatial segregation , crime , lack of housing , unemployment – are the crucial problems we must confront and continue to solve , especially given that the URBAN programme will no longer be continuing as one of the Community initiatives of the European Union .     We certainly cannot support the position adopted by Iran , which promises ‘tougher measures ’ in the event of the nuclear question being referred to the United Nations Security Council , and even a step backwards with regard to the commitments it has entered into on this delicate matter .
It is no accident that films are already recognised in law as a cultural asset in some countries .
The more developed countries ’ inability to recycle has also produced paradoxical situations of economic dependence on certain resources .
I should just like to mention the fact – as we can see in the newspapers every day – that extreme events are getting worse : heavier rains and longer droughts .
The European Union regards this problem as central to the issue of sustainable development , which , in turn , is one of the fundamental principles for the Union : solidarity with future generations , on a par with the dignity of the individual and democracy .
Gas is used to extinguish fires and , like fire , is a source of greenhouse gas , so the effects of both the gas and the emissions from the fire must be evaluated .
I must emphasise that it is pointless to cause serious economic damage to countries that base part of their economies on the responsible use of those gases when there is no likelihood of gaining appreciable environmental benefits , while even causing greater harm in some cases .
Overall , therefore , I can support the Doyle report , although there are some points on which I cannot agree .
We also need to give priority to reassuring consumers and thereby avoiding a pointless panic , which would be harmful both to the population itself and to the poultry industry .
If I catch this deadly virus , I hope to take with me to the grave as many as possible of these fools and scoundrels who are inflicting this suffering on mankind .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the amendment on which we are about to vote concerns the inclusion of the prestigious European College of Parma in the list ; if it were excluded , it would be in danger of closure .
There is no doubt , however , that every creative work bears enduring witness to a period in time and therefore helps posterity to understand the values and tastes of a generation .
For us , it is not so much an enlargement as a reunification with countries of an unquestionably European tradition .
However , some problems have to be solved – and solved by you .
The question of international adoption is also still unresolved and , after the moratorium and approval of the new law , it has now been blocked , with unfortunate and extremely damaging consequences for the children , those with the least protection , who should be the main beneficiaries of what we all refer to as ‘human rights’ .
That , in my view , is the Europe to which we all aspire .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like , firstly , to extend a warm welcome to the observers from Bulgaria and Romania .
It is precisely because of what has just been said that , in my view , we should have confidence in Bulgaria and Romania , which still have fourteen months to go , and we must avoid any preconceptions – of which there is a hint from time to time in comments by some of the speakers – that we should already be making up our minds on the efforts of these two countries , their populations and governments .
To conclude , I hope we will have the opportunity to examine these topics in greater depth , in the knowledge that there are lines in this field that I believe must not be crossed , such as the boundaries of human dignity .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Newton Dunn , and also , of course , the draftsmen of the other committees that have addressed the topic of the framework decision on organised crime .
The protection of witnesses and those who cooperate is a very important matter , as such people need to be safeguarded from the risk of reprisals by criminal organisations
