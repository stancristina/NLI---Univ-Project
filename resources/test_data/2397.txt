This aspect is vital in view of the international issues at stake , such as money laundering and drug-trafficking , but in order for it to become a reality , the resources must be there via the various strands .
Under no circumstances must we waver on the principles that have always guided us , and , specifically on this issue , the principles that have been in place since the beginning of the 1990s .
If we do not do this , a number of surprises lie in wait .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have addressed this House on a number of occasions to warn of the suffering in Cuba , in particular that of people who continue to fight peacefully for democracy and human rights .
Parliament has therefore kept an open invitation for him to come here as soon as he is allowed to do so .
The people of Europe , and especially the young , must be made aware of their story and their exemplary fight for human rights .
The key issue at stake here is legislative clarification .
I should lastly like to say a few words about information on who has received Community funds .
This is an issue of the highest importance .
Commissioner , measures must be taken without delay to ensure that this phenomenon is made more visible .
One is to close the gender pay gap , and the other is to facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life for both men and women .
The provision of suitable childcare facilities remains a key instrument in enabling women to enter the labour market and to stay there .
Mention was just made , as it was in the latest report , of domestic violence , and I should like to draw attention to youth violence and to the fact that it is on the rise .
The facts that have come to light are shocking .
The principal cause , according to the experts , is the absence of parents .
I should like the Commission , the Council and Parliament to look into this problem and to take appropriate measures while there is still time .
In so doing , a decisive contribution is made to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy , as a sector capable of generating jobs and growth .     .
MEPs from the Portuguese Communist Party , in conjunction with representative organisations of motorway and urban transport workers , have long campaigned to improve the labour rights of professional drivers , in order to ensure that legal working hours and rest periods for drivers are adhered to , and that the sacred cow of competition , in its exploitative voracity , does not undermine those rights .
The purpose of this proposal is to consolidate the existing legislation in a single act and to repeal ( or deregulate ) all existing pack sizes .
I welcome the Commission ’s drive to simplify legislation .
Although I do not subscribe entirely to some of the points that it makes , especially on institutional matters , I feel that the general worldview that emerges here is the right one .
We support the recommendation that the Member States adopt a zero tolerance approach to all forms of violence against women , which entails implementing effective methods of prevention and punishment , and measures aimed at raising awareness of the problem and at combating it .
We welcome the adoption of a proposal urging the Commission to notify Parliament of the progress made in the various Member States with regard to the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action , not least in the area of reproductive and sexual health , and to disclose statistical data on all Member States .
We must not jeopardise the directive’s key objective , which is to guarantee minimum Community-level territorial and social postal services , at a certain quality and at affordable prices .     .
It also fails to call into question the liberalisation of the sector in 2009 , promoting instead the opening up of the sector and the primacy of competition in this regard .
When democracy engenders an unwanted result , there is a temptation to condemn the idea that such an outcome can happen .
Despite the fact that this result reflects the will of the people , the potential consequences remain very serious .     .
Young people from these areas go to Cuba to receive training and education , and Cuba sends thousands of doctors and other professionals to other countries .     .
This is a country that , in spite of the embargo , achieved the highest economic growth in the past 45 years in 2005 , a country that is set to take on the presidency of the non-aligned movement and to host its 2006 summit , and a country that sends thousands of doctors , teachers and sports coaches to other countries , rather than armies to occupy , exploit and oppress .     .
The budget savings imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact and by the major contributing countries has meant that , following adoption of the annual Community budget , many priority areas are underfunded , which has led to a policy of redistribution and cuts across the budgetary headings and countless amending budgets .
The motion for a resolution on which we have just voted highlights the need for new management measures to be taken for the Mediterranean .
I should like to point out that , in its resolution of 27 October of last year , Parliament declared its support for a fair and lasting solution in Western Sahara , based on the rule of law and on international law , and in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security
