Stability in the financial markets can be aided by effective management based on clear regulation .
It is therefore high time we made sure that where there is an internal securities market , the numerous settlement costs do not obstruct cross-border transactions in this market .
Mr Mantovani 's report aims to provide the space to do so from a European perspective .
Elderly people and patients are more than just an item of expense to society .
The number of new policy-coordinating proposals and inventories will not , in my opinion , promote good care and assistance but will rather impede it .
Practice is not waiting for new rules from Europe , it is waiting for people who want to do the work .
Mr President , let me begin by disagreeing with Mr Blokland for once , and I will explain to Hans why later .
Incidentally , I must now make a critical comment about the communication from the European Commission .
In this case I am thinking about the whole range of medicines , for example .
I am convinced that Europe can do a lot , does do a lot and should actually do even more in the area of healthcare , even if it is initially via the open coordination method .
It would be very tragic if the international coalition against terrorism were to allow itself to become divided and diverted towards Iraq .
That is why it is so very important that we actually give substance to the reconstruction that Commissioner Patten was talking about and that has now begun , with the cooperation of local forces , particularly in the area of education and healthcare , giving priority to women and girls .
In his response to our contribution four months ago , the Commissioner himself stated at the time , and I quote : the Member States will certainly take note of the comments of many MEPs .
This must come to an end .
Then the human rights violations will continue and - let us not forget this - the credibility of the international community and that of the European Union will be called into question .
Are there any solutions ?
The second point , which was given less of a chance , relates to dangerous substances .
We have achieved the most we could achieve , and we commend the rapporteur and the whole negotiation delegation .
It is not the Parliamentary delegation in the conciliation committee who is to blame for this flawed compromise but the Commission and the Council who have unilaterally bowed to pressure from the cosmetics industry .
I am wholly in favour of it .
It is to Mrs Swiebel 's credit that she has documented so well how much is wrong in Europe in the area of human rights .
It is the first step .
Specifically when it comes to everything to do with foreign affairs and defence , we try to show that the EU still consists of 15 sovereign states .
It makes little sense to formulate such nice objectives without providing sufficient resources to enable these objectives to actually be achieved .
As recently as at the last European Council , the Council of Copenhagen , the Council again acknowledged Israel 's legitimate concerns about her security .
This European unease will not upset Hezbollah .
The party of Allah is simply not mentioned .
A powerful stance such as this would also set the right tone for the negotiations on the EU 's future relationship with Damascus and Teheran .
It has already changed , fortunately , but it was not just a matter of course .
The action plan may therefore also be relevant to the social democratisation of the territories in question - with Russia first .
The territory there in the north is extremely vulnerable , and we will have to accept our responsibility , particularly with regard to Norway and other countries with interests there .
It will nevertheless have to make a decision about this .
You made a very long statement .
The problems and challenges surrounding aquaculture were brought to the fore well in his report .
Self-help is better .
We must , however , remain rational in this regard and not make ridiculous demands .
Mr President , Commissioner , twenty years ago aquaculture was hailed as the solution for declining fish catches .
There is therefore little point in talking about cod replenishment plans if you do not restrain industrial fishery first .
Not in order to tap into a market but as an essential contribution to food supplies .
North Korea is the biggest humanitarian scandal of our time .
As far as this nuclear threat is concerned , the European Union must fall in line with the United States - insofar as she does have a line .
The immediate cause of this was Pyongyang 's recent unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
The United Nations and European Union missions to observe the elections were not welcome .
The opposition leaders and all other political prisoners must be released immediately .
Reports from Chechnya are still extremely shocking to us all .
In that context the OSCE is regarded as a busybody whose mandate should rather not be renewed .
We want the Commission to make efforts to find out what has happened to Mr Erkel and to see whether it would be possible to obtain his release .
I have always been taught that you must always tell your friends the truth , that you must not withhold anything .
A dirty war on the part of the Russians , but also on the part of the Chechen rebels .
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is terrible .
We all know that our Russian colleagues are very dissatisfied with the resolutions we are adopting .
We should therefore
