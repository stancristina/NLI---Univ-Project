Indeed , four years after the elections we all wanted , financed and supported , it is important not only to condemn , but also to encourage any action that will enable the real , specific exercise of government authority and democracy in general .
I feel like asking : what is Europe doing ?
Generally speaking , beyond the atrocities committed , we can only welcome the way in which the United Nations has handled the issue of extending the mandate of the UN mission in the DRC.
It is , however , clear that this measure can only be analysed in the light of the effect it will have not only on the financing of the rebel troops but also on whether the authorities can regain effective control , and on the socio-economic well-being of the people .
Once the final rules concerning the ESTA have been published by the US authorities , the Commission will present us with its final report on this subject .
Please rest assured that the Presidency will continue to support the Union 's cause vis-Ã -vis the American authorities .
The Belgian Presidency has made significant efforts to implement the Treaty of Lisbon , and in this context , the Presidency welcomes the agreement between Parliament and the Council on the European External Action Service , which constitutes a major contribution to the effective implementation of the common security and defence policy .
During the Belgian Presidency , four priorities in the fight against poverty will be highlighted : minimum wage and social welfare , housing and the homeless , child poverty within the family and finally , the participation of those living in poverty and all those involved in the fight against poverty , insecurity and social exclusion .
The results of the symposium will serve as the basis for a ministerial debate at the 'Agriculture and Fisheries ' Council in November .
On the basis of the Stockholm Programme , specific attention is granted to children who are particularly vulnerable , notably child victims of sexual exploitation and abuse , as well as child victims of trafficking and unaccompanied minors .
During its meeting of June 2010 , the European Council approved the general approach relating to the integrated guidelines for economic and employment policies , which are an essential tool for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth .
Members of the Council have also insisted on the need to guarantee the greatest legal certainty and to enforce the principle of subsidiarity .
Granted , this evaluation reveals some regrets from a social point of view and from the point of view of democracy and human rights , but only to say that the insufficiencies in this area hold back economic development and - I quote the evaluation by the Commission itself - that it is admitted that social cohesion creates a better climate for business .
I think I know the answer .
It provides better border security and intelligent management of migratory flows .
Mr President , we all know what the democracy and human rights situation is in China .
You tell us that China is modernising .
What does this mean in practice ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the absence of new proposals from the Commission relating to oil exploration and extraction - an absence which I should immediately like to point out is quite legitimate since the Commission is engaged in ongoing consultations with the industry and the numerous regulatory authorities concerned - I can only reiterate here our deep concern following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and its far too numerous human and environmental casualties .
I should also like to point out that the Commission is currently examining the EU 's disaster response capacity , with a view , in particular , to its improvement .
That is why I think it is essential for us to do as the US had no hesitation in doing , and introduce a moratorium on new installations so that the conditions mentioned just now can be fulfilled .
Clearly , it is difficult to answer that question directly .
So let us speak clearly and practically .
This requirement follows the statement in Article 3( 3 ) of the treaty that the internal market shall be constructed through policies based on a social market economy which is highly competitive and which tends towards full employment and social progress .
In this context , the Europe 2020 strategy provides an opportunity for visibility : a European social policy .
I would also like to say that , in the austerity measures , which the Commissioner has just spoken about , it was obviously important to consider the measures to be taken in order to ensure that austerity does not make people even poorer .
Madam President , Mr Karas , ladies and gentlemen , just a few days after the agreement reached in the Basel Committee , I think that it is very important that Parliament is demonstrating its commitment to banking reform and clearly showing that Europe behaves and must behave in a way appropriate to its global standing .
Second , as regards the rules on liquidity and the definition of 'liquidity buffer', the Commission is fully aware of the problem raised in particular for Denmark and Austria .
I hope that the Heads of State or Government of the G20 will approve this new Basel Agreement during the forthcoming Seoul Summit in November .
I was one of the people who were in favour of an own-initiative report being produced before the Commission makes its proposals on the framework for transposing the Basel Agreement , and I am delighted that the work done by Mr Karas with the help of the various shadow rapporteurs has highlighted the main points for consideration .
We would find it indecent
