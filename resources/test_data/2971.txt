National parties can indeed stand in the elections to the European Parliament ; they are funded in accordance with national legislation on the funding of political parties , and it would be wrong if national parties , parties limited to one nation , were also to form a party under the European Statute on Political Parties .
Although we welcome the inclusion of animal welfare in this regulation , we are critical of the nature of the provisions relating to it .
That remains the weak point in all the Member States .
It is of course intended to have a deterrent effect on product pirates and counterfeiters .
There are problems , however , as has already been mentioned , particularly by the previous speaker .
The European Union would accordingly be permanently depriving itself of the right finally to insist on legal application of the rules for preferential treatment of exports .
We need to remember this : the agreement was concluded in 1975 , the Oslo Peace Accord was signed in 1993 , and from that moment on the European Union has supported the independence of the Palestinian Autonomy Authority , it has given it over EUR 2 billion and has done very good work .
Above all , I would like to draw the attention of the members of the Committee on Budgets to the fact that this agency , in addition to the 27 staff working there , is also to be controlled by 27 members of the Management Board and also by an Executive Board consisting of five members .
It was not until this morning that all the changes , that is to say changes in the form of the Council text , were presented to Parliament .
We have noted all the proposals and carefully considered them .
If these general conditions are not met , the Council can decide to suspend financial assistance .
This proposal from the Council is meaningless , and the Commission knows that , but it cannot say that in so many words .
My recommendation , which was not accepted by the committee , was that the Stabilisation and Association Agreements should be successfully implemented over a period of years .
The issue is that the Thessaloniki Council asked whether we could not draw a few conclusions from the successful progress of the enlargement process with a view to bringing the countries of the Western Balkans closer to the European Union more effectively .
I will be voting in favour .
After 1 May , there will be more young people for us to reach .
As for the first , I would like to take this opportunity to shed more light on the Financial Regulation .
It is for that reason that I believe we have to make it our business to ensure that money is spent properly , but we must not allow ourselves to be tied into a corset that nobody will find it easy to get out of .
With regard to the elections on 10-13 June , too , I can only say that we have to persuade young people that Europe is the right place in which to take their political ideas further .
I would remind you that Erasmus aimed to include 10 % of students in the programme .
Only when we have done that should we look to see how much money we need in order to make that a reality .
The checks are to be carried out by , among others , multinational teams , with the inspection strategies to be used , such as benchmarking and common priorities , laid down by the Commission .
It follows that the presence of Spanish vessels in the waters around the Azores outside the 100 nautical-mile limit does not justify any emergency measures of the kind suggested by Mr Casaca , as these ships are complying with the rules on access .
It cannot therefore be said after the event that Spain was penalised .
Consultation of the Member States is guaranteed by the involvement of the Management Committee in this procedure .
We will examine this proposal with great care , as we do all contributions to our preparations for the reform of the common market organisation for sugar .
There is also the problem of having to consider how we help those developing countries that have traditionally been our sugar suppliers – Mauritius is one example – if they begin to see exporting sugar to Europe as a less attractive prospect than it was in the past .     – Mr President , Commissioner , the poorest countries in the world – or so the media tell us – have asked to be allocated their own sugar import quotas .
The study likewise confirms the feasibility of limit values .
We must clearly indicate the direction in which we intend to proceed .
What is wanted – and this message will be heard from politicians in the forthcoming election campaign too – is a set of clear and binding targets for local and regional authorities , targets designed solely to improve the quality of people’s lives .     .
It gives farmers the freedom and flexibility to farm their land as they see fit and to take advantage of market opportunities , and at the same time it takes account of environmental and social concerns .
The vital requirement , then , is to promote rural development and to rely on other products with a positive knock-on effect in terms of employment .
One such example is the proposal in Amendment No 58 that Member States be given the option of regionalising their national ceilings , which can certainly be considered .
Some of the amendments proposed in this report relate to the automatic activation of the
