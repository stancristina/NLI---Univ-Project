I thought the purpose of this Question Time was precisely to demand answers from the Council , which is why I am very pleased to be able to answer Mr Dupuis ' s question further .
Greece reports that it needs to amend its penal law .
Finally , in the Netherlands , a two-thirds majority is needed in parliament .
However , it is hoped that the necessary legislation will be able to be adopted within a short time .
The Union ' s Charter of Fundamental Rights has been signed by the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
The fact that the rights have been formulated in the Charter thus does not affect their value .
The Council has a duty to follow , discuss and monitor the question of the status of the Charter .
The Charter also contains a number of articles that are rather an expression of general political aims , for example Articles 37 and 38 concerning environmental and consumer protection .
The Council is not in a position to judge the application in the particular case taken up by the Member .
Secondly : where minority languages are concerned , another important institution - which is also geographically close to Parliament - namely the Council of Europe , has drawn up a convention on the status of minority languages .
I do n' t like repeating myself , but I am at Parliament ' s service .
The Council has no role to play in the cooperation that has been established between the six states and is therefore not in a position to be able to provide direct information concerning the situation and what has been achieved in this area .
Allow me simply to state very briefly the legal position of this agreement because I happen to be a citizen of a country that is one of the signatories .
The Framework Agreement is now subject to ratification by the signatory states .
The question that the honourable Member raises has never been put before the Council .
I actually have nothing to add beyond what I stated in my initial answer .
As regards financial repercussions of the BSE crisis , the Council would remind you that , in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council summit in Nice , both the budget plan and the Council Regulation on budgetary discipline must be observed even if new measures or supplementary measures are required .
Once this has been approved by the Council and European Parliament it will provide a framework for sustainable production .
The Council therefore feels that the Commission should be able to implement the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy without this being affected by BSE.
My second question concerns the fact that many members of the Swedish government are said to take a positive view of a Tobin tax .
As Mr Sj√∂stedt says , it is correct that representatives of the Swedish government have stated that a Tobin tax would be an agreeable idea - wording that has been used by a trade minister known to both of us .
I would like to put a question to the Council that concerns the slight tendency towards a Tobin tax that Sweden introduced between 1986 and 1991 , i .e . the turnover tax on share transactions .
What was the result of this type of transaction tax ?
Firstly I do not believe that it is compatible with my role to attempt to make an assessment .
Under this protocol Denmark shall not participate in the Council ' s decisions on proposed measures in accordance with Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
The question has been raised as to whether it is conceivable that the content of certain measures decided on by the Community within the context of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community may be made applicable in Denmark in any other way .
It is not possible for the President-in-Office of the Council to assess the content of a national debate such as that to which the honourable Member refers .
Last year , when answering a question , number 3304 , put by the same honourable Member , the Council already had the opportunity to inform him that it had not been involved in the activities of this working party and that no demands had been made upon the Community budget .
However , I should like to point out , as an aside in this Question Time , how much Sweden and all the other countries have contributed to this matter via their national budgets .
The European Union is addressing issues of human rights , including the position of women , with Saudi Arabia and other Member States of the Gulf States Cooperation Council within the framework of meetings at all levels between the EU and the GCC.
The EU will also follow up the issue of a more vigorous dialogue on human rights .
In this way , the European Union made its views on the situation in Saudi Arabia in this area crystal clear .
In particular , those issues addressed by the honourable Member are to be monitored , especially the risk of increased religious intolerance such as we are seeing in many areas of the world .
I believe the Council ' s view is that the optimum working method in this area is to support the international organisations that monitor issues such as these .
The Community ' s responsibility in the area of public health is laid down in Article 152 of the Treaty .
I want to thank Mr Danielsson for that answer .
I would point out that this draft law in actual fact enables children of twelve years and over , with their parents ' permission , to be present at
