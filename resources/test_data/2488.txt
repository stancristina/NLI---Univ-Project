should be proud of this , and so we are .
This unique cooperation makes heavy demands on us , however .
Our citizens expect the right results and solutions ; we have to be able to take decisions and be effective .
Decisions in the Council must be taken by qualified majority : this produces a willingness to compromise .
Justice , not brute force , holds sway in the EU.
This is only possible if we have a strong Commission .
This was the message the summit sent out to Turkey .
In 2004 , it will be assessed in detail and , after this , provided it meets the Copenhagen criteria , will be given a date for the start of its accession negotiations .
The Copenhagen Summit has shown that the EU is built on great visions and historic decisions , but , at the same time , time-consuming and sometimes even ugly negotiations on milk quotas , suckler cows and all kinds of transitional arrangements .
We politicians must be able to explain both sides of this fantastic European cooperation .
A big 'thank you ' to the President and , once again , hearty congratulations : you deserve to celebrate , and not just with a beer .
- ( DA ) Mr President , first and foremost , I should like to express my thanks for a constructive and positive debate and for the many positive comments on the Danish Presidency in general and the course of the Copenhagen Summit in particular .
A number of questions have been posed , and so many subjects have been raised that it is impossible for me to comment on everything that has been said in the limited time available ; but I should like to highlight a few subjects that many people have mentioned .
- ( DA ) Mr President , I should like to thank Parliament for this opportunity to express , on behalf of the Council , my deepest sympathy with those affected by the devastating and scandalous pollution that followed the accident involving the oil tanker Prestige off the Galician coast .
Unfortunately it has happened again , however , and thus maritime safety and the prevention of oil slick disasters is back on the agenda .
We still do not know what went wrong to cause the wreck off the Galician coast , but the fact that it could happen is , in itself , proof enough that further action is required .
On 21 November , Parliament made a strong statement on the Prestige accident .
I should like to say to Mrs de Palacio that the Commission , in my opinion , has shown great energy in acting on this difficult matter .
Both institutions deserve praise for the Community 's swift action in initiating decisions promoting maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment .
It has been the Presidency 's intention to treat the Prestige accident extremely seriously .
This was one of the reasons why there was a delay , meaning that the ministers did not end up dining with the Queen of Denmark .
The Council has declared that all the relevant measures will be taken to prevent this kind of accident : at international , EU and national level .
Both the Council and the Presidency hold the view that we have achieved a good result , one which sends out the strong political signal we need : a firm line against single-hull tankers in the EU and the political will to find solutions .
In particular , I am thinking of the measures that Parliament and the Council will be adopting together under the codecision procedure .
I have no doubt that we can agree on this , given the will and resolve that Parliament has shown in this matter .
The Council is also looking forward to constructive cooperation with Parliament , so that there is no unnecessary delay in putting in place the tightening of regulations and the rules on liability that are needed for the purposes of prevention and in order to ensure that , if accidents should happen , it is the right people who are made to pay : that is , those responsible .
( DA ) Mr President , may I on behalf of the Council state that I agree with most of what has been said , and with the anger , vexation and deep concern that has been expressed , and the demands for action that have been heard in this House .
It then continues by expressing satisfaction with the Commission 's work in respect of the economic , social and environmental consequences of the loss of the Prestige .
There was thus complete support in Copenhagen for Mrs de Palacio and for the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
It was a series of paragraphs which approximately correspond to Parliament 's viewpoints , which are indeed vigorous on a great many points and which already meet nearly all the requirements put forward here in this House .
But now something is being done , and what is being done is exactly what the honourable speakers have asked for , and the rapid action taken by the Commissioner has been applauded .
There are two types of liability .
The first is to be met by the funds for covering expenditure on cleaning up beaches and providing compensation for fishermen - and there is nothing to suggest that these funds are insufficient to cover the expenses concerned .
There is also , however , the liability for environmental damage , of course .
Mr Sterckx and others are right in saying that it is not the number of inspections which is crucial , but that inspection is carried out at the right points
