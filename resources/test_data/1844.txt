I am pleased , moreover , that Parliament has supported our attaching importance to finishing the job quickly so that people might have the card in their hands by 1 July 2004 .
It has not been as simple as all that , for it was as recently as last Friday that the Council agreed upon the wording now before us .
I must thank my colleagues in the form of the shadow rapporteurs from the other parties for having been so flexible and trusting in the work on this card and for having supported us in finding a solution as early as today , when I also hope we can lay the foundation for reaching an agreement at first reading and so having the proposal implemented in a mere six months .
What we are adopting today means that a number of the forms we have at present are to be replaced by a card .
Subsequently , a number of other forms will follow , normally to be completed when people move from one country to another or need health insurance – paid for by their country of origin – when temporarily resident abroad .
It is , then , not only students and retired people temporarily resident , or working in , another country , but also people travelling who will no doubt make more use of the new Health Insurance Card , for they will no longer have to contact the social authorities but will have the card and be able to go directly to the doctor’s .
In future , everyone will be entitled to all necessary medical treatment whereas , up until now , some people were only entitled to emergency medical treatment .
This proposal will therefore improve and simplify matters for them .
How the rules will look and what list of illnesses it will be permitted , in purely practical terms , to obtain treatment for will be laid down by representatives from the Member States .
It is also worth mentioning that it will become easier to reimburse expenditure .
This can be made simpler and faster .
At present , it can take a long time before expenses are reimbursed .
It will become simpler for the individual , but it will also in fact become simpler for the doctors and health staff , as well as becoming easier for the authorities .
Finally , I wish to say how very important it is to state that what we are preparing in this case is an insurance card and not a card providing health information in the general sense of the term .
In the context of the e-Europe programme , work is being done on a card that will contain health information , but that is not what we are talking about today .
It is a small reform but one that , I believe , will be very effective in practice .     Mr President , I should like to add to what has been said about the way in which we conduct these meetings .
The latter come in at the time when the President has said we are to vote , and it is completely unacceptable for Parliament to treat our Commissioners in that way .
May I not , however , ask that the issue be debated at a Conference of Presidents and that a solution be found , for I think that the dignity of Parliament is grossly impaired by the way in which we all conduct ourselves .     Mr President , it is unacceptable that a directive on environmental liability should not include pollution from the use of genetically modified plants ( GMOs ) .
In Parliament’s readings of directives on seed corn and the tracing and labelling of GMOs , it has been clear that there is a risk of unintentional pollution , even with the correct use of GMOs .
What is at issue is pollution due to the spreading of pollen and waste seed accumulated in the seed bank .
That being said , GMO pollution is not included in the proposal for a directive on environmental liability .
I am therefore able to support the proposals concerning GMOs by Mr Lannoye and others .
It is time that the EU lived up to its ideals .
Negotiations are complete regarding 99 % of it .
Then there is the encounter with the electorate .
Parallel with the summit , the European Referendum Campaign met in Brussels with 100 participants from many different organisations .
Both Mr Leinen and I were among the speakers .
On behalf of SOS Democracy and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities , I should like to undertake to contribute to some solid information work on the draft Constitution .
Let us together demand referendums in all the EU countries under a common motto : EU Constitution ?
In Denmark , we are to be given a referendum , but the June Movement would like to help gather signatures for referendums in all the EU countries .
Instead of giving the Danes and the Irish a second ballot , it would be better to consult the whole of the EU.
People cannot be given a constitution without permission being asked of them .     Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , the budget for 2004 is in many ways a complicated budget because enlargement will happen part way through the year .
Our success should be honoured and appreciated and not be greeted with attacks on Parliament’s budgetary authority .
First of all , we put enlargement in place .
Secondly , we found the EUR 200 million for Iraq .
It is now that the Iraqis are short of money .
Thirdly , I wish to mention a lesser , but nonetheless important , matter for the next few years .
At long last , domiciles were established for a whole series of
