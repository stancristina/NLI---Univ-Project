It is vital for the future of Europe that the Member States , for example , re-examine the question of a strict , quantitative limit to be placed on the value of their pension funds , in the run up to the introduction of the euro .
In the light of the two revolutions which are currently causing a radical upheaval in European financial practice - and here I mean the introduction of the single currency and the development of digital moneys of account - how can we not conceive of the introduction of new forms of payment , and more particularly , of the re-definition of money and currency itself , and of the role of the banks and the supervisory authorities ?
The proper operation of the single currency , the competitiveness of the European Union , and the stability of our European financial system , are so many reasons for governments to take urgent measures .
In conclusion I would say that , setting aside the enthusiasm of the 'euro at any price ' supporters - pun not intended - it is high time now to provide consumers with some guarantees , and among them , the guarantee of purchasing power , which has already been significantly affected by the attempt to meet the Maastricht criteria .
Firstly , will the euro become an international currency in the full meaning of the words ?
In this framework , such target bands can be of assistance in coordinating the economic policies of the various countries , by determining a few major policy lines and hence ensuring that economic managers in the various states communicate , on concrete and clearly determined bases , and in a word , by setting up the best possible communication between decision makers and hence , hopefully , giving rise to the best possible economic decision-making .
Before concluding , I would like to take advantage of these reports to ask Mr de Silguy , who is present , to outline to us his position on the consequences of the Asian crisis , as regards the prospects for growth and the euro timetable .
Finally , I am concerned at the absence of provisions relating to the social and labour relations dimension .
That being the case , how can immediate or even staged liberalization be accepted , which would inevitably bring with it its load of redundancies and exclusion ?
Space and associated fields can make a useful contribution .
If we try to adopt an even broader viewpoint , we are forced to the conclusion that the financial innovations and economies of scale in the management of the capital markets , after the introduction of the euro , will be of little interest if , at the same time , the economy falls to pieces .
Hence , the single-currency mistake may well delay the revolution in electronic money in Europe , for the sake of a single currency which will , with hindsight , be seen for the illusion it is .
The difficulties imposed on them by the transition period may well be a focus for all their discontent .
We should accustom our citizens to think in euro terms .
Finally , we have condemned the determination to confer an extraterritorial character on some American legislation , such as the Helms-Burton and Amato-Kennedy Acts , and we have called on the Commission to take the firmest stance possible .
The Commission is not always best placed to formulate such objectives , as the priorities are largely dominated by the institutional aspects of free trade .
My group has put down two amendments , one to Mr Souchet 's report and the other to Mrs Mann 's .
This Government , with , alas , the complicity of our own Governments , intends to lay down a new world order in which nations and families would be crushed , and human beings become objects to be cloned at leisure .
On the other hand , as Dominique Souchet notes , balance must be re-established in our relationship with America .
The final point is the aerospace sector .
The European flag is the Paramount flag , used by the American movie company Paramount , with its stars .
No, I do not think so .
Therefore , I believe it is necessary to attack the problem of unemployment by in-depth reforms , which are not directed against the employees , but carried out along with them .
Therefore , while discounting any developments I cannot foresee , I believe that the situation at present will not in real terms have any impact on the economy or on budgets .
Even if the national administrations of countries outside the euro allow them to work in euros , will they nevertheless not have to bear extra costs ?
This is what the European Council in Luxembourg committed itself to in November .
The problem affects more than 400 , 000 businesses , most of them small and mediumsized , which in total employ more than ten million people , with very different techniques .
In this respect , we should note that there has not been a proper assessment of costs .
Secondly , the rapporteur rightly drew our attention to the fact that 40 % of waste is the result of do-it-yourself - people working on their homes at the weekend .
This proposal was examined at first reading by the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection on 13 November 1996 .
But microbes do not care about borders .
We should also base ourselves on the European Centre for Epidemiological Surveillance for AIDS , and draw from the encouraging results of this institution , to extend the experience to other transmissible diseases .
Let us look at these questions a little more closely .
I note that the President-in-Office set the
