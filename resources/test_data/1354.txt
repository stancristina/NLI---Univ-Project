I did not really understand what Mr Frattini was referring to today , whether he was talking about press leaks .
This year we have spent €45 million ; Frontex has 90 staff and carried out four missions at sea this summer .
Policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third-country nationals (vote ) - Report : Moreno Sánchez Voting time on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my Group has expressed valid criticism of the Marty report and voted overwhelmingly against the Fava report .
It is a shame , because at least on subjects like terrorism and human rights this House ought to be able to overcome its internal divisions and produce a common position .
Well , there is no trace of her change of mind in the report , whereas it is full of testimonies by journalists who share the rapporteur 's thesis .
It is no longer political when we are invited to consider whether or not circumstances are sufficiently extreme to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union .
It is fair that the Commission should attempt to carry out an overall assessment of measures adopted by the Member States ; the other initiatives announced and launched by Mr Frattini are equally acceptable .
Judicial inquiries are underway in four European countries : Spain , Portugal , Germany and Italy .
This has not happened .
A few days ago we voted almost unanimously in favour of a resolution on Burma .
Even US President Bush , despite his many vacuous remarks before the UN Assembly , has one point in his favour .
I believe , however , that it is worth stressing that for the rapporteurs incontestable facts do not count : in politics it is the assessment and the role that Italy has had in the past and still has today in the institution of Europe .
They claim that anyone living in Europe , even if they hold passports and citizenships from outside Europe , is a voter .
Our responsibility is political : it is the responsibility to put an end to the military occupation and to call for two peoples and two states , able to coexist in mutual safety . on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , reciprocity is an important value in interpersonal relations and all the more so in relations between states , even commercial ones .
Nor does reciprocity apply with respect to safety or passengers ' rights .
Fortunately , Prime Minister Sócrates , the IGC was short .
This text contains positive elements , but it is full of traps and spanners in the works .
If we look at the difference between the cost of the product and what consumers are charged , we can see that consumers and producers are paying for a very long supply chain .
The TRIPS Agreement , as the Council has recognised , represents only part of the solution to the problem of access to medicines and public health ; it is important therefore that the Council , as emphasised several times by Parliament , should declare its support for all those countries who intend to take advantage of the flexibilities offered by the TRIPS Agreements , to be able to provide essential medicines at affordable prices .
The European Union must do more to stem the health crisis in the world 's poorest countries , particularly by ensuring that these countries can meet their own needs , without burdening them with bilateral or regional agreements , the 'TRIPS-plus ' Agreements , on provisions relating to pharmaceutical products that risk having a negative impact on access to public health and medicines .
It is a longstanding project , arising from the Bologna process as the system of accumulation and transfer of credits as an equivalent , before surfacing again at the Barcelona Summit system for vocational training .
Thanks to their generous involvement and commitment , we were able to include the following concepts : social integration ; the requirements of the labour market ; personal development along different training paths ; non-discrimination with the inclusion of disadvantaged persons ; equal opportunities ; respect for the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of coordination points within the Member States .
We have before us the result , which will require educational authorities in the Member States to use this shared framework as a translation device and a reference point .
Progress has been made with the formation of the African Union , the policy of unity in diversity .
The various aspects of the strategy are important , but we must carry them forward with coherent policies , and I am referring here to arms sales and trade .
The amendments put forward in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and by Mrs Gomes on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , as well as those tabled by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in plenary , have helped to ensure that the proposal on the table today is not an alternative one , that is , a negative proposal calling for the policy pursued hitherto to be replaced overnight .
We are freer than others to propose that alternative experiments be carried out and assessed pragmatically , not ideologically .
Even though it is illegal , however , that country is the source of half of the raw materials needed to kill our young people or make them fall prey to drug traffickers who , as we know , draw them into the use of drugs , which harms them and society as a whole
