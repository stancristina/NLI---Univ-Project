The standardisation of technical features will result in improved competitiveness on the railways without there being any negative effects on the status of other forms of transport .
In this connection I would still like to remind people about something that is important for Finland .
Because Russia has the same rail gauge as us , one that differs from that in the rest of the EU countries , there are also a lot of Russian carriages and wagons that run in Finland that are built in accordance with the GOST standards .
Finland has been accused , sometimes with good reason and sometimes not , of Finlandisation .
For practical reasons we must be able to use Russian carriages and wagons in the future .
In spite of that , there is still a long way to go before we reach the terminus .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , as the Union expands eastward to the countries of Central Europe and the Baltic , within just a few years ' time our relations with our eastern neighbours remaining outside the Union will become more and more important .
We like to find excuses for it , saying that these countries themselves still do not have the right economic conditions or political will to find suitable forms of cooperation .
But we have already invested a considerable amount of money and resources in cooperation with the southern Mediterranean region , and we are still waiting for the results to materialise there .
I did not notice any mention in the President ' s general report of our relations with the East , which perhaps was not possible within the framework of a broad overview .
This is out of all proportion with the relative importance of these two neighbouring regions .
This has already resulted in harmful and lasting changes to the balance of nature , and the situation is continuing to deteriorate .
Madam President , my group too warmly supports the approach whereby the main priorities are actually set forth in this discussion , and just for a moment we can ignore the 'business as usual ' attitude that we do tend to encounter in our everyday work here .
I am now referring to the fact that at the Nice Summit it proved utterly impossible to take the decision that , in future , matters to do with taxation might be decided upon by means of a qualified majority .
Population growth was mentioned here .
Madam President , very often strong words are uttered in this House on the subject of our citizens .
The institutions are at this very moment trying to put together a regulation on transparency , which would safeguard the right of the public to acquire information on decision making in the Union .
I would like to warn my colleagues and all those present that now it appears that this regulation on transparency is turning into more of a regulation to shield the confidentiality of the work of the institutions , or , in other words , it has precisely the opposite objective .
Neither can this matter be discussed entirely in camera , as is happening at the moment .
It is here , if anywhere , that the Commission must demonstrate leadership and set forth its views .
This is something we cannot possibly accept as we are speaking about sustainable development .
In this we can look forward to a real change in the paradigm .
To conclude , Madam President , if you will allow , Annex IV of the Treaty of Nice is certainly the best thing about this agreement .
My group fully supports your initiative regarding our obligation to include civil society in this debate over the next six months prior to the Laeken Summit , as well , obviously , as the national parliaments and indeed those of candidate countries .
We will have to take it seriously finally and we should no longer have to witness any Intergovernmental Conference in which just the national interests are safeguarded , with all this happening behind closed doors .
I also think it very important that the whole basis for working has been the notion that first we have to endorse current legislation and then these voluntary agreements can be made in addition .
This proposal is now extending the system that has been in force since 1993 by including various organisations having environmental impacts .
We are no longer just speaking about industrial companies , which is good .
The present-day consumer is laying ever greater emphasis on the environmental impact of products when they make spending decisions .
It is inevitable that joining an eco-management scheme will require a commitment to making regular environment-related declarations and reports , substantiated by independent experts , and to making them public .
The rapporteur recommends the adoption of the Commission ' s proposal on limit values to be implemented as from 2003 .
The Commission acknowledges the need for this second stage .
We shall be putting forward a separate proposal for this by the end of 2002 .
In this next stage , emissions will have to be measured in relation to an improved test cycle .
The Commission actively supports the development of a worldwide , harmonised test cycle for motorcycles .
For that reason , we believe that the new cycle will be introduced in sufficient time for it to start being applied in 2006 .
The relevant amendments are Amendments Nos 3 , 5 , 10 , 11 , 23 , 24 and 25 .
However , the Commission is obviously prepared to take part in formulating a general Interinstitutional Agreement as soon as possible .
The Commission recognises the importance of these if we want to make sure that there is a genuine reduction in emissions whilst driving .
I might reply to the question
