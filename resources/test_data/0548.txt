the nuclear plants .
On top of that , the nuclear power industry in the West is also having its lifetime extended .
The order book was more or less empty , but with EU money a new and lucrative market has emerged .
But under no circumstances will we be party to giving economic aid to maintain nuclear power as an energy source , at the expense of developing more environmentally friendly sources of energy .
The Greens ' amendments provided for that , but since they were all rejected , we have voted against the Adam report .
Mr President , the Europe of Nations Group would like to thank the Wise Men , because they are not looking for scapegoats but are instead indicting the system .
The Wise Men are very precise in their conclusion : they have not found a single person who has shown the slightest sense of accountability .
None of them should therefore be able to be reappointed now .
We would like to see an investigation of the charges against the current Commission and the apparatus of officials .
There must be accountability , especially for those who have helped to withhold information .
If it transpires that there are members of the Commission who are on record as having been strongly opposed to the adoption of the accounts and other regrettable decisions , then they could be considered for reappointment in January .
All of the Commission must go and not come back .
There are now 1 000 committees , 10 000 laws - with even more amendments - and 100 000 projects .
A new Commission will be no more able to manage what the old one could not manage .
The solution is not new faces , but an extensive clean-up .
The solution is a leaner form of cooperation with complete openness : a lean and open Europe .
Mr President , the conclusions of the Wise Men 's report are quite clear .
The Commission has lost political control of its administration .
That is in fact the most frightening conclusion of the report .
In such a climate , corruption , nepotism and irregularities can thrive .
We need a comprehensive staff reform , which in my view should include an end to jobs for life and introduce fixed-term contracts instead .
Many of them work diligently and well , but it should be possible to get rid of the rotten apples .
The staff organisations will fight tooth and nail when they see their unrivalled privileges disappearing .
They have at last accepted that responsibility and resigned en masse .
Parliament would have dismissed the whole Commission if they had not resigned of their own accord .
The Danish Social Democrat delegation is therefore unanimous in not voting for the restoration of a Commission which is almost identical to the one we have just dismissed .
It is not a question of personalities , although one person tried to make it so .
New blood is what is needed .
There must now be an end to the politics of the 15 rubber stamps .
Year after year , they have approved the accounts without batting an eyelid , so perhaps we should consider sacking the Council next time round .
They are a common crew !
On the Tindemans report , like Mr von Habsburg , I should like to point out that North Korea is suffering from a serious food shortage .
One has to ask oneself if we have got our priorities right when we choose one-sidedly to support energy development and do not at the same time at least help the starving people of North Korea .
Not so very long ago , the Union decided to provide food aid for Russia .
We supported that as well .
Hitherto , the Commission has said that surplus stocks of beef and veal were not earmarked for food aid and that it is not the right kind of aid from a nutritional point of view .
The idea of introducing a common European public prosecutor should be scrapped .
We can fight crime just as effectively with the existing instruments , including Europol and the convention on extradition and mutual judicial assistance .
We should not harmonise for the sake of harmonising , and in fact the differences between the criminal laws of the Member States are not so great that they cannot be overcome by using existing intergovernmental instruments .
Europol is a good example of the fact that this is possible , and Europol should remain intergovernmental .
It must not develop into a European police authority with operational powers .
The Nassauer report proposes that Europol should be put under the direction and control of the Commission , with strengthened supervisory powers for the European Parliament .
Formally speaking , parliamentary supervision of Europol is well placed in the hands of the national parliaments , although one might doubt that they themselves are aware of it , so it is perhaps a good idea to also report to the European Parliament , which takes its supervisory role seriously .
Europol is a form of intergovernmental cooperation and , fortunately , the Amsterdam Treaty excludes any proposal to make police cooperation supranational .
Mr President , I would like to begin by expressing my disappointment at the outcome of the Berlin summit .
Compared with the Commission 's proposal , which we supported , Berlin was in fact a disaster for European agriculture .
I am unhappy about that .
It is clear that the idea behind the report was to ensure the best possible terms for farmers .
But I believe we have to recognise the fact that we should have brought our agricultural prices down to a level which reflects the world market price , and so we will have to find other methods to compensate for the social distortion which may result
