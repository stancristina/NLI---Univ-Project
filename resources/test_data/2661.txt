latter can replace the decision makers .
I share the assessment which says that the Commission ' s approach in the proposal is rigid in relation to prevailing legal practice .
There is , however , a difference between the environmental and the 'social ' issues .
I come from a small EU country where my experience has shown that , precisely with reference to 'collective agreements ' , it has been extremely difficult for Finnish companies to enter the German , and also the Swedish , construction markets .
I still hope , however , to be able to send an important signal on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Reform Party , to the effect that if the proposals for increased threshold values are adopted , we shall not be able to support the proposals because , in our view , they limit this area of application still more .
Small and medium-sized enterprises must be able to compete on equal terms .
It would prevent protectionist behaviour in national markets and - something which is not to be sniffed at - make it easier for politicians to be thrifty with people ' s taxes .
In that way , the rules for those who submit offers will become clear , and they will know what prior conditions apply to procurement .
Nonetheless , I also want fully to acknowledge my country ' s extreme uncompetitiveness in the construction sphere , something which also leads to our having high housing costs .
Thanks to this directive , we shall be able to protect vegetation and people ' s health from the damaging effects of unduly high concentrations of ozone , except in those cases where that cannot be brought about by proportionate measures .
I wish quite simply to take the opportunity of conveying my special thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Davies , and all the members of the Conciliation Committee .
In view of this , it is not perhaps so surprising that many of us wish , and had wished , that the programme might have been better and feel disappointed that it is not as good as we would have liked .
Let us do it well and take the institutional and constitutional battle elsewhere and not where the Sixth Environment Action Programme is at issue .
Let us see what kind of thing the Sixth Environment Action Programme is and see what we are to use it for , namely as a guiding star in all EU policy -environmental and otherwise - and as a lynchpin of the entire sustainable development strategy with which we shall travel together to Johannesburg in September of this year .
Regarding Mrs Myller ' s reference to the common environment tax , I would make a point of mentioning recent reports in Sweden to the effect that the dramatic fall in the quantities of climate-changing gases is due precisely to the carbon dioxide tax .
That is also how it has been with the Sixth Environment Action Programme .
Mrs Myller , as rapporteur , and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy have genuinely tried to improve the Sixth Environment Action Programme .
We must now take the opportunity of changing this by voting in favour of the committee ' s amendments and the compromise amendments tabled by quite a few political groups .
So that it is possible to do this , I should like to recommend all MEPs to vote in favour of Amendment No 44 , which of course requires it to be discovered by no later than 2003 which forms of EU aid run directly counter to our aims , that is to say have a negative effect on the environment , and requires the year to be established by which this aid must be abolished .
It is sad that such an incomplete and one-sided analysis has been carried out .
There is so much we must do and agree upon within these institutions .
That is a proposal which we cannot support .
The fact is , however , that some of what Parliament contributed has been incorporated into the joint proposal .
During the period that this environment action programme is to apply , the European Union will be enlarged through the accession of a large number of new countries .
So that environmental work does not lose momentum , it is no doubt desirable to have a programme with timetables and practical objectives to adhere to when enlargement takes place .
My group will vote in favour both of the committee ' s proposal and of all the compromise amendments we arrived at in these negotiations .
This concerns the European Investment Bank .
That is why it is so important for them to receive the clear message that they too are not exempt from what is required .
It has been extremely instructive .
We appreciate that a programme may be needed that extends over a longer period because environmental problems often arise after a certain number of years .
The programme states the overarching objectives , and it is of course extremely important for us to know that this is the direction in which we must be moving .
That is something we must get to grips with .
We agree on which issues are to be highlighted : climate change , the natural environment and bio-diversity , health and environmental measures , and the issues of how we use our natural resources and dispose of waste .
The environmental action programme is challenging .
That is why I do not of course agree with rejecting the Council ' s common position .
That means that we must be very thorough in analysing the problems we face , together with possible solutions , at the same time as studying current research and making use of indicators etc
