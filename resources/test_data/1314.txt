together the most relevant information as quickly as possible .
Letters from any of the members of political groups in this Parliament are always taken into consideration , and I would like you to be assured of that .
I have never done so and I would hope never to do so .
I am accepting mine and you must accept yours .
In this respect , ladies and gentlemen , please be assured that you can count on me , at least on my good will .
The barometer of European public opinion , published in recent days in various newspapers , illustrates the schizophrenia we face .
I would like to appeal to the Swedish Presidency .
We shall have to wait and see what changes are introduced into the Treaty .
I would urge the Council to become involved in this first phase , which you have to begin and end at Laeken , during which we have to determine the method we can use to make progress , and consider not just the future of the Union but the future of the enlarged Union because , post-Nice , those countries are already on side and they must learn how we operate , which is no mean feat .
That brings me , Madam President , to what really is my final point , to say that you could have added another E to the European process , and I say this as a Spaniard , and that would be the Spanish word for 'hope ' - esperanza .
Having said that , when discussing the Europe of values , you referred to the need to export the system of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to third countries .
In many cases , this is a consequence of the application of fundamentalist laws or the carrying-out of ancestral practices and traditions .
Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , in the past , Parliament has continually demonstrated its commitment to the harmonisation of safety standards at the highest possible level for the Union .
Of course , the Commission hopes that the negotiators representing the operators and the crews will be successful , and Mr Simpson has urged them to reach a voluntary agreement on safety systems relating to flight and duty times and rest periods .
Various amendments have also been adopted on the requirements applicable to cabin crews .
Lastly , with regard to Amendment No 18 , the two issues it addresses are concerned more with the health of passengers than the operational safety of flights .
Furthermore , the Commission communication on priorities in road safety contains six points detailing the aspects on which we can have the greatest impact in order to achieve better results .
We must now be bold .
I would also like to express my gratitude to all of you who have spoken , who have given voice to your opinions and who have enriched this debate .
Because it is clear that the establishment of specific objectives - as we have seen in those countries which have adopted them - provides a stimulus and has the effect of a psychological incentive on the authorities , which leads to them exercising better control and therefore to a reduction in accidents .
I thought that this was at a more advanced stage .
What I mean to point out is that it is a fact , an objective fact , that Great Britain , with a limit of 0.8 , is the country with the second lowest number of accidents in the Union .
Do not tell me that the United Kingdom wants a European directive to resolve a problem in Great Britain because I would not believe it .
They do not have until 2002 , Mr Watts , but until June 2001 .
In any event , I am counting on your cooperation , your help and your support , and I congratulate the rapporteur once again .
The Commission intends to continue supporting intermodal transport , through research in the framework programmes for technological research and development and also by extending and enlarging the pilot actions for combined transport ( the PACTs ) .
The work that we have undertaken has confirmed that the knowledge , systems and technologies exist in Europe to carry out this type of activity , which facilitates the safe and durable transport of goods .
I would like to highlight two of these factors , the ones which lead me to support the rest of his proposals .
The time has therefore come to tame the automobile .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Costa for his magnificent report and all the speakers for participating in this debate .
The Commission believes that the lack of coordination in fiscal policies , the lack of coordination in Member States ' charging , hinders the efficiency of transport operations and restricts the development of the single market and economic integration .
Whatever the treatment of the different means of transport , it imposes real costs on European companies and on society in general .
We agree with the majority of the report - and we would like to support it totally - with the exception of the specific reference to establishing fixed obligatory quotas , because that could create added problems for women themselves .
Parity democracy , which we have been talking about for many years , is an instrument which is intended , through balanced representation , to put an end to the model of structural power which has kept women out of the decision-making process .
Madam President , last Monday I took the floor to give evidence to the honourable Members of this House on the recent decision of the Spanish government granting clemency to fourteen torturers .
Members of the Commission , let us see if , this time , we can make it on time
