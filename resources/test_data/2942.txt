outrageous is for the Commission to propose privatisation through the back door .
But what is really inexcusable is for the British Conservatives to support the European Commission 's plans to decimate our postal system in the United Kingdom .
It will be a triple blow to Britain and a triple blow in particular to rural Britain : an end to the daily delivery and collection ; an end to the uniform price - people in rural areas will pay more for their post ; and third and finally , an end to our extensive and excellent network of rural sub-post offices .
I appeal directly to the British Conservatives .
Maybe do not listen to us , but listen to the Women 's Institute in the United Kingdom , listen to the Council for the Protection of Rural England , listen even to the Countryside Alliance .
All of them are backing Mr Simpson and opposing your party 's views on this matter .
I hope that you and your friends can join with Labour in standing up for rural Britain by opposing the European Commission 's plans .
Mr President , it is a waste of time : there are none so deaf as those who will not listen .
Mr President , for perplexed observers such as myself , this issue is moving from the bizarre to the surreal .
We seem to be faced with one series of proposals and counter-proposals after another , dealing with a transitional regime in which the Commission first proposes tariff rate quotas based on historical periods , reference periods , but then moves to a 'first-come , first-served ' calculation .
Meanwhile , the US first condemns historical reference periods but now advocates its own historical reference periods .
It has become extremely difficult to follow .
For that reason , amongst many others , I will not comment on the bulk of Mr Dary 's report but will try and focus on one issue of principle .
Whatever the transitional regime is - whether we go for a tariff rate quota and a licensing system which uses the so-called first-come-first-served system or the historical reference periods , whether it is before or after 1993 - we have to start accepting that this is a transitional regime which will at some point have to be replaced by a WTO-compatible 'tariff only ' system .
We cannot continue year in , year out to avoid our international obligations .
The question is why ?
Mr Dary suggested that if we were to move towards a 'tariff only ' WTO system we would somehow be surrendering ourselves to chaotic commercial forces .
The truth is quite the reverse .
The WTO is a set of rules .
It is actually an inhibition on chaos because it tries to institute rules which we all abide by .
The European Union has an overwhelming strategic interest to ensure that those rules are reinforced and not weakened , because if we weaken the WTO or the rule of law , who will win ?
It will be the big guys like the United States ; it will be might is right ; it will be brute commercial force that will win through .
So I urge you , let us agree on what the transitional arrangement will be according to Mr Dary 's report .
But let us not turn our backs , as is suggested in Amendment No 11 , on the idea that we must eventually move to a 'tariff only ' system .
Mr President , the rapporteur deserves thanks and some sympathy for handling this difficult report .
It is almost impossible to reconcile the conflicting commercial interests and the dispute with the WTO , but the rapporteur and the committee Chairman have worked hard to produce a report which provides the Commission and the Council with a more realistic negotiating brief .
I hope that the Commission will respond positively to the amendments , not with the blanket negative view of the last debate , and will acknowledge that each amendment represents legitimate concerns .
There are already indications that the Commission 's first-come-first-served proposals are easing the negotiating process and that past trading volumes may yet be an element in the final outcome .
The dispute with the WTO has resulted in retaliatory trade sanctions and it is not easy to explain this to the exporters in Member States who are affected in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors .
Our objective must be to achieve a revised banana regime that will be accepted at the WTO and reflect the EU commitment to the ACP and the most vulnerable suppliers in the Caribbean .
Successive WTO rulings do not say that we cannot give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers .
The trick is how .
The Commission must demonstrate that their needs will be addressed .
It is not comfortable to accept the growth of trade liberalisation and a 'tariff only ' system in the future , as the Commission has concluded , but it must be faced .
The higher the tariff that can be negotiated , the less we will need other measures to help the ACP and the Caribbean .
I believe that speeding up the negotiations gives the best guarantee of an acceptable tariff level , and for this reason , above all others , I call for full support for this report .
Mr President , as previous speakers have said , the time has come to find a workable solution to this problem , as well as a solution which is WTO-compliant .
Far too often in the past , the WTO has ruled against us .
I represent industries in my Member State , the UK, which have fallen foul of US retaliatory action , where Mrs Barshefsky , the US trade secretary , has decided to impose 100 % increases in import tariffs on Scottish companies .
