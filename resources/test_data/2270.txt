Julius Nyrere , one of Africa ' s most famous teachers , in those post-independence , optimistic days , said education is not a way of escaping poverty , it is a way of fighting it .
Some of you may be aware that Julius Nyrere spent his spare time translating Shakespeare into Swahili .
But that man ' s wonderful dreams were lost .
He lived to see one third of African men illiterate and two thirds of African women .
I urge the Commission and the Council to make the link between poverty eradication and basic education .
The benefits for us all will be seen in increased child life expectancy , cuts in population growth and improvements in farm production .
We have the blueprints and I urge all of those with the political will to take action , to deliver for the children of Africa .
Mr President , the first EU-Africa summit was an important event and had a great deal of potential for taking meaningful steps to reduce the marginalisation of African countries .
So it is a pity that a number of things prevented that potential from being fully realised .
Firstly , neither the European Parliament nor the EU-ACP Joint Assembly was invited to participate in the summit .
Secondly , it is very sad that civil society was not able to have a greater input into the meeting .
The NGOs from the EU and African countries took this summit very seriously and it was a missed opportunity not to engage in more meaningful dialogue with them .
Civil society has a key role to play in Africa ' s development process .
Finally , this meeting could have resulted in a far-reaching action plan of concrete actions .
What we have is a plan full of warm words and good intentions but short on firm commitments , in particular on trade issues .
While it is nice to recall the EU' s important decision to grant duty-free access for essentially all products , it would have been even more significant to have gone beyond the famous "essentially all " to include those products of real importance to the poorest countries , such as agricultural goods .
Finally - sadly - commodity prices were conspicuous by their absence from this agenda .
A majority of African countries are overwhelmingly dependent on just one or two commodities for the bulk of their foreign exchange earnings .
Until action is taken to reverse the fall of commodity prices , poverty in Africa will not be properly addressed .
Mr President , ordinary people in most African countries are poorer today than when their countries became independent .
Poverty , therefore , is a disease inflicted upon innocent populations by evil dictators , greedy and corrupt politicians .
Natural disasters , including climate change , have aggravated the problem .
The Touareg in the desert in northern Niger , the Makonde in Tanzania or Mozambique take their families and put their meagre possessions in a little basket if they wish to move .
They are poor , insecure and exposed to the elements .
They have no water , sanitation , energy , medicine , education or reliable shelter .
Such desperate people cannot think of democracy and human rights in the way we do from our houses and leafy suburbs in the West .
They have no stake in their village , regional or national economies .
Such rootless people , desperate people , are easy prey to evil political manipulation , and that is why we see so much conflict and civil unrest in those countries .
We here in this Assembly offer these people open and free access to our EU markets .
We invite them to be part of the global economy , so that they can come and sit at the tables in Seattle for the WTO discussions .
What does this mean to these poor people , the majority of whom live in the bush , who have no knowledge , no means of efficient cultivation , harvesting , processing , packaging even what little they grow ?
They cannot even market it in their own countries let alone sell it abroad .
So I suggest , let us teach them to be self-reliant and independent , by teaching them the means to grow and harvest what there is in those countries .
Let us give them the technology transfer that makes sense , before we say our markets are open to them .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate the Commissioner on the progress he has made on the rapid reaction unit .
I should like to ask the Commissioner a couple of questions .
Firstly , although I recognise that he wants to keep the budget small and use existing instruments , is he satisfied that the budget in category 4 is sufficient for the special rapid reaction unit to be able to carry out its objectives over the course of a financial year ?
Secondly , concerning coordination : what will the relationship be between this unit and the European Union special envoys ?
One of the problems we had with Kosovo was not just coordination within the Commission but also coordination among the Member States of the actions they took as individual governments .
What relationship will you be able to have with Member States in order to ensure coordination of their independent activities ?
I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for an excellent exposition of the rapid reaction facility .
It is much needed .
I should like to ask him how he envisages disaster relief of the kind that was needed in Mozambique recently - how would this rapid reaction facility liaise and collaborate with Member States ' armies and navies ?
Would he also consider whether he would extend the call for help - if
