will , however , be vital for all nations that fish tuna in the regions under surveillance to be committed to the action proposed and for surveillance to continue to be effective .
I witnessed the situation when Mrs Green , Miss McIntosh and two other colleagues were not accepted on the flight from Paris to Strasbourg due to mismanagement by Air France .
I almost did not get on the flight because it was overbooked .
We need to look into this situation as it affects all countries , and the management of connecting flights to this otherwise beautiful town .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs of all the reports , and in particular Mr Elles for his outspoken and unbiassed report .
I believe Mr Elles has highlighted some serious issues .
That is why developing a computerized system would be of great advantage to Member States , but the Commission has to take responsibility for it .
That is why the least we can ask is that EU internal administration should be in good shape ; then we have to turn our attention to the administration of programmes .
Fraud is very possible when the most important task for member countries seems to be to minimize its net costs , while maximizing its income .
Furthermore , relations between Parliament and the Court of Auditors seem very bureaucratic .
Parliament has systematically argued for the European Development Fund to be included in the general budget , but to no avail .
And we could endorse that with a rubber stamp , hopefully without arousing Parliament 's whole bureaucratic machine .
This was because the outcome of the vote on Article 4 , on the subject of national airport networks , would be , from our standpoint , unworkable .
As a result , compensatory payments made in respect of national airport networks will be restricted to domestic flights .
As this essential point in the report has now become distorted , the Liberal group felt they had to abstain from voting .
Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Pronk on his report , and on the fact that he has succeeded , in quite a short space of time , in coming to grips with the essentials in this matter and making important and worthwhile changes to the Commission 's proposal .
Hopefully the Commission will be willing to accept them .
This represents that broad interpretation of the notion of innovation that is needed .
The small companies I allude to are often firms in which women mainly work .
Women are inexperienced as entrepreneurs and they lack information on funding opportunities .
This is very important .
But this should not mean that complete transparency must not prevail , as state aid can seriously distort competition .
I can thus give a great deal of support to the rapporteur in her desire to make the state aid process more open .
As we know , many firms have learnt to get Member States and regions to compete , and this has an exceedingly unfavourable effect on the public economy .
And why ?
Well , when the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was discussing its report , it had , in accordance with good practice , asked for the opinions of others , such as the REX committee .
The committee voted in the morning and only received the opinion it had asked for in the afternoon , at least as far as the REX committee was concerned .
My question is : what is the point of asking for opinions unless they can be relied upon to materialize and taken notice of ?
When we vote on the report in tomorrow 's sitting , COREPER will have already started its debate on the issue ; it did so last Thursday , to be precise .
The situation is an irritating aspect of Parliamentarianism , especially as it has happened again and again and will happen , I suppose , in the future also .
I wish the Bureau would look into this seriously .
As to the issue we are debating here , I will briefly state that shipyard aid has come to the end of the road .
The USA , for its part , must accept the OECD agreement .
Mr Sindal 's report , however , is turning into something that is unfortunately dividing the southern and northern European states .
Many of our friends in Spain , for example , have been very concerned about possible cuts to aid , and that is quite understandable .
We have lost some , but the sturdier ones have remained , and they are competitive .
The Commission , in its estimation , however , is rather gratuitously optimistic .
The present jungle of aid to shipbuilding has led to unfair competitive advantages between one European shipyard and another .
Aid that differs from country to country and region to region , like regional aid and aid for structural change , is now making the status of the different European shipyards a variable factor .
I myself proposed an amendment to this report , in which I suggested the checking of the overlapping of aid and variable aid systems for the years 1999-2000 .
My proposal for an amendment did not , however , get any response , even from my own group , and thus I did not consider it wise to present it to you here .
They are high-tech products , and that is what we Europeans have to face up to .
That would be consistent with the OECD agreement .
The report shows just how much expert knowledge she gained in her splendid work as Secretary-General of the Council of Europe .
Russia has a key role in EU foreign relations
