The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against this report , which secures a guaranteed level of poverty for the workers and maximum profits for big business , which is getting stronger and stronger and intends to demolish workers rights and make part-time work the rule .
The only way forward we can accept is the peace process which , apart from anything else , is combined with changes urgently needed to Colombian society if it is to avoid going down the same road as Argentina .
However , as you and I well know , ladies and gentlemen , violence begets violence , and more violence and yet more violence .
These demonstrations are a sign of optimism and show that the grass-roots movement is stepping up its fight to overturn this anti-grass roots policy .
However , they are united on the Middle East , declaring that the Palestinian Authority bears full responsibility for combating terrorism and making friendly overtures towards Israel .
Mr President , may I inform the House that the international convention held in Nicosia on 5 and 6 March , to express solidarity with the Palestinian people and attended by 43 left-wing and other parties and organisations from 22 countries , adopted a resolution condemning Israel 's all-out attack on the Palestinian people , the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian leadership . ?his resolution also expressed solidarity with the peaceful forces of Israel and called on the international community , and the permanent members of the UN Security Council , the European Union and the Arab League in particular , to exert pressure on Israel to comply with both the recent and not so recent resolutions of the United Nations .
Under these tragic circumstances , our failure to condemn Israel and our silence make us accessories to the crime of genocide of the Palestinian people and murderers of peace .
Brawls are no longer led by wild crowds of fans , they are led by organised mafias using fanaticism and violence to serve specific illegal purposes which have nothing to do with the love of sport .
This being the case , we cannot create a European area of freedom , security and justice unless we first create a network of information points and reinforce police and judicial cooperation between the 15 Member States in order to suppress violence at football matches .
The Deprez report is supposedly intended to deal with the problem of violence at international football matches .
In other words , it is caused by situations which derive from the very nature of the capitalist system and neither the Council nor the European Parliament texts under debate makes any reference whatsoever to these serious issues .
It is clear to the Communist Party of Greece and other peace-loving forces in Greece that this policy does not foster peace .
That goes without saying .
We have no guarantee of any such complete concurrence .
I am not sure what .
The question of an independent European defence policy is not a local Greek problem and it would be ridiculous to assume that it is .
Mr President , while we sit here debating , a tragedy is unfolding in Palestine : a humanitarian as well as a political tragedy .
At this stage , sitting on the fence - or going nowhere near the fence - is tantamount to complicity .
I trust that Mr Powell 's opinion will sit with Mr Bush 's opinion and Mr Rumsfeld 's opinion and Mr Cheney 's opinion .
The Commission 's initial proposal contained positive arrangements to improve safety at sea and reduce the danger of pollution from accidents .
However , a number of questions have yet to be settled and I therefore think we are right - and this is the point of the nine amendments approved in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism - to insist on keeping to a specific approach to point the way both to the Commission and to the Council .
We have tried in Amendment No 2 to take a more realistic approach to the cost of pollution or damage which the accommodating port may sustain ; obviously ports will be more willing to accommodate ships in distress if they know that they will receive fair and immediate compensation for cleaning-up costs .
Mr President , Mrs de Palacio has demonstrated her legal and political skills and struck the right balance .
The first attempt to grant a European patent was under the Munich Convention .
Everything has been said and a compromise has , I think , been reached .
This would combine the advantages of a strong European patent organisation with the de facto strengths of the national agencies by reason of their geographical proximity , knowledge of local conditions , knowledge of the local language and facility to mediate between the public and private sectors .
Finally , jurisdiction .
Of course we have the usual pronouncements about peace and democracy .
Conditions on the ground , however , as experienced in Cyprus , where 37 % of the island is still occupied , or by the long-suffering people of Palestine , subject to a criminal all-out attack by Israel , unfortunately not just tolerated , but still being funded and armed by the European Union , are somewhat different .
That is why we shall continue to fight against this policy and for a radically different policy to make the Mediterranean an area of peace , mutual benefit and equitable collaboration and coexistence for its people .
No, what we must realise is that the tragedy all around us , with the fight against international terrorism and attempts to establish peace in the Middle East , provide a perfect opportunity for the meeting of ministers in Valencia to demonstrate once and for all that the Member States of the
