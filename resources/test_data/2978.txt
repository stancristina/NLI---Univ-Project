wrong pockets .
We know that the audits have not been followed up .
We know , in other words , that Eurostat’s administration has been scandalous , including after 1999 .
Is anyone taking responsibility , however ?
No, apparently not .
It did so because the Group of Wise Men concluded that it was very difficult to find anyone in the Commission who was willing to take responsibility .
After the fall of the Santer Commission , we have now obtained a new article in the Treaty .
That is something Mr Prodi has chosen not to do , given that the person responsible , Mr Solbes , knew nothing .
That is , in my view and that of my group , reason enough .
Mr Prodi has today presented his action plan for Eurostat .
We want to see results .
We have seen a host of action plans and plans for reform over the last four years .
It is , of course , excellent to have plans for new and better procedures , and we shall naturally give our backing to such procedures .
The culture must be changed .
Irregularities and fraud have consequences .
Fine words , but patently of no consequence .
It was that another Commissioner should be found to take over Eurostat in the last year , with Mr Solbes otherwise retaining his areas of responsibility .
With his passivity , he has been a party to maintaining a culture of systematic disarray and irregularities .
In the same way , we should like to express our sympathy and respect for those who lost their lives in the attacks on the synagogues in Turkey .
The western world must stand united in combating terrorism .
I should also like to talk about Commission President Prodi’s statement on the Eurostat scandal .
Mr Prodi has reported on everything that does not work , referring to the lack of communication between the Commission and the control bodies , the OLAF internal audit , Parliament etc .
In all normal democracies , the political systems and administrations are developed in such a way that embezzlement and fraud are prevented or discovered very quickly .
This can only be interpreted as an expression of total incompetence on the part of the Commission and as a lack of will in a system characterised by a down-at-heel administrative culture .
Someone has known about the scandal for a very long time , and someone has wished to conceal it .
How , then , will he explain the fact that the press and the European Parliament knew about the Eurostat scandal a good year before MEPs forced the Commission to act .
There are three possible explanations : either the Commission gave OLAF’s director completely fatuous instructions , with the result that he did not keep the Commission informed ; or the Commission wished to leave unpleasant matters on the back burner for years in a secretive OLAF ; or OLAF’s management is appallingly naive and does not understand the political necessity of sounding the alarm bells so that the Commission is warned of serious fraud .
Mr Prodi says that he has now taken some tough decisions .
No, Mr Prodi , you have not .
You bear full responsibility .
Who bears political responsibility for the Eurostat scandal ?
The most serious scandal is that we have an accounting system that still makes embezzlement possible .
They have asked for 78 contracts but only received 60 .
Where are those 18 missing contracts ?
Who will obtain them ?
There must of course be copies of the contracts in all the firms .
Why have they not been obtained straight away , and where are the banks ’ copies for the secret accounts ?
Who is taking responsibility for ensuring that all the documents in proof now come to light ?
Up until now , however , zero tolerance has been shown first and foremost to those who have revealed fraud and warned against the accounting system that permits it .
They were quickly and resolutely frozen out .
When will you say to Mr Solbes : ‘Pedro , you are not perhaps the guilty party , but Eurostat is your responsibility .
I accept Mr Blak’s proposal and assume responsibility myself for providing a full explanation of the Eurostat scandal’ .     Mr President , to begin with , I should like to say how encouraging it is that Commission President Prodi and the Commission have apparently learned from the Eurostat case , that there are a number of things that are to be tidied up and that a number of reforms are to be implemented so that nothing similar happens in the future .
It is important for us to have a strong and independent OLAF .
It is particularly important for us to have a clear definition of political responsibility .
I think , in actual fact , that political responsibility is of crucial importance and , what is more , political responsibility borne by the individual Commissioner .
I therefore listened , of course , with great attention to Mr Prodi’s remark that we are now to have a definition of political responsibility .
We are now also to have a monitoring unit for picking up signals if something goes wrong .
My question , however , is this : what kind of signals is this group to pick up ?
None of the important changes adopted by Parliament at second reading of the Commission ’s proposal can in any way be found in the conciliation document .
Furthermore , liberalisation now also extends to include the pilots .
Both will be free to choose whom they want to work for them , and they will be able to use unorganised and underpaid labour for loading and unloading ships , rather than use well-trained port workers who , through agreements , have secured their entitlement to the work and to proper conditions .
