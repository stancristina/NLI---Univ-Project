Mr President , I do not have time to expand further .
With regard to the taxes on the use of the infrastructures , which in the end will be paid by the users , we suggest that , in the short to medium term , these only reflect the marginal costs generated by the rail traffic itself and not those involving the recuperation of investment and maintenance , which should be covered by state budgets , as in the case of roads and motorways .
I would like to say that what is clear to most of us is that things cannot continue as they are : with closed public systems , which are national , confined within national borders , which are leading to a situation where the railway , day after day , is losing its share of the market in goods transport and in the transportation of persons as well , with the exception of a very specific form of transport , that is , high speed trains and suburban trains .
To accept the amendments of both Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda , the vast majority of which correspond much more to the Commission ' s initial proposal and to my own opinions on the whole , would mean disregarding a compromise which was reached with great difficulty in the Council , as you know , after long arguments , after long periods of impasse and stalemate on this issue , which kept us talking into the early hours of the morning .
Amendments Nos 6 , 8 , 9 and 11 , which propose the separation of the operators of infrastructures from the providers of services , clarify the text enormously .
I belong to the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport which , once again , has not been asked to speak on an issue which not only involves legal questions , but should also be subject to consensus in other respects .
We talk of the Europe of research and a Europe of knowledge and then we do not recognise , out of pure fear or pure vested interests , anything that people do outside of their own countries .
I will go further .
The first is decentralisation .
Thirdly , I recommend that you read the conclusions of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , which introduce a cultural dimension , which is very important to the success of this information campaign .
There has been a very intense tug-of-war with the Commission , which led us to urge two of Parliament ' s committee chairpersons , whose work I am grateful for , Mr Napolitano , of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , and Mrs Theato , of the Committee on Budgetary Control , to make progress in the negotiation , especially in relation to the third Annex .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Karas , for his report , and all of you for participating in the debate .
With regard to the Member States , I can tell you that next week I will present the Commission with a report on the practical application of the euro .
This is the reason why we believe that we must pay special attention to companies during this period , as well as to citizens .
Two of them , for the moment , Denmark and the United Kingdom , have not shown any interest in implementing these information campaigns .
Of course , we will have to debate them in the future , when we discuss the budgets for the coming years .
In this respect , there is one good example : four years ago , given the opinion that silicon implants may be carcinogenic , several countries adopted an alternative substance for their manufacture based on soya oil .
It appears that the Commission has interpreted these opinions according to criteria which are no doubt very well intentioned , but which can at best be described as hasty , in light of the audience which took place in the Environment Committee with the scientists responsible for the opinions .
Furthermore , there has been much less research on the substitutes for phthalates than on the phthalates themselves .
The indication of categories is not necessary at all .
I believe that this is a great achievement .
The Brenner is one of the crucial transit routes via the Alps and is therefore a good example of the need to act in a balanced way , with regard to both railways and roads , in order to protect the environment and , at the same time , guarantee the free movement of goods .
Let us remember that EMAS is a voluntary market instrument .
There are two other amendments which I would like to comment on : Amendment No 19 , for which I have requested a separate vote up to the paragraph which reads "public structures and public contracts " , up to this point leaving the Commission ' s text intact .
The European Commission and the Member States committed themselves , on an international level , at the Ministerial Conferences on the protection of the forests in Helsinki , in 1993 , and Strasbourg , in 1990 , to the continuous monitoring of the damage suffered by the forests .
This proposal asks that the Commission be assisted by a standing committee on forests , as it is in many other areas ; that it present an analysis of the application of this regulation with regard to its ecological , economic and social aspects , as well as a cost-benefit evaluation ; that an amendment be included on the Mediterranean forests as a specific ecosystem for the southern countries and because of its importance in combating desertification and erosion
