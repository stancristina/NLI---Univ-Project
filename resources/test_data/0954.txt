It is on that basis that the Liberal Group will vote for the interinstitutional agreement because it will achieve not simply more money but more rights and more parity .
This point was repeatedly on the agenda at the subsequent trialogue meetings , and the Council presidency in particular expressed understanding for the European Parliament 's objections .
My conclusion is that all the EU bodies have the same desire to achieve successful accessions as soon as possible .
I do not believe anyone can ever be 100 % right in these complex negotiations .
The second question concerns accompanying measures and rural development , where different rules apply .
Mr President , I would like to repeat a question I asked earlier and the answer can be just 'yes ' or 'no ' . My question was whether the flexibility of 200 million and 0.03 % applies to all the categories of the budget , including category 1 .
The Council has succeeded in drawing up an efficient multiannual budget , thus creating the financial scope for enlargement .
This too should be acknowledged .
I very much welcome them both .
We will have no credibility in the eyes of the people of Europe if on the one hand we say we want to exercise control over a number of problems and will make money available to do it , and then allow that money to disappear into the pockets of organisations and individuals who are not entitled to it .
They lie at its very heart and consist of much more than the acquis communautaire .
Part of this is also the attempt to get the applicant countries involved in European political union , which is gaining a higher profile because of the emphasis on political criteria .
Mr President , you may well say that we are reforming the Structural Funds at the very last moment .
So there were two too many .
There is also the matter of social security .
The PPE has confidence in the social partners , is ready to let them take on the job , which is why we also want to accept this , we want to improve the procedure , but that is as far as it should go .
We do not need to study everything agreed by the social partners in minute detail .
It means that the Commission 's role remains unchanged but becomes somewhat easier as it is no longer faced with the united front of the Member States saying that they want to go back to the common position agreed earlier .
Article 1 includes an exception , but there is a difference in interpretation between myself and your services on the one hand , and the English authorities on the other .
I thank you very much for that .
I actually voted in favour .
First and foremost yet again , Mr President-in-Office , there is the role that Parliament has played .
This is all about democratic control , because Parliament has a number of comments to make on the substance of the agreement too .
I would therefore like to ask the Council for clearer information on this .
There are 500 000 displaced people in Kosovo , but does Europe have an asylum policy ?
Take Parliament seriously and stop rejecting everything so high-handedly .
However , we are still in the dark about the details .
Does it take the form of directives or regulations ?
A great deal of decisiveness is still needed and there is still a large amount of work to be done .
This is the only way to make people confident enough to get involved in this form of commerce .
There is a contradiction here .
But in practice the protection of human rights in Mexico is still far from perfect , as we can see from the unlawful executions and the continuing gang warfare in Chiapas .
It would appear to be absolutely vital to send in a UN policing force immediately .
There are a number of general points I would like to make .
Mr President , the Palestinian authorities are to be praised for their decision to accept an extension of the transitional period beyond 4 May .
During an earlier debate , the Commission told us that a management team had been sent to open the hospital at long last .
However , the Palestinian position calls for an immediate and positive continuation of the negotiations with the Israelis after the elections .
I also still think that a final positive outcome can only be achieved after agreements have been concluded with Syria and Lebanon .
We have never tried to put a positive spin on his activities or his aims , and we only hope that the Turkish Government will ensure that his trial is open and fair , although we do not feel exactly optimistic about this .
Applause
I hope there is a politician or perhaps a former Commissioner somewhere who could draw up such a plan so that , having left office , he can help to bring the Turks and the Kurds closer together .
We should make it clear to them that we cannot provide any financial assistance whatsoever if they spend it on arms which they then use to wage war and even to oppress their own people , particularly the Afar tribe .
Because there are question marks about the economic feasibility of Temelin , I do not think that we can take a decision yet , but we must work with the Czech Government to find the right solution .
This is why many in my group feel that it would not be right to single out the Czech Republic , particularly when this issue has already been covered in much greater depth and in a more appropriate context in the Adam report .
I myself have a personal
