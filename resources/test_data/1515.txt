all cities , above all the big cities with traffic problems .
Honourable Member , the question is an extremely delicate one : if Mr Albertini , who is always very generous , would like to buy us a coffee , we could discuss it and hear the experience of a mayor of a large European city .
You have to look at where the perimeter would be .
Madam President , thank you for the question .
This is important .
After many years of silence , testimonies of the suffering call for our attention , together with the accounts of many survivors who found themselves caught up in that terrible event .
Out of those same tragedies and catastrophes , however , sprung forth the democracies of Europe and , in the last fifty years , a season of peace has been built on those ruins , a peace that we have a duty to defend , and to carry beyond the borders of the Union : fifty years of peace that have been the greatest achievement of a united Europe .
The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in these important efforts .
I read it as though it were a sort of secular prayer , a remembrance for millions of victims , with which to associate the memory of so many other innocent victims whose sacrifice , I say again , must not be in vain for Europe .
The dead lay in the courtyards and in the end stayed in their huts .
For example , the directive will oblige airports to consult the airlines before taking decisions with regard to airport charges .
I am very pleased that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has also unanimously supported this agreement .
There are seven regional airports being considered .
Lastly , I feel I have a duty to express my opposition to those amendments providing substantial cuts to European funds for the regions of southern Italy : this is not the way to achieve European integration , even if fund management in these areas could be better .
I welcome the call on the Somali Transitional Government , in collaboration with the United Nations and the African Union , to treat piracy and armed robbery committed from the Somali coast against vessels carrying humanitarian aid as criminal acts to be pursued by arresting the perpetrators under existing international law .
Why then do we return to look at it again in such breadth and depth today ?
There are many reasons : firstly because we refuse to accept its widespread non-application , to which all the statistics bear witness , and secondly because we believe that the extreme injustice suffered by women in all countries of the European Union and in all professions , at all levels and in all sectors absolutely must be tackled , and it is in fact obvious that the instruments we possess will not suffice for this , otherwise after all this time we would surely have succeeded in reversing this trend .
We are calling for comparable , effective , consistent and complete data .
The issues that have become central over these last two years are , for Europe , the following two issues , which I would like to stress .
The proposed scheme to promote fruit and vegetables in schools would help to encourage young people to eat fruit and increase consumption .
However , most of all , we are not asking ourselves what lies at the bottom of this crisis and so we are not succeeding in tackling it .
Personally , I believe that even this estimate is optimistic .
The first relates to milk quotas : the one per cent rise , the product of the compromise reached , is really too small a step and is not enough to satisfy the farmers ' legitimate demands .
Mr Gaubert is right in saying that we are facing a demographic crisis in Europe and that we need more immigration .
In Oslo , at the conference to combat the use , production and stockpiling of cluster munitions , a young Lebanese man aged 24 , Ibrahim , whose body had been devastated by wounds , and who had an amputated leg , introduced himself , saying : 'Pleased to meet you , I am a survivor '.
The dead in Iraq , in Afghanistan and in the former Yugoslavia have certainly tested this .
I believe this plan to ban cluster munitions globally to be a matter , as I was saying , that goes to the heart of civilisation and humanity .
I hope that all this work will translate into the ratification of this convention which I believe is one of the most important aspects , in fact , of civilisation and humanity that the European Union can act upon .
The Commission has taken various measures on this issue .
Finally , the financial support supplied by the Commission for awareness-raising campaigns should be stressed .
I repeat now what I said at the hearing at which I gained the confidence of the Commission and Parliament : I will continue to make road safety one of my priorities .
Unfortunately , that is not the case , and we must work with schools , we must work with families , to ensure that all young people are shown the risks that they run every time they sit at the wheel and , above all , if they drink alcohol or take drugs .
With regard to the issue of smoking , I will ask the Commission departments to carry out an investigation to find out whether there are , in fact , additional risks for smokers or not .
In particular , what will be the relation between Community and national communications policies relating to the EU ?
In the midst of all this , what is being done ?
