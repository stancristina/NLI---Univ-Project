Finally , I hope that the information tools that the Commission is now going to be using will be used in a pluralistic way to promote discussion between all those holding different points of view about European integration .
Mr President , enlargement is the most important European project of our time .
Now comes the difficult part , however .
The first wave of enlargement must be completed in one and a half year ' s time in Copenhagen in December 2002 .
I would call upon the next countries to hold the presidency to maintain very close contact with the candidate countries and to help by removing obstacles from the path in time .
We too have to adapt .
An EU of 27 Member States must learn to concentrate its forces upon the major and cross-border tasks .
That is not , of course , what we are doing at present .
You repeated those words several times , and you are right .
Let us have a slimmer , but at the same time stronger , EU.
I propose that you appoint a bold Commissioner to the task of combating trivial extra tasks and petty regulations , and I propose that the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of the Parliaments of the European Union , COSAC , be given the ability to stop legislation that violates the subsidiarity principle .
It might be said that consumers ' interests are society ' s interest in seeing the dissemination of both knowledge and cultural expression rather than the suppression of these and their subordination to the interests of capital .
The first is to ensure the public ' s or consumers ' interest in being able to use both knowledge and culture .
In Denmark , the country I come from , we have a very well developed tradition of youth and adult education , and this must not be interfered with .
The second point is that the systems of enforcement and sanctions that have been developed and are practised in the different legal cultures in the different countries must not be interfered with either .
I can say that I have seldom been exposed to such intensive lobbying as in connection with this proposal , and that is by no means strange .
I might also add that copyright is , of course , among the most complicated aspects of the legal world and that , within the copyright field , the law relating to digital products is practically incomprehensible .
Against this background , it is an interesting fact , and one worth noting , that the proposal has been so balanced that I shall recommend my group to vote in favour of it .
Thank you for your answer , Commissioner .
I nonetheless sense from your answer that there is a very big difference between the status of the individual Member States , as we knew there was before 1 December .
In view of the health situation , a particularly long period ought not to be allowed to elapse , out of consideration for both consumers and farmers .
This is also because , right now , there is distortion of competition between farmers in the individual Member States , because the compensation offered is very different from one country to another .
I hope it will not be the slowest , but the fastest , countries which set the pace , for I am completely convinced that it is in that way that we shall achieve a result in which all the current 15 EU countries have implemented these BSE decisions .
Mr President , the result of the conciliation that we have before us is a substantial improvement upon the rules for the release of GMOs into the environment .
The long-term effects of the many authorisations are also to be looked into .
I think that all this together will make an important contribution to the protection of the environment and the protection of public health .
Firstly , I would ask the Commission to give an assurance today that , whenever we devise vertical legislation in different areas concerned with GMO crops , we also make sure that this vertical legislation respects the general directive we are now adopting on releases into the environment .
On this matter too , however , I would ask that we be given a more detailed explanation of the letter sent by Commissioner Byrne and Commissioner Wallstr√∂m to the members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and stating the desire to provide citizens with better information on GMOs .
It is important for full information to be given and for there not , therefore , to be a system provided in which there are still a whole lot of gaps in the information given to consumers about GMOs .
We are not interested in buying a pig in a poke .
It is important that we obtain real consumer choice and that short measure is not given in this area .
I could also do with an assurance from the Commission that , as has been mentioned , the way to new authorisations will not be opened until the new rules have come into force in 2002 .
However , if the law has not come into force , then it will not , of course , be possible to enforce these rules if the authorised businesses contravene them .
That is the only way we can be sure that it will , in actual fact , also be possible to enforce the rules .
Mr President , I would ask permission to speak regarding the Rules of Procedure .
I am making such a proposal , and the reason why I think the proposal for a directive ought to be considered inadmissible is that it is , in my view , contrary to the Treaty .
Article 152 specifies that incentive measures may
