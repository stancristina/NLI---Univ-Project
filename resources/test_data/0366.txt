The first answer is that the European institutions tend to prioritise everything that is cross-border , which is not surprising , after all .
One can deny reality using words .
So I am glad the Committee on Industry unanimously decided to prioritise a sectoral approach to business , the inevitable choice for identifying as precisely as possible the real and specific needs of businesses whose disparity lends itself poorly to a horizontal approach .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you in advance for supporting my report .
I have also asked that actions geared to specific groups like women , young people and the social economy sectors be encouraged , not forgetting employee participation in the life of these SMEs in general .
Turning now to SMIs/SMEs and micro-enterprises .
For an SME/SMI , working with this European network would undoubtedly mean that , where synergies exists , it would not have to form a consortium with several other businesses in different Union countries , which often results in an artificial set-up with masses of paperwork and endless complications .
The national governments , and even the regional and local authorities , already act as gigantic finance pumps to siphon off taxpayers ' money , that is to say the amounts levied on the majority of the population including the most disadvantaged , and pour this into big business and thence to proprietors and shareholders .
Account should be taken of that in implementing the programme but there are no grounds for mentioning them separately in the legislative text .
We also need to give careful thought to the level of European governance best adapted to the various initiatives .
We would actually like the Commission to give us more details on the proper application of this principle for each proposal , so that a real balance sheet can be drawn up at the time of the annual report .
( FR ) Mr President , forgive me for interrupting the sitting , but the news reaching us from the Ivory Coast is extremely grave , with civil war breaking out at this very moment between supporters of Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara .
The Commission is optimistic that it will be possible to establish a balanced partnership with Morocco .
Champions of generosity and of the third world , they are discovering what Chairman Mao called 'the difference between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions ' .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would simply like to add that there are clearly agreements between the two parties to establish a timetable for negotiations and that Morocco has spent months preparing its five-year plan .
More particularly , following the decisions of the Court of Justice of 1989 and 1993 - the Allu√© case - which ruled that the limitations on the duration of employment contracts of foreign-language assistants imposed by the Italian government were discriminatory , the Commission took a number of steps .
If the Italian legal system is reformed and modified , as it was in respect of academic teaching staff , we do not think that the Commission can intervene given that every European citizen has equal access to all categories of professions .
The Commission did its job in bringing the infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice and the Italian State changed the law .
Factors such as globalisation can be seen to have enhanced the possibilities of laundering dirty money and the means of avoiding prosecution .
Furthermore , Article 8 of the draft Convention limits the reasons which Member States may invoke for refusing to provide assistance to "essential interests " .
But this will not provide us with firmer guarantees on the right of defence and the protection of citizens ' rights .
Ladies and gentlemen , although the need for a future European public prosecution service would not seem to pose a problem in the long run , that of harmonising our policies on the protection of citizens ' rights and establishing a criminal procedure par excellence would seem to be more than essential .
I say to you quite candidly that I fail to understand how this initiative for judicial cooperation at the level of Eurojust can be seen as an attack on , or a threat to , the guaranteeing and protection of fundamental rights .
In this area we can indeed talk of a European public prosecutor .
The report will play its part in the appraisal of the way the situation is developing and of working practices .
The new type of research contract now sets out in detail all the financial and administrative considerations , with more clearly-defined responsibilities for participants and a better-documented negotiation procedure .
In this regard , you should know that in connection with point 74 of the White Paper on Reform , the Commission ' s services are already in the process of introducing a central register of contracts concluded by the Commission , which will subsequently be linked to all the Commission ' s financial information systems .
As far as the Agriculture DG is concerned , the problem has been resolved by transferring the relevant team to the Directorate-General for Research .
As you know , this position is in line with that adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Biarritz European Council who unanimously and unreservedly approved the Charter , and I can only urge you , therefore , on behalf of the Council , to follow suit , perhaps giving you a few reasons to do so .
Firstly , it precisely restates the fundamental rights laid down , in the main , in the European Convention on Human Rights .
I shall also stress Article 23 , which is particularly clear in stipulating equality between men and women , and stating that this must be ensured in all areas , and that the principle of equality shall not prevent the adoption of measures providing
