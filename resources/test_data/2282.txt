to find ways of solving environmental problems and the difficulties caused by traffic jams .
Competition is also really needed in this industry .
There should be some room for flexibility in the application to enable Member States to retain any proven procedures that they have applied previously .
This is corroborated by an amendment relating to Article 3 , item c.
Arguments relating to transport safety and to minimising the number of accidents are also in favour of the public transport option .
Such solutions should be practically oriented and they should be implemented in cooperation with local and regional operators .
It is difficult to understand that competition is seen as the only way to achieve this goal .
Competition is a good servant but a poor master , and one should always consider separately in each individual case whether competition is the only way to increase cost-effectiveness and to improve services and make them more efficient .
In addition , I am of the opinion that the proven methods that various Member States have used in the past in connection with public transport should be taken into consideration in this context : it must be possible to retain the licensing procedure that has been found to be so good and cost-effective in Finland .
Sabena is a warning example of the kind of inefficiency that centrally managed industrial policies can produce in the worst possible case .
Although I am in favour of the inclusion of all major ports , I can , nevertheless , give my support to Amendment 79 proposed by Mr Atkins .
We must not forget that British exporters benefit from reasonably priced port services in continental Europe .
The numbers of port operators should not be restricted except for compelling reasons .
This is a reason why Amendments 6 , 25 and 44 should not be seconded .
As regards pilotage , we , the members of the committee , concluded that strict national rules should apply .
Cargo handling and pilotage , based on national rules , should be included , absolutely .
We cannot change Europe into a giant Hamburg .
The committee has reached a good compromise and we should clearly stick to that .
Now we have a good opportunity to do a favour to European employment and sustainable development .
Mr President , we have just been discussing minor languages .
The latter stipulates that the CE marking should be incorporated in a number of directives on technical harmonisation that apply to specific industries .
The manufacturer is responsible for affixing the CE conformity marking , although the directives often require the intervention of a third party conformity assessment body .
Member States are responsible for the designation of such bodies in accordance with the applicable provisions of the directives .
However , the Commission does not directly intervene in the evaluation of product conformity , nor in the award of the CE conformity marking .
In an earlier reply to a written question in 1997 , the Commission noted that a wide variety of equipment could potentially be used for purposes of torture .
Nevertheless , to take account of the concerns of Members of Parliament and many others who have written to me on the issue , the Commission , in particular the External Relations DG , is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or for cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .
Mr President , I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Chichester , the rapporteur , for his significant work in preparing this matter .
Its chances of influencing the matter are restricted to the demand , and hence to the promotion of energy saving in the construction and transport industries .
In particular , research into and the use of renewable energy sources must be promoted .
Also , energy projects that serve common European objectives are an excellent way of putting into specific terms the EU' s policies on the Northern Dimension .
Honourable Member of the Commission , I propose that the Commission take swift measures in order to get this northern gas to balance our energy situation .
A great deal of attention in this presentation has been given to lignite .
Nevertheless , peat is an important fuel component in remote areas , and it is also a regional fuel .
We must greatly enhance energy efficiency in buildings because that is where there really is a great deal of room for improvement .
The Commission proposes so-called horizontal activities , in which it will be very difficult for small and medium-size enterprises to participate , at least at the initial stages .
Therefore it is necessary to make adjustments approved by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy to the direction that the already existing Craft programme arrangements will continue to take .
Enterprises have already become used to these measures , which have produced plenty of good results .
A share of 15 % funding from enterprises has been proposed .
Mr President , this proposed amendment works perfectly well as an addition , and can therefore be voted on as an addition .
The remaining items will be held over to the vote tomorrow .
The directive proposal we have in front of us now allows insurance intermediaries to operate also in other Member States .
We ensure that insurance intermediaries have the necessary professional competence , liability insurance or other equivalent insurance as well as adequate financial capacity .
Our committee has made several amendments , which according to the opinion of expert advisors clearly make the directive more sensible and give Member States the option to make decisions in consideration of national circumstances .
By this I mean in particular , travel agencies , who also offer their customers travel insurance as part of a travel package
