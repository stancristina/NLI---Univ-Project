compensation for price reductions by means of direct payments and especially with the supplementary subsidy of EUR 5 per tonne for the less favoured regions .
Farm production has always entailed positive externalities for the development of the rural world , contributing to job creation , to the development of other upstream economic activities , to regional planning , the preservation of the environment , the landscape and the cultural heritage .
.
( PT ) I believe that multifunctionality in farming must have a place in the process of reforming the CAP , and I think that the Council and the Commission must accept this idea .
I have therefore voted in favour of the report .
One of the main ideas expressed in the initiative is that - despite the individual changes to the constitution and to legislation that these organisations have welcomed , although in practice some have not really been applied - we must not soften our condemnation of the violence and arbitrary behaviour by the Turkish authorities , and we must step up our solidarity with all those who resist and fight .
Hence the need for clarification , specifically in defining the matters to which it should apply ; in mobilising all national players to ensure that participation in the process is not wholly confined to a small elite ; in coordinating it with other Community instruments , making this method a complement to legislation and not 'alternative legislation in disguise ' .
( PT ) I have voted in favour of the report , and welcome the initiative by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
This approach could lead to genuine convergence and could benefit everyone , without entailing the more or less imposed nature of legislation .
Women 's participation must be promoted in positions of leadership , in technical and medical teams and on refereeing and adjudication boards .

The risk of developing breast cancer is 60 % higher in Western Europe than in Eastern Europe , hence the proposal to create , by 2008 , the conditions required for a 25 % reduction in the average breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU.
( PT ) I congratulate the rapporteur on this report , which is so important and timely .
Having said this , and whilst acknowledging that we should not always declare ourselves against any armed action , all the evidence suggests , as indicated in our joint resolution , that we must do everything possible to bring this armed conflict to an end and to ensure that dialogue reopens between the Indonesian Government and the separatist movements in Aceh , as well as the representatives of Irian Jaya .
The issues that have been raised need to be reiterated : for how long is the Burmese regime going to be able to act with impunity ?
I voted for the amendments advocating the complete rejection of the European Commission 's proposals because I wanted to register politically the fact that the Portuguese people were unhappy and disappointed with the Commission 's original proposals .
For these reasons , I supported most of Parliament 's proposals but abstained from the final vote .
The wave of repression which has crashed down upon Cuba and swept writers , intellectuals and free men into prison must be energetically repelled by this House .
That , however , was not the case .
I am speaking specifically of the Christian topos inscribed and engraved all over our experience .
What can one say , moreover , about the participation of the national parliaments , which have made few really significant advances in terms of their participation in European integration ?
What do I expect from governments , then ?
The Convention did not include representatives of all political parties , only the larger ones .
The latter believe that a few dozen people , far from their countries and the problems and rights of their peoples , may be more easily swayed by the interests of economic and financial elites in the powerful countries which dream of ruling Europe .
He regrets , however , that it could not finally be resolved , as the central hypothesis was not accepted by the majority parties , the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
For these reasons , then , we believe that it is essential to adopt an action plan introducing practical measures aimed at maintaining a harmonious , efficient production line .
Neither fresh cuts nor the removal of non-tariff barriers must be accepted in this sector , except on a reciprocal basis , always taking the tariffs actually imposed as a starting-point rather than those made known to the WTO .
In other words , WTO members will have almost unrestricted access to those markets .
The jobs of 2 000 000 people and total revenues of EUR 200 billion depend on it .
The Portuguese textile and clothing industry is mainly composed of small and medium-sized enterprises , almost exclusively concentrated in the north of the country .
In the specific case of Portugal , the next step should be a round of multilateral negotiations , under the auspices of the Doha Development Agenda , which will then be translated into tariff harmonisation and removal of non-tariff barriers .
The Commissioner 's speech soothed and calmed our worries , but did not banish them completely .
Naturally , Commissioner , Portugal appears anxious and expectant , as do other European regions and countries .
Not , however , to the detriment of the most vulnerable economies and poorest citizens in the European Union .
We believe , then , that this would be the correct procedure if we are to operate democratically and openly .
Mr President , after the Council 's failure to achieve unanimity in 2001 , new perspectives opened up at Nice .
