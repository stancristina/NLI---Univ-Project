responsibility of the Member States , of the regions and the local authorities .
Mr President , I shall convey the messages I have heard here to my colleagues in the Council .
You have spoken of an enduring development , you have spoken of peace and of stability .
What we have heard from the Commission in Parliament has not been a useless act and a worthless spectacle at all , they have been particularly necessary and you yourself have been completely right to demonstrate to us in the last week that elsewhere in Parliament the Executive has not got around to issuing any detailed clarifications .
My group will not unite with those who would like the Commission to be some kind of secretariat to the Council .
So that we can have confidence in your Commission at least until the year 2005 , it must first be confirmed what this new spirit in the relations between the Council and the Commission will come to mean in practice .
We are still waiting for clarification .
The President of the Commission must also commit himself to using his power if there is any Member of the Commission suspected of , or being investigated concerning , misconduct or criminal behaviour .
Concrete measures are needed .
My group also calls for the amendments to the legislative process proposed by a large majority in Parliament to be taken in accordance with the proposals of the Commission in future .
We will also be responsible for including the whole commonwealth of European nations in this process because the upcoming reform of European institutions will guarantee greater rights to the citizens of Europe .
We have not been satisfied with the way in which Parliament has been allowed to participate in international agreements .
Mr Prodi , everyone is talking about glasnost , and transparency , and I believe that you are talking about it sincerely , but the hearings have not convinced me that the individual candidates or even you yourself , as the future President of the Commission would understand what glasnost or transparency really mean in practice .
This is not only necessary so that Parliament is kept informed , but also so that the citizens and all the nations can influence the development of the European Union with an emphasis which is completely fresh .
Now , all the possibilities of steering the actions of the EU are better than ever and the confidence of the citizens is growing in that direction .
As a College , the Commission has affirmed that it is prepared for real reforms through the mouthpiece of its President .
The hard rebuke given to us in the parliamentary elections in June by the citizens of Europe is still fresh in our minds .
The Commission has to move forward at the same pace as the reality of the Member States and their citizens .
Although I did say that all of the opportunities facing us are better than they have been before , I fear that it will not be possible to make use of them .
For the tasks ahead , I also wish the future Commission a long life .
He mentioned the need for rapprochement with the USA , the Mediterranean area and even between religions .
I may have misheard , but I did not detect any reference on his part to the Northern Dimension of the Union , the area from the Barents Sea through northern Russia to the Baltic States and Poland , and also from Scandinavia to northern Germany .
I hope that the problems of this area , as well as the opportunities , enjoy the attention of the Commission .
Commissioner Kinnock truly has a task as great as that of the fabled Hercules when he continues Commissioner Liikanen' s work reforming the structures of the Commission .
This is quite correct when one considers relations with Parliament .
The Soviet Union experienced its own disappearance .
I hope that the Prodi Commission will also focus on perestroika in the Union .
The unyielding Balkan crisis overshadowed the budgetary procedures relating to the fiscal year 2000 .
Efforts such as these also place huge demands on finances .
On the basis of the aforementioned meeting , this matter became the most important issue of the negotiations between the parties with budgetary control in the year 2000 budget procedure .
If the parties concerned are willing , it is however possible to find a solution which is satisfactory for both sides .
The rebuilding of Kosovo , and the solution to the Kosovo question , is the central prerequisite for the success of the budgetary procedure of the fiscal year 2000 .
Similarly for its part , the Union will respond to the financial needs arising from the earthquakes in Greece and Turkey and the needs in East Timor , as I mentioned earlier .
It is important to observe both the framework proposed in the new agreement between official bodies concerning expenditure , and also the detailed procedures contained within it to improve co-operation between official bodies .
This relates to expenditure connected with agriculture and with the agreement on fishing , so that it is possible to take account of new estimates on the need for grants without , however , excluding a reduction in the level of grants in terms of less agricultural expenditure .
Secondly , it has been decided to observe commitments as regards construction tasks .
When we studied the preliminary draft budget in general terms and also the overall growth , we started from the assumption that in preparing the year 2000 budget , at least the same degree of discipline would be observed as in the preparation of national budgets .
In accordance with the above-mentioned principles , agreement has been reached on a number of important decisions of the expenditure category , which I will briefly introduce now
