a different kind or a step backwards after the series of steps forward that that country took a year ago .
Our intention here is to send a clear message to the Iranian authorities and , at the same time , to create the greatest possible degree of consensus within the international community .
What positions do I believe we should take at this time ?
We stated clearly that , according to the report by the observers and in particular by their chief observer , the elections took place in an open , clean and fair manner .
Thirdly , we would like to say to our Palestinian friends ― I have said this personally on several occasions since the elections , and I am able to speak to the President practically every day ― that it would be a very good thing for the new government which emerges following these elections , in three months , also to recognise all of the agreements that the Palestinian Authority has signed over recent years .
I would like to say that what we have before us is going to be a new situation , it is going to be difficult , it is not going to be easy , but I believe that we must remain determined to ensure that this peace process moves forward under the conditions to which I referred before .
In my speech , I called upon the Kosovan political leaders and people in general to show generosity , unity and responsibility at this time so that progress can be made , and I believe that to a certain extent those words , spoken by myself and by others , have been heard : we now have somebody to replace President Rugova , something that I feared was going to take much longer , and who is also going to head the team which , under the direction of Mr Ahtisaari , former President of Finland , will jointly lead the negotiation with our Serbian friends .
The last thing I would like to say , Mr President , is that , as you know , ladies and gentlemen , we have received a request ― or at least the Presidency and myself have received a request ― from the Secretary-General of the United Nations , asking us whether we could assist in the elections that are going to be held in the Democratic Republic of Congo and which will provide the final impetus for the process of democratic transition in Congo ; if it goes well , it will bring stability to a significant part of Africa ’s backbone ; this issue is therefore fundamental for all of us .
Act ; we like the way you act ; your way of acting suits us ; the way you act is better for the world , the multilateral world in which the citizens of the European Union believe’ .
What have we learnt from saying for years that the solution was elections and democracy , that they were a step forwards and a condition for peace , when we are now seeing that those elections have become a problem rather than a solution ?
Furthermore , the Palestinians ’ quality of life has continued to deteriorate year after year .
Sooner or later , Commissioner , however , regardless of the urgent short-term issues , the European Union will have to give its opinion on something that is fundamental : whether the immense needs — as you have said — of the Palestinian people are compatible with the existence of Hamas , whose founding convention calls for the liquidation and destruction of the State of Israel , and the fact that it appears on the European Union 's list of terrorist organisations .
This is not the fault of the European Union , nor of many Members of this Parliament , who have worked hard to preserve the channels for dialogue with the Cuban authorities and people .
Secondly , we are not finding it possible to present the Sakharov Prize to the Women in White and we must therefore urge the Cuban authorities to allow this group to visit Europe in response to the European Parliament’s invitation .
The intention here , amongst other things , was to begin to prepare the ground for what many of us hope will be an imminent transition to democracy .
Those of us who have endured a dictatorship know how difficult it is to create a democracy , especially when those people who should be your allies on the outside turn their backs on you .
It is clear that that position will be voted for tomorrow and will have absolutely no effect .
I believe that the European Union must not be governed by the dictates of the US State Department .
That does not appear to be important here , but it is very important for the people whose sight has been restored and for their countries .
Now we Europeans have a serious problem : in the financial perspective , this Parliament wanted us to spend 1.14 % , but the President-in-Office , Mr Blair , lowered this to 1.04 % .
We are asking to be told where money is spent badly ; if a Member State is spending badly , we want it to be said that that State is spending badly , that it is not Brussels .
Parliament has played an effective and fundamental role in unblocking it following its presentation just over two and a half years ago , even finding a procedure which has made it possible to reach a compromise between the Commission and Parliament to overcome the difficulties of the proposal and which , furthermore , has had the support of the majority of the sector and of the national administrations
