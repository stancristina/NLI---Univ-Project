This policy must take account of the increased needs of our planet and of the pressure caused both by the population increase and our various manmade activities .
Measures to moderate and adjust must also be based , over and above the aspect of the cost of productivity , on meeting future challenges .
This would significantly limit imports of Chinese counterfeit products and , more generally , would safeguard compliance by China with the rules and disciplines of the WTO .
Secondly , as far as my reference to Article 1.5 of the Constitution is concerned , of course I too recognise that the Constitution has not yet been ratified ; however , the Constitution introduces the principle of dialogue and cooperation which , I note , is something accepted by Mr McCreevy .     – Commissioner , this issue of the basic shareholder is very dangerous .
The competent Minister said as much : ' Do not concern yourselves with what we are doing in Greece , foreign companies benefit ' .
Therefore you , the 'iron lady ' should uphold your reputation by helping the Greek Government to see things as they really are .
Apartment blocks must not be built ; there is not a strip of green in the whole of Athens .
I have no wish to believe that Mr Karatzaferis would want , as far as the financing of the project is concerned , to transfer resources from the Greek regions to this specific area of Athens .     – Commissioner , I understand that negotiations are under way on the size of the cuts but have not been completed .
Can the Commissioner give me this information ?     . – Mr President , the fruit and vegetable sector is one of the most dynamic and that is why it is rightly being debated .
However , I think that today 's proposals do not help either ; they do not improve the situation , given that the assessments contradict what is being proposed .
For example , the decoupling of aid from production for fruit and vegetables is being proposed , while agreement is being expressed with the mid-term review of the CAP , the core of which is the decoupling of aid from production .
Basically , I would say , the fact is being concealed that producer groups function as intermediaries between farmers and wholesalers and industry , giving the latter benefits such as cheap raw materials .
If this statement or intention of yours is true , then I believe that you are consciously leaving the CMO in fruit and vegetables out of the revised common agricultural policy and exposing these products and producers to numerous financial and international risks .
I believe , Commissioner , that your proposals for fruit and vegetables will not be confined solely to making arrangements for or changes to processed products .
Do not disappoint the producers who have made sacrifices in order to adjust and adapt to this model .
However , the European Union should work closely with the OSCE to organise and supervise the elections and increase humanitarian aid and financial support through the TACIS programme and the system of generalised preferences .
The strategy report adopted by the European Union in 2002 , for the period from 2002 to 2006 , for the countries in the area needs revising and enhancing , taking account of the new situation which is arising .
The aim of the proposals by the Commission and the rapporteur is to undermine working time by introducing two new terms – active on-call time and inactive on-call time – and more flexible working time in order to increase the profits of big business .
The consequences for the working class are painful : more unpaid work , whenever and however the needs of capitalist production dictate , thereby undermining collective labour agreements , the intensification of slavery , more accidents at work , worsening insurance and pension terms , drastic reductions in free time for social activity and the breakdown of family life .
What levers and control mechanisms do we , as the European Union , have to persuade or pressure the Georgian authorities into respecting the rights of the Greek minority .
I think this is what is important today .     – Mr President , I should like , more specifically , to ask if you are monitoring progress in the reform of the Criminal Code , the directions in which it is going and the timetable for application .
I have no comments to make .     – Mr President , we all agree that the Constitutional Treaty introduces important institutional innovations as far as external relations are concerned .
In all events , however , under present circumstances and taking account of the correlations , we have a positive and compelling compromise , which is why I support a vote in favour of the Constitutional Treaty .
However , I must point out that the best possible solutions need to be found in order to strengthen the efficacy , consistency , cohesion and visibility of external action .
One of the basic issues is the reinforcement of the advisory and controlling role and greater involvement on the part of the European Parliament , both now , at the preparatory stage , and once the European Service is up and running .
Secondly , the difficulty in taking decisions , due to the huge increase in numbers in the WTO , accompanied by its increasing heterogeneity .
Fifthly , the defensive stand of the developing countries towards the new subjects of negotiation .
The terms of the globalised economy dictate new overall regulation of the global economic system on the basis of the social and ecological market economy , regulation which will promote the distribution of resources , stability , international
