The patient 's choice of treatment is also reduced to a personal responsibility , through information networks which replace the state 's obligation .
It restores the adoption of the European Constitution , which is 'dead ' following the referenda in France and the Netherlands , as the necessary tool for promoting the CFSP.
It proposes increased funding , basically calling on European workers to pay for the EU 's aggressive policy .
They include the following : lifelong learning , extending flexible forms of employment , striking at collective labour agreements , exacerbating the terms of insurance and retirement and further privatising education , health and public services for the common benefit in general ; setting a minimum wage for workers , a poverty-level safety net , in order to prevent reaction from the workers and grass roots , while the plutocracy reaps huge profits from its exploitation of the working class .
No one can call it otherwise in the name of opposition to Soviet sovereignty .
The vote was not controlled and I wish to express my opposition , because their content is beside the point .
It is reminiscent of the feudal lords of 400 years ago , who met and decided certain things without giving the people a say .
Tell me the name of one large hospital in the whole of Africa .
All the big banks to which we entrust our money are in the northern hemisphere .
We need a decision , an ideology whereby all citizens of the world have the same rights to democracy and to health and to involvement in decisions which concern them .
We must be careful , because otherwise we shall get a new AIDS from Africa , which will be more catastrophic than this AIDS which sends many citizens from the northern hemisphere to the other world .
In the city of Mina-Mata in Japan in 1956 , 8 000 people died because they ate fish with a high mercury content .
I am extremely satisfied that both the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Legal Affairs rejected the double legal basis and opted for Article 175 as the only basis , given that the objective of the regulation is to protect the environment and public health .
As far as the starting date for banning exports is concerned , I am calling for something fair and simple : we in the European Parliament need to remain consistent with the resolution we ourselves adopted by a very large majority in March 2006 on the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury .
What message are we sending to third countries if we export to them the mercury products banned in the European Union because they are dangerous ?
Besides , supply currently exceeds demand , according to the Commission figures , and this situation looks likely to continue in the future .
Anyway , we are not talking about millions of tonnes .
I am therefore calling on the Member States to create a fund on the basis of financial contributions from the chlor-alkali industry which will provide the necessary resources .
The relative cost - for such an investment in the future - is comparatively very low in the face of the exponential benefits it will generate .
The worst thing is that it endeavours to justify the imposition of this specific area with the existence there of infrastructures and 'manpower '. In other words , it is using unemployment as a means of blatant coercion of the workers , so that they agree to turn their area into a landfill for toxic mercury waste from the entire EU , with incalculable risks to the health of the inhabitants and the environment .
The proposal for a Commission directive , as formulated with the anti-labour changes voted jointly by the Christian Democrats , the socialists and the liberals , supported by the New Democracy and PASOK MEPs , blows national supplementary insurance schemes sky high throughout the EU.
The blow to the workers ' rights in the supplementary pension sector is linked to the ambition of the monopolies to use the reserves in these insurance funds to fund their investments , while at the same time legalising the acceptance of the 'investment risk ' or possible loss of the workers ' money .
The poor results of the Euro-Mediterranean process and , at the same time , the huge challenges in this area are forcing us to take serious stock and adopt serious policies and financial commitments .
MEDA II , which is the most recent MEDA programme we have applied , was scheduled to provide the sum of EUR 5.3 billion from 2000 to 2006 .
Similarly , increases varied according to implementation sector .
We must also do whatever we can to enhance cooperation between the Mediterranean countries ( South-South partners ) in order to achieve the much sought-after objective of regional cooperation and integration .
Payments to Palestinian areas have been quite stable at between EUR 232 and 260 million from 2002 to 2005 .
In 2006 alone , EUR 700 million was provided , which is our record so far .
I wish to state that our political group supports our undertaking and I believe that I also have the support of the rest of the House on this new paragraph .
Unfortunately , what we have in our hands , first of all , is not an agreement with the USA .
Let me be more specific : firstly , the agreement and the attached letter from the USA state that America will be able to transfer the information we send it to any third country it likes , with hardly any obligation to even notify us .
They are only bound by the unilateral assurances in their letter and by American laws which , if they change ,
