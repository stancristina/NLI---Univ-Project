I think that , in this area , the Member States display a fundamental unwillingness to take the necessary initiatives to deal specifically with fraud involving EU funds .
This is borne out by , for example , the Commission 's statement that , out of every four cases that are brought to light by OLAF and that should lead to the national authorities ' being prosecuted , only one has legal consequences .
It does not however lead me unconditionally to endorse Mrs Theato 's conclusion that the optimum and only solution lies in setting up another institution : a common European Prosecutor in the form of a body taking precedence over national legislation and demanding extensive harmonisation in areas in which the Member States traditionally have different legal traditions and legal concepts .
If we were to implement this model here and now , I would anticipate major conflicts of authority between the common European Prosecutor and the national authorities , as well as some overlap in relation to other Community initiatives such as Eurojust , OLAF and Europol , initiatives that , in view of the short period of time they have been up and running , should at all events be given more time to produce results in areas including that of fraud involving EU funds .
I just do not think that the time is ripe for such a drastic harmonisation of fundamental areas of legal policy , as proposed by Mrs Theato .
That is , moreover , the model mentioned by Mrs Theato in Article 22 , Paragraph 2 of her report .
The purpose of the proposal is to comply with international obligations under EU law , to which we strongly object .
It must however be emphasised that we are in favour of introducing arrangements for protecting dolphins and other threatened species .
It is just that this must not be done under the auspices of the EU.
We agree with the content of Amendment No 64 and would have voted in favour of it if it had meant the expatriation allowance 's being granted to all employees .
- ( DA ) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Van Brempt 's report but believe it to be crucial to draw attention to the fact that the use of pesticides can never be regarded as a sustainable alternative , irrespective of whether there is a reduction in their use .
We have the following comments on the actual proposal .
The proceeds from fees should , most importantly , be used for clearing up in accordance with the 'polluter pays ' principle .
Finally , it should always be possible for a country to pioneer the right to maintain and introduce bans on the use of pesticides , partly on the basis of a national assessment in terms of the precautionary principle .
- ( DA ) We are voting in favour of the resolution despite the fact that we do not in principle believe that this is an EU concern .
We are talking about a small programme , and a cheap one , even though it would cost EUR 54 million , but it is a step in the right direction , and it is high time it were taken .
The programme we are now talking about must not replace , but support and supplement the initiatives on the part of the Member States .
Everyone has something to learn , however , and it is therefore important to be able to use the programme for supporting the promotion and dissemination of best practice , for example by supporting school twinning .
Indeed , mutual aid and the free exchange of ideas are part of the Internet 's splendid philosophy .
This too is something that this programme will get to grips with .
Education has been high on the agenda for the Lisbon , Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils , and , with the adoption of Mr Mauro 's report , we are taking a step , albeit a modest one , in the right direction of complying with the important decisions taken at these summits .
In my report , I have focused on certain key basic concepts in current development policy and attempted to investigate whether these basic concepts place special requirements on , or raise particular issues in connection with , checks on the use of the funds .
The point is that legitimate requirements of donors , a policy of relief of poverty , environmental aspects , etc . may conflict with national and local priorities .
As far as I can see , in principle there is no reason - certainly not from a control point of view - to avoid budgetary support .
Decentralisation : the much discussed decentralisation that the Commission has implemented is based on more decisions being made on the spot rather than here and in Brussels .
Underutilisation : the implementation of payments from the funds quite simply takes place too slowly .
Moreover , I find it alarming that the three funds effective for the 2001 financial year have been in the process of implementation for 16 , 11 and 4 years respectively .
I also find it incomprehensible and bureaucratic that , in administrative terms , implementation must take place via three funds at the same time .
I expect the Commission to present a realistic plan soon for increasing the speed of implementation and for simplifying administration of the funds .
A limit must be placed on the number of reservations that can be made and on when these reservations have consequences .
This fact was supposed to have been evaluated in 2002 , but we have not yet seen any results of these evaluations .
As a result of its financial audit , the Court of Auditors ' sharply criticises the Commission
