I will read their names in the order of the countries ’ accession : Schröder , Poos , Gahler , Queiró , Elisabeth Schroedter , Souladakis , Stenzel , Gawronski , Volcic , and Wiersma ; also the three rapporteurs who have passed on their brief to others : Mrs Hoff , Mrs Carlsson and Mr Matella .
This message of Spinelli’s may well sound like a bequest , but I see it as still being valid today , and so , in the future too , it should guide this House’s actions as 25 States join in hammering out the co-existence of 450 million people in the European Union , and do so on a basis of solidarity , democratically and socially .
Mr President , you really ought to interrupt me and ask why I am talking nonsense .
There was one in 1973 , when the Europe of the Six was joined by Ireland , Denmark and the United Kingdom , thus becoming a Europe of Nine ; then , in 1981 , came Greece ; Spain and Portugal joined in 1986 , with three more countries –Finland , Sweden and Austria – acceding in 1995 .
Municipalities , cities , communities , that is to say the places we call home , are given the right to manage their own affairs .
If it were to fail , it would mean more than just the end of a great hope .
Politically speaking , the Constitution makes the enlarged European Union more solid , more effective , more responsible , more manageable and more comprehensible , enabling its people to become more familiar with it and to trust it more .
There is no separation of powers , no direct involvement by the citizens , and , as Mr Turmes quite rightly said , there are important elements that we have not dealt with .
A larger Union is of no use if its decision-making structures do not make it effective .
Whatever our understandable and justifiable rejoicing at the fall of borders , we should not overlook the fact that many citizens of both the old and new Member States take a sceptical view of the future .
This is true also of foreign and security policy , where Europe still has much to do over the coming years .
To the practical problems of border regions , it has geopolitical solutions , and that is the wrong way to deal with them .
It is logical that the next stage should involve Romania , Bulgaria and Croatia – the last of which would be very desirable as a new Member State .
I could , alternatively , give another example of the creation of the Single European Sky from 31 December 2004 .
The upshot is that Parliament and the European Union have done our homework but the Member States have not and so the next important questions are already on the agenda for a now enlarged Union .
We have always regarded the Commission as a sort of government .
I say this as a suggestion , so that we can , together , give some thought to that .
We prefer the spring wind , which may perhaps be a bit lukewarm , but it does refresh Europe with new blossoms and new leaves , without destroying the trees that grow here .
External economic policy , too , must become a means whereby we defend our European social model , for example where public services are concerned .
You will always be numbered among the great Presidents of the European Parliament and you were lucky that your Presidency fell in a successful time , at a time when the constitution was being debated and when ten new Member States joined the European Union .
I would like to make it very clear that we have a great responsibility in voting now on the reports of the Committee on Budgetary Control since the members of the European Court of Auditors are appointed for six years .
I would also , though , like to testify to the respect I have for Mr Wurtz , even though I have no sympathy whatever with what he had to say in his speech today .
That , unfortunately , was not enough to make us give him our votes , but I thank him warmly for his cooperation , which is always excellent and constructive .
My dear Pat , I hope we will have another opportunity to work closely together , and the fact that you are in the plenary today shows that the passion for Europe will still be with you .
You mentioned the former Prime Minister of Portugal , José Manuel Durão Barroso , with whom we will be having discussions this afternoon , and whom I knew both when he was leader of the Opposition , and then as Prime Minister .
It was a success for you , Taoiseach , and for your team .
Let me just say two things in general terms .
You are right , Mr President of the Commission , to say that what matters most in future is the social Europe , but it is important that , instead of us just talking about it , the European Union must take action once and for all ; in the eyes of the public , only actions count .
That is a quite different achievement , and one for which we are grateful .
The citizens have a part to play , because the Charter of Fundamental Rights gives them rights , and so , in future , there can be no such playing about with the presidency of the Commission as we have experienced this year , for it will be the citizens who will decide who the President of the Commission is to be .
I cannot but emphatically
