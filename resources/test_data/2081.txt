I should like to quote two brief articles from today 's Financial Times for those who have not seen them .
One is in the letters page and is headed " Tobacco proposal would be a slap in the face for workers " .
One paragraph says that if exports are banned , it will deeply affect our competitiveness in world export markets and may cost hundreds of jobs in Germany alone , maybe even cause the regional closure of plants .
That is a comment from one of the leading trade unions in Germany .
On the facing page is an article written jointly by the prime ministers of the UK and Spain , not about the tobacco directive but about market liberalisation , which says : " It is so important to avoid the sort of heavy-handed regulation that could drive investment and jobs out of Europe " .
That , Mr President , is what we are in danger of doing - we are not just stopping exports of cigarettes we are actually promoting the export of jobs .
We have an opportunity today to send two signals - first , that we care very much about health , but also that we care very much about jobs , employment and deregulation .
The final point I would make is a little plea to the Commissioner .
We have had this conversation before , but when we vote today on the labels , can we please have a larger-scale version as posters and spread them throughout the institutions so that we are not just talking to others but also addressing ourselves .
If his support cannot be strong , it can at least be mild !
Mr President , as the final speaker I , too , would like to join in thanking Mrs Thors for what is , as Mr Caudron has just said , a very well-balanced report .
It is a focused report .
I should like to conclude by making a link to the next debate on electronic communications .
In this whole area we have to be very conscious about how fast technology is moving and how that technology is beginning to change our whole thinking and indeed the whole form of competition in which digital television and other media are developing .
I come from a country where there is a long tradition of public service broadcasting and that is one of the areas Mrs Thors has addressed powerfully in her report : the questions of access to this new technology and access to the viewer .
Let us not forget that one of the key things that all people in the industry are facing is competition for a very scarce amount of viewer time .
As channels multiply , viewers are having more choice - not just in looking at programmes but in being able to shop , to use interactive Internet media through their digital televisions ; interactive media which they can pay for .
They can pay for a sports event with interaction to be able to choose the sort of format that they want .
It will not be long before they are able to buy a digital recorder which will hold hundreds of hours of television time on a hard disk which will be sorted for them so they will be able to watch things in time shift .
They will have different forms of competition .
We have to make sure that our legislation does not constrict the growth of technology and does not constrain the growth of competition that is going to come through these new forms of technology .
That is an issue we have to think about , both in considering Mr van Velzen 's report and in the new report on copyright in the information society which will be before this House in a few months ' time .
Mr President , the rapporteur , Mr van Velzen , is to be congratulated on having produced a balanced and well-founded report and a balanced and well-founded speech in support of it .
I can applaud , as always , his comprehension of the need to regulate but with carefully argued parameters .
It is right to remind ourselves that when we talk about regulation , it is not something of which we have either more or less ; within the European Union we plan to regulate for a purpose , for a goal , over a certain period of time .
It is good , too , that Mr van Velzen 's report has a clear appreciation of what the convergence of various technologies means .
He and many other contributors to this debate have reflected on how both Parliament and the Commission have been able to look at what has happened in the past and try and guess - educated guesses - about what may happen in the future .
Where we have not guessed correctly , we have been able to put things right .
The speed of change , not only in terms of technology , but also in global competition in this field , has meant that the margin of error is much less .
This is why this report is so important .
It lays the groundwork for the future development of the Commission 's plans and Parliament 's response for this industry .
The Socialist Group will not be able to support all of the amendments and the details of qualified criticisms of the "auctions versus beauty contest " proposals .
We had hoped to be able to have split votes on that .
I regret that we cannot ; nor can I support the amendment that calls for mobile telephones and the mobiles market to be excluded .
We ought to take great care not to introduce rules that limit growth in this startlingly versatile market .
Nor do we want to enter into a
