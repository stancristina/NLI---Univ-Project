The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believes that we need to use this advantage every way we can , at both European and national level .
There is already a lack of manpower in certain professions in the tourist industry , which is why our committee is calling on the European Commission to draft a study into the requirements of the market in collaboration with the Member States and within the context of a tourism policy at national and regional level .
We also believe that we should make use of the potential for job creation and should strengthen employment among women , starting with various measures to help reconcile family life and work in the tourist industry and encourage entrepreneurship among women .
In keeping with what is now the Union 's standard approach , the report also ties tourism to the Procrustean bed of the laws of the market and competition in order to accommodate the interests of big business in the tourist sector , thereby dealing a mortal blow to small and medium-sized - and especially small - businesses in the industry .
In this sense , tourism should play a positive role in wider communications , in getting to know other nations , customs , mores and cultures , in helping to develop friendly relations between nations and in promoting popular culture and history and a healthy and creative synergy between tourism and the environment .
I have attended more debates like this than I care to remember here in the European Parliament and at some point they start to sound like empty liturgies .
Various directorates , not just yours , have passed general measures on tourism , the internal market , the Structural Funds and the environment .
These measures need to be coordinated , even though there is no common policy , if the European Union is to produce the best possible tourism policy .
Despite the fact that , by definition , tourism goes beyond borders and is by definition an activity which is beyond a single Member State 's control .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a few weeks ago the Greek Minister of Health decided to shut down all the schools in Greece because of an outbreak of a viral infection .
However , the hype created by certain mass media and a few loose cannon resulted in cancellations and disappointment for those who make a living out of tourism in Greece .
The same , I imagine .
We need to be able to take measures to moderate these unfortunate repercussions , we need to be able to finance suitable action from the Structural Funds , we need to make special provision in the budget for funding to improve tourism , with everything that means and implies .
The White Paper really does give all us politicians , at both European and national level , the opportunity to take stock of our responsibility in the light of this objective .
The rapporteur has taken the right approach here , for which she has our warmest thanks .
Despite the range of European student exchange programmes , for example , there are huge discrepancies between education systems .
Mr President , young people are the most sensitive group in society and it is therefore only to be expected that crises in the capitalist system will hit them first .
An education system which is incapable of passing on basic knowledge , which replaces education with training and which excludes a significant proportion of young people on the basis of class criteria .
And when our young people dare to protest , in my country they are more often than not dragged off to court .
It even promotes so-called voluntary service as the highest form of social solidarity and entrepreneurship as the antidote to unemployment .
It is only by fighting for a society that respects people that young people will be able to acquire the wherewithal to make their way in the world .
In fact an amendment has been tabled in an attempt to change the code ; it has not been changed already and I would be obliged if this could be corrected .
My question is this : what will the status of these thirteen fighters be , wherever they end up , and is there any possibility of their being returned at Israel 's request , which would , of course , be criminal .
If you wish to arrange for us to be given even just a minute to restate these questions , then gladly .
Having studied the outcome , I must say that it is a significant improvement on the original text and , as such , our group will support it .
What worries me is that a large slice of the funding will go to industry , with a tiny sliver for universities , research institutes or small research groups , irrespective of the standard of work carried out .
Mr President , Commissioner , my report on the annual assessment of implementation of stability and convergence programmes , which was approved unanimously by the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , concludes - in brief - that the annual stability and convergence programmes submitted by the governments of the Member States and their application in 2001 were , for the most part , in keeping with the requirements of the stability and growth pact , despite the recession caused by the decline in growth rates , what were luckily temporary setbacks in the American economy and one-off incidents such as the terrorist attacks on 11 September .
The European Commission and ECOFIN believe that recovery is on the way and will start to bite during the last quarter of this year .
Obviously , simple management by the intergovernmental conference is not enough .
