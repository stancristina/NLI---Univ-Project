types of activities without danger of microbiological contamination and , most importantly , they have the right to information as quickly as possible on the state of the waters in which they and their children will be bathing .
I see no reason to delay the application of the directive .
If the objective is to improve and maintain the quality of European bathing waters and protect citizens , I find it hard to understand why the Council does not wish to develop a public information system .
It appears unacceptable to me that we should end up with even lower microbiological specifications than those set by the Commission .
Mr President , I am delighted that , having filed its deed of ratification on 17 February 2005 , the European Community will now be attending the second meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention as a party to the Convention .
In addition to adopting directives on access to information and on public participation , it has made significant progress , especially with the proposal for a regulation on the application of the Aarhus Convention to Community agencies .
It points out the importance of incorporating the provisions of the Convention into administrative practice , so that they become operational in practice .
The Commission will also emphasise the importance of developing institutional capabilities as a means of improving the application of the Convention .
On this point , I believe that it is particularly important for the procedures to be applied for which provision is made for activities relating to genetically modified organisms under the Carthage Protocol , for example , and for the acquisition and exchange of experience to be promoted .
I would like today in plenary to congratulate Mr Hegyi , on his excellent report on the protection of film heritage which is the result , as we have heard , of his knowledge of the cinema .
That is why it is important that the European Union is taking an initiative today , albeit in the form of a recommendation to the Member States , in which preserving the film heritage is raised to a priority objective while , at the same time , specific and realistic measures are proposed to make it feasible .
This will result not only in the preservation of old films , but also in the creation of jobs .
The 20th century was defined as the century of the culture of the image .
Terrorism is a terrible thing .
We have terrorism and fear of terror .
So let us protect our citizens .
We urgently need to take more – and more effective – measures .
The successful example of the Olympic Games in Athens , where innovative security measures were applied , should be taken into account by the Member States , who need to acquaint themselves with these measures .
It feeds the unilateral power of the employer even more , on the pretext of corporate flexibility .
We are turning the clock back 85 years .
Thus , the Member States or employers acting alone can say that eight inactive working hours implies 0.8 hours active time .
One day , three days , three weeks ?
Would you want to come across a lorry driver on the road who has been driving for 30 hours without a break ?     – Madam President , the proposal for a working time directive to be put to the vote is the product of a synthesis of theoretical opinions on the organisation of working time and an effort to strike a compromise between the interests of employers and employees .
The Cercas proposal reinstates respect for the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities with regard both to working time limitations and on-call time , which is expressly referred to as working time .
Mr President , following the very informative intervention by Minister Schmit , I wish to add a few comments and perhaps come back to some of the points raised by the Minister .
On 9 February , the Commission approved its communication entitled ' Winning the battle against global climate change ' .
First in importance is the need to investigate , jointly with basic partners and during the current year , both the potential for a strategy after 2012 and the shaping of a favourable climate for opening official negotiations on future arrangements .
We met , either jointly with Mr Lux and Lord Whitty or separately , with representatives , with ministers from China , Brazil , Spain , South Africa , Australia and Russia and got their initial reactions .
According to the Commission 's strategy , the objective of the European Union for the seminar is to create a climate of trust , to discuss and look for common ground and to send out appropriate messages , not just to the United States , but also to all the global partners .
I should point out here that many countries are hiding – at least they have been hiding until now – behind the refusal of the United States , in order to avoid discussing the question of climate change .
I wish to agree with Mr Florenz that we also need to include other sectors , if we are to be able to combat climate change more effectively , including in the transport sector .
Finally , I should like to say that Parliament is being called on to play an important part in our efforts to achieve an agreement on future arrangements with regard to climate .
You did a very good job in Buenos Aires and I want this work to continue with the same demands on the part of the European Parliament .     – Mr President , it is very important to lay down the right preconditions so that policy on climate change , based also on the Kyoto Protocol , can start to bring about specific results .
