.
We must give up this habitual way of thinking .
Otherwise , we shall lose people ' s support for European cooperation .
This is the attitude behind the poor opinion people have of the EU , an opinion which Mr Cashman' s report will change for the better .
I shall just conclude by saying that I think it was a pity that Mr Jens-Peter Bonde had got the wrong script for his intervention today .
It was not , in any case , relevant to the Cashman report .
The report takes as its starting point the observation that an ever greater proportion of health insurance in Europe is covered by supplementary health insurance schemes .
In the course of the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , the matter was brought to a head when our fellow MEPs from the British Conservative Party said that , in insurance , the premium is based on the risk assumed by the insurance company .
This is a breach of absolutely fundamental principles of solidarity on which the European social model ought to be based , and a common initiative ought therefore to be taken to ensure that no one is excluded from such supplementary schemes .
If the European Parliament is asking the Commission to produce an inventory of the Member States ' policies , it is precisely because we have a common interest in all Member States having access to high-quality health services .
This is an area on which it will be natural to work within the framework of the open coordination method , as the European Council has begun doing in connection with combating social exclusion .
Mr President , the draft Nice treaty is more like a constitution for a federal State than an agreement for an association of States .
As a rule , the European Union ' s laws are to be adopted by qualified majority voting so that all democracies in the individual countries can be voted down .
There are still 65 categories of legislation requiring unanimity according to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
We are therefore approaching the point of no return , beyond which a unitary State is unavoidable .
The inner sanctum of the national States is now being penetrated , with majority decision making on aspects of social policy , labour market policy , taxes , industrial policy , culture , supranational parties and even our own salaries , so that we are becoming the EU' s highly paid representatives in the Member States instead of the voters ' representatives in the European Parliament , duly taxed in our own countries .
Trade policy will make the EU countries resemble a State .
Decisions on foreign and security policy are also to be adopted on the basis of majority voting .
Otherwise , the right of veto will not figure very prominently in the new treaty , and countries without the right of veto resemble constituent States more than independent nations .
What has been deferred to the constitutional conference in 2004 is not the content of the text but merely the icing on the cake of a text which may also come to resemble a proper constitution , that is to say a text containing firstly the Charter of Fundamental Rights , then the ground rules and , finally , an appendix listing the individual policies to which changes may be made without the need for tiresome ratification .
All that is missing is democracy .
Democracy was forgotten en route .
More majority decision-making in which officials and ministers can vote down the electorate and elected representatives .
Majority decision-making will destroy the right of veto for the Member States as parliamentary democracies , but the EU will not itself become a parliamentary democracy .
The federalists can achieve their desire for more integration , and the governments in Sweden , Great Britain and Denmark can ease their countries into the new arrangements once the decisions , binding in practice , have been taken .
I shall adopt a position on the Treaty of Nice when I see the outcome of the negotiations , but there is a somewhat schizophrenic feel to the debates here .
In my view , the most important thing to do at the Nice Summit is to set a timetable for when and how the EU is to become ready for enlargement .
We are focusing far too much on how prepared the applicant States are , and we all too often ignore the fact that , for example , the EU' s agricultural arrangements and Structural Funds are enormous obstacles to enlargement .
A decision in Nice to the effect that , for example , the applicant States must have the opportunity to participate in the next elections to the European Parliament could help put the necessary pressure on the EU itself , so that enlargement can become a reality .
- ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution concerning preparation for the European Council ' s meeting between 7 and 9 December in Nice where , among other things , the current Intergovernmental Conference is to be concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Nice .
Many of the motions for resolutions tabled by the different political groups are therefore also based upon a deep concern about how much success there will be in achieving the goal in Nice , which is to make the EU ready for admitting the new Member States of the EU.
As a prerequisite , the solution should involve striking a balance between small and large countries , not only where the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers is concerned , but also when it comes to the composition of the European Parliament and the Commission
