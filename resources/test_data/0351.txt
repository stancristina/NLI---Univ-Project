keen to enter into agreements .
The slow pace of the social dialogue is particularly regrettable for someone like myself , as an ardent fan of the Danish model , where the parties to the labour market settle industrial relations questions jointly .
We would risk finishing up with multinational companies pitting national trade unions against each other .
It may well be that collective action or some kind of European employment legislation should or could resolve any conflicts in industrial relations .
Mr President , the fact that the European Parliament is now debating fair trade is largely due to grassroots activities that have been underway over the past 10-15 years .
This is because idealistic organizations have shown that by means of a conscious policy , the market can be used to promote socially and environmentally responsible production , as well as , quite significantly , income for small producers in developing countries , and this is very useful experience .
But we must not insist , for example , that this requires harmonization of EU labelling .
Replacing this with an EU label would be a setback to development to the tune of several years .
Despite several years of endeavouring to come up with a joint label , they have not yet succeeded in doing so .
I do not believe the advantages of having a common label would go any distance towards offsetting these risks .
I can but agree with that .
We must require that it will be possible to set special quotas for products that do fulfil the criteria .
Currently , that is not possible today .
Unless definite pressure is applied , neither will it be possible in the future .
The people currently working with fair trade understand the problems .
We support applying strong pressure to the WTO and making funds available for education and for changing production in developing countries .
This article , which is about Sellafield , was not printed in the magazine .
I have read the article .
Mr President , I would like to highlight two points before we proceed to the vote this morning : on the one hand , nisin , and on the other , sulphites .
Nisin is an antibiotic that could , in the long term , lead to resistance to medicines .
In my opinion , this has no place in this directive .
More and more people are affected by food allergies .
I believe that at the very least a specific limit value should be set for their use , rather than estimating the extent to which they are thought to be necessary .
And many parents buy dried fruit loose for their children as a healthier alternative to sweets .
I appreciate that to a large extent , climatic and hence cultural differences may give rise to different views of what additives are necessary .
But we must understand that there is a difference between whether it is possible to produce and add an additive on the one hand , and whether the additive is really necessary on the other .
Today , we have foods in the European groceries market that would keep long enough to allow us to make a trip around the equator in a rowing boat .
We do not really need our food to keep that long .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists will be voting in favour of the amendment by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection to Mrs Breyer 's recommendation for second reading - for which I would like to thank Mrs Breyer - and I hope the amendments will receive the required number of votes .
There is no doubt in my mind that the current trend - even discounting ecological foods as such - is towards greater simplicity and more natural foodstuffs .
Once again , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this directive .
I would also like to remind you of the subsequent questions to the Commission and the Council on the possibility of simplifying the directive without necessarily altering its content , and I would like to remind you of the answers given .
I am reminding you of this in the hope that the conciliation procedure can be used in such a way that simplification is addressed alongside the work of finding a compromise .
Rather , we are doing so because the common position appears to be comprehensive to the point of meaninglessness in this area .
The best approach would have been to introduce flour into Appendix 2 - that is , as the staple commodity it most certainly is - spelling out permitted substances there .
Now we have a situation whereby far too much is permitted , and the argument that the industry would obviously not use all these additives is really rather feeble .
In this regard , I am also referring to Directive 89/107 , Annex 2 , point 1 , where it states that there has to be a " sufficiently great technical need ' for approving additives .
I cannot actually make sense of the common position any other way than this .
Pineapples may not in fact matter , because the outer part is not eaten , but it would be quite unreasonable for peaches .
How will these individuals find out what the position is ?
In other words , has the Commission planned its information strategy ?
I am looking forward to following up this debate in the Committee on Budgets , but I would like to ask the Commissioner to clarify whether or not the democracy programmes will be able to proceed unhindered .
And finally , my last question to the Commissioner is this : why did the Council not adopt the motion that the Commission obviously tabled as far back as a year ago ?
