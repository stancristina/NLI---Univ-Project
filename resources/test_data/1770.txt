of the conventions , but most of all the Intergovernmental Conference and then the opportunity offered us by the corpus iuris - for a great qualitative leap .
Here too it should be stressed that this must operate with every democratic guarantee , the guarantee of parity for the prosecution and the accused , but certainly something must be done in the direction of common legislation .
Mr President , as we debate in this Parliament , the American Congress is debating too .
Engagement with China is the only possible way .
It does not exhaust our drive to define the right policy , which , as a Parliament , we have only just begun , but it is a good start .
Whether a framework agreement with China is seriously possible soon will depend on this .
Head-on confrontation is a mistake , because in the Chinese tradition it leads to them cutting off relations .
It is also wrong to try to export the worst of our culture , like consumption , corruption , and the law of the strongest .
So it is paradoxical that while it has served as the basis for greater equality in other fields and other rights , both social and political , equal pay for equal work is still not properly applied in our countries .
The third point highlighted by the committee is that the code has its own internal logic and therefore operates in that logic .
The governments of the member countries of the union have the main responsibility for guaranteeing the success of this code , but too often they pretend not to know of the existence of such discrimination , or anyway fail to intervene positively to remove it .
We also hope that the Council will quickly approve , on the basis of Parliament 's recommendations , the directive on the burden of proof , which provides a precise definition of indirect discrimination for the first time .
I will dwell on just two points .
Too little is also done on use of and familiarization with the computer in schools .
Some passages in the report are balanced and we support them , but we oppose a certain number of passages , and only if these fall will we be able to vote for the report .
After a long series of obstacles and uncertainties , an international agreement on humane trapping standards was reached last December between the European Community , Canada and the Russian Federation .
I am also grateful to the Commission , and in particular Mrs Cresson and her staff , for their communication and for presenting this programme .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur , one of Parliament 's Vice-Presidents , on her excellent work .
Such work is of tremendous value , since it will broaden the youngsters ' horizons and , very importantly , bring them into contact with other young people both in Europe and in third countries .
Mr President , I wish to compliment Mrs Cresson and the author of this important report .
SOCRATES has given a tremendous boost to the mobility and exchanges of students , teachers and assistants , as well as the creation of cooperation networks .
So it is clear that if we really wish to give a boost to European education through information and communication campaigns for our citizens , carried out by the EU , the necessary funding must be found .
Otherwise , we shall lose credibility in the eyes of the citizens who wish to build the Europe of tomorrow - those young people who are expecting not just words or promises , but practical action from the Union - especially in times like the present , when ideals are under threat and culture has to play its rightful role .
I am also a member of the Committee on Budgets , and I know that it would not be impossible to transfer these resources from other headings .
So I do not believe that there are any arguments in favour of this postponement .
Since we feel that this is totally at odds with the spirit of the Treaty , and with the sensibilities of most members of European society , we feel that we cannot go on subsidizing such a cruel form of spectacle , which has a coarsening effect on those who go to watch it and is cruel to the animals involved .
According to the OSCE , at least 90 % of the Serbs returning to the region in recent months have been unable to reoccupy their homes .
Indeed , I would recall the persecution , the looting and the enforced exodus , after the end of the Second World War , of hundreds of thousands of Italians who had been living in that region for centuries .
On 15 May 1997 , it even suffered physical attacks by elements from within the police force , undoubtedly with the aim of intimidation as well as repression .
Therefore , if Europe wishes to be credible , it must seriously rethink its entire policy towards the African continent .
Other species are at risk too : the vicu√±a in Peru , Argentina and Bolivia ; the whale , following a proposal from Norway and Japan ; and the Caretta turtle , in view of a request from Cuba .
Sport should be thought of not merely as an opportunity for healthy competition ; it also contributes towards social integration and personal development in young people , preventing them from being at a social disadvantage .
A youngster 's identity can be forged in national sports federations , based on the common denominator of a European treaty on sport .
We each have our own political views , but as far as sport is concerned , all those views have a single common denominator
