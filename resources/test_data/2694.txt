is an unqualified yes .
That , if anything , surely constitutes progress .
It would therefore seem very odd if this Parliament were to vote against a proposal just because it does not go the whole hog , for we are nearly there and have the opportunity to carry out an annual audit .
This proposal constitutes a clear improvement when it comes to transparency and , in addition , to democratic administration within the EU.
This makes it possible in future to classify not only sensitive military documents as secret , but also more general documents concerning security and perhaps other policy areas too .
What is more , I agree with what has been said about the procedure itself , namely that it is extremely difficult to understand how , as part of an informal process I would characterise as very dubious , the negotiations concerning such a sensitive and important subject could have taken place between the committee , the Council and the Commission but not been subject to scrutiny by ordinary Members of Parliament and the general public .
Moreover , the very negotiations concerning the proposal have been a display of lack of transparency .
Paragraph 14 of this Regulation also specifies that the Member States must be loyal to the contents of the Regulation .
There are extensive and partially unclear exemptions from the rules concerning access to documents .
The European Parliament ' s access to classified documents has also been dealt with in these negotiations , at the same time as the public ' s right of access to documents .
The conciliation ought to continue as normal .
A very great deal of the general debate in 1999 was about transparency and public scrutiny .
The Regulation we are voting on tomorrow is a compromise between Parliament and countries in the Council of Ministers which are sympathetic towards transparency .
However , we Liberals are also sorry to see that it is deficient in a great many ways .
In some Member States , including Sweden and the Netherlands , there are more far-reaching rules governing access to documents .
The Presidency bears considerable responsibility , namely to ensure both that Dutch legislation and , above all , the Swedish Constitution are not undermined and that no self-censorship is practised by Swedish authorities either .
Rather , it is democratic and efficient .
We shall also take the lead in establishing still better rules in a couple of years ' time for , in spite of everything , transparency has the future on its side .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is about our believing in the words we write .
I am extremely pleased that we have succeeded in introducing more good administrative procedures for the handling of documents than I had believed we would .
Citizens will be able to monitor the Commission ' s activity in a completely new way .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party will use that tool in the way cited by my colleagues and , in this , we are counting upon the help of the ombudsman .
There are shortcomings , but they are not as serious as our opponents maintain .
It is now a question of going further , beyond what emerges from the reports about what has happened .
Fifteen years after Chernobyl , the safety of nuclear power and its effects upon health are the subject of this resolution .
Is that at least not something we should be able to agree about ?
Just as Commissioner Wallström pointed out , children are the most vulnerable .
EU funds are still being handed out for the purpose of completing the nuclear reactors in Ukraine , and Euratom still spreads the gospel of nuclear power , praising its splendid qualities .
What answer do we give to the applicant States when they ask about this ?
We should like to be able to debate energy policy , but I believe we should avoid that today and instead concentrate on the subjects of how we can improve nuclear safety in the applicant States and , of course , of how we are to continue to cooperate with Ukraine and Russia .
In this , the Commission explains its view of how these issues must be worked with , that is to say that both short- and long-term approaches are required .
Naturally , Members of Parliament know as well as we do that we do not have competence in this area to force either the Member States or the applicant States to do anything .
As you know , we have no special European standards , but we say that European Union Practices must be complied with .
The IAEA ' s standards form the basis , of course , but these are so general that they require 'practical application ' .
We do , Mrs Schörling , in fact also have agreements to close the most dangerous nuclear power stations of all - Kozloduy , Ignalina and Bohunice - and to ensure that the safety of the remaining reactors is upgraded so that we obtain an acceptable standard .
You probably know where I stand when it comes to the use of nuclear power but , even though I am critical of this , I believe that the research into safety issues must continue .
Above all , I agree with what one MEP pointed out , to the effect that we must remember the children and make sure we do everything in order also to help and support those children who still have to pay the price for the dreadful tragedy of Chernobyl .
Twelve of the national currencies of the Member States are to disappear and be successively replaced by the new common currency .
The Europe-wide use of the euro has already brought economic stability and a variety of other advantages
