The report contains only very vague ideas about the adjustments Europe would have to make following a future accession , and these seem to me to be quite inadequate .
We must have an overall approach to the management of migration flows and of borders .
I am convinced of the need for Europe , so do not go on classifying me among the anti-Europeans .
This point is important .
I believe that , on the contrary , we are sources of mutual strength .
No.
I welcome the concrete steps this report includes to : 1 . continue to promote a strong trade relationship and work with India to better understand the global economy and , more specifically , to understand the benefits for both economies with regard to outsourcing and insourcing-related matters . 2. pay close attention to the India-Pakistan dialogue , including the Kashmir issue ; welcoming the dialogue and hoping for a fruitful conclusion ; and paying attention to the need to develop and secure mutual trust and confidence between these two major countries , 3 . maintain and improve co-operation in development policies to help India meet the Millennium Development Goals .     Mr President , the Commission shares your concern about the humanitarian , economic and social problems posed by the presence of a whole series of unexploded ordnance , such as cluster munitions , which are left behind after conflicts .
We in Europe regard Iran as a great country .
These conclusions are unequivocal : despite the commitment made by the Iranian Government to reinforce human rights and to promote the rule of law , very little progress has been made .
Mr President , the fight against terrorism is undoubtedly one of the major challenges facing our society and the whole of the international community , but it is also clear that it requires us to answer crucial questions about the way in which terrorism can enter into conflict with the promotion and protection of human rights .
This is an unacceptable situation and I feel that you must ask the President-in-Office of the Council to enlist the support of our Ambassadors in Tehran to help ensure that human rights are respected .
It also demonstrates that transporting radioactive materials , by rail or by road , is certainly not exempt from accidents , which may lead to major disasters .
Consequently , if the EU adopted those proposals and turned them into practical legal measures , that would represent considerable progress and would provide the impetus for putting pressure on countries such as the United States , China , Ukraine , Russia and Israel .
Whilst the EU appears determined to meet the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol , a great deal remains to be done , however , if we are to prepare our communities to face the changes that are already underway .
We want growth and jobs to be a priority , and I believe that this also involves better links between all European policy instruments , or in other words a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact to ensure that it has tighter links with the broad outlines of economic policy , the new financial perspective and , indeed , the revised Lisbon objectives .     Mr President , I should like to return to the issue of the Hague Programme and to ask the Council a number of questions relating to this Programme , which undoubtedly represents a major innovation in its introduction of a move to qualified majority voting for Title IV.
The first of these obstacles relates to the freedom of movement of Palestinians in Gaza , the West Bank and East Jerusalem , something which is essential both for the electoral campaign and for election preparations , the holding of elections and the counting of votes , but which is far from guaranteed .
We do not object in principle to either Turkey as a country or the Turkish community , which has held Cypriot nationality for several generations .
If one strips away the strategy ’s commendable goals , which include jobs , training and economic growth , and the way in which these goals have supposedly been achieved , namely by means of coordination , one is left with an instrument whose real purpose is to bring about a greater level of harmonisation of national economic and social policies .
During discussions with my colleagues in the Council I made sure that Parliament’s concerns were raised , and I proposed the changes I believe to be necessary .
This assessment did not relate just to the tip of the iceberg , that is to say the Buttiglione affair , but to the overall profile of this college , marked by unbounded liberalism .
We are opposed to this mockery of a state which the European Union aspires to be , as well as to a Commission that is playing at being a government and that apparently needs to be confirmed in office .
Mistakenly , you chose to be on the side of the Heads of State or Government .
Mr Barroso , the events of these last few weeks will , I hope , have brought you closer to the European Parliament .
What I took from your speech was your desire to create an EU that speaks to young people and to their generation , an EU that , as I myself see it , should pave the way for their future through professional training and through language learning accessible to everyone .
The new Commission will have to apply itself in order to win the confidence of the large majority of MEPs who want to see an active and prosperous Europe that defends its social and environmental model .
