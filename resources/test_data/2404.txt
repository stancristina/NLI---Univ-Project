I feel that we must constantly stress that the Internet is a wonderful experience , and it must be so also when we create a European domain for , apart from anything else , it has been entrusted to self-regulation , to the ability of the operators to manage themselves .
Thus , with interaction between the citizens and the institutions of the European Union , we will be able to fill the ' .EU' domain with material of genuine European telematic citizenship
Prime Minister , this presidency comes at a critical juncture .
Prime Minister , Madam President , at the Laeken Summit , we shall be reviewing the Union ' s progress in implementing its social agenda .
We have a duty to stop this trend .
I am particularly glad that , in contrast to the situation six months ago , it is now being conducted widely in all the media .
They want a Union that delivers the quality of life and the type of society they desire .
Therefore , let me conclude with a few more words on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice .
Therefore , as I have stressed on a number of occasions before this House , I very much hope that the Treaty will be ratified by the end of next year , in full respect for the democratically expressed opinions of our fellow citizens .
Some people have not been able to resist the temptation to reply simply that this question is not on the agenda .
No, it is not .
Ladies and gentlemen , a 'no ' to Nice would inevitably delay the enlargement process .
Mr President , I feel I can say that the Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Affairs firmly supports the statement which launched the Belgian presidency ' s term of office this morning , particularly one of the points you made , Mr Verhofstadt , to the effect that it is not enough to provide the citizens with tangible solutions to the tangible problems which affect them most .
Of course , the new developments in the Union ' s policies such as those you outlined will enable us to win back the citizens ' confidence in the European project , but the citizens also feel a strong need to be able to take part in the development stage of the Union ' s guidelines and decisions .
The response can only be provided by a Convention which in which , first and foremost , the national parliaments and the European Parliament participate as democratic representatives of the citizens .
The euro is certainly an important step - and I agree with the line taken by President Prodi - but it is not enough .
These , I feel , are the bases for achieving an enlargement which we strongly believe to be an irreversible , necessary step for the European Union : an enlargement in which my political grouping believes and which the government , which my political grouping supports in Italy , stressed both in its meeting with President Prodi and at the last Gothenburg meeting .
It was the right decision and I believe that even our friends who would have preferred to conclude the matter in Luxembourg should be grateful to us .
It is true that she is young , but she cares about the interests of all pensioners , including Italian pensioners , to whom she has spoken on a number of occasions .
Therefore , I voted in favour of greater commitment to renewable energies .
In this sense , it is a good thing that the European Union is attaching due importance to that - by definition - renewable source , hydroelectric power , providing security and incentive mechanisms on the market which will certainly benefit the mountainous areas as well , particularly those where the electricity companies are directly managed by the local communities .
By adopting a further European directive compelling all the States to transfer all the pension funds paid to the State up until that time into professional funds , which managed the money well and thus generated good pensions ' .
Well then , I was thinking about that last night , Madam President .
Madam President , in order to illustrate my explanation of vote on Mrs Flesch ' s report concerning the ' .EU' designation in computers , I have to tell you that , in the last few days , right here in Strasbourg , I met a very attractive girl from one of the Eastern European countries , one of the countries that have applied to join our Union .
Therefore , I am not the only one to call for a European pension !
I could find no answer to that question in this or any other document and so , in this explanation of vote , I call for the euro to be introduced directly on 1 January 2001 , without the transition period .
This is precisely because of the need to protect minors for , all too often , we forget that fundamental rights are the prerogative not just of adults but also and above all of minors .
We must remember now , especially after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , that they are free , independent States .
How , then , can the European Union subject these countries to an assessment of their respect for human rights when , in its own documents , it does not proclaim loud and clear the protection of that principle - the principle of self-determination - that the peoples of those States have been denied for decades ?
If that is the case , then I say to you that this is a great mistake .
We call for a forum in which all this can be discussed .
Mr President , I do not represent any region ; as you know
