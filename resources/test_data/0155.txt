develop a logic all of their own , quite independently of their electorate .
What I do not find in this report , though , is the conclusion that very many parents today still opt voluntarily in favour of staying at home and decide in favour of the family , and that probably many more people would take that option should this be made financially viable by the government .
This reflects credit on the work we did there .
In Turkey , for example , a change of religion must be notified to the government .
After all , globalisation has changed the world , and large undertakings with a considerable market share , which , for example , make important contributions in the field of innovation , must not simply be judged by their dominant position , but must be seen in a broader economic context .
It is obvious in that case that , even though the turnover is below the threshold of European interference , the effect of such a level of concentration can very much be European , and as the Commissioner already indicated , that is therefore a reason to find out if we can broaden the criteria for European competences in this connection too .
This renders democratic control over decision-making impossible .
That is not difficult , since not even a change in the Treaty is required to open up Council meetings .
Everyone benefits from fair rules in trade .
I am still hopeful of a positive outcome this year .
This is yet another illustration that the Commission must continue to give priority to a better implementation of the WTO rules by China .     Mr President , Africa accounts for less than 2 % of world trade , and yet , the development round remains stuck on inadequate concessions .
First of all , there is the need to involve the poorest countries .
Since , in my view , the environmental aspects of economic policy get a raw deal , I would call for the inclusion in the economic policy guidelines of clear and specific environmental objectives , in addition to references to the importance of the environment .
What is this fear about ?
Encouraged by the Commission , we tabled proposals for sweeping changes which were subsequently met with a wall-to-wall majority in the plenary meeting .
This is something we would like to work towards , and we hope that the Austrian Council Presidency , with whom we are always prepared to enter into dialogue , will lead us to a directive that benefits the self-employed , professionals , consumers of services , consumers , employees , economic growth as a whole and creates many additional jobs .
Unfortunately , there is no support for this at the moment , and more time may well be required .
We hope that some more light will be shed as to why a number of sectors are excluded .
For example , the opinion that the appointment of a representative among posted workers should be sufficient is tantamount to denying the Scandinavian countries their negotiation tradition .
What is now before us represents a big step forward .
I totally agree that something should be done about them .
I am delighted with the fact that the monitoring procedure that checks the way we deal with each other is set to improve thanks to different labour inspections joining forces .
How can we achieve this ?
That is what is missing .
We in this House have first-hand experience of some impact assessments on amendments ; we too have found that the quality varies , and that is why I propose an independent review of them .
The public will then see that we mean business and that we actually want this transparency .
I should like to congratulate him on it and also thank him for including , virtually in their entirety , the various paragraphs that we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , had incorporated in our opinion , based on our experience .
In this framework , it is indeed those who use the rules and regulations in practice , namely the supervisors , the economic operators , the consumers and users involved in the process , who should have far more say in terms of the content of those rules .
Reality is that subsidiarity has been an empty concept for a long time .
We have examples of this in the Netherlands , in the shape of the committee that monitors the environmental impact reports .
That is why I am pleased to see that Mr Takkula’s report has turned the Citizens for Europe programme into the Europe for the citizens programme .
When it comes to remembering victims of European dictatorships , however , this approach is painful and lamentable .
Without citizens , the European Union is nothing , as indeed the Council , Commission and Parliament have proved time and again .
There is broad consensus here in this House that we must take climate change seriously .
Instead of the internal market legal base , we opted for the environment-linked legal base .
The Commission must , of course , closely monitor the situation and ensure that the restrictions of market access are proportionate .
French energy companies are carrying out foreign take-overs , but the borders remain closed for foreign take-overs in France , and now that the services directive is on hold , foreign workers are also barred .
Moreover , solutions are sometimes put forward that only make matters worse , in fact .
On the basis of these Rules , I would like to postpone the vote on that amendment to the next part-session because I would like to reopen the political discussion about our working methods in this Parliament
