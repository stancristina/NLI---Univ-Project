over the last ten years .
But in a number of areas there is little recognition by the Commission of the benefits the aviation industry , including aerospace , have brought and I am disappointed by the negative attitude towards the industry in this paper .
One of the key factors in the success of the last 20 years has been the privatisation of the national state-owned industries which began in the 1980s .
I also welcome the Commission statement that subsidies have now ceased .
When we look at the choice of routings and so on for the consumer , air fares have come down considerably over the last few years .
Fares from the UK are amongst some of the lowest , showing what effect having three major carriers operating out of one country can have on competition and pricing .
This has produced the real benefits and other countries need to take a look at this .
The report outlines at some length the expansion in capacity which has taken place in the European aviation industry , particularly across the north Atlantic , but that is obviously quite a complicated issue .
I fully accept that there are challenges which need to be addressed such as problems with congestion , in particular air traffic control .
However , I believe that the Commission has a responsibility to put forward more balanced views which do not undermine the value and success of an industry which has made an enormous contribution , not only to the countries of the European Union but worldwide .
Mr President , I only have a few minutes so I want to focus on just one particular point in the Commission communication .
Let us recall that the title of this communication is ' From single market to worldwide challenges ' .
Yet one of the remarkable things about this communication is that it does not appear to recognise that one of those worldwide challenges must be how the airline industry will respond to increasing environmental concerns and likely environmental legislation .
Of all the many words in this communication , just one short paragraph is devoted to this issue .
As rapporteur for a very good Commission communication on aviation and environment I know that the issue of environment and competitiveness is a very live one with strong feelings on both sides of the debate .
For example , that communication starts by saying that the growth of the air transport industry is , and I quote , "unsustainable and must be reversed because of its impact on climate and on the quality of life and health of European citizens " and it goes on to say very clearly that 'business as usual ' is not an option .
It is quite obvious that aviation ' s response to environmental concerns will have effects on competitiveness , some positive and some negative .
Let us not underestimate either the impact of aviation on the environment .
A report launched in the UK just yesterday by a number of environmental NGOs including Friends of the Earth forcefully made the case that one flight to and from the US could cause more pollution than the average UK motorist causes in a year .
It makes the case that the world ' s 16 000 commercial jet aircraft produce more than 600 million tonnes of CO2 every year - nearly as much as all the countries of Africa put together .
It makes the case that the number of people flying will almost double in the next fifteen years .
I would ask therefore that we see a bit more environmental mainstreaming .
Rather than confining the environmental aspects of aviation to a report solely devoted to that subject , we should be seeing environment threaded through all approaches to this policy area , particularly one which purports to be addressing issues of competitiveness .
Mr Sterckx has included environment in this own report .
I very much welcome that but I would also like to see environment automatically mainstreamed through all Commission reports and communications .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx for his report which addresses an important aspect of the civil aviation industry .
There is no doubt that civil aviation has grown considerably over the last ten years and it is predicted to continue growing in the foreseeable future .
There are those who would argue that this is due solely to the liberalisation process within that sector .
Whilst I and my Group recognise that this has had a considerable effect on aviation ' s growth , other factors have also contributed .
In the initial stages of liberalisation , a lot of people lost their jobs , those who remained had to work longer hours and others suffered a deterioration in their working conditions .
Also , on some routes , fares increased while others were so cheap that airlines went bust or built up huge losses .
Another result of liberalisation has been the practice of co-sharing , of airline alliances , and in some instances even takeovers .
We are beginning to see now an increase in aircraft registered outside the EU similar to the maritime sector ' s flag of convenience .
At my own airport in Manchester there are Icelandic-registered aircraft and I have been to Iceland more times than they have .
The reason why I mention these points is just to lend some balance to the argument .
It is very easy to say that liberalisation in aviation has been a glowing success , without ever recognising that there is also a negative side .
My Group accepts that gradual liberalisation is a way forward but only if safety , working conditions and passenger rights are safe-guarded and strengthened .
We accept that an increasing number of EU citizens are demanding better services
