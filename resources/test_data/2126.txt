comparable circumstances are treated differently , depending on the country in which they are established .
I wish to show by this that the budget problems will continue to exist as long as the Commission does not close up the "open end ' .
The first question was : what are you actually proposing on taxation ?
Do you , for example , actually propose shifting taxes on work to other areas such as energy ?
Mr President , I would first like to thank Commissioner Liikanen and Commissioner Gradin for the way in which the implementation of the European budget has improved recently .
Is it correct that in August this year no more than 4 % of the transeuropean network funds were being used and if so , what does the Commission intend to do to improve this situation during this year .
As far as former Yugoslavia is concerned , there are still considerable problems .
Here , our main problem is to ensure that what we plan to spend is also effectively spent .
Here we have an immense moral obligation to fulfil in connection with the reconstruction after our failure to dam up the conflict , and we are fulfilling it in an extremely poor and non-transparent way .
These are the things we must assess in a global framework and within that global framework we must assume our responsibility with regard to the European budget .
So in the first place for me enlargement is an institutional debate , but in addition it is a fact that we must prepare ourselves for the financing of the European Union after enlargement .
Linear cuts for me amount to a lack of courage and lack of political choice .
The strengthening of the ties with Canada is also important in the light of the recent reinforcement of transatlantic relations with the United States .
We applaud the fact that the rapporteur has had the courage over a period of several months to seek something of a consensus .
My group does support paragraph 6 of the resolution in which the Commission is called upon to undertake a study into the effect of the ageing of the population on the pension system .
But the preceding question asks whether all this is necessary .
Anyone who considers that to be socially unacceptable must be consistent and remove the EMU from their list of priorities .
But this can go hand in hand with the dismantling of the social welfare state .
Nevertheless , it is a fact that the Member States must not only adapt to this but there must also be a unity of jurisdiction and this is caused above all by the preliminary rulings under article 177 .
We wish you the best of luck in your new position .
International consultation is very important in order to guarantee electronic free trade .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I cannot go into the detail of this complicated subject here , but I shall attempt to give you the gist of my report on the Commission 's Green Paper on relations between the European Union and the ACP countries on the eve of the 21st Century - challenges and options for a new partnership .
Therefore we must think about the existence of the ties that the European Union has with the ACP countries , that is to say , the countries of Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific with which we have this agreement .
Europe itself was still limited to the common market and there was the conviction that you could separate the economic from the political .
The role of women is discussed in great detail in this report .
We must maintain and renew in this partnership the fundamental achievement of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries and the Joint Assembly also plays an important part here .
It is excellent because it provides a broad vision of the relationship between the European Union and the third world and also excellent because the report above all also shows an understanding of the difficult position in which many developing countries find themselves .
The rapporteur did not let himself be drawn into the fashionable criticism of our relationship with the third world .
In my view that is an important point in the new Lomé V. A second remark concerns democratization and the protection of human rights and the rights of minorities .
That is a painful matter that must also be placed on the table within the context of this discussion .
The resolution stresses the basic principles of the Lomé Convention as partnership , predictability and certainty .
The European Parliament wishes to take measures against this and there is great social pressure for such measures to be taken .
I must say that the European Commission , with the powers that it possesses , is looking at that and is helping but it does not possess that many powers to intervene .
Animals are injured , animals are dehydrated .
I trust Parliament will accept the resolution as it stands .
However , those animals that are transported must be moved using the most animal-friendly methods possible .
It is strange that the Union 's current export refunds still encourage long-distance transport of live animals .
Meat can be transported deep-frozen .
We often discuss the people 's Europe but here is a subject that has been raised by three million people .
It may in no way be seen as approval of the political situation .
In this context , priority must be given to trade and investment barriers .
It is not up to the EU to determine which countries in this region may or may not accede to ASEAN , however much trouble we have with the situation in some countries in the region
