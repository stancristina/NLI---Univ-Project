When calling for a guarantee fund for microprojects involving migrants , gender-specific projects must receive special attention .
Combat the contribution Europe is making to the migration of war refugees through its arms exports and reduce the emissions output of Europe and its trading partners if your desire is to reduce migration which is primarily the result of climate change and the spread of deserts .     . – Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , by means of the report on fair trade and development , we , as Parliament , are reacting to the remarkable economic and political success story which is fair trade .
However , it does involve defining criteria which make up the substance of the concept of ‘fair trade’ .
However , as far as this fledgling sector is concerned , consideration must constantly be given to the fact that precipitous directives always involve the risk of schematic harmonisation and over regulation .
Reference was also made to the enormous influence of fair trade production on combating poverty in general and , specifically , on the lives of women .
I wish to propose , by way of a compromise , that it be translated into the languages of those EU Member States affected by the investigations .
A number of things , though , will be important over the weeks to come .
It would be quite utterly wrong to support one of the parties to the conflict on the ground , and it needs to be stressed above all that since , at the moment , Ethiopia and Eritrea have a manifest and considerable interest in using Somalian territory as a place in which to settle their differences by force of arms , it is very important that the European Union should , through diplomatic channels , make it perfectly plain to both of them that this is just not on .
I hope that we will now give more attention to Mauritania , and not just because of the refugee situation , difficult though that indeed is , or because of the discontinuation of the fisheries agreement .
Censorship of the Internet is not a good thing anywhere , not even in the Member States of the European Union .
No more calumnies on big cars , then ; instead , let us stick with the objective we all share – that of achieving 120 mg per kilometre by 2010 .
Every gram of CO2 discharged into the atmosphere has the same effect on climate and should therefore be subject to the same amount of tax .
The fact that this is not the case does not bother them ; they just try it on , and anti-European sloganising gives them a chance of scoring a few points .
Do not misunderstand me : the Committee on Budgets takes the view that the EUR 154 million constitutes the minimum that should be allocated to the EMSA to enable it to cope with its additional functions .
The fact is , though , that Europe is not a suitable source of funds if fires are regularly started deliberately , and so , while I urge support for the victims , I also expect the Member States to call the arsonists to account and to punish them severely , particularly if their actions are motivated by land speculation , about which we hear every year with depressing regularity .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , responsibility for Commissioner Michel’s statement lies with him himself and with the Commission ; he alone bears responsibility for a statement he made some time ago in an interview .
Glad though I indeed am that these elections took place , I take a rather more sceptical view of them than do those who have already spoken .
It is also significant that our activities in Congo should involve the civil and military powers , working closely together to manage the crisis .
That is the core issue .
Again and again , you say that we want free trade .
I quite simply do not see us actually thinking through what we mean by modern trade policy .
Why can we not start thinking in terms of – among others – ‘multiregional ’ categories ?
Now , though , we have new tasks to which to address ourselves .
Daphne is a small , but very successful , programme , which has already enabled important progress to be made in combating violence against women .
Putting the two together in this way would certainly have resulted in even more misunderstandings and in incomprehension of what the European Union was up to , particularly among the persons affected by them , and I am glad that this is not going to happen .
At one moment we are in favour of taking efficiency into account , the next we decide not to .
As I see it , the main challenges , not least for the EU’s internal market , are the abolition of poverty , the removal of social divisions , and energetic action to protect the climate .
We are counting on this House to support this line , and , if it does so , we will then be able to vote to adopt the report as a whole .     – ( ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , climate change is one of the most crucial challenges that politicians such as ourselves have to face .
That I regard as disgraceful and absolutely indefensible in terms of the ongoing debate about the climate .
Reference is made in the European Charter for Small Enterprises to the fact that some insolvencies can occur despite the exercise of responsible initiative and entrepreneurial risk-taking , and a review of national insolvency laws in the light of proven best practice is accordingly called for .
What I can tell you
