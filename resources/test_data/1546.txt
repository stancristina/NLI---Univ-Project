Giving Parliament a bigger role and greater participation in issues such as the area of freedom , justice and security is the way in which this treaty has tried to bring the citizens and the institutions closer together .
Mr President , it is widely acknowledged that international terrorism has brought new challenges to our societies .
This is the context for the agreement we are examining today between the European Union and the United States concerning the transfer of financial messaging data .
It has enabled us to arrest terrorists after they have committed attacks and , most importantly , before they have succeeded in committing them .
It may not have been the best decision .
In this regard , and I wish to reiterate this point as clearly as possible , the Spanish Presidency is totally committed to the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , particularly Article 8 , and fully recognises the legitimate concerns expressed by Parliament .
For this reason , I have asked for time to work with all the countries of the European Union , with all the Member States , to look at whether we need to incorporate this type of consideration into the new agreement .
Of course , when something like this happens , when it comes to tackling a threat such as the threat of terrorism , I believe in making a response , but I am much more in favour of working quietly and continuously , slowly but surely , as we say in my country .
We are talking about mistakes made in an attack that fortunately did not happen .
In my opinion , the personality of suspected terrorists is a very significant factor in relation to this issue .
I hasten to add that some of the attacks that we have suffered in the past could have been avoided if the information had been made available in good time to those responsible for counter-terrorist measures ; in other words , if the information had been handled in an integrated , and if you will pardon the expression , an intelligent manner , which does not always happen .
As I said at the beginning of the debate , another of the consequences that we can draw from the alleged Detroit attack is that commercial aircraft continue to be a fundamental target for terrorists .
These matters are debated in the formal and informal Council of Transport Ministers .
These studies will be available to the Council and this House in the near future .
I would like to remind you , as I did in my first speech , that I am certainly not in favour of holding debates on such a complex and sensitive topic as the fight against terrorism after attacks or apparent attacks .
Once again , I would recommend that you look in detail at his last speech in this House because I believe it is an excellent speech that highlights the extent of our strategy .
The important thing is not to transmit all of the information that you have , but to transmit the information that is relevant to those who are receiving it .
Of course , if we do not , each country will be able to implement its own policies , and probably , even if we do decide on a common solution , there may be some countries that decide to go ahead with their own policies under their own laws .
Indeed , this became a critical issue just over a year ago , with the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine .
The Baltic energy market initiative now falls under the wider umbrella of the Union 's Baltic Sea Strategy , which was one of the Swedish Presidency 's main priorities .
The Member States concerned should also act as one on this matter .
They are , of course , part of our strategy to become a Europe with a truly common energy market , which it currently does not have .
Madam President , there is no doubt that the 2020 strategy is probably the most ambitious and important objective for the immediate future , and is going to be at the centre of the debates that are being held in Brussels tomorrow in the informal European Council , and which are taking place at the highest possible political level under the Spanish Presidency .
Therefore , we need to aim towards a production model which in itself creates stronger , more solid , more stable jobs based on specialisation .
In November last year , the Council adopted conclusions about religious freedom which allowed us to once again reiterate the European Union 's position on this subject , in clear terms .
I have already said that there is a structured dialogue and so a series of conversations take place regularly with China , on this subject .
We can conduct it with specific people , for example , in the case of the well-known human rights activist , Liu Xiaobo , or we can also conduct it on other levels , on a political level in political dialogue .
What is the Council 's position on this new information and these trials , and what explanations can it furnish ?
We have always taken the opportunity to express our concerns to the United States from a European Union standpoint regarding these matters .
The nature of Europe and what unites Europeans who speak different languages and have different traditions is precisely the fact that we share these values of defending human rights .
Mr President , I would like to begin by also congratulating my colleague Mrs Lynne for the excellent work she has done in our committee , for her ability to reconcile all points of view and for the work that she has carried out over such a long time .
However ,
