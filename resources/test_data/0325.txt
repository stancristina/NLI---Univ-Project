Some 500 people have died of starvation so far .
There is a lot of political corruption at work here .
Mr President , I should like to echo Mrs Daskalaki 's thanks to the members of the Committee of Culture , because I think it is very important that in her initiative report Mrs Daskalaki has touched on this question , which is of such interest to the press as part of the new technologies .
It is sufficient to cast a glance at the relevant statistics already mentioned by some supporters , to see that there is the same tendency in Europe as in the United States , where the printed word is sold less and less , and vital advertising income recedes accordingly .
This has less to do with the advance of new media , however , as with the trend towards print media concentration .
For this reason parents must be included much more in media education .
But even if we should now be successful in making the projected 450 , 000 lawyers and 100 , 000 judges better acquainted with Union law , that will not be enough to remove the existing deficit .
Then we shall have made a sensible contribution to animal welfare .
I do not deny that this is a very difficult and laborious process at European level , otherwise we should not have been talking about his subject for such a long time .
What are our possibilities ?
In other words , we should bear this in mind and not lump everything into one category .
For this reason an official vet should certify the correct transport of cattle , and the payment of export subsidies should be dependent upon production of this official certificate .
That is not the case here with everyone who announced their intention to make an explanation .
For the taxpayer as well , intervention is only justified when it concerns the maintenance of the environment and , above all , the maintenance of future-proof jobs .
It is exactly the same , by the way , with wine .
The correct policy would be to use the same effort for renewable ones .
If so , how is this to be achieved ?
This is quite unacceptable and the Commissioner has said as much .
It has made some useful , interesting and balanced suggestions .
We have to be clear what child pornography is .
If it really is the case - and there seems to be considerable evidence - that the phenomenon is growing , that children are being traded commercially , that children are kidnapped not only in order to abuse them but to coerce them into prostitution and export them - we know from the debates on human trade that it includes children -, then we must take all possible steps from the use of EUROPOL to the founding of a European centre for missing children .
I am glad that at least in this instance protection of children is to be guaranteed up to the age of 18 .
I believe it is not only a phenomenon in those countries , it happens here too .
So I welcome the discussion on these points relating to the fight against child abuse .
Much of what is contained in this resolution is a combined effort .
So what does the report suggest ?
But the way in which this report was eventually produced really was not ideal and the Committee on Fisheries must take care that it does not deal too often with such important and weighty matters with a series of compromises which then have to be rushed through the vote for lack of time .
We regard this as an essential requirement .
Because , Commissioner Flynn , if we take the position that special features of the legal provisions of some Member States must be allowed for and make that a common position , we might as well forget about all EU directives and save ourselves the work !
The accused must prove that they have adhered to the principle of equality , an important corrective in all Member States , for common legal instruments will include both direct and indirect discrimination .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , today 's discussion is in a sense a rehearsal for the debate we shall be having in exactly a month on Agenda 2000 and thus on the enlargement of the European Union .
Tomorrow we shall of course vote for agreement on this report .
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy we were very sorry that we were in a minority and the majority voted against the national face .
But back to coins .
It is important that we have common safety requirements for the construction of ships , fire prevention and the rescue equipment carried on board .
It is all the more inexplicable in view of the urgent necessity of reducing greenhouse gases , to which Member States have already committed themselves in Rio , Berlin and now Kyoto , coming up with the aim of a 15 % reduction .
It also has to be said that Altener II will also remain a patch-up if the political will is not there and that it is not there is indisputable .
In the report on the Green Paper , the European Parliament demanded a major Community programme for sustainable energies with a million photovoltaic systems on roofs and facades , 15 , 000 megawatt wind farms and 1 , 000 megawatt biomass plants .
I have just one question : what about Amendments Nos 28 and 29 ?
In this report I have basically welcomed the fact that the Commission has made specific proposals and that it has continued to concern itself with this topic , and I would like to highlight a number of
