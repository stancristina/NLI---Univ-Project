I told her I was not and that I had no particular interest in patents .
We know from experience that effective patent protection and research go hand in hand .
That , of course , is untrue .
We need it urgently .
Is it right , Mr Rothley , to allow things just because they are possible ?
Above all else , morality means independence .
That is the political decision before us .
The competitiveness of European industry must be fostered , and European researchers must be motivated to remain in Europe , to conduct research in Europe and not to emigrate overseas .
That applies to both sides , so the applause was perhaps premature .
Implantation in the womb is already known .
If Parliament approves this report , the ethical floodgates will come under intense pressure .
I therefore appeal to you to reject the report as it now stands and to adopt the amendments tabled by the Green Group .
The directive in front of us only does that to a limited and unsatisfactory extent , and at certain points it even abolishes such protection , as in Amendment 74.
It should not be the subject of exclusive property and exploitation rights .
Genetically engineered human hormones , for example , will be a monumental step forward for haemophiliacs , for anaemia sufferers and for patients with genetic metabolic disorders .
Madam President , I have a question for Mr Monti on Amendment 49 .
One thing is perfectly clear : there is good reason for the haste with which genetically manipulated organisms are being released , because the more information people have about the possible consequences and risks , the harder it will be to legalize this technology .
That result is on the table today .
Mr Argyros ' report will be dealt with by my colleague Karel van Miert .
In this case , however , 14 Member States agree with us that carrier preselection is very important for competition and for the consumer , especially , of course , because it reduces telephone charges .
It was a purely technical consideration .
We shall not be the dog in the manger .
I believe that these questions do deserve an answer , but for that you need time .
That might well be an interesting development , for I see that Mr Barton 's thought processes have also been developing .
At the present time we have similar practices in the domains of humanitarian aid and currency reserves .
And it assumes even greater importance because it is intended as a benchmark for the development of Community staffing policy in the coming weeks and months .
For that reason we have explicitly welcomed what the Council presidency said at the trialogue : not creative accounting but a real solution .
What is absolutely contestable , and what I cannot support at the present time , is the proposal for both a linear cut - although I learned today that this part of the proposal has now been dropped - and above all for a specific cut .
I do find it quite astonishing that there should now be moves to deviate from this line without a reasonable alternative being presented .
The decision , in fact , was taken back in 1988 .
I believe I ought to be fair here .
We all know - and the Council , we hope , will take the same view - that liberalization and the competitive conditions which go with it cannot be allowed to produce a situation where social and safety legislation goes by the board .
As we see it , the Commission 's next step should be to produce its White Paper on the internalization of external costs , and also the study that was specifically requested in the Schmidbauer report , giving evidence of the external costs of all modes of transport .
Finally , I should like to express my sincere thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism , the committee secretariat and also the representatives of the Commission .
However , the proposal before us does not yet offer any guarantee that the suggested charges will have the same impact in all the Member States .
The proposal would allow the Member States to impose differentiated user charges where this was justified beyond doubt in terms of traffic congestion , pollution and accident rates , and it would also allow for the designation of sensitive routes .
I should like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent report and for his commitment to achieving a broad degree of consensus in the House .
Madam President , I asked for the floor because I wished to respond first of all to Mr Wijsenbeek , whose speech was extremely clever , even though wide of the mark .
In my view , however , it does not matter what we call the document which cites the wrongdoers and their wrongdoings .
Agenda 2000 shows that the European Union has responsibility for the whole of Europe , but it is more than just a plan for expansion .
Of course there will be a cost , there will be political problems , and not just for us but for the eastern European states , too .
( Applause ) In this context , the summit in Luxembourg in November must send out a signal : a signal which says that the Union is at last concentrating its policy on employment , on the creation of employment .
We are prepared to reform the Structural Funds .
I am really very grateful to President Santer for making this clear .
And there are other governments that are saying no to reform as a way of preventing enlargement - they exist too .
I am glad that the Commission has now taken it up .
But , President Santer , we expect you to
