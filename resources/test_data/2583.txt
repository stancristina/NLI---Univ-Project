principal operator has led to a price increase for those most deprived of public services , in the name of economic profitability and competitiveness for the benefit of those who unjustifiably want to hold long-distance conversations .
It is true that some of those who have built the European Union are trying to change the names of certain activities , and to alter concepts that disturb their ultraliberal presuppositions .
Mr President , there is plenty of justification for the initiative we are examining , which demonstrates the importance of the supply of services of general interest and the terms in which it must be monitored .
And in cases where competition is possible , consumers without much in the way of means will be the principal beneficiaries , as we have been seeing in the case of telephone services or air transport , for example , with the irreversible abolition of the old companies with their monopoly privileges - we still suffer from them in Portugal - which , it is claimed , serve a useful social function .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to congratulate Angela Billingham very sincerely on the excellent report she has prepared and the Commission on its statement .
One of the essential problems affecting public services is competition .
The Jové Peres report opens up the possibility of increasing national production , allowing for new plantations which would make it possible to return to traditional production levels .
Madam President , I too am impressed by Mr Martínez 's contribution to the debate .
Secondly , I would like to say that , whatever subsidy system is used in the future , I think the two main sources of fraud in the sector should be abolished .
Anything can happen with this Commission and this Europe which is always ashamed of something ; we 're ashamed of producing olive oil !
I would like to say , however , that there is an important point , and I will conclude with this .
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , a lot has already been said about tobacco .
I am hygienic because that is how I was brought up , and it was preferable to concentrate on educating children , so that they actually become careful about tobacco , tobacco abuse , alcohol abuse , and anything bad for health .
Not so !
I will never allow any fellow-Member to say that I take money from anyone .
I have no hesitation in apologizing to my fellow-Member for what I did , but I would most earnestly ask him not to call any Member a thief , because there are Members who do not like being called by such a name .
Parliament expressed its opinion on the substance of this agreement last June , with a clear majority .
We opposed the authorization of the use of any of these traps in water , rivers or lakes , as killing traps .
I would nevertheless like to state my own view at this point on the moment we have reached and on the tactical aspect of the agreement , since we are discussing its substance .
And in particular , with regard to the derogations , that is to day the possibility of non-implementation of what is written into the agreement , I should like to ask the Commission what the American representative , Charlene Barshefsky , has already put in her letter to Minister Klaus Kinkel , where she says that these derogations will be applied in cases of extreme necessity and that they will be the same as in the agreement with Canada and Russia .
If it had not been for the pressure of European public opinion , which we represent , the first versions of the agreements with the Americans would have been approved .
Yesterday something happened which I would have liked to avoid , and which I am not proud of .
I went up to him and asked him ' What did you say ? '
The ECU 150 million proposed by the Council for the 1998 budget after the Luxembourg summit on employment are no more than a palliative ; the sums allotted show how important the subject really is .
In this context , I think we should be pleased with ourselves for refusing to give the Council 's proposal to cut ECU 1 billion from the structural funds a second reading .
There are not sufficient institutional structures in the European Union for the adequate processing of information on infringements of human rights .
Mr President , with the interests of the EU primarily in mind , the creation of the euro may also be of great significance to the other areas of the world .
In view of the desirability of its world-wide acceptance , we need an immediate broad dissemination campaign in the various areas of the world , a point to which I would particularly like to draw the Commissioner 's attention , as we suggested in the report we made to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy .
And in fact legal and tax barriers still exist that cannot be overcome , as the report recognizes and which , on that account , cannot mean that only the euro can overcome them .
Since when have common interests been unresolved , even if consent and unanimity are required ?
It seems right that consumers should not be asked to bear them but , as these costs will exist and will be substantial , who will bear them ?
The enormous revolution which the introduction of the euro will cause worldwide , and not just in the EU countries , needs citizens to be well informed for it to be accepted and a success and ...
