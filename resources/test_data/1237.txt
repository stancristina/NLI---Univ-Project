During the Portuguese Presidency , we will be continuing discussions on the CAP , by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union ' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers ' incomes , paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms .
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes , in the Agriculture Council , the Health Council , the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council .
We also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers .
It is an extreme manifestation of the phenomenon of social exclusion and of poverty , which the Council is attempting to combat in various ways .
This programme will support action carried out by NGOs in this field .
This would have obvious consequences in terms of our ability to remedy all of these negative knock-on effects which cause social exclusion and which are obviously linked to poverty .
It is therefore a key issue , which will enable us to show the public how useful Europe can be to them .
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency , which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme .
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission ' s own scope for intervening , through its right of initiative .
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented , specifically by non-governmental organisations , but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters .
I am thinking in particular of the whole debate in which we participated on renewing the Lomé convention and on establishing the new contractual framework which will succeed the Lomé Convention .
Because our own national parliaments are concerned , just as this Parliament needs to be , at Community level , about the way in which these appropriations are being allocated and used .
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments ' ability to act and within the scope of the Council .
You have raised a long-standing problem in the field of food aid which is whether food aid might actually be damaging agriculture in developing countries .
With regard to the question asked by Mr Marinos , I would like , first of all , to emphasise that the Council is fully aware that the cultural dimension is without a doubt one of Europe ' s great triumphs and that we need to make every effort to safeguard our cultural identity .
With regard to Mr Nogueira Román ' s question on employment , I refer to what I said earlier : this issue is still of concern to members of national parliaments and to national governments , and it will , of course , occupy a central place in the Portuguese Presidency ' s programme .
It should therefore continue to be the responsibility of the conference itself , which is an intergovernmental structure , to study how the issues you have raised could be incorporated into its work within the scope of its mandate .
As you know , both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately .
If , by chance , it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , then this could be suggested , both by Member States , and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group .
This is an issue which , as you will understand , will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue , because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place .
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so .
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative , the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue .
Let me remind you of what this statement said . 1 - The governments of the fourteen Member States shall not initiate or accept any official bilateral contacts at political level with an Austrian Government which includes the Freedom Party .
Basically , the view these states share of the political situation in Austria led them to conclude that the possible inclusion in the Austrian Government of a party such as the Freedom Party could bring about a change in respect for the common values which the Member States of the European Union are committed to safeguarding .
First of all , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , no one is threatening the existence of a democratic government in Austria or questioning the electoral reality behind the results of the recent elections .
( Applause ) Let me repeat that point : this applies to Austria today and it would apply tomorrow to any Member State of the European Union .
As for the tangible consequences of this , about which the Commission ' s statement yesterday gave a few clues , the European Union will try to continue its work , whilst strictly respecting the Treaties and of course paying particular attention to the way in which the new Austrian Government acts .
