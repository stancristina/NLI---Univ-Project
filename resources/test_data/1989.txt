Public and social investments are dwindling , equal opportunity and the fight against all forms of discrimination related to access to employment , and labour relations are being undermined , and priority is being given to whatever serves the aim of the 'economic productivity of labour ' for big business , in other words low wages , lack of social protection , flexible and temporary employment , and the persistent exclusion of women , young people and people with special needs from the labour market .
That asset is , and will prove to be , valuable in the struggle for a social , democratic and supportive Europe , a Europe of peace , progress and socialism .
Now is not the time to pass judgement past events and situations .
It is an open secret that interests are being expressed in the Balkans by many sides and many people , who often do not have common strategic aims .
Secondly : the boundaries of the states in the area are non-negotiable , even if it proves necessary in critical cases to adopt flexible forms of administrative autonomy and greater decentralisation .
Without exaggeration , at the beginning of the 21st century we would have a new thirty-year war , 10 years of which , in any case , we have unfortunately lived through .
Positive results will emerge through development , democracy and prosperity .
I hope that the strong convergence of support for the Lagendijk report achieved in the Committee on Foreign Affairs will find the same response in Parliament , and thereby express the desire of us all for a positive and stable outcome .
By its very nature , the Stability Pact in Eastern Europe is intrusive , on the pretext that human rights and democracy are being protected .
In other words , new interventions are being prepared , even military ones , with the aim of converting the area into a protectorate .
They try , either by force or by economic blackmail , to terrorise peoples and subjugate them to the new order .
And the question is this : what principle of international law are they basing their actions on ?
Mr President , I will make three points .
The second point I want to stress is that financing part of the reconstruction plans by reducing agricultural expenditure must finally stop .
The truth , however , is that contrary to what some people are claiming even in Greece , the Helsinki decisions on Turkey have emboldened the Turkish regime .
But we have been hearing that in the Council of Europe for very many years , perhaps more than ten , without anything happening .
Will the Kurdish issue ever be resolved , will all the political parties be allowed freedom of formation and operation and finally , will Turkey ever withdraw its troops from Cyprus ?
We have come to believe it ourselves and we claim to represent the world-wide moral conscience .
You see , Belgrade can be bombed , but not Moscow , Beijing or Ankara .
Secondly , would the Council be prepared , in this whole process , to suspend or cancel obligations of the European Union relating to the pre-accession process as long as the people we are talking about remain in prison ?
For goodness sake !
We are talking here about two very ancient peoples who have been subjected to systematic genocide by the Turkish regime , a genocide perhaps not so impressive as in Armenia , but just as effective .
Is the Council going to take any specific action along those lines ?
I want to thank him for his answer .
Are there any special support and aid programmes planned by the European Union specifically for these people who are living in such misery and desperation ?
What is hiding behind all that ?
And the third question : how can it be that the citizens of the European Union are being called upon to pay for the Stability Pact even though European undertakings established there cannot be protected by the European Union ?
This great truth emerges from a fact rather unknown to most , that in the English language , for example , there are at least 75 000 words of Greek origin .
The English sage , Francis Bacon , said that knowledge is power , so knowledge of the basic languages from which our modern European languages derive improves our general knowledge and reinforces European civilisation , which , besides its humanitarian value , is also a weapon for our survival and prosperity as Europeans in a globalised economy .
- ( EL ) The citizens of Europe , especially workers , farmers , small and medium-sized enterprises , women , the young , the nouveaux pauvres , all those who suffer under the policies of the EU , are already voicing their anger and disagreement , some more forcefully than others , with the choices being made by the European Union .
The European Union is being used by imperialists and multinationals as a battering ram to break the people ' s resistance and make them give up their fight for a better tomorrow .
What is the point of rotating Commissioners ' nationalities and not rotating the presidency of the Union if not to exile a supposedly small country from the centre of power for long periods of time so that it is basically unable to defend its interests and the interests of its people , insofar as they can be defended within the framework of the European Union ?
There is only one conclusion to be drawn from the EP resolution , which the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against , and from the Commission ' s recent proposals .
Greece has started using its good relations with Iran to wage a campaign and to take steps
