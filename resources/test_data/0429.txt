With the planned reform of the structural funds , this idea is very unlikely to be considered , given the considerable reduction in the objectives in general .
The rapporteur is right to recommend - and I am glad he does - the adoption of the common position by Parliament on the basis of few improvements to the final text which could be accepted by the Council and by the Commission and which are intended to enhance and clarify the general aim of the directive .
Overall , and on this I am in agreement with the rapporteur , the report provides a vast quantity of information which demonstrates that , notwithstanding the progress made , the principle of equality of opportunity is far from actually acquired .
That is why I invite the Commission to take account of the rapporteur 's suggestions , so that the next annual report is slimmer , perhaps more broadly usable and also more responsive to the proposals the European Parliament has been making for years in its various reports , richer in examples of good practice and specific instruments .
What does 'strategic vision ' mean ?
( The President cut off the speaker )
This is really serious .
That certainly is quite incredible : it means we are still faced with an attitude to what goes on in family life or , rather , in a relationship between people , which is not based on anything very different .
I think it is even more important to make that statement as a man , to avoid any suspicion of corporatism in these matters , as other speakers have observed .
Think of those androgynous beauties , think of the hairy chests , think of the well-muscled , increasingly ostentatious monsters .
Instead , there is a queue - look outside any advertising agency - of women seeking to engage in this profession .
So , I repeat , it is up to them to decide how to do so and with how much good taste .
That sends a very positive signal : it certainly means that the work so many of us have done for so long , undervalued and opposed , is beginning to bear fruit and these issues are attracting more attention , in fact the feminist position is becoming common sense and received opinion .
Perhaps if some of us , young and beautiful of course , had spoken in the nude .... !
The banana is an endemic crop in these countries , it represents the history of the inhabitants but it may have no future if this absurd trade agreement continues to be escalated .
In Ecuador the growers get $ 3-4 a box which is then resold at $ 22-23 .
The endemic state of civil war continues to prevent the export of Somalia 's quota .
The Memorandum of Understanding signed in Ottawa in December 1995 , provided for the closure of the Chernobyl reactor in the year 2000 , completed by a long term energy strategy including , as a least cost investment plan , the completion of reactors K2 and R4 which you , Mr President , have mentioned .
As you know , the vice-chairman of our committee has been to Ukraine several times , he has kept us up-to-date on what is going on and will be in a position to summarize it to the House with full knowledge of the facts .
Next Thursday the second bilateral meeting between the United States and the European Union will begin in Paris on setting common criteria for the definition of rules to guarantee the safety of investments .
Your colleague , Commissioner Fischler , himself raised the same question the other day on the BSE issue , asking whether and to what extent , within the context of this general liberalization , it would still be possible to take the necessary steps to protect the health of European citizens .
Finally , and this is a basic clarification , if there is a wish to apply a retroactive criterion to Cuba and support the approach of the United States on nationalization issues , given that in that country a large part of the property belonging to foreigners or Cubans who have emigrated to the United States was nationalized 36 years ago , and considering that , while virtually every other state has for years sought compromise solutions on its citizens ' nationalized property , the United States has refused to do so , the new rules under discussion could be extended to any commercial operation , any investment in that island , in contradiction , I repeat , to the decisions which have been taken by the European Union .
This is one point on which concern has been expressed by my colleagues .
But the Council , like the Commission , has not put forward any concrete proposal , any initiative to stem the horror , the slaughter and the violence , and it concludes by stating that the Algerians must find the solution to their problems on their own .
To isolate the extremism and establish a dialogue between the parties is certainly possible , and we Europeans have the means to get it accepted .
I would also like to express a few thoughts .
I welcome with great satisfaction the idea that a delegation from this Parliament is going to make an urgent visit to Algeria to begin as constructive a dialogue as possible with the new Algerian Parliament .
But I would mention that there is already a delegation on relations with the Maghreb countries , which carries out its duties with a sense of responsibility and which , if required , can be broadened for the occasion , so as to represent the whole of the European Parliament better .
In saying that , I am not trying to justify the European Union , I simply believe it
