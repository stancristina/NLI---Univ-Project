thing to do at European level .
I hope that working together , as we will be during the next six months , will produce the best possible results .
We live in a time of enormous challenges .
As it is about to begin , this Presidency has already been described as a sort of transitional phase .
It would be the wrong way to treat Europe’s future generations if we were to close our eyes to the historic challenges we face and just wait around for a better time to come .
The programme you have presented today , President-in-Office , reflects both the strong reforming tendencies of your government and the egalitarian and innovative impulses of a nation which repeatedly tops the league tables for education , innovation and development .
Liberal values will be on the march with your Presidency .
First , the market-driven programme .
As regards Article 42 – justice and home affairs – your Presidency is right to focus on areas where European Union legislation adds value to citizens ’ lives , but in the modern world a wanted man can be halfway across Europe before the policeman has his boots on .
President-in-Office , the time has come to heed our call to apply the footbridge clause provided for in Article 42 and to make policy in justice and home affairs democratically .
But true transparency requires that the transposition , implementation and enforcement of legislation be given much more attention than it has to date .
Three years ago , we demanded that Member States draw up concordance tables showing how they transposed EU directives into national law .
Otherwise , poor implementation and gold-plating will continue to fuel the fire of Brussels-bashers .
With greater power comes greater responsibility and I hope that our House will bear that in mind when it meets today to discuss much-needed parliamentary reform .
We wish you success in finding a way forward to an agreement in the WTO , so valuable to our economy and that of developing countries , and we wish you great success with enlargement , though we know that is also in the hands of another very competent Finn , Commissioner Rehn , who is here with us today .
As Lönnrot did for Finland in the Kalevala , we need to draw on aspects of our common history to create a common consciousness .
I wish you the wisdom of Väinämöinen .
For his people’s lasting pleasure , mighty songs for Suomi’s children .     .
That policy is now being continued .
In major political issues during the Presidency the Finnish Government will not obtain the backing of its own people .
This Constitution will never come into force anywhere .
Its ratification is a waste of time , although that is what the Commission , among other bodies , wants .
Commissioner Rehn’s attitude does not befit a Member of the European Commission .
Neither is Finland showing any regard for the power of the people or democracy in France or the Netherlands .
Mr Vanhanen’s Government has yielded to the EU’s will by abolishing the requirement under national law for a UN mandate as a condition for the mobilisation of a combat force division .
Civil servants in Finland are trained in dealing effectively with matters relating to EU enlargement , Structural Funds programmes , the REACH regulation , the Seventh Framework Programme on science and research and many other day-to-day issues on the EU’s agenda .
These also include the directive on services and free trade , which our group has viewed critically .
Our group actively supports the policy on Russia and thinks that Commission President Barroso’s proposal for a free trade agreement with Russia is an interesting start and one which the Presidency needs to respond to .
Finland is thoroughly prepared to succeed in its Presidency .
Finland has proposed that the Union should put time and effort into innovation and competitiveness , transparency , energy , the Northern Dimension and external relations , as well as finding a solution regarding the fate of the Constitution .
Finland , however , should take a look in the mirror when it comes to progress on the European Common Foreign and Security Policy .
The government’s approach in particular to the European defence dimension has been woefully inconsistent .
Our Government has only yielded when it has realised it was in a minority in the Council .
Closer cooperation is needed if we are to improve the security of the European people and global stability .
What then could the Council do under a Finnish leadership ?
Most of these have already been introduced in one way or another , though not the security guarantee clause .
The development , however , has become tangled .
If I can quote the wise words of the Prime Minister , we should not just wait around for a better time to come .
Energy is a weapon of foreign policy , but it is also a weapon in the struggle for global resources , for energy .
Is this such an impossible equation to balance ?
The Russians have begun to take a positive view of the Northern Dimension , but now have doubts about the new European Neighbourhood Policy , because they do not want to be compared with countries in the south or the northern Sahara .
The Northern Dimension must become an important forum for northern issues .
It was out of date when it started , and , just as Mr Poettering said , we want a stable , democratic and developing Russia .
That , at least , is what we Finns want to believe .
Its coolness is invigorating .
Despite the fact that we share a border , Finland is not one of those countries which are suspected of promoting its own interests at the expense of a common European policy .
