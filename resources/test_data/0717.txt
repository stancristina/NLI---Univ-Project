recruitment and promotion procedures , in order that women , too , can be afforded the chance to make a career .
I can only endorse your words , Mr President , and say , on behalf of my group , that we are in full agreement with you on that .
It was signed by Mr Vinci .
It has an influence , therefore , on European drugs policy , asylum and immigration policy , aspects of privacy and what have you .
We desire a revision of the Treaty in the good sense , so to speak , of the communitization of Schengen .
We want to modify the tone of the report , but we also want to correct its content .
That means giving competence to the European Parliament - including it , that is to say - and also giving competence to the Court of Justice in this field .
We compliment her on her excellent work .
I am very pleased that the Schengen testing ground for policy , as I have called it , has induced the realization that these measures are essential .
Mr President , the great European projects always have the same failing in that the social dimension seems constantly to lag behind .
But in the final analysis I feel that the whole thing is viewed too much as an automatic process and that too few critical questions are asked , for example , about the driving back of the hierarchy and the broadening of organization and the repercussions of that with regard to the decline of the less skilled and less specialized work of which we in Europe have a tremendous need .
Discussion about the information society is focused only on people who have work , and thus all those people who are not in work , who are unemployed , or retired or not involved in the employment process for some other reason , are left out in the cold .
Coordination and societal factors must also receive attention .
Mr President , I am very happy with Mr Van Velzen 's report and , in particular , with what he has said this evening .
It is not that we are in a situation that could lead to a revolution : we are already in the middle of one .
If Europe is to win through in the field of the information and communication technologies it is essential that action be taken to that end .
Entirely new forms of education and teacher training need to be devised .
Exemption from this prohibition was granted only for developing countries .
The strong growth in air traffic and the more stringent noise requirements being imposed at airports impose a need for ever-increasing economy in the allocation of the available noise space .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I speak in this debate principally to mention a problem at a regional airport which is a perfect example of the problems that can arise in connection with this matter .
If the Commissioner cannot answer the question here and now can we expect a written answer ?
Industrial reorganization is not unusual in Europe , and people say that the relocations , downsizing , redeployment and closures we are seeing are all the result of competitiveness within the various sectors and competition on the world market .
Thanks to the Council 's lax attitude , the 1992 revision of the directive on collective redundancies did not go as far as it should have done or as the European Parliament and the Commission wanted .
Europe is doing more for animals than for people , so it is no surprise that people are rejecting it .
Ten years further on , pitifully few of the promised social improvements have actually been made .
And who holds a 48 % share in Renault ?
Seven other directives have been held up in the Council for years .
It is the Commission which grants billions in subsidies for these relocations .
The fact that Dehaene knew about the closure days in advance and chose to make monkeys out of the Vilvoorde workforce shows just what sort of a man he is .
It is as well to know these things about someone whose ambition it is to become a member of the European Commission .
That is why I am particularly pleased that you are proposing to tighten up the directive , and I hope that you will press on with this as quickly as possible .
Until two years ago , Renault was a state-owned company and the French State is still a 47 or 48 % shareholder .
Given that Renault is a multinational , some sort of action is obviously expected from the European Union , and it is understandable that Commissioner Van Miert should launch an inquiry into Spain 's plans to provide government aid for the Renault plant there , and that Commissioner Flynn should review the rules on the consultation of workers .
But I do not agree with those who are taking advantage of the situation to launch an attack on Europe or to target the free market economy .
The role of maritime transport is set to increase , especially in connection with the Mediterranean partnership and cooperation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , such as Poland and the Baltic States .
I would add that this costs a good deal of money and must not be allowed to result in further differences in operating conditions for the maritime industry in Europe .
It is thus the job of governments and scientists to convince producers and consumers of the need for change .
The differences in regulations are hampering trade .
This report is acceptable to the Green Group in the European Parliament because it allows the Member States the scope to introduce more sweeping measures to prevent noise from aircraft .
