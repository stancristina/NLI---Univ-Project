In this regard , I believe that the result of the vote in the Committee on Budgets - the EUR 300 million - is an expression of a more realistic solution .
I would also like to thank Mr Maňka for his work on the budget for other institutions .
Our group believes that we should be careful of excessive increases in the allocation for political parties , but we have agreed to the draft that is on the table , and I would also like to thank Mr Maňka for the fact that he has focused on the expenditure on translation and on Parliament 's buildings policy .
We have been calling for this for a long time .
Mr President , yesterday , I was asked to give three reasons why people should vote against this report .
First of all , it is farcical that any parliament would want to adopt a report based on a treaty , the fate of which is still completely uncertain .
No one knows what the future of the Treaty of Lisbon is , and anyone with even the smallest modicum of respect for democratic structures - the smallest modicum of respect for Member States such as the Czech Republic - would hold back on this project until there was clarity about the future of the treaty .
Secondly , this report ( and the whole foreign affairs service that is now being constructed ) represents a complete undermining and disavowal of and failure to appreciate the sovereign right of the Member States to conduct their own foreign policies .
The Commission , of course , particularly in its role as a 'civil servant' , is very obviously not popularly elected .
That means , thirdly , that it is a democratic farce that this Parliament wants to hand more power , some absolutely crucial core areas within the sovereign State , to the Commission , which has no popular mandate .
It is never ever based on demos .
We must , therefore , have more democracy .
Mr President , my thanks to Mrs Paliadeli for a splendid report .
There is not much time , so I will restrict myself to just three points .
The first thing I would like to mention is the Ombudsman 's monitoring of his agreement with the European Investment Bank .
This was an initiative that our group took in connection with Parliament 's resolution on the 2006 annual report .
Secondly , I would like to mention the amendment proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calling on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to draw up procedures to make it easier to bring cases before the Court of Justice , with regard to which Parliament will support the Ombudsman 's recommendations .
This is something that we previously received Parliament 's support for in principle .
My third point is about the amendment we have tabled today for making the Ombudsman 's authority clearer in matters of poor administration - maladministration , in other words .
Although our proposal looks quite technical , it is considerably more secure from a legal point of view than the wording in the report .
Mr President , I , too , would like to start by saying how pleased I am that we now have the Treaty of Lisbon in place , a treaty which will , of course , give Parliament more power over the budget and change the way we adopt the EU 's annual budget .
However we resolve this in practice , we have made a start with Mr Lamassoure 's report , and I would like to thank him for taking the initiative so quickly .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wholeheartedly supports the report , which indicates how we are to deal with the amending budgets and transfers and other things that have already been mentioned .
The Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group has tabled a number of amendments proposing the abolition of the amending budgets and transfers .
We agree with Mr Lamassoure that the number of amending budgets should be reduced .
Moreover , national parliaments also have such an instrument .
The increasing number of requests for money from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in connection with the large number of dismissals alone will , of course , result in a number of amending budgets .
There are very fixed rules for how much the Commission can transfer and how it is to be done - it cannot simply be done however the Commission fancies .
The report also points out that the Financial Regulation and the interinstitutional agreement should now be amended , too , and I very much look forward to us receiving a proposal from the Commission soon .
I have one big Christmas wish , and that is that when the climate conference is over and all the participants have stopped acting like administrators and technicians who talk only of details and quotas , we can then finally have a political debate about what can realistically and practically be done to improve conditions for our planet and its inhabitants .
If we open our eyes , we will see all too clearly that the US , Russia , China and many other countries around the globe do not really have climate change on the agenda .
Instead , they are simply making fine-sounding declarations of intent and empty promises .
Seven months ago - on 23 April to be precise - a large majority in this House refused to grant discharge to the Council 's budget for 2007 .
It was because the Council 's behaviour in respect of Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control was completely unacceptable .
The situation was so absurd that representatives of the Council immediately
