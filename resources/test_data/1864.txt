there are more people in this House who are concerned about the directive as it stands at the moment .
Could we now move to the vote ?
That is against the rules of the House .
That is what we call integrating the environment into agriculture .
The European Union 's eco-labels scheme is a good initiative to protect the environment within the internal market .
Secondly , our group agrees with the rapporteur that the formation of an independent European Eco-label Organization ( EEO ) will not overcome the difficulties that arise from the complex procedures for establishing criteria for eco-labels .
Mr President , I wish to speak in connection with Rule 41 of the Rules of Procedure and Annex II .
Commissioner Van Miert , can you tell me what the point was of the expensive studies which DG X carried out in 1993 ?
We have always said that that must not be allowed .
I am pleased about this and , to repeat , we will keep watch to ensure that such things do not happen at future sports events .
I think we have a common enemy , which is those who with corporatist associations think that they are above and outside European regulations .
The Commission has to stick to the instruments it has been given .
However , I am afraid , just as you are , that things are going on here and there , bearing in mind what has happened in the past too , which are not always as they should be .
And there have been two notable examples of this .
Just consider melatonine , which is freely available in the United States but has to be dispensed on prescription here .
Mr President , my compliments go to Mrs Miranda .
I want to put a question to the Commissioner : how does the Commission think it can ensure the dynamic implementation of the human rights clause ?
However , a number of comments do need to be made on this agreement .
Time will tell .
Mr President , the immediate reason which led to the revision of the Community customs code was the report by the committee of enquiry of the European Parliament into fraud in customs transit .
Is it true that as important a country as Germany has refused to take part in the pilot project which has already been simplified ?
The two most important examples of this are the rules for the provision of security , including the test of reliability , Article 94 , and the limiting of opportunities for Member States to introduce simplified procedures , Article 97.
We know the Commissioner to be a good democrat and so have confidence in the outcome .
This is because this guarantees business and industry a fair chance of being heard when real changes are being made .
All in all the time before the business community knows whether it is susceptible to fraud or that fraud has been committed is extremely long .
Some candidates knew exactly how to deal with the questions .
Does this provide us with the strongest team ?
Incidentally , it gives us the opportunity to start a comprehensive file on all Mr Trichet 's actions .
In the meantime it has become clear that , politically speaking , this veto right does exist .
The organization of the hearings worked well .
It has also become clear that the ECB will immediately be faced with the question as to how it is going to give shape to its secondary task , namely supporting general economic policy .
As if the Group of the Party of European Socialists are the only ones here in this Parliament who defend openness and transparency where the Central Bank is concerned .
Some suspicion continues to linger in the minds and hearts of the people .
Marianne would topple from her virginal pedestal .
In the wake of the two previous Dutch speakers I want to know whether we will be assessing a president who will make use of his sovereign will to step down midway ?
Moreover , the candidates have shown in advance that they have the predisposition to operate as a team .
The decision-making procedure of the Council must of course be changed .
I invite everyone to consult the result of the roll-call votes shortly , then it will become clear how strong my backbone is .
London is mentioned over and over again .
Afterwards the President of the sitting at the time asked for a vote on the original paragraph 8.
I am sorry , I would like to go some way towards it , but in this case I cannot .
It should be improved in future if we want to strengthen public confidence in the euro .
And this policy is working .
That is why I am pleased to see that qualitative objectives have been set for this .
National policies are the answer here , as the intensity of the pollution varies so much from country to country .
We see it as our principal task to plead that from the outset , as is the case with the establishment of the European Central Bank , Parliament is fully involved in the preparation and the further elaboration of plans on that point .
This does not , for instance , mean replacing NATO , but being an addition to it .
The Ministers of Defence should also be able to meet in Union context .
I was and remain sceptical about the opportunities to develop a genuine defence policy within the Union context .
What the Union needs above all , and I have often said so , is positive practical experience .
This does not involve any military instrument .
Instead , the United States is conducting subcritical tests and the START-II Treaty is not being ratified by the Russian Duma
