, but I take the view that democracy is best placed , as the Danes say , 'in the pockets of the citizens ' .
By virtue of association agreements , they have something which in reality is equivalent to two thirds membership of the European Union without any influence .
But now that the Schengen system has been created , I would far rather that it were kept under the third pillar , and for once I find myself in the situation of being able to praise the presidency for the exceptional lack of efficiency that is inherent in the administration of these rules .
I would like to add that this Parliament is naturally interested in ensuring the maximum possible openness with regard to these decisions , a wish I fully support .
The conduct of the Council in this respect leaves a great deal to be desired , whether the Treaty is interpreted one way or the other .
Mr President , International Consumers ' Day was celebrated in March , with the theme of electronic commerce and consumer protection .
Commerce using digital networks should be at least as secure and safe as commerce in the physical world .
One of the major problems with the directive is that it is the rules of the country of origin that apply .
The level of protection in the Nordic countries is generally higher than in other countries , especially as far as marketing in relation to children is concerned .
The background to the principle of using the rules of the country of origin is that it is too difficult for trade and industry to be familiar with every Member State 's legislation in this area .
For the consumer , commerce on the Internet thus virtually takes on the character of Russian roulette .
What rules apply , and what rights do we have if something goes wrong ?
I support the amendments , which improve the directive , but I cannot support the text as a whole - and the June Movement cannot support the text as a whole - because it still takes the country of origin principle as its starting-point .
Madam President , dear Nicole , the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is also pleased to congratulate you on your election today .
It is a matter of great importance to us that things should now be put in order in Parliament , so that a journey costing EUR 300 is not reimbursed with EUR 1000 , and remuneration is completely upfront and not hidden in perks slipped in through the back door .
I am certain that we will be able to work constructively together to open up the decision-making process within the EU.
But we can offer constructive opposition .
Around this time , twenty five years ago , I visited you at a flat in Paris , where you were in exile .
But I have been unable to support you today , for , although we may agree on democracy in Portugal , my group does not support your ideas on integration within Europe .
That is why we have been unable to vote for MÃ¡rio Soares , even though his past life and background strike a chord with me .
Again , on a personal note and speaking as one of the ten veterans to have sat here in Parliament since 1979 , Nicole Fontaine is the best President we have ever had .
On no account is it for political reasons that I voted for you today , but because I hope that you will continue to represent all Members .
Applause
Madam President , the work of developing the Amsterdam Treaty for even greater union is commencing under the Finnish Presidency .
It will provide for more majority decisions whereby ministers and civil servants are able to tone down the democracy in our Member States .
We will have much more Brussels and less democracy .
The power which we as voters are losing is mainly being transferred to the Commission and the Council , although the Parliament is taking over the right of veto from the parliaments of the Member States .
The individual States may no longer prevent the adoption of a law or recommend that a law be amended .
A democratic era is being superseded by a bureaucratic era in which the voters are being driven into a siding .
Democracy , because power must lie with the publicly elected in our Member States and because the necessary common legislation must also be controlled democratically .
We no longer want centralism and unification , but decentralisation and freedom .
The EU must be a help and not a hindrance .
Madam President , it is an extremely difficult task to rebuild Kosovo without disempowering the population and undermining the self-supporting powers of that country .
This can only be achieved if legal proceedings are initiated against murderers , rapists and war criminals .
The most difficult of all will be to secure long-term peace .
We must learn to combine the military iron gloves of NATO with the economic velvet gloves of the EU and provide co-operation and aid for economic and democratic development .
We in the EU must establish an anteroom to those Balkan states which intend to develop along the lines of democracy and the market economy .
We must also provide humanitarian aid to Serbia , insofar as this can be achieved without supporting the Milosevic regime , and we must urge municipal leaders , private associations and others to work with the democratic forces in both Kosovo and Serbia .
I have seldom heard a Commissioner distance himself so clearly , and in such a well-reasoned manner , from a Council Resolution .
Now , the Headquarters will be in Thessaloniki , whilst those carrying out the work will be in Pristina .
