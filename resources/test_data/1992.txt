And we are going to talk about where there will be a new form of supervision different from the Lisbon Strategy .
It is also working closely with the Commission and Parliament .
I do not think that should be criticised , quite the contrary .
In other words , the possibility for at least one million European citizens , both men and women , from the various Member States , to be able to sign a legislative initiative .
We have to make up that lost time and essentially respond to citizens , for what they want is participation .
As soon as the Commission submits its draft regulation - we would like to thank the Commission , and I must say especially President Barroso and Vice-President Šefčovič , for the concern with which they have prioritised this issue in the Commission 's work schedule ; we are also grateful that it will take place imminently and very speedily , as Mr Šefčovič will be telling us shortly - we shall have a text that enables us , together with the Council and Parliament , to set in motion what European citizens are undoubtedly hoping for , before this six months are up .
I had the honour of taking it to the Presidium and we approved it .
In other words , do not let us make things complicated .
Mr President , Mr Šefčovič , I was very pleased to learn that the Commission plans to approve this draft regulation next week , on 31 March no less .
It is the opportunity for people to actually get close to Parliament and learn how it can be useful .
Mr President , I must express my deep satisfaction regarding the debate that has taken place .
I am sorry that he is not , I am sorry to give him bad news and discourage him , because this initiative will strengthen the European Union , not weaken it at all .
It is undoubtedly one way of strengthening this democracy , and also the citizenship or European demos referred to by Mr Casini , who is , moreover , Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , which will , for the most part , be dealing with this initiative .
In any event , the timeliness of this debate is very doubtful , because Parliament has stated its opinion on the issue of China on a number of occasions over the last few months and , above all , because China is a big international player whose relations with the European Union go well beyond the issue of Tibet .
We have equipped ourselves with a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who presides over the positions of ministers on matters of foreign policy and it is she who ought to debate these issues with Parliament .
I am delighted at what Mr Cioloş had to say .
This meeting we are having today owes much to the Chair of the Committee on Employment , Mrs Berès .
It is not enough to regulate financial products ; we must get to the very bottom of the wrongdoing .
These countries had already been suffering in the years prior to the crisis , however : firstly , the food crisis , which endangered the survival of hundreds of millions of people ; then , the energy crisis , which used up many of the resources of those that did not produce oil or gas ; finally , the climate crisis , the effects of which on harvests and infrastructure harm the poorest countries most of all .
As a result , hundreds of millions of people have been added to the list of the poorest and hundreds of thousands of children will die at an earlier age on continents such as Africa .
In the autumn of 2008 , my family and I were living in London for academic reasons and I was a direct witness of the pound sterling 's sudden drop of 30 % over the course of a few weeks .
The euro is a shining example of monetary union that is being studied and admired by the economic elites of China , India , Brazil and Russia .
Nevertheless , under no circumstances must its export strength be weakened .
' Considers it appropriate , therefore , to explore the grounds for an agreement with creditor countries to establish a temporary moratorium or debt cancellation for the poorest countries to enable them to implement countercyclical fiscal policies to mitigate the severe effects of the crisis ; proposes that efforts be made to facilitate arrangements for transparent debt arbitration ' .
The subject matter was not controversial and there were no amendments during the plenary session that could subvert the report 's basic content .
This is therefore a situation in which it is not easy to act from a European Union perspective .
Throughout the weekend , the Council , the Spanish Presidency , the Commission - most particularly Commissioner Kallas , whom I thank for his willingness and hard work throughout this period - and Eurocontrol have been working to prepare a much more precise , much more appropriate reaction to what was already becoming a more lasting crisis , which was beginning to have very serious effects on the whole of the European Union and beyond .
There is no room for compromise on this , as Commissioner Kallas said - he said so this weekend - and therefore , there is an area in which there is a ban , an agreement for an absolute ban on flights .
We will gain a much more precise idea of the real risk from all of the data that is going to be used by Eurocontrol , not only from London , but from the tests that are being carried out with
