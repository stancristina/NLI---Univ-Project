The Treaty of Lisbon , which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty , was rejected in the referendum in Ireland .
It is worth noting that in paragraph 4 of Mr Dehaene 's report it is stated ( quote ) : ' Welcomes the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that the European Council may by unanimity , and with the consent of the European Parliament , provided there is no opposition by a national parliament , extend qualified majority decision-making and the ordinary legislative procedure to areas in which they do not yet apply ' .
Notwithstanding the fact that voters in many Member States are clearly sceptical of an increasingly supranational Union , the federalist majority in the European Parliament indicates the possibility of making the Union even more supranational under the Treaty of Lisbon and shifting even more power to the EU without having to agree on a new treaty .
This report welcomes the new powers that will be given to the national parliaments by the Treaty of Lisbon .
We fully respect each Member State 's right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
This is an outrageous crime against democratic principles and an equally outrageous example of the arrogance of power that characterises cooperation in the EU.
I have voted against the report .
We have chosen to vote in favour of this report because the European Parliament needs to prepare itself to be able to implement the changes that will occur in connection with its work if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force .
Prior to that , the draft Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands .
It shows an exceptional arrogance towards democracy , and above all towards the Irish population , which is once again to be forced into a referendum because - in the view of the political establishment - they gave the 'wrong ' answer last time .
I have voted against the report .
The economic situation looked significantly more worrying six months ago , but it seems to have stabilised .
Many countries have a long way to go to balance their public finances .
The Council 's draft , which was adopted unanimously , deals with and contributes to meeting these challenges .
It is a disciplined budget and a sound one from the point of view of state finances .
The logic behind our draft general budget is quite simple .
Compared with the 2009 budget , our commitments have increased by 1.1 % and the payment appropriations by nearly 4 % .
There must be an emphasis on providing European added value .
The EU must have sufficient flexibility to cope with future needs and unforeseen events .
The degree of implementation and the absorption capacity have been key factors in our analysis .
If we adjust for the accounting effects of the economic recovery plan , the increase in this area amounts to around 8 % .
As regards payments , the Council believes that certain reductions can be made in relation to the preliminary draft budget , but I would like to stress that our draft nevertheless represents an increase in payment appropriations of 3.2 % compared to 2009 .
As regards heading 4 , it is extremely important to leave a substantial margin to the ceiling under this heading in order to be able to cope with unforeseen needs in the best possible way .
The common foreign and security policy is increasing in importance and the Council will therefore ensure that adequate funds are available for this .
At our conciliation meeting in July , it was highlighted once again how important it is for the recruitment associated with the enlargements of 2004 and 2007 to be carried out , and we agreed on a joint statement .
I believe that constructive cooperation is the only way to achieve a sound budget .
Mr President , we have heard from both the Commission and the European Parliament that we will have several difficult issues to deal with during the autumn .
At the same time , I am very hopeful that we will succeed .
Finally , I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for allowing me to speak here today .
The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union ( Frontex ) is responsible for coordinating and supporting Member States ' efforts to monitor and control the EU 's external borders .
The Agency is currently coordinating a number of joint operations and pilot projects at maritime , land and air borders with a view to combating illegal immigration , with a particular emphasis on certain high-risk areas such as the southern maritime borders of the EU , although the northern and eastern borders are also covered .
The Council also urged Frontex to foster cooperation with other border control authorities , including customs authorities , and with third countries with regard to border control .
The Council is looking forward to adopting a position on the Commission 's proposed amendments together with the European Parliament .
The need to tighten up border controls and the need for clear rules for joint patrols and the landing of those that are rescued , as well as the increased use of joint repatriation flights , were given particular emphasis .
Enhanced cooperation with the countries of origin and transit is fundamental and the dialogue with third countries should be intensified in areas such as legal immigration , migration and development , capacity building and the repatriation of people who have no need of protection .
I would like to mention Mr Busuttil 's views on greater cooperation with Libya .
The criminal networks that exploit people 's desperation must be tackled .
I would like
