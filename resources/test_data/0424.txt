the Guarantee Fund , unlike the Investment Bank loans .
The Guarantee Fund can also be used to guarantee the Euratom loans to support the development of core industries in non-member countries , although no transfers from the reserves to the Guarantee Fund have had to be organised for these sorts of loans in recent years .
In December 1999 the Council decided the maximum amount for guarantees for the Investment Bank for the period 2000-2007 , and produced a list of non-member countries that would be entitled to receive aid .
As Parliament has been heard , the matter is no longer being discussed in Parliament with regard to the terms and conditions of the guarantees .
So there are good grounds for the country joining the group of borrowers , just as there are to increase the ceiling of the EIB mandate .
Parliament is bound to have a lot of conditions it would like to impose on loans to Turkey , but at the time we will be making a decision in practice with regard to just one word .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by the Committee on Budgets under discussion , which recommends extending the Community guarantee given to the European Investment Bank to loans granted to Croatia , deals with two important matters .
The new government is committed to political and economic reform .
For years the country practised an economic policy based on plundering , which has left the new government to shoulder the burden of a depressed business sector and an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .
The country ' s inhabitants showed by voting that they demanded democratic change .
In foreign relations it gives priority to the integration of a Euro-Atlantic framework .
In its programme , the government is committed to such matters as a respect for human rights and the rights of minorities , the repatriation of refugees , improved relations with its neighbours , and considerable economic reform .
Developments in Croatia have swiftly led to closer relations between the EU and Croatia after a gap of several years .
The Council decided in August that the Tempus 3 programme , which relates to higher education , should extend to Croatia .
With that sum , it is proposed to finance basic infrastructure projects and environmental investment , the development of industry and SMEs , housing reconstruction , urban renewal and tourism .
The cure will be hard to endure , but , hopefully , the loans now being spoken about will help to soften the negative effects of economic reform on the lives of the people .
We also have to remember that Croatia has good industrial manufacturing plants , a qualified and trained workforce and excellent opportunities for the development of tourism , for example .
The events in the Balkans and the future of the region are burning issues .
The international community has already indicated it will support the Serbian nation and sanctions are being lifted .
We know that nationalism and poverty mean war .
Hopefully , the signs of hope in Croatia and now also in Yugoslavia will encourage us to find a solution to the problems of the budget and its financial perspectives .
Without a properly administered competition policy , neither the European Union ' s economy nor its external manifestation , in the form of the euro , will ever be able to achieve its full potential .
As Mrs Riis-Jørgensen quite rightly emphasises in her report and speech , there is a danger , particularly with regard to the small Member States , that too narrow a concept of the market is used to define a dominant market position , which makes it harder for companies in small Member States to become sufficiently large players in the area of global competition .
As Mrs Riis-Jørgensen states in point 15 of her report , we have to focus on the harm caused as a result of measures restricting competition , and not so much on what sort of economic players are involved .
For that reason it is good that this report of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s also emphasises the importance of this .
In his report , my colleague , Mr Evans , thanks you , Mr Monti , for having got to grips with the issue of State aid policy .
Although State aid may , on the surface , seem a good solution , when viewed in the longer term it very rarely produces lasting positive results .
In the long run , however , levels of State aid will have to fall .
Then it is the private consumer and the taxpayer who foot the bill .
However , we have to express our concern that there were cries of defiance in certain matters .
The impression that spread to the citizens of Europe via the media was that there was conflict between the small and large countries .
Already there are numerous examples of how just one country can obstruct matters which almost all countries consider to be important .
A cautionary example of inappropriate behaviour is offered surprisingly by Austria , which has just experienced unjust treatment itself , as that country is warning its neighbour , the Czech Republic , against using its nuclear power plant at Temelin .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights proudly conveys what European values are , but it is fruitless to create an artificial controversy with regard to its rapid and binding constitutionality .
Mr President , I also wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Haug , for her excellent work in preparing the draft budget .
She sat in on our committee and , to her credit , took our committee ' s proposals into consideration .
The committee stresses the importance of good and disciplined financial management , the simplification of administrative procedures , and the successful outcome of projects
