are flooding the European market , competing unfairly with our products and causing damage to our businesses and our work .
Of course , it is not yet perfect and much more could be done , but it is moving in the right direction : it is a step forwards on the road to convergence , if not to genuine harmonisation of legislation within the confines of Europe , transcending national borders .
That alone would be enough to justify the tenacity with which my political group has been proposing for years to this House and the Commission that a European civil protection agency should be set up .
It is quite clear that the slogan ‘ Free trade = poverty reduction ’ was just bait to persuade the southern , poorest countries of the world to endorse the expectations of the industrialised countries .
In addition , the programme has been guaranteed an budget line that is rightly separate , as the rapporteur also said , from the drugs prevention programme .
The time has come to harmonise legislation on this subject and , until that happens , the Commission should use the tools that they say they are preparing and straight away set out a very clear-cut , rigorous position on the policies that the Union and its Member States should apply , so that we can take a clear stand on these issues .
You will all remember , I am sure , the so-called ‘jeans ’ ruling ; well , among the comments I shall quote the one made by the Prefect of Rome , who stated that the latest episode , when two French girls were raped after accepting a lift from two strangers , was due to imprudence more than anything else .
I am very pleased that there is general agreement today in that respect and that it will be possible to focus more seriously and more emphatically , with about twice as much funding as was provided in the past , on the issue of preventing and reacting to all kinds of violence that affect children and women .
Anyone who still has any doubts needs to be assured that the value added by European action in this area is quite obvious .
Two final remarks : the first is that much has been said about a European telephone helpline to help children in difficulties .
This is the beginning of a thought process that we can take up again later .
In this context , I have tabled a written statement ( 39/2006 ) to illustrate a new system , based on a differentiated Childkey SIM card , designed to protect children who use the Internet and mobile telephones , because it allows providers to determine whether the user is a minor or an adult and to filter calls , blocking any that are anonymous or undesirable .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the debate in recent months on the growing political integration of Europe , with its ups and downs , we have often said that Europe needs to give people a better idea of its project , its purpose and , I would say , its indispensability : the Europe of results , conceived by us specifically to give people a real key to understanding its .
That is why I think today’s debate is important ; that is why I think it should be part of the European agenda , even though some may perhaps question it because it is just an own-initiative report on this subject .
This can be entrusted neither to an exclusive role for public institutions nor to self-regulating market forces , but to solidarity of three kinds : individual solidarity , spreading positive values among people ; the solidarity of social groups that organise themselves into social networks ; and institutional solidarity , with few essential and universally accepted rules , for a State that can make the most of all its society’s energy .
European businesses also form part of this design , because full employment is a cornerstone of the social model ; small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important as the backbone of a system combining economic entrepreneurship with the solidity of the social fabric , working towards a new European social model that , through a diversity of forms and of organisational systems , promotes the well-being of everyone .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this debate on emissions trading plays an important yet dangerous part in the issue of the Kyoto agreement .
May I just say to the honourable Member that I met the Bulgarian minister for internal affairs again just yesterday and once again I told him that Bulgaria and Romania must prepare appropriately for a strong European contribution in controlling an extremely sensitive border .     Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is certainly a highly sensitive subject , and I can confirm that I have personally raised the issue in my talks – including recent ones – with the government authorities of both Bulgaria and Romania .
That will be understandable , considering that they will be new Member States within a second phase of enlargement .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has held a passionate debate on the mental health strategy .
A year ago , a group of people who are commonly termed ‘mad ’ came here to Strasbourg from Rome in a coach , together with mental health workers and family members .
The main benefits of the agreement are the creation of a free trade zone , a serious commitment to cooperation in areas of mutual interest and , above all , the promotion of a more stable legal environment that will reassure foreign investors .
Today I can say that Albania is changing .
