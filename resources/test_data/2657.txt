that their counterparts in the USA do .
But it goes into every aspect of the problem : whether genetic material is capable of being patented in general , relations between the pharmaceutical industry and the developing countries , and the basic issue itself : can you rob naturally produced material of its secret by patenting it for exclusive use ?
It is essential that Parliament reviews the amendments .
Four fifths of the world 's genetic polymorphism happens in the developing countries .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Pirker for the splendid work he has done in preparing this very important report .
The protective barriers that prevent a normal young person from becoming a user of synthetic drugs will weaken if drugs are easily and cheaply available and if they are perceived as being a part of modern youth culture , as they are in many countries today .
One particular problem is the control of the trafficking of synthetic drugs in its early stages , as such drugs can be manufactured quickly and close to their markets .
Surveillance operations must be quick to react in the same way all over Europe .
It will be important to undertake a survey on what kind of technical solutions and systems already in place could assist in the creation of such an operation .
Mr President , first I would like to congratulate Mr Cabrol on his guidelines for bringing into effect a ban on the advertising of tobacco .
It is often claimed that there is no researched evidence as to how the anti-smoking lobby and a tobacco advertising ban leads to a reduction in smoking .
It has also been noticed that , in a general sense , educational programmes that started in the 1950s show up clearly in statistics : figures for lung cancer in men have fallen dramatically .This is without doubt an indication that an advertising ban is necessary and that it will have far-reaching significance for the issue of public health .
Has advertising any importance , then ?
Can advertising be targeted at just one group ?
Advertising that stirs the imagination is what young people are especially exposed to , and the tobacco industry purposely uses this sort of advertising especially in the sponsorship of events , where the aim is to achieve an image of a jet-set lifestyle .
The ban has been significant , especially for the young : before the ban 35 % of 15 to 24 year olds smoked , a figure that fell to 23 % after the ban .
I do hope that Parliament will show a sense of responsibility and approve Mr Cabrol 's report without amendments .
The proposal addresses the current insistence on human health , although , as has been said , things have gone too slowly .
The present proposal also addresses environmental challenges more closely .
In such a vital and influential matter as health and health care , we cannot afford to allow a policy to exist that would end up in the quality of drinking water being bargained over , due to limitations in standards of quality .
Finally , I would like to say , regarding the matter of copper , that it must be regarded as a health issue , and addressed as such .
Mr President , annexed to the directive on drinking water is a classification of substances that can have an effect on the quality of drinking water according to their degree of danger .
If the Council 's proposal goes through and copper becomes classified as a poison , a very misleading message will be going out to the consumer .
In a study undertaken by the World Health Organization in 1997 it was stated that there was no scientific evidence that the use of copper as a material for manufacturing pipes for drinking water would lead to health-related problems caused by drinking water .
In this world of all sorts of additives , colouring agents and preservatives , it is right that the quality of our drinking water is controlled , and this report is on the right track in this respect , but there should be moderation in everything .
In the Auto Oil programme we had to reduce sulphur content to values in millionths .
This is technically quite possible , and the costs are not unreasonable .
The facades of many fine buildings are now peeling away because sulphurous emissions are damaging them .
We should , however , stress that this measure is also important for local air quality .
Sulphur emissions from liquid fuels could react with particulate matter and cause harm to people 's health .
The Commission originally outlined something of the kind , but there is nothing on the subject in this proposal for a directive .
In fact , I have the impression that the Commission 's own calculations suggest that the costs of the whole acid rain operation could be reduced by 15 % if maritime fuels were to be included in this directive .
They should be included ; there is no doubt about it .
I now wish to turn to the matter of diesel , or light fuel .
The committee now supports the position that the threshold currently in force in Austria , which is 0.1 % , is the right one , although it is less than the Commission proposes .
This might well help Austria to insist on its more stringent limit if the Commission does not bring the Austrian sulphur content figure into the picture .
We have to acknowledge this , even though the people who vote for us may be car owners .
They must be made more stringent for solid fuels also , especially coal .
In accordance with the EU energy strategy , the exploitation of natural gas and renewable energy sources is to grow
