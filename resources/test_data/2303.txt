policy , and as a guiding principle of European social and economic policies .
If , like you , visitors come here , it is because they have chosen to come .
Whether or not it will be ratified remains open to question .
I shall only discuss two aspects , namely the monitoring of subsidiarity and comitology .
Paragraph 13 of Article 6( a ) of the Duff report , however , confuses the problem and manages to complicate further this otherwise simple rule .
My second and final comment concerns the case of Mr Dell 'Utri and I echo the calls that have been made to differentiate this case from others for the reasons that have , quite rightly , been outlined .
To the best of my knowledge , there has , so far , been no genuine dialogue , no genuine assessment of the progress made in developing freedoms in the region , nor any debate in Parliament .
The Algeria of today is defined by the citizens ' movement in Kabylia , formed in spring 2001 to condemn the repression and killing of 115 young people , is still active in Algeria .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am one of the Members whom Mr Cohn-Bendit referred to , who does not share the approach taken , although I do congratulate Mr Cohn-Bendit and General Morillon , who is unfortunately not here with us this morning , for the efforts that they have made to try to develop , using this strategic concept of ' Maghreb integration' , a possible key to relations between the European Union and Maghreb.
This situation arises from the distribution of power in Europe : this European Union , which is dominated by the northern countries - and , what is more , the list of speakers this morning shows this very clearly - is somewhat indifferent towards the Mediterranean .
The most important thing , and we would stress this , is to promote the highest possible quality and safety standards for donations of blood and blood components , and it is not by extolling the virtues of obligatorily entirely unpaid donations , I repeat , or by proposing assimilation - thus far scientifically unfounded on grounds of both ethics and quality , as stated by Amendments Nos 7 and 10 adopted in committee and Amendment No 26 - that we will be laying down proper foundations for the future of the blood sector in Europe and providing a practical , sustainable solution to the question of self-sufficiency .
We cannot accept any challenges to this principle , and we believe it should be extended to the whole of the European Union .
- ( FR ) Today we have voted on a important issue .
We consider the implementation of the directive to be important .
In this respect , it outlines ideas worthy of study .
I would like to draw the attention of the Council to one point : territorial division .
Having said that , I would more specifically like to highlight two aspects that I consider unacceptable .
Lastly , I would like us to agree on the designation .
I am thinking in particular of aid for agricultural exports .
If you put as much effort into helping countries that need help to develop enough to support their population as you are into building a wall around Europe , if you channelled this energy into becoming involved once again in the Johannesburg process , then I think your Presidency would be seen in a better light .
Local communities should be given the right and the wherewithal to exercise power at their own level , and it would also be beneficial to encourage private initiatives and place more trust in civil society .
Mr President , more than a year has passed since we gave this proposal to amend the 1976 directive its first reading , a proposal which was referred to the European Parliament in July 2000 ; this means that it has taken us practically two years to reach an agreement with the Council and the Commission on amending a directive that Parliament has been discussing since as early as 1996 , when we received the first proposal to amend the directive .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank Heidi Hautala for the time that she has devoted to this directive and for her work , which shows that she has been equal to this task and has merited the trust placed in her by the members of her committee .
In addition , there is also the whole dimension of obligation .
All of the parties have been informed that proceedings have been closed and the complaint has been withdrawn .
Mr President , I am going to be presenting the non-nuclear section of the report on the Joint Research Centre ( JRC ) , which represents two thirds of its budget .
This also applies to food safety , where the JRC will help to establish a reference and standardisation system , and to the protection of individual privacy in information and communication technologies .
In conclusion , the Joint Research Centre 's main objectives will therefore be to remain close to its users - the European Parliament and the Commission - to develop its role as a recognised centre of excellence on issues of safety , health and the environment , and to develop its activities as a promoter of research networks .
This is a field in which Europe is recognised as having genuine expertise - it is a world leader - and our objective has to be to maintain our technological advantage .
Parliament very much welcomes the increase in certain budget lines and the inclusion of footnotes giving guidance on allocation within some budget lines , as we requested
