look forward to hearing the Commission ' s response to my proposals .
We might have wished for more extensive and more timely information , but many of the delays can be attributed to the framework agreement .
It is used to withhold documents and to keep documents confidential for , in the end , it is the Commission which decides whether a document should be deemed confidential .
However , I think it should be revised .
One of the greatest dangers of this agreement is that ordinary committee members are reduced to second-rate members .
It will never be discovered .
However , Parliament should certainly also 'look nearer home ' .
Why have we not yet arranged for a secure archive to be set up to which Members may come to read confidential documents under proper conditions ?
I am delighted that the Commission has put its trust in me as rapporteur .
We could sense quite clearly that the Commission wanted a timely discharge .
All in all , the Commission has taken the discharge very seriously this year .
The Committee saw all 12 Commissioners .
However , I do not fully agree with the Commission ' s view of what Parliament ' s discharge should be based on .
That is something I do not agree with .
Parliament should not be a detective agency .
We should concentrate on structural problems .
It is the Commission to which Parliament must grant discharge , and that is why we must hold the Commission primarily responsible .
I therefore made a great effort to incorporate all the institutions in my report .
Agricultural policy is a good example .
Time and again , it has tabled proposals for countering malpractice , fraud and over- charging and , time and again , Parliament and the Council have voted against these .
Every year , the Council has given the Commission the green light in its discharge , so I became curious .
I sent a letter to the Swedish presidency requesting permission to attend the Ecofin meeting where the discharge is adopted .
I was very disappointed in the Swedes , who normally boast about their openness .
They rejected my request .
I have other things to say , but I shall return to these at the end of the debate .
The June movement will not vote for rules which enable officials to legislate instead of elected representatives in open assemblies whose work can be monitored .
This is a year when the present Commission was only able to influence the final quarter of the year and so cannot be held responsible for a very great deal .
I do not have enough speaking time to mention all the scandals but would refer to my good colleague , Mr Heaton-Harris , and my other capable colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control who mentioned a number of the problems with which we have been confronted .
Mr Blak has made a great effort to find answers to quite a few questions .
The more harmless questions have been answered , but the evasive or inadequate answers to other questions are unacceptable .
We are still waiting for a clear indication of responsibility and for those responsible for the mistakes to suffer the consequences .
Commissioner Schreyer stated that a black list of fraudulent businesses had been drawn up .
In the discharge , Denmark was subject to a critical comment which is a scathing criticism of the way in which the Danish Ministry of Food , Agriculture and Fisheries handles export aid payments .
This means that Danish export businesses are severely hampered in their operations at the moment and that there is a considerable distortion of competition vis-à-vis other EU countries .
I must therefore urge the Commission to ensure that the Danish rules on export aid are normalised as soon as possible .
Mr President , I would like to spend my last three minutes talking about this year ' s major issues .
I will start off with the Scandinavian countries .
The administration of the Stockholm office has proved to be scandalous .
However , I would like to ask the Commission when this will be concluded , and I should also like to know whether the Commission has taken measures to suspend staff after reading the OLAF report ?
The problem with the guarantee payments in Denmark , which has not yet been settled , is an absolute disgrace .
With regard to the flax issue in Spain , I am very delighted that a compromise was successfully reached .
I examined whether the Commission had failed to fulfil its monitoring role , and I do not think this is the case here .
I should like to mention the 'Fléchard case ' which has been at the centre of discussion this year .
We have set up a special committee , we have sent out additional questionnaires to the Commission and we have invited five new and former Commissioners to a consultation in the committee .
OLAF , the expert committee and the Court of Auditors have looked at the case .
And what did we learn ?
Under no circumstances was there a legal basis for reducing the penalty from six to three million .
The Commission reacted , perhaps under pressure from the French government , and turned somersaults to save a company which had most likely even been involved in the fraudulent activities from the beginning .
The conclusions of the meeting at which the decisions were made were never put down in writing and cannot now be reconstructed .
If OLAF cannot find them , then how should MEPs be able to ?
For the first time , the new Commission has admitted that the decision to reduce the penalty was perfectly open to criticism and that a more thorough investigation should have been carried out
