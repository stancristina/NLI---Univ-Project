Although the report contains a number of good ideas , it also contains proposals which are particularly worrying , such as : increasing the powers of the President , who will be allowed to give the floor to those who catch his eye , without abiding by any rules , or decide on the admissibility of questions or amendments , which could well lead to high-handedness ; the need for groups to represent one-fifth of the Member States , thereby discouraging convergence in the European parliamentary area ; restricting the use of all languages in all the work of the European Parliament , irrespective , including representations and so on .
This is being jeopardised , especially within the context of the information industry , which alienates Members of Parliament from what they are voting on , often without their knowledge .
We have seen a great number of protagonists along the way .
Cyprus tops the league of candidate countries .
It has an exemplary economy , an exemplary democracy and its institutions operate in an exemplary fashion .
Lithuania , for which I have acted as rapporteur .
There are two problems : first the usual problem in these countries , that is , agriculture .
They must listen to the needs of the future .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office , honourable Members , on 18 April 2002 the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities adopted an opinion drafted by Mrs Dybkj√¶r on the basis of the Commission reports submitted in November 2001 .
Institution building and strengthening institutional and administrative capacities in this area are basic prerequisites to full application of the European acquis .
We also feel it is very important for the candidate countries to develop or reform their judicial and administrative structures , in order to create the right conditions for applying the acquis communautaire efficiently .
The Commission is called on to step up its efforts to wipe out all forms of violence against women as part of the accession strategy , in order to ensure that women 's personal rights and dignity are safeguarded and , of course , to act as an incentive for improving children 's rights and child protection .
The Commission needs to promote suitable public and private investment in social sectors in the candidate countries , in order to make it easier for more women to enter representative institutions and the centres of power .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Similarly , no call is being made on the present Member States to increase their contributions .
Secondly , it is estimated that the take-up capacity of the new Member States will be such in 2004 that we shall be able to give them far more resources than those for which provision was made in Berlin for 2002 .
First , enlargement is in fact an historical venture , but for a new Europe , not so that certain factions can rewrite post-war history .
Does that mean Bulgaria and Romania have no further prospects of accession ?
Will their accession depend at some point on the veto of one of the present candidates ?
My final point concerns Cyprus .
He might have been able to tell us more .
Ladies and gentlemen , the announcements and positions we have heard reflect the commitment of all of us to the historic venture which the enlargement of the European Union represents .
Similarly , we need to promise to assist with the policies and funds needed to encourage and facilitate reform in the candidate countries in this sector .
This new European world which is being born also belongs to women and we must give them every opportunity to make a contribution to it and enjoy their fair share of the benefits of this joint endeavour .
The universe is not conspiring against it ; on the contrary , sometimes Turkey itself undermines its own European prospects .
However , what we must bear in mind is that the ISPA is not just a funding instrument , it is a way of familiarising these countries with the European Union 's way of thinking .
By way of illustration , according to the statistics , there were 23 000 road traffic accidents in Greece alone in 2000 , 3 900 of which involved pedestrians .
The important thing is that , first , the industry itself is anxious to make a voluntary commitment , meaning that no direct legislative intervention is required in the first stage and , secondly , this commitment covers all the important manufacturers , European , Japanese and Korean alike .
First , we consider that the voluntary commitment being negotiated with the automobile industry represents a first step towards improving road safety and , secondly , we are asking the Commission to come forward with a framework directive in which a clear , realistic time schedule is established for the intermediate and final goals to be reached , as well as methods for monitoring assessment .
It is a classic example of imperialist expansionism which has found fertile ground following the collapse of the Socialist system in Europe and the break up of the USSR.
Its sole purpose to is hand the national wealth of these countries over to western European capital and bring them into line with capitalist restructuring ( the famous "acquis communautaire " ) , grab their public property and wipe out everything Socialism achieved , in collusion with the local Mafia .
Candidate status had a coercive effect on Cyprus and encouraged Turkish intransigence , with the complicity of the ?U.
And the welcome reference in the report to a single sovereign Cypriot state does nothing to change this .
The proposals to integrate the new Member States are illustrative of colonial-type efforts to annex the CEECs .
The aim is to secure markets for big business and develop
