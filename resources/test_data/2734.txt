On flexibility , which has been mentioned several times here today : yes , we will need flexibility if we are planning so many years ahead .

Mr Posselt , the regular assessment report on the progress made by Romania , which was published in late 2003 , contains a thorough assessment of Romania’s progress in the restitution of assets .
In essence , that justice and administration in the candidate countries really do work within a reasonable time .
If a political party in Malta disputes a citizen’s right to vote , the relevant Maltese court has to consider the case and the ruling of the Maltese Constitutional Court has to be taken into account .

Instead of taking countermeasures here , however , we are now to spend millions of euros on pilot projects on deportation in Europe .
Not only have we made demands on you as a Commissioner , you have also made demands of us as a Parliament at times .
Let us look at the United Nations General Assembly resolution for which the legal basis was the ' Uniting for Peace ' formula .
It is for us to create the international law that we all desire .
The issue of the PLO Charter is a complicated one .
I think it is shameful .
Does the European Union have anything to say about this plan , and does it also include concrete measures to tackle the heart of the problem – Israel and Palestine ?
I stand by the principle that if you audit you cannot advise , and if you advise you cannot audit .
