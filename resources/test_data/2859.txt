the Berlin agreements are a step backwards in terms of limiting aid to large farms and increasing support to small and medium-sized farms .
Yet tonight we have to decide on both aspects at once .
We want social policies , policies on employment , on rural development and on trans-European networks .
The outcome in terms of the rules for assistance in the fisheries sector can be considered satisfactory thanks to the attitude of the Committee on Fisheries which opposed the Commission 's original plan from the start .
Today we are listening to proposals to make us condemn the interinstitutional agreement , thus leaving us without a financial perspective .
Parliament 's demands have been adequately reflected in the articles .
It should take careful note that the Committee on External Economic Relations categorically rejects the tariff increase announced by Mexico on 1 January this year .
We need to talk about those issues .
The adoption of this recommendation will send a good signal to the Americas at a time when doubts are growing about our will to increase European efforts in the region .
Finally , in view of the late hour , I would also like to thank the interpreters for their patience .
And lastly , there is no mechanism for monitoring the environmental and social clauses or the democracy clause .
I also want to express our satisfaction because , in my opinion , as draftsman , the explanations and clarifications Mr Marín has given tonight entirely meet the Committee on Foreign Affairs ' demand that Parliament should be informed of the development of the negotiations before their conclusion .
Finally , Mr Elles is well aware that the Committee on Budgets , a well respected and very competent committee , is in no way an internal body with the powers to dictate which majority should be used to take decisions in this House .
As a result , we must acknowledge what the Council has done and particularly the German Presidency .
I naturally appreciate the work involved in drawing up a list of the Schengen acquis , as we all know that the Schengen acquis was a web of rules and a web of international public law , which complicated matters even further .
When the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the Treaty on European Union , we must clearly give our opinion .
We also hope that the initiatives being taken , particularly by the Commission , will outline some clear future guidelines that will allow us to make progress at the next summit in Tampere .
In short , it seeks a balance between interests competing in the market , and all these interested parties deserve protection .
We will vote against them as we feel they upset this balance .
Mr President , it is fortunate that we have you as President of the sitting in this House at the moment because this is one of the last reports , if not the very last , by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights and you were a very efficient member of that committee for many years .
This area covers the whole electronic commerce sector , the electronic activities sector covering everything from intellectual property to digital signatures and everything related to information services in general , including intellectual property issues .
In the European Union today , for better or for worse and despite national cultural traditions , the basic principles , the principles of law and order and the principles of the protection of morals , rights and minors still apply .
Mr Cassidy , I believe in freedom for men and women .
This is a simple question of the order of voting as this is the general report and the other four reports are the implementing reports .
I would like to remind Mr Samland , who used a political rather than a legal argument , that this House has often called on the Council to do away with unanimous and qualified majority voting and to adopt agreements by a majority .
According to the opinion you have expressed , this act would be null and void and would be at odds with the 1988 decision you mentioned .
The European Union itself was present at the 1996 elections and soon a period of four years will have elapsed since then .
These objectives of the Union are at least as important as our commercial objectives .
Mr Malangré 's proposal is based on Article 65 of the EC Treaty , as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty , and I support it .
This is seriously jeopardising a number of jobs .
In this way , we could guarantee full compliance with the commitments made by all the parties in the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
I hope that the Commission will bear this in mind and will address this problem which affects so many jobs .
It must be restructured so that our products and services are sufficiently accepted in a global economy to enable them participate fully in the international markets .
I must stress that this industry has made considerable efforts to adapt .
The fact that the European institutions include a Parliament , with all its defects and all its problems , is something that the people of Europe should begin to value .
I hope , however , that he will not use these great complimentary speeches by the whole House to his benefit in the election campaign , as we are in different camps .
I should like to thank you personally and on behalf of the group I represent .
Yesterday , the Conference of Presidents and the political groups jointly registered an objection to the establishment of the so-called ' Technical Group of Independent Members ' and I believe that the said objection should be explicitly recorded in the Minutes
