preventing counterfeiting and fraud , food and environmental safety , the development of craft products and the establishment of programmes to fight desertification and facilitate the conversion of non-drinking water into drinking water and the development of tourism are some of the many points which we have discussed .
It is one of the duties of Europe , which has the task of being the driving force of a balanced system of trade , the market , development , growth and economic prosperity .
We must prove wrong the theory that enlargement means a decline in interest in the Mediterranean .
We must therefore always bear in mind that the agreement must be based , first and foremost , on understanding and dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis .
On the other hand , we cannot lose sight of other areas of conflict such as the Western Sahara .
With regard to agriculture , I would point out to the Swedish Presidency that it is very easy to say that we are going to open up agriculture to free trade as well .
Thanks also to the new production boost in Asia , Europe now trades more with Asia than with America .
However , we cannot ignore the fact that , thus far , our joint action in this major geographical area has not been effective and has certainly not been exhaustive .
I hope that the same will become true of Mediterranean policy as of today , not only because the Middle East is one of the most insecure areas on our borders or because the southern side of the Mediterranean is the greatest source of migration towards Europe , but also , I am glad to say , because , as President Prodi recently stated , having already discovered America we have now discovered Asia , and the Mediterranean has resumed its key position in world trade and exchange which must be exploited on both northern and southern sides .
Economic and social progress must also lead to the consolidation of the areas of democracy , but , as has already been stressed , we must not lose sight of the fact that full respect for human rights is essential if the partnership is genuinely to succeed .
At the next check point her umbilical cord was cut .
Only in that they could have served as cover for any Palestinian attacks against the settlers who are overrunning the country and treating it as theirs , destroying Palestinian houses and crops .
All this is well-known , and none of us , particularly those in responsible political positions , can say that they were unaware of the facts .
Mr Solana is right : Europe is now playing a larger role but it must do much more .
There is no strategy , no awareness of the institutional objectives of our Union in our approach today , at least in terms of the abstract goals set forth in the human rights charters and in the charters of the rights of European citizens and others .
This is the problem : when there are 100 , 150 kilometres of territory to cross , one more kilometre conceded might , in effect , represent one more trench to fight from in a war sparked off by an unfair peace agreement .
Nowhere in our hearts and culture does the nineteenth century right to the national state exist today : civil , political and human rights with regard to any state , central or centralised authority do exist , and you are unaware of all this !
Peace is a dangerous word if the European Union is required to use it but is not able to follow it up with action .
We must uphold rules and principles , especially if the Bush government is going to prove incapable of guaranteeing the affirmation of these rules and principles or unwilling to do so .
Mr President , the European Union is finally realising that there are serious social problems underlying the tragic situation in Columbia , specifically the need for the fair redistribution of wealth and land between the few who have everything and the many who have nothing .
Clinton and Pastrana 's 'Plan Columbia ' , which reinforces military structures for combating drug trafficking , has the effect of preserving this social imbalance , just as the paramilitaries , loyal allies of the Pastrana army and drug traffickers , preserve it .
Mr President , as many Members have said , speaking on 'Plan Columbia ' , this United States military plan , the European Union must intervene autonomously and independently , pursuing a non-military strategy , promoting and safeguarding respect for human rights , humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms and , most importantly , doing something to improve the standard of living of the local communities .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Wieland , this resolution of mine may not be as sexy as it could be , for justice is usually naked , or at least , attempts are made to strip it of its effectiveness .
Of course , certain positive elements have also been noted , such as a computer system from the Netherlands known as KRIS , which has been used as a model .
For example , Luxembourg once refused to comply with the requests made by the judicial authority of another country because the act was not a crime under Luxemburgish law .
In short , it is a proposal supporting the European Judicial Network and what is known as 'good practice ' .
What has come to the fore in recent months is a by now familiar subject , namely the monitoring by Member States of the application of Community measures .
Of course , it is clear that , even today , we do not have the incineration capacity , and so it is stored .
