This would take full account of the result of the negotiations reached so far .
Firstly , I should like to thank Mr Fassa for his excellent report ; next I would like to emphasize the importance of this instrument to a North/South cooperation policy ; and , finally , I would like to say that many of the suggestions put forward will certainly be included in the communication which the Commission intends to present in a few months ' time .
The total weight and quality of the percentage represented by textiles and clothing therefore varies throughout the EU , according to quotas and Member States , and even more if we take sectoral peculiarities into account .
Thus , without prejudice to the importance of upstream and downstream activities , it seems to me essential that we should define the limits of the spinning , weaving and garment-making 'production chain ' .
The same applies to Amendments Nos 25 and 30 .
Against the backdrop of a global 'production chain ' approach , greater importance is attached to labour-intensive activities , rejecting the inevitability of contracting-out or globalization , which will be all the more relevant inasmuch as the sector represents over 2 million jobs , has lost 600 000 jobs in recent years and , unless something is done about it , we can predict that hundreds of thousand more will be lost .
Whereas Parliament had been excluded from the process until the Commission 's document came before it , from then on it has wanted to play a full part .
In Portugal , for example , the sector is responsible for over 30 % of industrial production .
Mr President , my colleague Sérgio Ribeiro 's report , on which I congratulate him , makes a significant contribution to the much-needed promotion of the textile and clothing sector , reinforcing Commissioner Bangemann 's welcome initiative .
It is therefore important that those values are happily married to our economic activities .
It would be incomprehensible if the politicians were to fail to honour that commitment .
Thus it is no surprise that the report gives priority and particular emphasis to policy measures .
The pressure of competition from third countries that make extensive use of direct and indirect subsidies , together with the Outward Processing Arrangements ( OPA ) which has stimulated the displacement of labour-intensive activities to the CEECs and the MEDA countries , with highly damaging effects on the textile industry in southern Europe , means we must adopt a real 'plan of action for increasing competitiveness in the European textile and clothing industry ' .
We must mobilize the Structural Funds , particularly the Social Fund and the ERDF and the SME , ADAPT and EMPLOI initiatives , to ensure that European textiles continue to play an irreplaceable economic and social role on the European scene .
I myself am entirely in favour of that principle .
And , therefore , I myself would give the principle of subsidiarity free rein in that area - a principle which is also recognized and applauded in the report .
I am thinking for example of the question of what role Parliaments should play vis-a-vis public opinion .
The aspect I wish to dwell on , however , is the question of transnational lists .
It also has another serious disadvantage , from my point of view .
Those are the principles I support , and I think they should be taken into consideration in this document .
The emphasis given by the rapporteur to the principle of proportionality therefore deserves our acceptance .
This , in particular , would drive a wedge between Members and electors , when our agenda should primarily be to find ways of dealing with the real alienation of the one from the other that we are seeing today .
I voted against the proposal for a European electoral constituency for transnational lists , because that extraordinary idea is not intended to correct deviations from the proportionality rule and ensure that minorities are represented , nor is it even really necessary to ensure transnational participation in European elections .
It involves selecting major pro-European political figures as candidates for the European Parliament , with real input and influence in the political systems from which they come .
Although we acknowledge their merits , it has yet to be proved that they will have the intended effect of making it possible to replace labour taxes - even if they are effective from the environmental point of view , they will not produce much in the way of revenue - or that they will not have the effect of penalizing investment , particularly in a competitive world with open borders .
Mr President , these reports by the European Monetary Institute and Mr Fourçans point in the same direction : they are to be identified with those who proclaim the obsessive principle of price stability , and aim for a uniform fiscal and budgetary policy and a centralized economic policy .
And we want to say so .
There is no doubt , for example , that the rule that 50 % of the Cohesion Fund must be applied to the environment has contributed very positively to improving the quality of life in the Cohesion states , but it has also increased the amount of environmental investment in the Cohesion states , making the link between the role of the environment and job creation more obvious .
The shortage of food and , especially , the lack of medical assistance are becoming acute .
In this respect , too , the European Union can and must play an important role .
In the third place , I would like to emphasize that it is vital to find a peaceful solution to the conflict by political means that respect the fundamental rights
