The Council had refused to give documentation to the complainant , Mr Tony Bunyan , on the grounds that the documents were ephemeral or only reflected the thinking of individuals .
This means that the arrangement we adopted previously will operate still better and that the public will more easily be able to follow the decision-making process .
Paragraph 5( 2 ) proposed that the ratification procedure for a future constitution should be designed in such a way that a 'small minority ' of Member States should not be able to oppose ratification .
The Convention 's democratic representativeness in such a case cannot be seen to be greater than that of the governments .
The report makes it clear that the EU can only act in areas delegated by the Member States .
The requirement of unanimity in the case of treaty changes must be maintained .
The Moderates are opposed to proposals that may lead to the EU 's being funded by EU taxes .
The reason , of course , is that all the parties , no doubt partly because they all know how important it is for us to be able to demonstrate agreement prior to enlargement , have contributed to a businesslike and constructive process .
Last but not least , I wish to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets , the committee 's splendid secretariat and , especially , its splendid chairman , Mr Wynn , who has supported the work throughout .
When this process began just over a year ago , one of my objectives was to develop Parliament 's own procedures , and I think we have made some progress .
We have developed the new budgetary debate in September , something which it will certainly be possible to develop further next year .
That is an entirely unreasonable model .
I am a keen adherent of budget ceilings , but that model is far too rigid .
We have an emergency reserve of which we make ever more extensive use .
There is no sound long-term budgetary methodology .
If the pace of implementation continues to be slow , there will be a risk in future years of a situation arising in which regions that have received promises of aid and candidate countries that have been given generous promises of pre-accession aid will , quite justifiably , protest when the promises are not fulfilled .
By means of the developed frontloading model , we have been able to supply the Commission with those resources it needs , for example for the 500 new jobs required for enlargement .
A range of different bodies receiving aid from the EU are now investing those resources in integrating the new countries .
Allow me also to mention the EU 's efforts in the fight against poverty and disease in the developing countries .
That has been done only on condition that we and the Council promise to supply the extra resources that may be required for these purposes next year .
We have also got the Council to promise to try to produce a corresponding sum from the European Development Fund .
We have , finally , a joint promise in any case to contribute those resources that are required if the EU is to be able to retain its place in the management of the fund .
Ladies and gentlemen , this budget will not be an historic one because of any dramatic conflicts or major new revolutionary budget initiatives .
I am , above all , very pleased that we have , with such broad political agreement , in actual fact come up with those solutions required in order to prepare for enlargement .
I also wish to extend a big thank you to both the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation , with special thanks also going to the Danish Presidency for having actively helped the EU 's two budgetary authorities jointly to arrive at the framework for category 5 at a conciliation on 19 July of this year , something I believe to have been very important .
Within this budget , we have also managed to implement those priorities we set as early as when the guidelines were drawn up at the beginning of the year .
The necessary decisions will have been taken and implemented by then .
The second priority was to implement necessary reforms .
Parliament 's legislative function must also be strengthened .
It is a question of coping both with the preparations prior to enlargement and with the commitment to the necessary reforms and of doing these things within the stated budgetary framework .
Allow me to point out that I am conscious of the fact that the Council wishes to see a still greater margin .
It has been important to implement all this in a way that means that the preparations for enlargement can be made in all the institutions .
Further decisions along these lines will be necessary during the forthcoming budget year .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your answer .
At what point does the Commissioner consider that a company may be in an especially dominant position ?
Madam President , Mrs Ries has done an excellent job of reporting on the negotiations at conciliation and on the problems that have arisen in connection with these .
A longer wait will involve further risks to public health .
It can also be converted into brominated dioxins .
I therefore believe that Mrs Ries will understand why my group will abstain from voting in the final vote .
The average European produces approximately 14 kg of this type of waste every year .
Through the new directives , the Member States will be responsible for ensuring that waste from electrical and electronic products is collected separately from other waste .
I believe that these solutions are a great success for
