Commissioner , Minister , the European Parliament wants to thank the Presidency of the Council , the Commission and the Member States for their efforts to negotiate a new protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons , which deals with all the humanitarian problems associated with the use of cluster bombs .
Are we going to have a common position of the Council in this matter ?
That is exactly what this report does .
If this measure were to be carried out , it would give the Taliban a new argument to defend its positions and eventually would most likely result in the farming communities ending up as rebel camps .
It would also have very serious health and environmental repercussions .
Indeed , one of the nicest poems in the Spanish language is dedicated to the attachment of a poor unfortunate worker .
When it comes down to it , the large debtors , the people who are involved in major financial operations and who end up owing billions to thousands of defenceless people , those large debtors do not usually have their accounts in a bank in Belgium , Brussels or Strasbourg , or even in London .
I hope that the Commission will soon present us with a legislative text that enables the cross-border credit market to continue to function . on behalf of the PSE. - ( ES ) Mr President , Mr Lehne has in essence given the view held by the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
First , I hope that during 2008 and , if possible , before 30 June , the proposal for a directive , the Directive on the European private company statute , will be on the table , and , secondly , it is to be hoped that the Commission does not give up on the idea of continuing to develop company law in fields such as freedom of establishment and change of domicile for companies .
I thank you all .
For example , 1 032 petitions were submitted in 2005 and 1 016 in 2006 .
The Commission 's recommendations remain instrumental in defining the most appropriate answer to petitioners ' problems .
Since many of the petitions relate to the environment and many of them are from Spain , I would like to discuss how they could be better handled .
We are also concerned about the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive .
I reiterate that the basis for my speech is scientific reports .
This afternoon we are , for example , discussing among other matters the case of Somalia .
This is , basically , the LGBT population .
Our Group is delighted at the definite progress made at the Lisbon Summit but , at the same time , we would be lying if we did not say that our Group considers that we still do not have sufficient political momentum and ambition to transform the European Union of today into the European Union that we need for the future of the European people .
We must share with them this political need for effort and dare to tell them the truth about what is missing .
This without doubt strengthens the Union but , in the opinion of our Group , it also strengthens the European nations .
We should pass it on and , at the same time , be aware that we cannot lock up this value within our European Union . rapporteur . - ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today , as a result of globalisation , our economy , the progress of the Community and the welfare of our citizens depend more than ever on an effective , efficient , economic and , above all , sustainable system of transport .
However , for more than a decade , the levels of interoperability of the European networks have not gone beyond 7 % and it is the requirement for national approval of locomotives and traction units in each of the Member States where these are to be used that is currently one of the main barriers to the creation of new railway companies dedicated to the transport of passengers and freight , and also a major obstacle to the interoperability of the European railway system .
Member States will consider as meeting the essential technical requirements those structural subsystems authorised to be placed into service in any other Member State and will not require any further authorisation , except where compatibility with infrastructure characteristics or limitations may be affected .
However , I have decided to remain here to listen to you and hopefully therefore to reinforce to some degree the Europeanisation of rail transport .
European citizens must not therefore be afraid as rail safety has been Europeanised and therefore strengthened .
The Court is currently composed of 27 members , from the Member States of the Union , and we are now preparing to renew the mandate of four candidates : David Bostock , for the United Kingdom ; Maarten B. Engwirda , for the Netherlands ; Ioannis Sarmas , for Greece ; and Hubert Weber , for Austria ; and to propose three new members , Michel Cretin , for France ; Henri Grethen , for Luxembourg ; and Harald Noack , for Germany .
As for Mr Weber , currently President of the Court of Auditors , I would like to clear up one point , before the vote , which is of particular concern to me and which arose after the confirmation hearing in the Committee on Budgetary Control , and so I think that this forum offers an excellent opportunity to clarify it .
Whereas to date
