in particular in Palestine , there is a unique opportunity finally to resume the peace process .
The Middle East conflict has been the cause of frequent instability and tension , and the international community has been dragged into repeated attempts to alleviate the political and economic deterioration that the region has undergone for a number of years .
We cannot , and must not , forget this tragedy , which is one of the most shameful and painful chapters in our continent’s history .
It is crucial that we resume discussions on the draft framework decision on racism and xenophobia , because we will only be able to combat these phenomena effectively and consistently throughout EU territory if we adopt an integrated approach that involves both preventative and punitive measures .     .
Today we commemorate one of the most troubling dates in the history of the human race : the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp .
Europe , which considers itself tolerant , must , in this instance , show character and be resolute in combating this kind of organisation and activity .
Mr President , eminent Members of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , before I address you on the Commission ’s legislative and work programme for 2005 , I should like briefly to express my satisfaction with the results of yesterday’s referendum on the European Constitution in Spain and I shall try to do this in Spanish .
This ‘yes’ , expressed clearly and unreservedly , opens the way for the other European citizens who will also be called upon to express their opinions on the European Constitution over the coming months .
Let me remind you of some of its most important elements .
Finally , we do not only want to deliver on time – we also want to deliver in a better way .
On 2 February , I presented to you our proposals for a mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy .
As in any partnership , the important thing is to have positions on the table clearly spelt out , and to work together to achieve common objectives .
We have already started to work towards this goal by implementing our work programme for 2005 : we are on track .
Let me assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed .
I am fully convinced that , via the legislative process , we will be able to settle upon an instrument which will tap the single market 's hidden potential without jeopardising legitimate public interest objectives .
We want better incentives to foster 'good policies ' in 'good times ' .
This shows the Commission 's full commitment to modernising and developing European social systems , to tackling social exclusion and poverty , and to attaining the target of more and better jobs .
It is an essential complement to competitiveness and the Lisbon Strategy – raising prosperity levels in the less-developed regions of the Union benefits the Union as a whole .
This set of instruments will include proposals on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development ; consumer protection and public health ; energy – including renewable energy sources ; competitiveness and innovation in respect of freedom , security and justice .
These proposals supplement those relating to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy .
Next month , we shall publish our contribution to the current review exercise .
We all share the belief that it is our action for the benefit of Europeans that is the source of legitimacy for our daily work .
I should like to repeat what I have already said on many occasions before this House , namely that I intend to develop a constructive rapport between the Commission and the European Parliament .
I shall be happy to hear now your comments and suggestions regarding its content .     – In recent weeks , the Commission has taken decisions on two key themes : the strategic guidelines for its mandate and the reform of the Lisbon Strategy .
This approach to life , this culture , will become a reality if the capacity is there to carry out the right economic policies .
It is now the duty of the Member States to display the reforming spirit proposed by the Commission through practical political action .
Your speeches , ladies and gentlemen , have confirmed the richness of the debate and have demonstrated the wide range of viewpoints on the subject of globalisation .
Today’s globalisation is not the result of a decision made by any one country or group of countries , and nor is it a conspiracy on the part of a group of companies .
With regard to Europe and the Commission , what can I tell you ?
Accordingly , if we wish to conduct a coherent debate on the issue of cohesion , we must begin by seeking to implement cohesion – economic , social and territorial cohesion – here in Europe .
It cannot therefore be said that trade and aid are irreconcilably incompatible .
As things stand , it is clear that we are only limited by the resources available .
Mutual trust must be built up and must work effectively .
Secondly , I feel that it is crucial that this evaluation should be an objective evaluation , and in order for this to be the case I propose that a Quality Charter for Criminal Justice should be created .
The Council has called on the Commission to prepare for harmonisation of the list of offences referred to in the Constitutional Treaty at the earliest opportunity , so that by the time the Constitutional Treaty enters into force the preparatory work will have been completed and the Council can quickly , in conjunction with Parliament , adopt the harmonisation standards called for in the new Treaty .
