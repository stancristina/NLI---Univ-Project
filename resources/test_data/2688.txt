The second theme is combating the trafficking of human beings , as mentioned by Mrs Klamt .
At the moment we are addressing very ambitious challenges , such as signing as soon as possible , first with Morocco and then with Algeria , readmission agreements that are once again European , and no longer bilateral between one State and another , to increase Europe’s political dimension .
The third theme is legal immigration , which I see as an opportunity and certainly not a danger .
Allow me to say that it would be irresponsible to welcome immigrants without integrating them because we would thereby increase their frustration and their sense of isolation .
I am about to promote an initiative , which the Commission should approve on 19 July , on certain guidelines for illegal immigration .
They are not actions implemented by individual Member States working together , but are coordinated by a European agency .
I think that the future will see the African Union and the European Union implementing a strategic programme and I think that this can really make a difference .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not think that Europe’s problem stems from migratory flows ; the real problem is not people arriving on our territory , but the large number of people who do not get to Europe , those who die in the Mediterranean Sea or in the Atlantic Ocean .
Only last year , Commissioner , more than 20 000 illegal immigrants arrived on our Sicilian shores , double the number of those who landed in all the European countries bordering the Mediterranean in the past two years .
You are known to be a person who is in favour of decisive , practical action and we invite you to give us yet another further demonstration of it .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am not Maltese and , therefore , while acknowledging that the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs is doing a magnificent job , I regret that the Finnish Presidency , which today began its term of office , is not present ; this may be because of the match , or the time or perhaps a lack of attention ( seeing that one of the Finnish Presidency’s themes is immigration ) , but it is not here .
Commissioner Frattini , if this European Council , this European Union really does want to avoid being hypocritical about Malta , it must remove these people , who have been held there for months or even years .
You are obviously right ; if I had the tools and the flexibility that the bureaucratic systems do not confer on me , this mission would have left a long time ago .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party .
It also says nothing whatsoever about the danger that certain forms of extreme religious beliefs bring to our Europe .
Thus , in Amendment 15 , after : there must be added : I call on my fellow Members , including those who do not agree on this matter , not to prevent this oral amendment from being tabled , as we did earlier with Mr Gawronski , since it simply describes the current legal situation .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that , in voting in favour of this report , we must pay tribute to what is perhaps a positive development , namely that the European Parliament , rather than constantly laying the blame on the United States , is beginning to look at the way in which the European Union and the Member States comply with the law , because all too often , when faced with illegality and abuses that exist , for example , regarding the transfer of personal data and regarding air passenger traffic , we have actually hidden our own illegality – the inability to comply with our own rules – behind that of the United States .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the compulsory origin marking proposed by the Commission must be supported because it has a dual purpose : to make Europeans , as consumers , better informed and to optimise the industrial system of those European countries that are investing a large amount of resources in innovation , with the aim of transforming their production apparatus into something of excellence .
What is the Commission ’s strategy when it comes to strengthening the external aspects of European competitiveness , given the extremely close relationship between industry and trade , between production and promotion ?
Yet , it is an initiative that some people still insist on not supporting , demonstrating political short-sightedness and a lack of interest in consumers .
We call on the Commission subsequently to monitor the application of the rules , in terms both of labels of origin and of product composition , and we are grateful to the Commission for its swift action , because the swifter the action , the greater the protection of our fellow citizens .     .
This is in an effort to respond to the Islamic courts .
We need to be alert to the danger posed by the political destabilisation plan implemented throughout Africa by the vast network of international extremism , and of the danger posed by Osama Bin Laden 's message supporting the supreme council of Somali Islamic courts and opposing the legitimate president of the republic .
The European Union should take a leading role again in Africa , just as Italy should in Somalia and throughout the Horn of Africa because of its historical precedents .
Making origin marking compulsory , as what we are discussing here provides for , is only a first , crucial step in protecting against those products that
