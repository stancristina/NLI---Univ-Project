I would call for a European convergence strategy which takes full account of subsidiarity and involves at least the following : firstly , urgent measures to refinance social security .
As a Fleming , I can say as a matter of principle , and I speak with some knowledge , that this would be a very bad idea .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive on the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers has a very lengthy history .
The report includes a very clear amendment in the definitions which states that with units of measurement customarily used in the Member States for certain products , such as wine in 0.75 litre bottles , the price per litre need not also be indicated .
We have tabled an amendment here giving the Member States the chance to determine who is 'small ' and who is 'large ' , and what exceptions need to be made .
In our report , I and the other members of the committee followed the lead given by the Economic and Social Committee , which delivered a unanimous recommendation .
Perhaps it could give us an explanation .
If she does this before 12.30 p.m.
The aim of the Committee on the Environment is that when the euro is introduced we should not then have a system where two , four or even six prices are indicated , but only a maximum of three .
I should like to begin by congratulating the chairman of the Committee of Inquiry , Mr BÃ¶ge , the rapporteur , Mr Medina , and all the other committee members .
In mid-1990 , France and Germany considered imposing trade restrictions on British beef , but Commissioner MacSharry threatened to take them to the Court of Justice .
Our group therefore confirms that it has confidence in the Commission to implement these reforms .
It needs to take urgent action to restore the credibility of the European Union by giving public health and consumer protection precedence over economic interests .
Individual disciplinary measures must be taken where officials have acted incorrectly , Mr President of the Commission .
( Applause ) Mr President , I should like to congratulate not only the Committee of Inquiry but also all the national parliaments , including the House of Commons in the UK, for ratifying the Maastricht Treaty which made this committee of inquiry possible .
I too am in favour of having a quality assurance policy for agricultural products , but I only hope that farmers will also benefit from this , which has by no means always been the case .
Senior officials said that they were forced to give in to political pressure .
While scientists advised caution , the Commission lifted the ban on exports of gelatine , tallow and semen from British bulls .
What will the budget be ?
What is more , the mistakes which caused the problem to escalate are not the fault of today 's Commission , but of the United Kingdom , previous Commissions and the Council , whose presidency is conspicuous by its absence here .
Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , for the time being we are happy to accept your statement of intent , but we also expect you to act on it .
In conclusion , following on from some of the comments made by the rapporteur , I should like to ask the Commissioner when we are likely to see a complete revision of Regulation No 1107/70 .
First of all , because we have seen that simply carrying on providing aid for combined transport is tantamount to flogging a dead horse .
Mr President , I am pleased to see that Commissioner Monti has now arrived alongside Commissioner Kinnock .
The point I wish to make is this : if we had had the conciliation procedure then , so that we could have worked directly with the Commission and the Council , it might have been much easier to find a solution .
We would have preferred to allow the countries offering the highest levels of protection for investors to compete with countries which do not offer any .
I hope I shall not have the same effect , but I think we can assume that the market boom we are experiencing will not last , and that one of these days it will start to dip .
To my mind that is extremely dangerous because it may lead to all manner of dubious goings-on .
This works by the electronic recognition of chips implanted into the animals .
The ELDR Group welcomes the initiative on the debate on the future of social protection in Europe but has not given its support to the Weiler report .
I totally agree with Mr Whitehead that the communication should have been a far more detailed , more thoroughly thought-out programme and that it should have indicated how and in what way the Commission intends to attain the objectives it has set itself , and with which I have no problem as such .
It should in my view have included a far clearer list , with priorities .
You may think I am riding my pet hobbyhorse here , and I am , but I think we can often help the consumer far faster , more cheaply and more efficiently if we offer a lot more incentives for settling disputes than we do at present .
Can we perhaps have an answer on this ?
The report exudes a spirit of realism which is most apposite , I think , in consumer policy .
So I welcome the report 's recommendations for strengthening the position of the consumer by spreading information ( paragraphs 20 to 26 ) .
Parliament endorsed that , the Council of Ministers scrapped it and we then had a debate in the second reading .
