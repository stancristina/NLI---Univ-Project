It is very important that we retain a sense of perspective , a sense of proportion about this issue and I welcome the balanced response from Commissioner Wallstr√∂m .
It is very important that we stick to facts and avoid some of the wilder claims that have been put in the Green motion for a resolution on this issue .
I want to emphasise that safety was not compromised in the incident of record falsification .
I would like to quote also from the NII report that the fuel manufactured in MDF , the MOX Demonstration Facility , will be safe in use in spite of incomplete quality assurance records caused by the falsification of some acceptable quality-level data by process workers in the facility .
The NII takes this view on the basis of the robustness of the fuel manufacturing process and the totality of the checks made on the key parameters .
I would also like to draw colleagues ' attention to the positive response by BNFL to the two reports made by the NII , one on the records incident and the other on the control and safety management regime at Sellafield .
I welcome the response and their three key recommendations to improve the safety management system and management structure by implementing a comprehensive overhaul of the safety management system across the company .
To improve resource availability by taking on more monitoring staff , by improved training and further emphasising the safety culture and thirdly , to improve independent inspection , audit and review by appointing independent senior compliance inspectors and the like .
BNFL has responded positively to the 28 recommendations in one report and 15 recommendations in the other , the falsification report .
I do not propose to go through those in great detail .
I have no time .
Let us not lose sight of the fundamentals here .
Regulatory safety mechanisms worked in this instance .
Members of the staff reported the error and then the regulatory procedures took their course .
There was no actual breach of safety , only a breach of record-keeping regulations for one particular customer .
The offence of falsification of records must not negate or obscure the long-term case for reprocessing or MOX fuel assemblies .
Both of these are forms of recycling .
Both of them are effective ways of reducing , of concentrating waste and in the case of MOX manufacture are the best answer known presently to the issue of safe disposal of weapons grade plutonium .
I welcome the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association WENRA which was formed just over a year ago in February 1999 .
I welcome their launching of a project aimed at harmonising its members ' safety rules and practices .
The regulators themselves are undertaking this job across Member States : who better to undertake that task ?
The result will be an enhanced safety culture and that is to be welcomed by all .
Mr President , the vast majority of United Kingdom citizens or indeed EU citizens were deeply shocked and dismayed at the recent events at BNFL .
Let me quote BNFL 's own words : " At company level it has been recognised that in the mind of many stake holders quality and safety are inextricably linked .
Failure to comply in one aspect of an accredited quality system has led to a major loss in confidence in BNFL overall . "
That is from a management which is now aware of its shortcomings , a management that foolishly engaged in staff reductions , now reversed thank goodness .
The highest standards are required of any nuclear installation .
I have considerable sympathy for the workers at BNFL let down by a sloppy management .
Their livelihoods were endangered .
They will now speak out whenever they see evidence of lack of safety culture .
I do not want to talk at this stage about the viability or wisdom of reprocessing nor about the economics of MOX .
That is not under debate , although those matters should be debated in the UK and elsewhere .
BNFL is now in for a very difficult period and deservedly .
The main reason this is being raised in the European Parliament is to point out the lack of European harmonised standards in the nuclear industry .
There are harmonised standards in almost every other aspect of European industry .
The Euratom Treaty is deficient and that must be rectified so that we can have the sort of directive we need .
We cannot really contemplate enlargement without some sort of acquis communautaire in the nuclear sector .
The Commissioner says she does not feel it advisable to produce a communication .
Please come to our committee Commissioner and we can discuss this further .
I think one is needed in the near future indicating how we could achieve more harmonisation - of course not at the lowest standards in existence but at the most stringent .
If you want public acceptance - and many of you do - of the nuclear industry , you have to ensure that .
Commissioner you say that as far as new facilities are concerned , if there are to be any , you feel that there is a case .
I really do not see the difference , and I urge you to reconsider what you have said this evening to come to our committee , look at this one case as an example of what we need for the public of Europe and for the workers in our nuclear plants .
Mr President , what the investigations into this incident show is what can best be described as a culture of management incompetence and one of complacency .
The report by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in February of this year into the safety records found that these records had been systematically falsified .
The processing
