for the products of biotechnology : demand from citizens , particularly those whose circumstances are rather special - and this mainly involves the pharmaceuticals sector ; and demand from sectors , such as agriculture , in which products of this kind could bring substantial benefits from many points of view .
The task is made all the more difficult because this is a field that is difficult to understand , in both legal and biological terms .
I am therefore in favour of establishing the directive in full because I am thinking of life , of the life of the many sick people who are waiting for it and have written to us .
Moving in that same direction , I ask you to consider , specifically because of the importance of the directive , the need to retain as it stands the committee 's amendment to Article 9 .
Thanks to the detailed and new work done by Mr Rothley - whom I congratulate on behalf of my group - we now have a substantially clearer text that is able to meet the demands both of those who wish to guarantee European firms a favourable legal framework that does not perpetuate the disadvantage they suffer compared with their US and Japanese competitors and of those who are rightly determined not to abandon the protection of human beings and other living beings .
The new proposal for a directive , based on Article 100a of the Treaty , contains a number of important points of reference .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , when in March 1995 we voted on the first directive on the patentability of biotechnologies , I voted in favour .
I have great confidence in the ethics committee that has been set up and in the debate that we in the Committee on Research and Technology shall be pursuing further in the context of the Fifth Framework Programme .
To conclude , therefore , we need to avoid patents on the following : the human body , parts of the human body , human tissue and all genetic material derived from human sources ; animals , parts of animals , animal tissue , genetic modification processes , plants , seeds , vegetable tissue and other reproductive material .
Had they been kept separate , we should long since have entered into competition with the United States and Japan , and we need that for development in Europe and to create jobs .
We consider that it should be supported , even though there may , clearly , be amendments designed to improve or clarify it .
We ought therefore to conclude that what is not acceptable for human beings should not be acceptable for other animal organisms either .
And so we are opposed to this .
In Europe , however , we have a plethora of different phone cards , prepaid and credit cards and cards containing a chip , with a scale of charges that can hardly be described as transparent ; consequently , we are tempted to use cellular phones , that are much more expensive a technology , even though phoning from a public call box would be much cheaper .
That is the intention of this House , and it is in that spirit that my group , which to begin with had reservations about the procedure adopted , now considers the procedure adopted by Mr Brinkhorst - very wisely in my view , including in an effort to secure the appropriate interinstitutional dialogue - to be the right one .
President Santer pointed out that the Court of Justice has recognized that the system of quotas may justify the adoption of conditions able to guarantee that there is a real economic link between the fishing vessel and the Member State in question , if those conditions are designed to ensure that population groups dependent on fishing and industries in the sector benefit from the quotas .
In the past year we have been making proposals and suggestions to the UK authorities on how to implement the economic link the Court of Justice talked about .
On 7 May the Dutch Ministry of Health informed UCLAF but requested strict confidentiality with regard to the investigation undertaken at the same time by the Dutch prosecutor .
An inspection visit to two Belgian plants took place on 3 July .
The situation was considered unsatisfactory in terms of control and there was certain evidence concerning the link between Tragex-Gel and the British plant concerned .
On the basis of evidence found in Safex Cold Store and Heine Foods on 14 July we asked the UK authorities to withdraw these companies ' approvals .
What the Commission is entitled to do is to coordinate the control .
On the second issue : you are aware of the position of the Commission on labelling .
I agree that it has taken a long time , these things proceed slowly , but if the Court of Justice goes along with the opinion of Advocate General Lenz this will be a real case of substantial progress being achieved in enforcing the free movement of goods .
I therefore thought it appropriate to table a number of amendments which are designed to restore the approach contained in the report approved by the Environment Committee .
But there is some inconsistency here - Members from Germany , as well as from Italy have made the point clearly - because it is perhaps too unique a case .
Income should not exceed construction , management and development costs but , above all , we should take into account certain criteria that no-one has really stated clearly yet .
We are among those who fear this happening : if it does , then even the acquis communautaire will gradually be eroded , and the Union would then lose all real political significance
