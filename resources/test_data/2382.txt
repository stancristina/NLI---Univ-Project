campaigns on the referendums that are to take place .
When questions of such importance to the future of the people and of the Member States are being debated , it is wrong to attempt to impose coordination of the ratification processes with a common schedule and strategy and , worse still , to establish guidelines for disseminating the content with the aim of influencing public opinion in favour of adopting the draft Constitutional Treaty , which most of us wish to see .
It is clear that the best way to involve the general public in the process will be to hold referendums that will foster campaigns explaining the issues in a fair and balanced way .
Just days from the European Council of 5 November , an important struggle has taken place in Parliament in defence of freedom , justice and human rights , particularly those of immigrants .
I was therefore unable to vote in favour of the report .     .
I shall begin by welcoming the fact that , following my suggestion adopted at the time , the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs has begun to implement a process of dialogue and cooperation with the national parliaments .
This must not , however , deflect us from once again advocating the doctrine that under no circumstances must we cross the line separating legitimate – often necessary – international political pressure from undesirable meddling in the internal affairs of other countries .
Its political support and the presence of its military units stationed in areas of conflict and the surrounding areas are crucial to stability ; and it is equally important that genuine respect be shown for the territorial integrity of the bordering countries .
I voted in favour of the Joint Motion for a Resolution on the Communication from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee , ‘Developing countries , international trade and sustainable development : the function of the Community’s generalised system of preferences ( GSP) for the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015’ , because I feel that all necessary efforts to simplify and improve Community actions in developing countries must be properly supported and funded by Parliament .
The Community’s trade policy must therefore be consistent with the aims of its policy on developing countries , of which the overriding aim must be to eradicate poverty and to promote sustainable development .
In the proposal tabled by the Dutch Presidency , only six working languages are safeguarded – those of the six biggest countries .
In so doing , they have shown their ignorance of the European car market .
This rise is the result of a complex series of factors , including the invasion of Iraq , political and social instability in some of the big exporting countries , natural disasters , increased demand in countries with large populations and strong economic growth , and also speculation .
The key issue , however , is much broader and more structural , and is due to the fact that the world’s economy has never resolved the problem of its dependence on a resource that is finite and subject to speculation .     .
I also decided how responsibilities would be shared out among the Commissioners-designate and the main features of the new Commission ’s internal organisation .
As I said to you in July , and in accordance with your wishes , there are definitely no first-class or second-class Commissioners in this college .
It is clear that this is not the time for a false crisis .
You think that your strength comes from these strong-arm tactics with Parliament .
Look at how they have left you to your fate today .
The decision right now is yours , and yours only .
If this were one day the case , this House would no longer be a Parliament but a court of opinion with a morbid taste for censure .
It is understandable to vote against a Commission if one is not 100 % in agreement with it .
Lastly , Mr President of the Commission , I do not know how tomorrow’s vote will go , but , coming from Portugal , I can tell you that you can count on our vote , and I hope that the Commission is not rejected because of 12 votes from the Portuguese left of this House .     .
I believe that , in this way , ordinary citizens can be better informed as regards their duties and the rights they are accorded .
I feel that this work is also highly valuable because it preserves in full the content of the codified acts ; all it does is bring them together .
Consequently , and in order to ensure clarity and transparency in Community legislation , I believe that it is essential that Community legislation be codified , as provided for by the Commission in 1987 and by the Edinburgh European Council of 1992 .
The purpose of this report is to resolve a problem that arose due to the absence of a response from the Council to the creation of a new Regulation in the area of aid to uprooted people in Latin America and Asia .
Regulation (EC ) No 2130/2001 , of 29 October 2001 , provides assistance to some of the most vulnerable groups in the world – those forced to flee their homes due to armed conflict .
I also welcome the trend in recent years towards gradually increasing appropriations .
This is not a story that tells the truth as we understand it , and so we have rejected it .
I agree that the ECB has been a factor in institutional and economic stability and that it has met the majority of its objectives .
