Pension rights and pension funds are again in the line of fire and the generalisation of ‘flexibility ’ in employment and wage freezes are being promoted in the name of competitiveness and reducing labour costs .
It is certain that the peoples will not remain inert in the face of the further intensification of the attack and will develop even further their fight to resist and counter attack .     Mr President , as we all know , the Commission has been preoccupied with the question of better governance of this Community model which is called the European Union for years now .
As time is short , I shall comment on three of the basic overall problems which arise .
Representativeness is not a vested right of any agency and must be confirmed gradually .
This orientation is also clear from the European Commission 's Green Paper and from the STAR 21 report and from the meeting organised by the Greek Presidency in Athens on 8 and 9 May on the subject of ‘Security and Defence Aspects of Space’ .
Militarisation is being promoted both in order to serve what we see as the aggressive common defence and security policy and on the pretext that it is the only way to strengthen the aerospace industry with public funding .
Although the report by the Committee on Industry which we are examining contains a series of correct findings and proposals , such as acknowledging the role of the European Space Agency , the reference to the need to promote research and international cooperation , however , adopts the military use of space and goes too far .
The involvement of the European Union in the further militarisation of space is a severe blow for peace because it brings it to the same level of responsibilities as the United States in the military competition race .
What is for sure , in all events , is that a lot of work is needed in order for the sun to revolve .
However , it cannot be used as a pretext for new escalations .
It must intervene decisively and with the force of a third agent .
We are politicians .
Apart from hollow proclamations , not a word of support for the Palestinian people fighting for human dignity for the whole of mankind in the face of imperialist brutality .
He also cites the famous road map which was signed by the Palestinian Authority with a gun to its head and which is being trampled underfoot by Israel , to exert more pressure and coercion on the Palestinians to make new concessions , basically to start a Palestinian civil war .
We call here too for a front of solidarity for peace in the Middle East and for reconciliation between the two peoples in two independent , sovereign states .     The resolution may criticise the situation concerning the transmission of data to the USA , but it accepts its legalisation .
These crimes , apart from terrorism , murder , kidnap , taking hostages , trafficking in human beings , transporting explosives and transporting toxic waste , also include theft , offences of a serious sexual nature and smuggling drugs and psychotropic substances .
We saw this with the murky Van affair , where foreigners conducted surveillance and which was linked to the 17 November affair , and now we shall see them ‘legally ’ imposing complete chaos and a Euro-police state and subverting national sovereignty .     The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution because it does not include the amendment which we proposed calling for a ban on the collection and transmission of personal data on passengers to third parties , as demanded by the citizens and , in part , by Article 6 , paragraph 2 of Council Regulation 2299/98.
What is important to the grass-roots movement is not if the ΕU is playing first or second fiddle , but that , together with the USA , it is carrying out an orchestrated attack on fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms .     – We agree with the motion for a resolution because it makes an effort to address the acute problems of apiculture .
That is why I am asking you to make sure that their proper functioning is safeguarded for the coming period .     Mr President , the operation to criminalise pacifist action is continuing in Greece with the referral to the courts of 5 peace fighters who , with thousands of others , expressed the opposition of the Greek people to the dirty imperialist war against the Yugoslavian people .
One aspect of the fight was the blockade on the columns of NATO vehicles , in which the 5 peace fighters also participated .
We have seen and are seeing similar trials against farming trade unionists .
In all events , they will come up against intensified reaction by the workers and our peoples in general .     Mr President , the change in the definition from "forest ecosystems " to "forests " is a step backwards scientifically , in that "forest ecosystem " is scientifically a much fuller term .
Any so-called forestry policy to date – and I quote my country as a typical bad example – has failed to address the basic problems of forest ecosystems ; on the contrary , they have contributed to the privatisation of the forests , hence the large number of arson attacks , given that we are talking about fires , the rapid appearance of big business and speculation in ecosystems of huge size and importance , such as national trust lands and so on , and appropriations and changes of use , in the aim of stepping up speculation by making use of them for tourist and housing purposes .
So when you have something which is priceless to
