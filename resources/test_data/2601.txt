longer including these overly radical amendments , as I explained to the House last night .
In August 1967 , the Commission consulted the European Parliament for its opinion on the first proposal on a regulation to establish a common organisation of the market in the tobacco sector .
To begin with , Europe must ensure that environmental legislation is applied .
The Member States ' main duty is to put in place systems for collecting and processing waste water and to respect a pre-established timetable .
We can only regret the fact that the United States has introduced a tax on steel imports , at the expense of European interests and which apparently violates WTO rules .
This situation is proof of the true nature of American-style globalisation .
I voted in favour of this report .
The report by the former trade unionist Mr Bruno Trentin begins with a guideline which has the merit of being perfectly clear at least : 'the priorities ?should involve reducing labour costs ' .
A report that clearly stated that tax policy is a matter for each nation and which recommended improved coordination between the Member States in this area would have received my vote .
It will be the work of the Convention coming together over the coming months to find the combination that best encourages voluntary synergy , without abolishing the freedom of choice of the people .
He was moved to the area in Tunis prison that is reserved for those sentenced to death , despite the fact that he is a political prisoner .
He stressed that the European Union respects the political sovereignty of Tunisia and does not wish to interfere in Tunisia 's internal affairs .
We note that the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement , stipulating that relations between the two parties are based on the respect of democratic principles and human rights , has once again been flouted .
My second comment relates to the issue of services of general interest .
In what way , Mr President , did you take into account this unprecedented call from our respective societies to leading European decision makers ?
Mr President , the Barcelona Council reiterated the Member States ' commitment to reach a budgetary objective that would be close to balance or in surplus by 2004 at the latest .
In this case , rather than decisions , the rules by which the Member States have to abide are being made progressively stricter by means of some far from democratic procedures .
The second observation is , in order to prevent disturbances and to maintain law and order in connection with football matches is to have , first and foremost , it is essential to have an organised and efficient system for exchanging information regarding the risks that some matches present - and more specifically , certain types of supporters who travel to matches - and therefore , secondly , to improve coordination between the organisations responsible for security .
We believe that a directive is the most appropriate tool for establishing a European list of environmental crimes and a common foundation of criminal sanctions .
And if we disregard this principle , we will edge slightly further towards the concept of a centralised Union which is not what we want .
This means that we must pay particular attention to the subsidiarity principle and the rules on competence that are laid down by the Treaty .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank the two rapporteurs , Mr Oostlander and Mr von Boetticher , for their excellent reports .
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that , as regards the monitoring of external borders , the Schengen acquis was split , within the framework of the European Union , with important aspects coming under the first pillar and also important aspects coming under the third pillar .
We are currently working within a framework where harmonisation is based on common minimum standards .
It is essentially due to the fact that the Council of Ministers adopted the legal bases too late , which means that a number of items given budgetary appropriations had to be postponed .
I think that this behaviour is totally unacceptable and I now urge my fellow Members and the political groups to reject these amendments .
A Member cannot be both rapporteur and the author of amendments - he is either one or the other .
His report is a balanced , reasonable and positive piece of work .
We have already waited too long .
The initiative allows us to remain within an intergovernmental framework and this aspect of criminal law will remain one of the national responsibilities .

For example , when illegal immigrants apply for asylum in a Member State although they have previously stayed illegally in another , the latter must process the asylum application and it cannot shirk from this responsibility .
I hope that the name of this mysterious Member State neighbouring Germany does not begin with the letter ' F ' . Whatever the case , the problem cannot be resolved by greater police intervention in the Member States .
The results of the measures show that dust particles of depleted uranium have been widely dispersed in the environment as a result of the impact from these munitions .
You touched on this point , Minister .
The hospital in Ramallah has been surrounded and the clinics are inundated by the number of people who are seriously injured .
Tanks were positioned at the bottom of the steps in Nativity Square blocking all access to the church .
In the birthplace of cultures and civilisations , universal values and human dignity are being treated with contempt and humanity is collapsing
