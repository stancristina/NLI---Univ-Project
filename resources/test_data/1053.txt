directive .
The Commissioner replied that he had written to the Greek authorities on 7 June 2000 asking for information on the extension to the Petrola plant but that the Greek authorities had not yet replied to the letter in question .
The problem of the influx into the Member States of the ÅU of people who have lost everything , of people who are in danger in their own country , either because they are being politically persecuted or for reasons of economic survival .
Consequently , we should have no delusions about the fact that , as long as imperialism prevails , asylum-seeking and immigration will live and rule .
For example , it quite rightly points out that the concept of 'safe ' countries of origin or 'safe ' third countries is very fluid and the danger here is that people will be deported to countries in which they are at risk , that is , they will literally be sent into the lion 's den .
As far as the conditions of survival of refugees are concerned , a typical example is Greece , where thousands of Kurds live in shanty towns in Lavrio and Afghans and other refugees sleep in cardboard boxes on the beaches in Athens , deprived of even the basic necessities .
However , we feel that only solidarity and a united fight by both refugees and workers in the Member States of the ÅU in a bid to claim dignified living conditions for everyone and , more to the point , wipe out the reasons for refugees and poverty will provide a definitive solution to the problem .
However , the Commission communication on an 'immigration policy ' contains omissions and additional objectives need to be promoted .
.
The European Union should move to get the USA , Russia , China and all the other major arms exporters to adopt binding rules of conduct and their unwillingness should not be a reason for the European Union to relax or otherwise fail to act properly .
Mr President , representative of the Council , Commissioner , in my view , our economic policy is a combination of success and failure .
Some people maintain that this collapse is a virtual collapse because it is due to a simple change of name , in that the private sector is investing where the public sector used to invest .
I do not think so , but although no one admits it , this was the official policy up to the European Council in Lisbon .
It seems to me that these events have drawn a line under the Lisbon vision and that we need to go back to the drawing board .
By refusing to make use of the possibilities offered by the Treaty and exempt investments from the definition of deficit in the Stability Pact ?
I heard Mr Della Vedova refer in trepidation to 'deficit spending ' .
Also , I should like to ask you , Commissioner , as you did me the honour of allowing me to ask you in private : what is the scientific criterion for refuting your position that will make you tell us that our position has been refuted and that we need to change economic policy ?
Mr President , so as to appease the Commissioner and the other honourable Members , may I state for the record that I am not a fan of deficits , of increasing public debt or of inflation .
But if it does happen , then it will be too late .
I fail to understand why .
Surely you do not mean to tell me that you would have a problem if someone somewhere did something about annuities or the international speculators throwing hot money around on the stock exchange , or even about the excessive wealth and the frantic consumption of our inflated upper middle classes .
Well , I have never heard such dogmatism in my life !
It may have been Swissair but it could equally easily have been Sabena or Olympic Airways or another airline .
To refuse to see the 15 billion given to the airlines , to refuse to see that , for both political and economic reasons , international movements of funds need to be controlled somewhere along the line if we are to have both economic and political stability , to refuse to see that governments need to stop being petty and to take things in hand .
First , do these plans for Morocco include Turkey ?
If it later emerges that they should not have been naturalised , is the Member State which naturalised them obliged to pass this information on to the other Member States so that the person who has no right to live in the European Union can be located ?
That does not answer my question .
I understand how tired the representative of the Council must be , she has been here since this morning , she has intervened on numerous issues , and I can only ascribe her disdain for the European Court of Human Rights to that .
Besides , the European Parliament , in its recent resolutions on Turkey , has called on Turkey , among other things , to respect the rulings and to obey the rulings of the European Court .
You are a member of the Belgian Parliament .
Apart from the rulings on Leyla Zana and the other three Members of Parliament in prison , there is the famous ruling on Titina Loizidou , the Greek Cypriot still waiting for Turkey to pay the compensation awarded to her in a ruling by the supreme court , which Turkey has provocatively said it has no intention of observing
