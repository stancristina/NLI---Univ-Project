in this House .
We feel it is wrong to create a Community patent at any cost , as this indeed undermines the interests of small and medium-sized countries , with regard to both the language arrangements and the role of the national institutions and national patent agencies .
Although such a balance will be difficult , it is often an attainable target , as evidenced by this compromise .
As well as playing an important part in preserving dolphin communities in this region , this Agreement has also helped to preserve the ecosystem as a whole by preserving communities of other species in addition to dolphins , such as sharks , turtles and other aquatic animals often killed , thanks to the use of different fishing gear specially designed to catch these species of tuna .
I therefore feel , Commissioner , that following discussion in the Committee on Fisheries , this was an important time to raise awareness among the Commission and all of the members of the Committee on Fisheries of the fact that the European Union needs to regulate the issue of eco-labelling , and it was to an extent with this in mind that some amendments were tabled .
I feel that this mini-hearing helped to convey the importance of this programme and to show that it is possible to have Agreement between fishermen , scientists and politicians on such an important issue .
Thousands of jobs are on the line and ‘change ’ of this kind has enormous economic and social ramifications .
The EU must therefore channel all its efforts into a consistent and proactive policy towards its industry , a policy that can both anticipate structural change and develop a sound and competitive industrial base .
In March 2005 , the Council carried out a review of the Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP) , with a view to making it a more flexible and streamlined instrument .
The Member States are both the judge and the defendant , and would rather fail to implement the SGP than impose sanctions on one of their peers .
What we really need is to suspend the SGP and to make a complete break from the economic guidelines in place in order to create the macro-conditions to revitalise the economy and to create more jobs .
A range of common rights for all migrants in the EU should be drawn up , yet we must not lose sight of the fact that excessive ‘generosity ’ in granting further rights , such as the right to vote , may result in more resistance and be the source of unwanted xenophobia . - resolutely combating illegal immigration ; attempts must be made to put a stop to illegal immigration , if possible in the country of origin , and to problems relating to the economic exploitation of migrants .
A further salient point is that health services are intended for people in need and cannot therefore be compared with goods offered for sale ; this should therefore not be included in the general services directive .     .
This issue therefore needs a separate Commission proposal and should not be included in the general services directive .
Hail the ‘no’ votes in the French and Dutch referenda !     .
In other words , this is imperialism in action ...     .
Internally , European industry is undergoing a period of intensive reconstruction with jobs being lost and manufacturing units shutting down .
If we are to combat poverty effectively , we must create more and better jobs , and the quality of those jobs must be seen as no less important .
Including young people in the manufacturing sector will also help to modernise the economy .
We also hope that the ruling by the Constitutional Court can be implemented , which stated that certain energy conventions signed by the previous government with multinational companies were illegal , given that they had not been submitted for consultation to the Bolivian Parliament .
Its President’s frankness only serves to show in stark relief the truth hidden from Europe by its governments .
This new player does not want less Europe , but , rather , more and better Europe .
European leaders were not equal to the task that history had set them .
What social model should we follow ?
Europe can live without a Constitutional Treaty , but it is doubtful whether it could live without agreement on the Financial Perspective .
The debate on the European Constitution has , undeniably , seen the greatest democratisation in Europe’s history .
Parliament must be proactive and visible in the times ahead ; it must work in a network with the national parliaments ; political parties , local authorities and citizens ’ groups must play their part ; and the media must also become involved .
This victory paved the way for combating the increasingly neoliberal guidelines that have gradually been introduced in the EU in recent years , and that have ultimately been enshrined in the draft so-called European Constitution .
I therefore feel that , rather than appealing to the Members of this House , who might block the adoption of this common position , our overriding priorities should be common sense and the need to take this process forward .
I therefore urge common sense so that we can take this process forward .
This would widen the gap between the Members of the European Parliament and politicians in the Member States , when in fact their work and their day-to-day functions are similar , and this is something to which we are opposed .
The creation of a single ‘parliamentary salary ’ financed by the EU budget and subject to a Community tax , forms part of a federalist concept of the mandate of Members of the European Parliament , with a view to turning the current ‘national Member of the European Parliament ’ into a ‘European Member’ .
