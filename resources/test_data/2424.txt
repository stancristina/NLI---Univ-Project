role in supporting the two sides and the agreements which they conclude .
Finally , the French Presidency will ensure that Europe is able to do all it can , in a coherent and responsible manner , to help open a new round of negotiations , which we hope will be global and balanced negotiations , within the World Trade Organisation .
Finally , and this is my last point , Mr President , the partners , i .e . the Council and the Commission both agree that we need better monitoring of the implementation and efficiency of Community aid , especially by the General Affairs Council , which needs to play a more important role in steering the Union ' s external action .
I welcome Mr Dupuis ' frank and coherent amendments , which at least have the merit of calling a spade a spade .
It is precisely these advantages which the single diplomacy being proposed to us will devalue .
Since the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO ) was created at the beginning of the 1990s , Europe has taken its place as the biggest donor in the world .
I therefore feel that the question should perhaps be broached with greater flexibility .
But in this short speech , I want to focus on enlargement .
First , respect for the need for identity .
The conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council , which took place on 20 July , was , I think , very positive .
I would add - and of course this is important in our discussions - that it has been possible to earmark such a significant amount without having to revise the financial perspectives aimed at strengthening category 4 , as proposed by the Commission .
That is why it has accepted the amounts requested by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget for the framework programme for research and development as well as for the trans-European networks .
However I want to emphasise , as regards the MEDA programme , that the draft budget provides for an amount of EUR 701 million which is higher than the annual average allocation over the period 1995-1999 .
I wish to conclude this overview of the various categories of expenditure with the expenditure on pre-accession aid .
Just when attempts are being made to establish methods of funding to guarantee better , more permanent services , the monstrous burden of AIDS falls on communities already assailed by the economic crisis , underdevelopment , an inadequate health structure and the lack of a social security system .
Their effects are already apparent in the mother-child prevention programmes set up by UNAIDS and UNICEF.
We must urgently strengthen prevention programmes , improve the research effort geared to developing countries and give all patients real access to treatment .
Perhaps the round table of 28 September , organised by the Commission , in liaison with WHO and UNAIDS could be the first stage in setting that up ?
We would not be having this debate if triple therapy cost a dollar .
We will meet the challenge together .
This recommendation was received without comment as to the principle , the monitoring centre being perceived as a tool to assist restructuring , but debate arose around the work on its creation .
It must be organised so as to fulfil its missions , and in our opinion that means a light , flexible structure .
And it is always the workers who have to pay the price , never the shareholders .
In fact , the Commission has plenty of documentation available , and Eurostat can provide very interesting statistics on industrial evolution in Europe and beyond .
For that , two conditions seem indispensable .
I find that approach interesting .
In addition , the Council is constantly attentive to the rights of the child wherever issues relating to human rights are dealt with .
The stress will be on modernising the organisation of work , education for lifelong learning and raising the employment rate , especially for women .
The fact is , however , that we still have a few years to consider the matter .
In this respect , it specifies that the Commission is , in collaboration with the Member States , to carry out an assessment of the potential impact of the concessions on the economic and commercial interests of the European Union , and obviously the Council will not take a decision until it has consulted the results of this assessment .
In addition , the Feira European Council requested that the Commission submit a progress report to the Council on the work undertaken in this area .
The implementation of the reduction commitments agreed at the time of the 1994 Marrakech Accord is also scheduled for examination in the course of these negotiations , which are based on the principles outlined in Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture .
I can assure you of just one thing , Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , and that is that , as far as we are concerned , the financial perspectives , which were the product of tough negotiating in Berlin , represent a framework which it would be extremely difficult for us to shift .
The action plan for Albania to which you refer is a High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration action plan for Albania and the neighbouring region , adopted by the General Affairs Council on 13 and 14 June this year , intended , in effect , to define and coordinate European Union resources with a view to responding to the problems of asylum and migration in Albania and the neighbouring countries and , as such , it is not intended to promote the rights of any particular minority .
Examination of the situation in Chechnya will thus clearly be part of the assessment process
