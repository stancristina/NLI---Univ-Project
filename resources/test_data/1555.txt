goes against the spirit of the Treaties .
Establishing specific centralized systems , such as for the approval of active substances , benefits everybody .
For Mrs Sierra Gonz√°lez begins her report by talking about competitiveness .
Well , how effective are all these discussions we hold in this Parliament ?
What is the basic factor needed in order to plant the information society firmly within European society ?
And that is what I want the Commissioner to think about with us , although the idea is not new to her .
Nor must we forget what the information society will mean for training , now that we talk of life-long training or continuing training .
Superhighways , or motorways , often charge tolls - not in Germany , Madam Commissioner , but in other countries .
We know what we hope for : a British Presidency which believes strongly in Europe today , and is tenacious , optimistic and practical , with a sense of humour as well , if possible .
What are our suggestions ?
The European Parliament , on the other hand , is asking for a further ECU 4 for the budget out of every ECU 10 , 000 of the Community GNP ( that is , a total of ECU 131 ) , so that we can simultaneously tackle enlargement and solidarity .
It cannot threaten northern Cyprus , and be constantly opposed to human rights .
That is true .
And on 19 November this Parliament gave a few recipes , in its statement on the Treaty of Amsterdam , which Mrs Green reminded you of today .
Do you think the report by Mrs d'Ancona ( who is a member of your group ) addresses people 's concerns ?
You are right .
Europe is not just a market , Mr Cook .
It is a Mediterranean country with great human potential , which is asking for privileged relations with the European Union .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , it is a known fact that the self-exclusion of Spain , as decided by Mr Aznar , will result in unfair treatment for unemployed people in Spain .
Mr President , please give me some support .
I should , however , like to draw attention to one aspect of the report to which other colleagues have referred , and which seems to me to be fundamental : that in which the rapporteur , Mr Sainjon , suggests that social justice and sustainable development should be on a level with efficiency and economic stability .
But there is a Swedish company , Ericsson - and others following suit - which sell part of their production to small firms without guaranteeing the workers ' rights and without guaranteeing the workers ' future in that small firm .
I think that MPs are already fully aware of this .
That is , when making a temporary regulation into a permanent one , it would not make much sense to keep to the figures established initially , on the basis of a given situation which might have been valid in 1992 .
It could be said , perhaps , that since the amendments approved for the Canary Islands , numbers 5 to 8 , are so strictly drawn up , they might allow little margin for subsequent development .
I think that they help to allow for this flexibility in a regulation which is going to become permanent .
It is possible that the Commissariat could explain whether it has any ideas about this or , simply , if it is going to restrict itself to approving the amendments as they may be approved tomorrow by the Plenary session of Parliament .
As the traditional basis of these peoples ' economies , such specialisation should be respected and consolidated .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , the measures proposed for this regulation are simply the updating and continuation of those adopted in 1994 and 1995 within the framework of the POSEIMA , POSEIDOM and POSEICAN programmes .
You can already see , Madam President , that all the political groups and countries support your proposal .
That is why I consider it necessary - as the Commission recognises - to maintain this kind of aid in the future as well .
Asylum is a basic human right .
However , when political union is fully achieved this right will only be necessary in terms of nationals from third countries .
Perhaps we should also mention that there has been competition since the treaties , that is to say competition to shape the internal market .
In this case , as in so many others , the best authority is the one which does not have to take action but may initiate the action process .
No longer do we have the big six , but now even less than that and recently we have often had occasion to listen to or read such news in the media - which does not affect the Green Paper ; they are questions concerning the Department of Competition in the Commission and , certainly too , it is the Commission 's task to monitor the strict application of the Treaties .
However , the Commission needs to address the problem of how to establish or guarantee such independence , particularly in relation to legal services since , the legal adviser is an independent professional but one who is partisan , who is within the company , who has his own interests .
It is certain that the measures taken by the Government - in the case of the massacre at Acteal and the events in Ocosingo - are an attempt to restore confidence and the country 's credibility , within the limits of the legal system and the rule of law , under which all subjects must be seen as equal , beginning with the Government and ending with the citizens .
