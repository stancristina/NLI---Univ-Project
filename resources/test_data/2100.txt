, on eco-labelling of construction materials and , on the other , on drawing up lists of hazardous places of work and on setting up environmental ambulances .     . – The health effects of environmental pollution are of fundamental concern to society , and a broad commitment to this issue is important .
Unfortunately , this is not the case with the present Action Plan .
By way of conclusion , it is very important that the Commission , on the one hand , clarifies what total sums are to be released to fund the Action Plan and , on the other hand , explains whether it believes that a new financial instrument is required to fund it .
Whilst contributing economic resources in the form of development aid to poor countries , the European Union is preventing these countries from achieving growth through its bizarre agricultural and trade policies .
In the EU , special national interests are still too dominant .
It is worth putting this into an historical perspective .
Labour had moved to better paid jobs in the engineering industry , and what remained of the textile and clothing industry had moved on to more advanced products .
No unemployment had resulted , and the trade unions had played an active part in the structural change .
At that time , the surviving Swedish textile and clothing enterprises moved a large proportion of their production to low-wage countries such as Finland and , in time , Portugal , but kept their design and marketing operations in Sweden .
We have had ten years to adapt .
Even though certain limits are imposed in this directive , the fundamental conflict remains .
At first reading of the proposal , Denmark and Sweden registered their reservations , as we are concerned about the directive adversely affecting the level of consumer protection where Member States have stricter national legislation , as does Sweden in this case .
This is currently governed by the Television without Frontiers Directive which , in turn , is in danger of being fully harmonised as a result of this proposal for a directive .
That is why we ought to have had a stricter proposal with regard to advertising aimed at children .     Mr President , I am very pleased that the basic , underlying idea concerning how we are to achieve better development in Europe is now the knowledge-based economy .
It is good that the social sciences are included in this connection .
We see how , in the current situation , large numbers of people are leaving research for other jobs because they find it impossible to carve out careers and create good bases for family life , given the rules and conditions we lay down for them .
The general trend in all the Member States is for this to go down instead of up .
It is a nice idea to export old fishing vessels , but it would not work .
On the contrary , both Indonesia and Sri Lanka have declined such offers .
In addition , a conference of regional fishing organisations met last week in Sumatra , with representatives from all the countries affected .
That is what we must help them with .
Can you see that the emperor has no clothes and scrap this proposal ?
If an amount similar to the total cost were spent on manufacturing boats locally , the benefit to local fisheries would be many times greater .
How should we handle distribution and allocation ?
Fourthly : do the countries intended as recipients of these boats really want them ?
It could undoubtedly be improved by adopting the amendments , especially those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance .
Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives , millions lost close relatives or their livelihoods .
The proposal to help countries hit by the tsunami by giving them vessels from the EU is therefore morally commendable , but the measure would be a drop in the ocean , making the proposal almost absurd .
There is a tendency for forces within the EU to use disasters to advance their own positions .
I object to the use of international tragedies for the purpose of giving the EU new powers .
This resolution was adopted by the UN Security Council .
The UN is , and must remain , engaged in international issues .
We object to this development and recommend that there be national foreign policies , together with international cooperation within the UN.
The proposal bans unfair commercial practices .
We have chosen to vote in favour of the proposal .
In addition , there is good cause to question whether sending vessels from EU Member States to the countries hit by the tsunami is the most appropriate way of helping .
On the other hand , I do not believe that transferring fishing boats , as put forward in the proposal for a regulation , is the right way to proceed .
Each Member State should be free to conduct its own industrial policy within the framework of competition law .
The June List is of the opinion , however , that each Member State must be permitted to decide for itself how it wants to achieve a good working environment .
We have ten new Member States that are very dependent indeed upon energy imports from Russia .
At the same time , energy prices are rising .
We have enormous problems with energy networks .
The European Union has described what are known as the TEN projects as being incredibly important , but we see how , in area after area , they come to a standstill and do not develop at the rate anticipated in the original decisions .
All in all , we are thus in an extremely worrying situation .
We must ensure that the TEN projects work
