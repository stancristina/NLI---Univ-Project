that we must also be able to solve common problems and that we must also have sufficient contact with each other to allow a dialogue , so that we can say the things that need to be said .
This place existed a week ago in Brussels , but it makes no difference whether it is in Copenhagen or Brussels .
We had the dialogue , the necessary things were said and Mr Patten was a witness .
Mr Nielson has confirmed this today .
With regard to Mr Zakayev , who is currently in custody in Denmark , I should like to tell Mr Dupuis that the Zakayev case is being dealt with entirely in accordance with the principles of the rule of law , in accordance with European extradition rules and in accordance with our established policy on combating terrorism .
Everything has been done by the book .
The same applies , moreover , to the holding of the conference which created the conflict between Denmark and Russia .
That is not something we can prevent , and we stand by that right , just as we have held firm in all other aspects to our democratic ideals .
Of course not .
We are in agreement on the fight against terrorism , but we are not in agreement in our appraisal of what has gone on , and is still going on , in Chechnya , and this was stated very , very clearly .
A solution was successfully found to the Kaliningrad problem , and one which respected the sovereignty of Lithuania and Lithuania 's right to accede to Schengen .
The fact that we managed to solve a problem in the region around us in this way is very important for enlargement .
So nothing was forgotten .
Everything was done by the book of democracy .
I would like , however , to end by saying that it is important for Parliament to hold fast to its ideals and take the Council to task if there is a risk of our not doing the same .
I do not , however , think that there is any reason to admonish the Council or the Presidency for the way in which they handled this very difficult summit which has just taken place .
I would just like to repeat to Lord Bethell that not a single political decision has been taken in Denmark concerning the imprisonment of Mr Zakayev.
A judge has decided that Mr Zakayev is to remain in custody for a further period , but if it proves that the charges brought have no basis , then naturally he will be released again .
That is how the judicial system works , and Lord Bethell can be certain that the Danish legal system functions in accordance with all the principles that we uphold in this Union .
This caused great concern in the democratic world and led to much condemnation .
On 14 August last year , General Musharraf published his so-called ' Road Map To Democracy ' , which described how he proposed to comply with the decision of the Pakistan Supreme Court and restore democracy in Pakistan .
This was to take place in October/November this year .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Cushnahan for the great work that he and the other members of the Mission carried out in this connection .
We have noted in particular the report 's criticism of the circumstances in the run-up to the actual elections , especially the constitutional amendments introduced by President Musharraf this summer .
There were unequal opportunities to conduct election campaigns and unequal access to resources and to the media , and there were reports of manipulation in connection with the elections .
Taken together , these factors gave cause for concern .
Throughout the process , the EU has conducted an ongoing dialogue with Pakistan concerning the reintroduction of democracy and , in the course of this , has also had the opportunity to express criticism of factors which have moved in the wrong direction .
Negotiations are not yet complete .
The EU and Pakistan issued a joint declaration on signing the cooperation agreement between the EU and Pakistan in Islamabad on 24 November last year .
In the same declaration , Pakistan also confirmed its commitment to the restoration of democracy in accordance with the said Road Map , something which was welcomed by the EU.
The conditions are thus in place for taking the agreement further .
It is crucial to state that implementation of the cooperation agreement does not rubber-stamp Pakistan 's democracy .
As I have mentioned , there are many things that we might wish were different , as can be seen from Mr Cushnahan 's report .
The agreement includes an initial paragraph in which the parties to the agreement confirm their respect for human rights .
The Council will continue to expand the dialogue with Pakistan with a view to helping strengthen Pakistan 's democracy .
Can it be true that I did not even mention Mr Cushnahan 's criticisms ?
I would like to reiterate my thanks to Mr Cushnahan for the fact that he drew attention to these fundamental faults in the democratic process so clearly .
That is not a backward-looking sentence ; rather , it states that despite everything , we are talking about the step from pure dictatorship to something that is less pure dictatorship , that is , something that also has a democratic element , even with all the criticism that can otherwise be mentioned .
But I think it is important to establish - for the sake of future election observers as well - that the EU 's observers act entirely independently of the Council .
Thus a declaration by them is also entirely independent
