euro will have a major impact not only on the eleven participating nations , but also on those watching from the sidelines .
Denmark will shortly be voting on the Treaty of Amsterdam .
That is a decision made by the people of Denmark .
We are voting in favour .
Madam President , I feel like someone standing on the quayside waving farewell to the beautiful , unsinkable Titanic .
I sincerely hope that those in command on the bridge do not keep on squabbling until the ship sinks .
The truly perilous voyage begins in the year 2002 , when the life belts are to be cast away .
The euro is a dangerous experiment leading to the necessary international collaboration for hatred , and my group has today voted against it .
Which textbook says that a monetary union performs best in terms of monetary and foreign exchange policy alone ?
For the sake of the eleven nations , I do hope the experiment succeeds .
But common sense tells us that the EMU in its present guise will either founder when it meets market forces , or it will have to be backed up by a political union with a common government determining income policy , fiscal policy and all other economic policies , meting out precise doses to benefit the people of Europe .
When currency union was adopted , there were 12 million unemployed .
We now have more than 18 million out of work , so if currency union is to be called a success , there must be something wrong with the yardstick .
The reasons for this are many and varied and time does not permit me to elaborate on many of them here , but two matters are of particular importance to me .
I still have a serious problem with the patenting of genes .
I can agree with the idea of taking out a patent on the information concerning a very specific application of the gene , but only for that particular application .
My other concern is that the Council 's common position undermines the ability of developing countries to protect the wealth of nature in their countries , and , not least , the moneymaking potential of this .
Ensuring that this principle is adhered to is a straightforward matter .
This is an effective way of safeguarding the interests of developing countries .
I simply cannot accept the argument that a requirement such as this could be contrary to the TRIPs agreement .
In the forthcoming negotiations on this agreement , the European Union must work towards safeguarding the interests of developing countries , and this House must ensure that in these negotiations , the Commission has a clear position in favour of the Convention on Biodiversity and a fair distribution of income from the wealth of nature in the developing countries .
Today we have a proposal that takes far greater consideration of animal protection , humanitarian and ethical issues .
Many are pumped with chemicals all their lives without ever finding a real solution to their suffering .
Even though it is already a part of the text , I do support the amendment clarifying informed consent .
In my view , the Santer European Group on Ethics seems a bit dubious .
Naturally , we welcome the promise of transparency , but I would rather have a right to transparency than be assured of it as a favour by the President of the Commission .
Mr President , despite the legal guidance underlying the proposal , its actual legal basis is still in question .
That is still made up of politicians .
I would be amazed to find that the tobacco industry is alone among commercial activities failing to make contact with new customer groups through its advertising .
They maintain that they are only endeavouring to persuade established smokers to change brands .
There is already legislation banning tobacco advertising on television .
Tobacco is manufactured legally like many other products that cannot be given unrestricted coverage - medicines , weapons and poisons , for instance .
That is one of the reasons why I have always been against EU financial support of tobacco production .
We do not subsidize imported tobacco , after all .
ECU 1 billion towards tobacco production and a mere ECU 11.2 million to combat cancer !
It is good to see European Parliament amendments incorporated into the common position .
Even today , the majority of countries have to purify their drinking water either by proper technical or straightforward chemical treatment .
However , the problem of monitoring water is that we only find what we are measuring for .
I also believe it is important for drinking water to be free of hormone-like substances , as mentioned by Ken Collins .
We are living in a time when agriculture , in particular , has to take responsibility for its use of chemical substances and the consequences this has on natural resources .
I am glad that the reference to water as a commodity has been removed from the common position .
I concur with the chairman of the committee in advocating that Member States should produce a plan to replace lead pipes and taps for domestic water supplies within the next five years , and it is also my belief that more rapid implementation of the directive will be required .
Mr President , on the whole I can concur with the comments of the previous two speakers - the rapporteur of the Socialist group and the chairman of the committee .
Looking at the world situation in this area , an incredible number of children die because they really are not able to get adequate , clean water , which is critical to their development .
As the previous speaker said , in a very large part of Europe , it is not to be taken for granted
