scientific documentation on the application of the precautionary principle and , hence , the need to review the data and to keep it under regular review , as well as the need for reporting to the European Parliament .
Worrying theories have been put forward on the possible harmful health effects of exposure to artificially produced fields , and a debate is under way concerning the existence of possible long-term effects , first and foremost cancer , and particularly cancer of the blood , leukaemia .
In conclusion , Mr President , I believe that it is absolutely crucial for further high-level studies to be conducted on long-term exposure , on the one hand so as to protect the public and , on the other , to avoid panic and unemployment .
We must ensure that the limited scope that does exist , in terms of both competence and resources , is harnessed to achieve maximum results in terms of cooperation , information exchanges , identification of best practice , and health education - as has already been done under the various specific programmes and the 1993 framework programme .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the communication on the development of public health in the European Community will probably be the last major health policy issue on which Parliament expresses an opinion before the end of this parliamentary term .
It is crucial , however , that the Commission should present as soon as possible detailed , concrete proposals for the next five years , taking Parliament 's wishes into account .
Colleagues have already referred to the lack of action over the European health passport , the fact that health funding remains utterly inadequate , and that even after the BSE scare , insufficient attention is being paid to the linkage between health and food .
One fundamental aspect here is to recognise Parliament 's role in determining and controlling the health budget .
I would merely say in conclusion that , since we are approaching the European Decade for Health - from 2000 to 2010 - I hope that the Needle report , which we support , will generate renewed and reinforced interest in public health .
The United States is now triggering a fully-fledged trade war , which could do serious damage not only to vital export sectors in the Community - and particularly in Italy - but also to transatlantic relations in general .
We learned a few days ago that the German Government , which had been calling more loudly than any other for a new method of cofinancing the common agricultural policy , has withdrawn its proposal .
All the Commission can do is encourage both parties to resolve the problem and maintain contact with the governments involved .
This is just to explain that although , strictly speaking , the matter is not within the Commission 's competence , we are working to ensure that the acquis communautaire is applied , as it should be in all cases .
I am a full-time commissioner and I will act as a commissioner , full-time , as is my duty .
The Commission 's survey of ports is most useful here , considering that public funding also benefits many non-Mediterranean ports , albeit indirectly .
The desire for cultural integration in Europe also means becoming conscious of the European cultural area .
Knowledge and understanding of our architectural heritage are therefore key factors in determining our cultural identity and bear witness to our origins and our history .
There is a risk that agricultural reform will be confined to a mere cost-cutting exercise , rather than aiming for quality production and safeguarding the certificate of origin , the sole guarantee that a product is typical and meets consumer demands .
I also concur that an agreement , compromise or meeting of minds must be found in Berlin .
Ways to boost employment include the promotion of more liberal labour market policies , progress concerning Mr Monti 's proposals , the exclusion of public expenditure and investment from the deficit , and fiscal policy harmonisation : none of these subjects have been mentioned this morning .
The deal must therefore be clinched immediately , and it must be a tough one with peace as its goal .
Scientists tell us - albeit still without total certainty - how hazardous both high and low-frequency electromagnetic waves are to human health ; and yet the Commission simply denies the existence of any such danger , thereby reneging on its duty pursuant to Article 130r of the Treaties to formulate policies to protect human health .
The very thought that the profits of telecommunications companies might be dented is a deadly sin to you , the priests of the god Market .
Our assistance has been vital to the survival of the Palestinian Authority and also to the life of the Palestinian people , especially in Gaza , a tiny patch of land where a million people live as if in a sort of concentration camp .
Even though our assistance has been granted under extremely difficult and quite abnormal economic circumstances , it must continue .
Now , however , we must ask one more thing of the Palestinians , and this is the key point of my resolution .
But an initiative is required from the EU , the USA and Russia , and this is the most useful thing that can be done at present for the Middle East peace process .
The first fundamental mistake would therefore be for Europe to think that the Mediterranean area can be confined to countries which resemble it to a greater or lesser extent : the multifarious array of cultures and political systems cannot be narrowed down artificially .
Allow me at this point to quote a highly authoritative speaker from the Islamic world , President Khatami of Iran , whom it would be absurd to ignore .
