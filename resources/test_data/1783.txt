.
I also welcome Commissioner Bolkestein' s dynamic approach in this respect .
The European Community will need to carve itself a role in the increasing cooperation between Member States in collating data and exchanging expertise and best practices .
Sweden is greatly affected by the excise level in Denmark which , in turn , is greatly influenced by Germany .
The government should not act as a moralist and the moderate use of alcohol poses no problem whatsoever , of course .
Sweden has requested more time to adapt its alcohol policy .
The Commission is of the opinion that it is not advisable to make reference to general issues , such as the connection between alcohol policy and health policy or the need to aim for more coordination of excise levels on alcohol , within the context of a proposal on derogations applied by one Member State .
I would especially like to stress once again that the public health aspect which Mr Maaten mentioned is , of course , important .
All countries , all EU Member States have alcohol-related problems , and know about alcohol-related problems , and all EU Member States are adopting an anti-alcohol policy .
The Commission might wish it had , but it has not .
In this way , Finland is bracing itself for 2004 when travellers will be able to bring alcoholic beverages for their own use from other Member States for free , in line with the internal market principles .
With regard to the restrictions on imports from third countries , I would like to note that it is the first time that Finland is requesting a derogation .
Madam President , the entry into force of the internal market and the lifting of border controls have led to the abolition of VAT declarations along with the statistics which used to be kept by customs offices .
The number of codes is restricted and , as such , the classification and codification of goods by companies is simplified without them needing to take any special measures .
These then degenerate into all-out bingeing sessions , at which point the cameras start to roll .
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his proposal in which we will be given the opportunity to exchange ideas here with Parliament which is , after all , eminently suited to express its opinion on this matter .
I hope that the Commission can give me a clear answer to it .
Anyone who has different ideas about Europe or who would like to increase the pompe afrique , the money pump from the taxpayer to the European political parties , should have the courage to stand up and speak out , but you are lacking this courage .
A large part of the resolution is taken up by non-military crisis management , and this is very much how it should be , in my opinion .
I would like to make one final point .
I would like to stress that we should not be guided by power motives .
And as far as we are concerned , these are still mainly within the national state .
This seems extremely illogical to me and leads me to believe that this development is not taken altogether seriously .
This means therefore that the Council must make this possible and that the personnel and budget required for this should be adequate .
The European Parliament should also gain greater influence on military action through the budget and proper accountability through the Council .
But all too often the Council puts to one side what has been decided within the European Parliament , by consensus or not , as the case may be .
Cologne and Helsinki have added substance to the common European security and defence policy .
What does autonomous mean in relation to NATO ?
This mainly relates to the government .
Beijing +5 also had to incorporate a number of new issues into the text , which it did , after a hard fight .
In my opinion , we have three tasks within the European Union .
It is the most atrocious form of violence perpetrated against women .
The distribution in care , actions against trafficking in women and empowerment of women are important issues to me .
The other point I wanted to raise is the opposition from the Islamic and Asian countries with regard to women ' s rights , in connection with which they refer to the sharia .
Mr President , the World Conference on Women , which was held five years ago , meant a breakthrough at the time in the worldwide recognition of women ' s rights as an area of human rights autonomy and empowerment .
The true inspiration which I gained from last week ' s conference in New York lay in the power of the international women ' s movement which , contrary to popular belief , is as vigorous and alive as ever and is also bolstered by a new generation of young women who , strong and well-informed , stand up for all kinds of issues .
Why is Europe silent about human rights in Tunisia ?
Tunisia calls itself a democracy , a democracy without opposition that is , without freedom of the press , without fair judicial processes and with torture and the elimination of political prisoners and their families .
If the European Union keeps quiet any longer , it will be partly responsible for the human rights violations in Tunisia .
He is quite right in asking the Council for real action because the EU' s own credibility as a partner of the association agreement with Tunisia is in the balance .
At the end of the day , we rely on goodwill and , if that is not there , we might as well forget it .
