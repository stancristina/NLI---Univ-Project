Firstly , from 2011 , all flights within the EU will be included in the system .
At the last conference of the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) in September , we faced strong opposition from many third countries regarding our plans to include all aircraft in the trading system , regardless of nationality .
The proposal is in line with the Chicago Convention and the bilateral aviation agreements .
Given the forecasts of rapid growth in air transport , this will have a considerable environmental effect .
In the period before 2013 , a percentage of the air transport emission rights will be made available by auction , in line with the percentage auctioned to other sectors .
Ladies and gentlemen , combating climate change is now the EU 's highest priority .
Europe has a duty to play a leading role , but must do so in a way that does not provoke its international partners .
The programme brings out the need to adopt measures in the transport sector that are more environmentally friendly ; it highlights the Strategic EU Energy Review , the suppression of biodiversity and the marine environment strategy .
We Europeans should also practise what we are constantly preaching .
Lastly , I must mention the Health Services Directive .
Under what conditions will the free movement of patients and health professionals be permitted ?
Mr President , the number of non attached Members may be increased at any time , owing to unforeseen events .
They should produce useful results , not only at the time of legislation or amendment , but also under changing circumstances in the future .
While these cover a wide range of policy areas , they frequently touch up on land-planning and environmental issues .
The first of these is a recent development : the visits the Commission makes to places where a particular problem has arisen .
Those of you who managed to hear the radio programmes last week about the activity of the Committee on Petitions will have understood how important it is that you should give those submitting petitions a personal hearing in the presence of all the necessary experts .
You must surely have foreseen that at this point I would answer by referring to our recent communication on the enforcement of Community law , entitled ' A Europe of Results ' .
The document will put all this to use in the environment sector , which , as I understand from your report , is one of the sectors you are most concerned with .
Systematic cooperation leads to a better exchange of information and hence an improvement in the level of service offered to our citizens in all sectors .
I now feel vindicated and satisfied that my report has been approved by the Committee on Regional Development and enjoys the support of all the political groups .
The European Parliament expects the Commission to examine , at least within the scope of such a communication , a number of proposals contained in the report .
Thirdly , the European Commission should ensure that more funds are allocated to public information and the training of professionals dealing with earthquakes .
Lastly , the Barnier proposal should be revived .
Let me conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation , and also my fellow Members in all political groups who have improved my original proposal through their interventions and amendments .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission , and I personally , wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Vakalis , for this extremely informative and valuable report .
Not only did we have the largest single mobilisation of the EU civil protection mechanism to fight the Greek forest fires , but two new legislative measures on civil protection were adopted : the financial instrument for civil protection , and a revised European civil protection mechanism .
For these reasons , in 2008 the Commission will develop a complete initiative to improve disaster prevention generally .
The new regulation has almost doubled the funds available .
The events of last summer have shown that although the EU civil protection response was impressive , there is still room for improvement .
Mr President , earthquakes are inevitable , but protective shielding measures can be taken to minimise death and destruction and to allow people to enjoy greater safety .
As regards new construction , the quality of materials and the reliability of builders ' must be verified , as human lives are sometimes disregarded in the interests of greater profit , as we know from earthquakes in Greece .
This is the people 's money .
In an earthquake , you can only hope to have God on your side .
We can therefore bypass the regulations .
The Commission supports the approval of the report on the regional impact of earthquakes .
Lastly , let me remind you , ladies and gentlemen , that on 22 and 23 November , the Commission is holding its second civil protection forum in Brussels .
Once again let me congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Vakalis , on his excellent report .
Here we are giving money in order to vaunt our humanitarianism , while at the same time our foreign policy marginalises 1.5 million people both economically and socially , giving them no hope of improvement in the future .
The moral lesson of this should be that humanitarian aid without a realistic foreign policy makes no sense : the two go hand in hand .
They want an election before the opposition is out of prison and Mr Ahsan , President of the Supreme Court Bar Association , is released from house arrest .
I find it impossible to disassociate developments in Pakistan and Kashmir from those in Afghanistan .
It took a leading role on the international scene and a constructive position with regard to our
