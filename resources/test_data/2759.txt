As we said a long time ago , along with Gorbachev , human rights are an end in themselves .
But it does not propose the export of a eurocentric political order .
I therefore call on the Commission to respond to the practical proposals set out in this report .
I would even go so far as to say that the promotion of human rights , democratic values , the rule of law , good governance and the fight against corruption should become essential elements of any future agreement .
But in addition to all of these problems , I would draw particular attention to the fight against corruption and good governance as essential elements that all cooperation and development agreements with third countries should contain .
If genocide took place in Rwanda or war is still raging in Angola it is only thanks to certain European countries and their leaders .
We cannot continue to let these wrongdoers benefit .
When it comes to human rights we should not forget or underestimate the importance of social rights .
Mr President , in its descriptive aspect this report has two sides .
But rarely do they dig deeper to comment on the alarming rates of HIV contamination , or outbreaks of hepatitis or TB.
When we think that 4 111 of those prisoners are being held on remand , many of them for periods longer than is desirable or stipulated by the law , then we must agree with the rapporteur when he talks about abuse of remand by the judicial system as one of the main causes of prison overpopulation , a measure that ought to be an exception but has actually turned into the rule .
We are not verifying whether or not the Commission has correctly exercised its mandate in accounting terms .
I would like to state quite unequivocally that the Commission must not and cannot be allowed to dictate what Parliament can and cannot do .
On 9 November the European Union explicitly condemned as totally unacceptable Iraq 's decision on 31 October to cease all cooperation with UNSCOM , and supported the United Nations Security Council 's response to that decision - United Nations Security Council Resolution 1205 .
Lastly , on behalf of the Commission , I would like to emphasise the very laudable efforts of the Moldovan authorities to consolidate democracy and develop the market economy , even in circumstances which everyone recognises are extremely difficult .
The second victims are tomorrow 's sportsmen and women : our children .
Furthermore , it also believes that it is important , as a matter of urgency , to attack some of the underlying causes , such as the excessive commercialisation of sport , which are often at the root of this scourge .
At that meeting , Commissioner Oreja announced that he would be participating in the World Conference on doping to be held in Lausanne .
Two projects are already being financed under the framework programme on research to the tune of ECU 2 million : one is a study involving research into growth hormones , which is a key issue today in the battle against doping , and the other is a research study in conjunction with the International Olympic Committee 's Medical Commission on methods of standardisation to enhance the validity of tests , particularly in court .
The Commission considers that for the time being there is no need for legislative action .
I believe that we are on the right path and that this action will be translated into concrete and positive results , as we will not relent in combating doping in sport and sport will always prevail over those who try to breach its rules .
It is not unusual , and I include the United States in this , for some persons under arrest not to be fully aware of their rights and for the provisions of the Vienna Treaty not to be applied , which is a serious matter and could lead to a judgment being annulled .
The European Union has contributed ECU 73 million this year alone to this operation .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , I shall not try to analyse those issues on which there is general agreement and which others have already touched upon , such as the general nature of the action plan or the limited innovations it contains , the need to launch projects based on genuine and diverse partnerships , the urgent need for an overarching vision of the fight against racism , the need for education starting at school , the urgent need for awareness-raising and information campaigns , or , lastly , the need to evaluate legislative progress made at Member State level or the urgency of guaranteeing proper legal support for victims .
Also , the Commission has been working intensively this year to prepare the ground for the entry into force of Article 13 of the new Treaty .
Building on this work , the Commission is greatly looking forward to presenting legislative proposals to combat racial discrimination in 1999 .
Whereas in his report Mr McMahon considers that a transitional solution based on the Rhine Agreement is necessary , the Commission believes that this is impractical and indeed unhelpful .
I would accordingly like to stress the importance of this agreement if we are to achieve the objective of transparency in the legislative process .
We also believe that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality should be applied objectively , but not in such a way as to rule out dynamism and flexibility , the need for which is reiterated in the Amsterdam protocol .
Output and trade have grown continuously , prices have fallen and there has been an extraordinary increase in the variety of goods and services on offer .
We also need to attack the delay - and even obstruction -
