It calls for all settlement procedures to be frozen , including the natural increase in the population and it calls on the Member States to propose that the UN Security Council send observers and take a stand in favour of the creation of a Palestinian state .

Fleecing the workforce , insecurity , expensive private care , commercialising the pension system , poverty and social exclusion .
That is what is in store for the workers , while big business , which demands that the social security system be sacrificed in order to safeguard its competitiveness , can look forward to a more robust , completely unaccountable and hugely profitable future .
The Greek workers have said the first resounding and steadfast "no " to the poverty and insecurity in store for them .

I think that then we would all stand to benefit .
However , the questions which we need to address from now on , as Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro have clearly stressed in their report , are important questions such as the separation of powers , the role of the European parliaments , the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and the future of the common foreign policy ; questions which we shall be addressing between now and the Summit in Laeken and beyond , questions which will link future summits with the outcome of Nice .
The report under discussion today applauds the anti-democratic and reactionary provisions of the Treaty of Nice and lobbies for even more anti-democratic arrangements , such as the abolition of the veto and various other issues , the integration of foreign policy and defence and security policy , the inclusion of fundamental anti-grass roots rights in the Treaty and the facility to circumvent national parliaments by creating a special convention to table a proposal for a constitution .
I should just like to say briefly that the Nice Summit was held against a background of total indifference on the part of the citizens of Europe , despite the fact that it has serious repercussions for them , and total indifference on the part of the governments towards the citizens of Europe .
Having said which , here we are , post Nice , and I think that the European Parliament can help take us in a new direction ; one step could be making up the huge democratic deficit and taking part in constitutional procedures and another could be moving towards certain policies to benefit the citizens of Europe .
This is the simple , crude and cynical way in which acute environmental problems are dealt with by the European Union which , with its bombing of Yugoslavia and its depleted uranium bombs , has inflicted incalculable damage on valuable natural resources , not to mention all the other disasters .
Does the House not think that the European Union , which claims to be fighting for the environment , should review its position on and fund these projects ?
It was a stubborn , time-consuming and difficult report due to its sheer size and the number of specialist topics which it covers .
It proposes ways of improving expenditure commitments , useful and necessary addenda , simplifications designed to make the provisions of the new regulation clear and transparent and , finally , it strengthens the responsibility of financial agents without touching their independence or autonomy .
I think that it is our duty to insist on a proper dialogue on mutual terms and on an equal footing with the Commission and the Council within the conciliation procedure .
That is why I too agree that Parliament should only vote on the amendments tomorrow .
Until now , employment strategies , guidelines and recommendations have been of a strictly national nature .
A mere 0.4 % .
There are pension problems and insurance problems and regulations on movements of workers and their pensions need to work better and faster , as we have already heard .
Parliament is supporting the Commission in this endeavour , as it has done since 1993 , as can be seen from this year 's budget , which is in the order of EUR 13 million .
We are currently studying the possibility of extending the range of services to both jobseekers and employers .
Finally , I think it is worth mentioning that the legal basis for EURES needs to be revised , so that EURES can be adapted and improved to meet the future demands on these services .
We all know that the terrorists are from Kosovo , an area under NATO control , which alone is responsible for what is happening in the FYROM.
It is high time we addressed appalling cases such as the Dutroux case in Belgium , where the inadequate legal framework means that it is still impossible to prove the constituent elements of the crime and hold the trial which has been pending for the last four years , which is why the Union initiative to stamp out this vile crime and create a common reference framework to strengthen judicial and police cooperation between the Member States and bring these criminal syndicates to justice is all the more important .
As far as crimes relating to child pornography are concerned , we have proposed that importing , exporting , purchasing , selling and advertising , and not just producing , distributing and disseminating child pornography should be criminal offences .
This is another innovation which we have proposed .
I am well aware that promoting legislative arrangements is not the only solution .
As far as I can see , the main reason for this is because the capitalist system commercialises culture and because huge interests , which may appear to be legal or which are downright illegal , are therefore involved in the sale of stolen cultural objects .
Culture is a collective creation by society and no
