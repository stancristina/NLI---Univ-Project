The second message was that we needed an effective regulation without unnecessary red tape and , on the other hand , a regulation which would help to put the money of European citizens to good use .
As rapporteur for the general regulation , I call on my honourable friends here today to accept this text and to say yes for the following basic reasons : Parliament , during the course of negotiations on the financial perspective , secured an additional EUR 300 million for transnational and interregional cooperation .
Despite the Council 's initial resistance , monitoring committees will also be attended by environmental partners , non-governmental organisations and other bodies which represent civil society .
In other words , we achieved what we have for years referred to as the 'greening ' of the Structural Funds .
This obligation includes submitting a special list of the towns selected in order to address the relevant problems .
I would refer by way of example to the British Presidency 's bonuses , which have somewhat altered the cohesive logic of the regulation .
Today we are moving from theory to practice .
Parliament will be present throughout this procedure in order to monitor and to call for structural movements for the benefit always of the poorer Member States and regions of the European Union .     – Mr President , the structural policy of the European Union , as applied today , has limited results because , basically , it is the expression of the social policy of the economic model of free competition derived from the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies .
Let us not forget that the European Commission of the Europe of the 15 looked mainly to satisfy the wishes of the old Member States when it came to how appropriations were apportioned and how the contributions of each Member State were calculated .
This means that we cannot cofinance the packages in order to get them .
It is a gift that is no gift .
It is particularly important that the European Parliament managed , through long and difficult negotiations , to introduce important qualitative changes to the texts of the regulations , changes which will help to improve the quality of life of the citizens and to create actions and plans which will not result in divergence , changes which promote sustainable development and the democratisation of procedures to apply the funds through an enlarged partnership and the participation of representatives of civil society .
It is very important , therefore , to have decentralised , flexible procedures with as little red tape as possible which ensure that these resources reach end users in less developed regions in the old and new Member States and are not refunded to the rich countries .     – I did not vote ( abstained ) on the amended Hatzidakis report , because in it Parliament basically departs from its initial positions on all the major issues and countersigns the Council 's common position , which weakens regional and social cohesion policies .
In other words : - the resources available have been reduced from 0.41 % for the period 2000-2006 to 0.37 % for the period 2007-2013 .
The resources of the Structural Funds are being channelled to sectors which are of interest to the profitability of capital and , at the same time , 'crumbs ' are being given in order to 'defuse ' grassroots indignation and bring the working and grassroots class movement under control .
The promotion of technological research and the acquisition of scientific knowledge are the major challenge facing Europe in the 21st century .
This finding could very soon be proven in the following four lines of action : - by constantly upgrading the infrastructure of and action by educational institutes and research centres , given that the driving force behind development is the acquisition of knowledge by man ; - by disseminating scientific knowledge in the field of production , by redefining both the infrastructure and workers ' skills and qualifications ; - by applying a policy to increase jobs and to redistribute income fairly , given that high productivity and poverty result in recession and unemployment ; - by fundamentally reducing working times , so that workers can regain their creative spirit and redress the balance lost between work and family life .
Point one : small - and medium-sized companies need to be networked with large companies and industry .
Consequently , such joint ventures could have huge advantages both for small and large companies .
Because , among other things , I consider that we need to seriously examine the promotion of open European competitions in line with the corresponding American model .
The rapporteur , whom I honestly congratulate on the composite presentation of her report , therefore justifiably points out that , despite the fact that the European institutions recognise the vital importance of promoting research and innovation , the European Union as a whole is still failing to make adequate use of its potential , either in terms of human resources or in terms of funding capacity .
Alongside state financing , the proper management of Community financial resources and financing mechanisms by the Commission and access to loans from the European Investment Bank is expected to safeguard an increase in research activities , especially by small and medium-sized companies .
The arrival of subscriber television in the life of citizens has radically changed its social role .
Finally , what is being done about the list of sports which the Member States must propose and notify to the competent committee of the European Union , for which broadcasting on free rather than subscriber television is mandatory ?     – Commissioner , punitive dismissals of workers are becoming general practice .
In our opinion , the new employment
