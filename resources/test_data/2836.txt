particularly sharp economic and social crisis .
My group , which is in favour of retaining the ceiling at 1.27 % , therefore considers that in order to make possible the essential enlargement towards the east , the European Union must accept the budget framework as it stands , must call for intergovernmental cooperation and restrict itself to the development of a limited number of those common policies which are the most effective , in accordance with the famous principle of subsidiarity .
And what arrogance there is in the political criteria imposed on these countries .
But to enlarge our Union is also to wonder about the impact of enlargement .
Finally , and I will finish on this point , Mr President , third precondition , we must define our political project : the "acquis communautaire ' is also a project in the area of defence .
Let us make no mistake .
The path towards a successful enlargement is a difficult one and the achievement of the financial aspect is an essential factor .
Hence this basic premise and own resources ceiling of 1.27 % which governs the overall thinking .
Why are your people advising you not even to allow distribution to all Members of a declaration making it possible to deal with an issue which everyone knows is fundamental ?
If the original text is poor , we vote against , and we vote against the whole thing .
It is true that the enlargement will necessitate concessions , but they must remain limited and be properly thought through .
And that is just one example amongst others .
First it proposes six objectives for the future CAP , which we cannot but approve of .
If the CEECs want to enter the Union , it is because that entry signifies for them a definitive break with the parentheses of fifty years of communist domination .
In our opinion , in postponing the euro .
At the risk of repeating ourselves , we reaffirm our will to see this new objective 2 at least include a specific and independent sub-objective entitled "rural areas ' and another called "maritime zones ' , with , for rural policy , a programming period equal to that of the CAP.
There must be no confusion of powers .
What has to be recognized , Madam President , is that the countries which are not going to participate in this policy , at least initially , will still suffer the consequences , hence the need for flexible formulae .
I now come , of course , to the fourth point , which is undoubtedly the essential one , the Euro Council , the Euro X , whatever you like to call it .
But where are the real answers ?
The political problem is a different problem .
That is the impression given by reading the Gasòliba I Böhm report , as well as the working document of the Commission on the same subject and the current arguments about the Euro Council .
It is clear that the Walloon government has not been sufficiently precise about the objectives to be attained , sufficiently firm in the conduct of the projects , sufficiently effective in monitoring the consumption of appropriations , sufficiently convincing on the utility of research and development and targeting aid to support SMEs in the competitive sectors .
The rapporteur , Mr Decourrière , has deplored , and I too deplore , the slow implementation of certain programmes , above all in the initial phase concerning the Hainaut objective 1 region which is fortunately now being made up .
It had still not received this letter .
The Adapt and Leonardo programmes should be reinforced , along with objective 4 which goes in the same direction .
Women from these countries use subterfuge to obtain long-stay residence permits in the Union .
It is only when it is of real extra service to consumers that such constraints are justifiable .
The main beneficiary mail service is the Netherlands , whose KPN postal services made profits of around 1 billion dollars in 1996 , thanks to reposting acitivites .
The Commission is not in a position to contradict or alter the decisions of the European Parliament .
I thought I had two minutes .
It goes something like this .
When Members of the European Parliament are confronted in their own countries with the tragedy of families hard-hit by unemployment , they cannot be expected to cheerfully accept the disappearance , not only of 28 , 000 jobs , but also of a source of finance which would make it possible to create at least a few alternative jobs .
It is Christmas , and everybody is congratulating and thanking everyone else , even Mr Tomlinson .
But , putting to one side both the general celebratory atmosphere and the slight note of cheer in my voice , I am in fact dissatisfied .
On the other hand , it has demanded and obtained a reduction in payments under headings 3 and 4 , which are under the budgetary authority of this House .
This is a budget which serves the reigning political utopia , the Europe of the regions , a step towards the planetary organization which sets the nations at nought .
The ECU 150 million - 1 billion francs - accepted by the Council as spending on the European pact for employment , is not going to solve the unemployment crisis .
We have affirmed our prerogatives .
My colleagues have been so prodigal in their compliments that I cannot possibly add to them .
I believe it is possible to spend the amount that Mr Giansily wants to see spent without making extra levies and providing for extra input into the Resider and Rechar initiatives .
The over-restrictive application of this rule was the first of our earlier criticisms .
Concrete proposals exist
