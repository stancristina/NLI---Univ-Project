Therefore , I look forward to the greatest possible endeavours from the European Union too , making use , not least , of the tool of the joint investigation teams , precisely to restore the necessary confidence of the European citizens .
The Council official blithely arrives here at the very end of the debate .
The three proposals , therefore , cancelled each other out .
There are , in fact , groups of non-governmental organisations which have expressed their concern at the possibility , for example , of Internet campaigns being used to raise funds .
I fear that this is the direction in which we are heading and that the citizens ' greatest privacy concerns are not caused by the prospect of receiving a few more or less unsolicited commercial e-mails .
Nowadays , when every public directory ends up on the Internet , we have no way of protecting ourselves .
I therefore feel that , until I am protected - I am speaking on my own behalf but there are also many other people , older people like myself or people who have less expertise than many young people - I will do without electronic commerce , because it is not something in which I have confidence .
Firstly , I fully support the call for the funds made available to the film-making industry to be increased .
We do indeed need to encourage public institutions , local authorities and cultural associations to search for old and short films and to restore film material , thus ensuring that they are preserved and are available to the public .
I feel that the measure tabled by the committee and the decision the House makes tomorrow are so important as to warrant due reflection from the Commissioner and , indeed , a number of proposals and initiatives as well .
When we debate television without frontiers , then we will be able to establish rights and clear guidelines ; we will be able to require television companies to distribute , promote and commission European films , but it is imperative that , in cultural terms , we realise that we must make it quite clear that all the European countries must be able to benefit from films .
Clearly , this consolidated production cycle , which is vital for the economy of our country ' s livestock sector , would be completely disrupted by the introduction of a maximum journey time or distance limit .
The second point on which we have reservations is more general : it is the recommendation that the fight against money laundering should be seen as the priority .
I am appalled by the unnecessary delay with which this institution reacted to the violence suffered by Mr Dupuis and the other Radical activists .
Replying in a letter of 4 October 2000 , President Fontaine acknowledged that I was right and assured me that the translation services would correct the error .
However , I regret to say that it is still there .
Why can we not manage to make ugly things beautiful too ?
' The documents showing the way my pension is calculated , ' she replied , 'for I still cannot understand how that figure was reached .
Cappato report (A-0374/2001 )
Forgive me , Mr President , for giving rein to my imagination , but while we were discussing European joint investigation teams , I imagined investigation teams which included women , dressed in the same uniform , a common uniform for policewomen .
I strongly support this excellent report by Timothy Kirkhope which calls for a framework decision on setting up joint investigation teams .
Marinho report (A-0371/2001 ) Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
It is no longer just an economic issue ; it has taken on an ethical dimension .
I hope that we will soon do something to improve this situation as well .
Lastly , we do not feel that this directive is the most appropriate instrument to address the issue of the public financing system .
That applies to cargo handling and terminal services , and we feel that , in due respect not least for the principle of subsidiarity , certain services in which safety and professionalism are of paramount importance , such as pilotage , could be revitalised .
Through this process , the Union is preparing to shoulder responsibilities as a continent and we therefore need to take a closer look at our resources , policies and goals , at global level .
We have already seen extraordinary progress along the road to accession .
Once the conditions set by Parliament and the European Council have been complied with , and once the necessary ratification procedures are complete , these countries will be in a position to join the European Union before the June 2004 elections and thus elect representatives to this House for the next Parliamentary term .
Therefore , next year will be decisive for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe .
I would also urge the Member States to continue to respect their existing commitments regarding enlargement , particularly those contained in Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective for up to 2006 , as agreed by the Berlin European Council in 1999 .
With enlargement , Europe ' s position as the world ' s leading economy and trading power , with an internal market of 500 million consumers , will be confirmed .
This will make integration of our closest neighbours , the countries of the Western Balkans , easier when the time comes .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the continuous involvement of this House in the enlargement process remains crucial , and not least in terms of the debate on Europe ' s future , a debate to which the candidate countries and future Member States are expected to make a substantial contribution .
