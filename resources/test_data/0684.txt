then , with considerable ambition and with a great spirit of unity and of solidarity between all the political groups .
Secondly , a qualitative leap was also taken in terms of concepts : sustainable development made a very close link between the environment and poverty .
I would , however , add a point not mentioned either by the Danish Presidency , or by the Commission , and which I believe is negative : it is the fact that no boost was given to institutional reform in the field of the environment .
I would put it on the negative side .
This time , things were reversed : our relationship with the Danish Presidency was excellent , transparent , highly cooperative and , unfortunately , this time , with the Commission , we did not see the same level of cooperation that we have grown accustomed to at the conferences on climate change with Commissioner Wallstr√∂m .
And , basically , considerably more was needed .
We are aware that a decision was taken to create a solidarity fund designed to eradicate poverty .
We would really like to see , in this field , a level of commitment , a degree of responsibility and a clarity with regard to targets similar to those that have been adopted at the trade summits .
The first is a total ignorance of the declaration signed in Doha , where the European Union agreed to reduce its export subsidies , but managed to insist that all other types of subsidies , specifically the credits handed out by the United States of America and the state undertakings of other countries , should also be reduced .
And the fact that this has been ignored and not mentioned is incomprehensible .
If Voltaire were to return here , however , he would also draw a caricature , certainly a very impressive one , of those that today think that everything is for the worst in the worst of all possible worlds .
It makes no sense that this problem should not be addressed because we fear religious dogma , the type of dogma that Voltaire condemned , or because we fear being considered Malthusian .
I shall try to explain once again : Let us separate the institutional level , the role of Parliament , from political cooperation .
I voted in favour of this important report , bearing clearly in mind the worrying predictions of the Commission , which suggest that road freight transport in the European Union will increase by around 50 % by 2010 .
I particularly welcome the fact that , according to the observations made by the rapporteur on the future of employment in the European Union , businesses will be asked to give greater weight to the family-friendly organisation of work .
In order to ensure , however , that the aims of the ICC are fully achieved and that International Law is given greater credibility , its universal implementation must be guaranteed .
I say this not only in light of the already-mentioned principles of solidarity or of the region 's defence of the rule of law and of the economic model based on free initiative and on improving working conditions , but also because of the opportunity that a revitalised and concrete EU-Mercosur partnership would represent for a more balanced political and economic profile of the Union and its Member States in that region of the American continent .
Finally , Mr President , the problems that we are seeing in the region must not affect the course of the negotiations currently taking place between the European Union and Mercosur .
I believe that we have serious moral responsibilities towards Latin America and that the North/South dialogue and cooperation and development are meaningless unless we translate our words into action .
I shall , therefore , restrict myself to discussing a few aspects of this complex issue .
Fourthly , a more specific issue , however , that I feel is important and which Mr Titley has already mentioned : I am referring to the fact that customs revenues represent a substantial , if not almost exclusive contribution to the ACP countries ' budgets , which means that the measures we adopt on trade liberalisation must take account of this extremely important fact .
Making existing craft compliant with legislation will involve substantial costs that cannot be either disproportionate for boat owners or the sole responsibility of the shipbuilding industry .
I also feel that the failure to adopt the amendments tabled by my group seeking to reject any military aggression against Iraq , to lift the embargo on that country and to promote negotiations between Iraq and the UN to find a solution to the current situation is a mistake .
With regard to the movement of workers between Member States and nationally , the picture is no more encouraging : our rate of mobility is almost half of that of US citizens , with only a small elite of 225 000 European citizens moving to another Union country ; in other words , 0.1 % of the population of the Fifteen .
Directive 98/49/EC and Regulation 1408/71 must , therefore , be updated , simplified and extended and the coexistence of situations of double taxation with those in which this does not apply must finally be eliminated ; a further major contribution to fostering geographical mobility is the creation of the European health insurance card , which is expected to be up and running in 2004 ; Ninthly , we must highlight the use of the Eures system , although this must be extended and brought up to date .
In fact , the scarcity of fish on the continental shelf and in the major fishing grounds has caused many vessels and many fishermen to turn to these species that have survived or that have been largely ignored until now , and which are , consequently , on the way to suffering total despoliation
