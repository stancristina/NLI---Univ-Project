For too many years , Lebanon has been governed against a background of ethnic conflicts and foreign interests .
Even if the events of recent days suggest that the Syrian regime is willing to give up its military presence in Lebanon , there are good reasons for maintaining a critical line where Syria is concerned .
Even if the actual military forces are withdrawn from the border areas , the long arm of the Syrian regime will still be able to sabotage democratic development .
A fair number of bloody attacks in Syria’s and Lebanon’s recent history are witness to this .
In addition , there is the influence exercised over Lebanon by the hierocracy in Teheran , including Hizbollah .
I am still waiting to hear a reaction from Teheran , supporting democratic development in Lebanon in unambiguous terms .
The EU and the United States stand together on this matter .
With reasonable support for the democratic forces and a common front against the enemies of democracy , the EU and the United States will together be able to help democracy on its way – not only in Lebanon , but throughout the region .     Mr President , I should like to ask about the matter of software .
Are you able , Commissioner , to confirm that it was not just a question of lying down and accepting the reference to the procedure , but that vigorous protests were made ?
Are you able , secondly , to confirm that you yourself were contacted by , for example , the Danish Government with a view to your supporting the Danish Government’s desire to have the software patent down as a B point ?
This is something I should like to have clarified .     Mr President , I shall also present an amending budget , which implies a response .
The adjustment of salaries and pensions , adopted by the Council at the end of last year , only amounted to 0.7 % , and , when we prepared the budget for this year , we anticipated a 2.6 % increase in salaries .
Like the other EU institutions , Parliament can now , therefore , cut back the staff appropriations in the 2005 budget .
That is something about which we , of course , agreed in the budget conciliation .
In the same connection , we are directing the Secretary-General of the European Parliament to examine Parliament’s budget in July , to assess the situation and to see if we need another amending budget .
This is because , for a number of years , Parliament has secured us future savings on rent by purchasing buildings – a very sensible policy , meaning that we can save some money .
I am well aware that Parliament’s services are engaged in negotiations about further purchases of buildings that we are at present renting , but these are at an early stage , so we do not know what position we shall ultimately be in .
We shall return to this subject in July .
This budget will , of course , also be characterised by the preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania which , as Mr Dombrovskis pointed out , it is anticipated will take place in 2007 .
A huge effort has , of course , already been made to acquire the upwards of 1 200 new employees we have obtained in Parliament , an effort that has in many ways been a great success .
I think , however , that our rapporteur , Mr Dombrovskis , is right to demand that we investigate whether the resultant staffing situation is satisfactory in all respects .
We must ensure that recruitment does not take an unnecessarily long time and is not unduly bureaucratic .
We must see to it that , as Members of Parliament , we have access to the necessary expertise so that we can do some serious legislative work .
Moreover , there must be resources for proper impact assessments in connection with the legislation , including assessments of the financial consequences for the public sector , the EU budget , the national treasuries and the business sector .
Last but not least , I am delighted that , in Parliament’s draft budget for 2006 , we propose a significant strengthening of Parliament’s information policy .
It must become easier and simpler for journalists and people in general to follow the legislative process .
We must ensure that the fine speechifying about transparency does , in actual fact , bear fruit .
It is also important for us to increase our efforts in favour of decentralisation by means of the information offices in the Member States where a better sense can be obtained of the practical needs that exist for information .
I would thank Mr Dombrovskis for his efforts .
We are able to support his report .     Mr President , women will undoubtedly be put under tremendous pressure to supply eggs .
This is something we are unable to talk clearly about .
I was not fully aware that embryos could be procured in the same way as semen .
They mention them in the same breath .
We need very tough controls , and we need to see those who break the rules tracked down .
This should , of course , be controlled too .
Trafficking in women may also be permitted in the other country , but we still want to see it banned .
I eagerly await the Commission ’s explanation of how it will ensure that this desire is complied with .     Mr President , President Barroso , Commissioner Verheugen , I would like to say how pleased I am today at the positive reception given to our draft resolution on the Lisbon Process .
I regard it , in fact , as a hand outstretched in cooperation and I see it
