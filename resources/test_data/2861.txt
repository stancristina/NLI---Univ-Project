Mr President , my party , the Socialist Party in the Netherlands , is in favour of democratic cooperation from the bottom up among the European peoples , but not of a large European superstate modelled on the United States of America .
Mr President , I would like , as a matter of priority , to thank Parliament for lending its support to aid for Mongolia .
In the Belgian federation , the federal states are equal pursuant to the rules in the constitution .
In the same light , Flanders would like to make it clear that the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages , as referred to in paragraph 20 of the Haarder report , does not pertain to French in the periphery but , for example , to the Limburg dialect ( recognised in the application of this Charter in the Netherlands ) or to the Arel German dialect in the Province of Luxembourg .
But the other side of the coin is that disasters which do not reach the news , to all intents and purposes , do not exist .
It is commendable that Commissioner Nielson travelled to Mozambique so quickly .
Mr President , the recent floods in Mozambique , followed by the hurricane , have thrown the country into complete disarray , at a time when it was just about recovering from the political atrocities of the past .
It will first address emergency aid , then housing and infrastructure and after that structural aid in order to get the affected areas back on their feet .
The images were inadequate , the disaster is very sad indeed , but the European Union did not stand idly by , as was suggested .
The last few weeks have been marked by a series of repressive measures against the independent media .
The new regime can only win the new local elections , expected in May , if the opposition is , in effect , eliminated .
It is really unacceptable that elections will soon take place - allegedly formal , democratic elections - in a country where the opposition has first been left without any tool to express itself .
This is fine within the framework of the new CARA programme , but it is also particularly important that this should happen in two weeks ' time , in conjunction with the Stability Pact .
It is most peculiar that the European Union is not really aware that we too have this tool at our disposal and that , for example , we should , in fact , deny entry to the EU to the Serbian football hooligans in return , because they are people who take advantage of the Milosevic regime in the most shocking manner .
Mr President , apparently , the Milosevic regime is not tired of fighting battles , not by a long shot .
By the way : the few independent papers that do exist are hard to come by in the provinces .
This appears to have awakened world opinion again .
Once again , it seems unlikely that the correct decisions will be taken at the CITES meeting in Nairobi and once again , we will be stepping in to prevent the wrong decisions from being taken .
Re-legalisation would only further reward bad behaviour .
We urge the Commission and Member States not to support this type of proposal but to keep CITES as it is .
Over-exploitation and misuse cannot be explained by poverty alone .
The Dutch Minister was the only one to vote for the conservation of the elephant .
Between 10 and 20 April next , the fate of this elephant will once again feature on the agenda of the world community .
In the space of three generations , more than 80 % of the population has disappeared .
Naturally , I have absolutely no intention of defending the objectionable behaviour displayed by the leader of the Canadian delegation .
The leader of the Canadian delegation may have reacted in a manner which I would not wish to condone , but I also think that Mr Berthu is going to have to choose his words a little more carefully at future meetings of this kind .
What is more , the international agreement of 1977 was never intended to artificially prolong the life span of aircraft due to be phased out , or to transfer aircraft from chapter 2 to chapter 3 .
Incidentally , there is no getting away from the fact that one of the key stumbling blocks in the conflict between the United States and the European Union , is that there is obviously no longer any basis for trust .
Mr President , the regulation we are discussing today dates back to 29 April last year .
In other words , we were not obstructive but we were firmly united in our willingness to introduce a regulation ; under the terms of which , I might add , the United States would , in any case , have two more years in which to complete the phasing-out process .
The regulation should come into force now as far as we are concerned .
I think that is a particularly sorry state of affairs .
We should not turn things round .
I believe they should withdraw it .
Parliament and the Council have decided that from 4 May onwards , the number of these noisy American machines permitted to land on European airfields will be frozen .
That is why the Clinton administration decided last week to lodge a complaint about Europe with the ICAO.
If we are to reach a compromise with the Americans , then surely the minor problem of the hushkits can be resolved as part of the overall package .
We thought that postponing our own measures would help us to
