biggest problem is by far the Member States .
It seems to us incredible that seven Member States have still not ratified the 1983 Convention on compensation for victims of violent crime and that standards of justice are still so low in so many Member States .
Let me give just one brief example from my own constituency .
Mr Pike , a lorry driver in my constituency , was recently assaulted by his employer in the Netherlands .
Mr Pike is not a wealthy man and the cost of legal redress is high .
He does not have access to legal aid in Britain because he has to employ a lawyer in the Netherlands to help him .
He does not have access to legal aid in the Netherlands .
He is unable to secure any compensation or , indeed , any justice for the injuries he has suffered .
Unless we are able as a Union to help in relatively clear and simple situations like this , our citizens will not have confidence in the single market and will not feel part of the European Union .
I hope that we can take up some of the ideas put forward in this report to improve their situation .
Madam President , I would not want Members of this House to think that I do not have a sense of humour .
I did refer yesterday to the man or woman dressed as a cigarette packet standing outside this Chamber .
But I was making a serious point and maybe yesterday it was taken rather too lightheartedly .
I have a letter from you , Madam President , dated 6 April , in which it was agreed by the College of Quaestors that the area around the Chambers in Brussels and Strasbourg should be regarded as a neutral zone in which demonstrations , exhibitions or similar activities intended to influence Members would not be tolerated .
You went on to say that you would investigate ways of ensuring that there would be no recurrence .
I hope that you and the College of Quaestors will take this seriously because it is an encroachment on the right of Members to come to this House and vote freely on issues that their electors have sent them here to debate .
The jobs of one thousand people in my constituency are now at risk as a result of the decisions that were taken here yesterday .
Mr President , the drafting of the Charter has now reached a critical phase .
We have drafted 60 clauses and provoked 1000 amendments .
Frankly the Convention is staggering and may stall completely should the Feira Council fail to bring a fresh stimulus .
We have so far tried to reach a consensus across the body .
This is now proving an improbable task .
We require a far more formal decision-making procedure of a parliamentary type .
This means voting , and voting by a qualified majority , as would be normal for the procedures within any modern European State .
Some representatives of the European Council cannot stand the prospect of being forced to vote and they disapprove of the nature of the Convention itself .
This prejudice must be suppressed by the Feira Council if the project is to succeed .
Mr President , I failed to catch the President 's eye this morning .
We should not allow this plenary session to pass without paying some attention to the fact that the Nobel laureate and Sakharov Prize winner , Aung San Suu Kyi , is still denied her freedom .
It is exactly ten years since she and the National League for Democracy won that election which the dictators proceeded to completely ignore .
There has been a whole decade of dictatorship in that country .
Next Monday , Aung San Suu Kyi will be 55 years old .
It is a very poignant birthday for her .
In March , her husband died of cancer .
He asked for permission to visit her to say goodbye to his dear wife .
The military junta in Burma refused permission for him to see her .
These military dictators remain terrified of a small and gentle woman who has no malice , no uniforms or tanks to protect her .
She and the people of Burma will not give up .
What I am asking today is for the European Parliament to do what she asks .
She says : " Please use your liberty to support ours " .
I ask the President of this Parliament to write to the military junta in Burma to say : stop the human rights abuses , return to democracy and give freedom to Aung San Suu Kyi .
Mr President , as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I object to Mr Lechner 's attempt to mislead this House on an interim court ruling that has come out of the European Court of Justice on the ban on tobacco advertising , not on health warnings , which is what we voted on yesterday .
Mr Lechner should be aware that the judgement is interim and that we will not have a final judgement until the autumn .
Furthermore , the Legal Affairs Committee ignored the advice of Parliament 's legal services that the legal base for this directive was correct .
I can understand Mr Lechner 's frustration as he and some of the members of his group worked closely with industry to try and frustrate this resolution , but we cannot have the politics of the press release overturning decisions of this House .
- Although I am aware that what I do here is of no interest to other Members of this institution , my real audience is my own constituents .
It is to them that I wish to explain my actions
