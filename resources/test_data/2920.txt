fishing activity can be expected in the next few years , and clearly with that significant downturn in activity will come a significant downturn in the income of many families and many communities in our fishing areas , both in the catching sector and in processing .
Just as the economic and social effects of the lack of a new agreement with Morocco have been felt in very particular areas , so the effects of these emergency measures in the long-term cod recovery plans will have an effect in very particular areas .
There is a case for looking at similar financial compensation measures for these areas .
The CFP review provides a challenge and an opportunity .
I hope that the solution we come up with will be one that actually works .
The best means of doing that is to make sure that the new fisheries policy includes significant and adequate involvement of stakeholders - of fishermen , processors , scientists and conservationists from particular areas such as the North Sea , so that we can work together to recommend proposals for management which are tailored to and targeted towards the needs of these particular areas .
Mr President , can I first of all apologise to you , your predecessor and the House for my late arrival .
My problems began this morning at a very early point when my flight from Belfast to London was cancelled .
Thanks to British Midland International and the good work of their staff , I got here rather late , but still I am here .
I apologise , as I did not intend to be discourteous to the House .
I listened with tremendous interest to Mr van Dam talking about half-baked approaches by the Commission and how well the Dutch fishermen were responding .
Mr van Dam should go back and read my report because I neither criticised the Commission nor the fishermen .
This is not an easy problem .
It is a very serious problem .
To some extent the fishermen in my region faced this problem last year .
For them , this is the second year of closure .
I should tell Mr van Dam and the Scottish fishermen , who are now facing the first year of closure and are creating a lot of waves , that the fishermen from my region not only took this in their stride but actually responded in a very positive way .
They cooperated with the Commission in the technical measures and were prepared to look very sincerely at them .
It is not easy for fishermen to take on board a closure of their area for such an extensive period .
It is even more difficult when there are no support mechanisms to help the industry find a way forward .
This is what I want to concentrate on .
When I raise the problem of the Commission coming forward with concrete proposals - be it set-aside or support mechanisms - the Commission says : " let the national authorities come forward with ideas and we will take them on board in a very positive way . "
But the problem is that the national authorities will not come forward with any sincere proposals to help the fishermen in the region .
Certainly not the United Kingdom authorities - and it does not really matter whether it is a Conservative or Labour Government .
Neither of them would ever come forward with any positive support to help the fishermen .
I have one amendment to my report and I ask the Commissioner to take it on board .
It is to allow the fishermen , under the supervision already agreed at the early part of the closure , to continue right through that closure .
If at any time the discards exceed part of that closure , then the fishermen will quite readily accept .
At this moment , the Commission has set its face against accepting this amendment .
This is unfortunate because the cooperation that is being given by the fishermen to the Commission is a shining example to other parts of the European Union .
As Mr van Dam said , there is a tremendous problem , there is tremendous concern and we have to ensure the future of cod for the future of fishermen .
I hope the Commission will be able to take on board the very positive aspect that I have put forward in my amendment .
Mr President , Mr Nicholson 's report underlines the serious crisis now affecting fish stocks in the waters around Britain and Ireland .
The very fact that the Commission has found it necessary to implement emergency measures in four separate areas to save exhausted fish stocks , serves to illustrate the total failure of the common fisheries policy .
As of today , 12 February 2001 , more that 40 000 square miles of the North Sea will be closed for 12 weeks to all white fish trawling .
In addition , there will be emergency closures covering the West of Scotland , the Irish Sea , as we have heard , and North Atlantic hake and all of this comes on top of the savage cuts in total allowable catches and quotas announced by the Council last December .
The common fisheries policy in its current form has been operating for 18 years .
The system of tax and quotas has led to massive quantities of healthy fish being dumped dead back into the sea .
Over two million tonnes of fish a year , 25 % of the total fish catch in the EU , are discarded in this manner .
The system of MAGPs has also been a disaster .
Member States who attempt to observe these rules are punished while other Member States ignore the MAGPs entirely .
So , the CFP has failed in its core objectives .
