requirement that air transport safety be improved .
This is why , only recently , we carried out a reform of Agenda 2000 : these price packages tend merely to make annual adjustments in response to one-off situations .
A short while ago , therefore , following Mrs Gonz√°lez ' report , the European Parliament approved the urgent establishment of guarantee thresholds at Member State level and the Commission was asked to present these proposals as a matter of urgency .
- ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Parliament is due to state its position at second reading on the regulation that forms the legal base for the general framework of cooperation between the European Union and South Africa .
Furthermore , it appears to be a position that has been reached in conjunction with other New World wine-producing countries , given that the South Africans were negotiating bilateral agreements on wines with the European Union and then they suddenly changed their minds and wanted to postpone everything .
If that is the case , we would have to provide Members of the House with a greater ability to carry out their mandate , more and better information and we would have to ensure that the political groups are more accountable and that the staff of the European Parliament is more efficient .
Now that the process of enlargement has been launched , fundamental changes are required as well as renewed ambition .
- ( PT ) Mr President , the current year is the first in which OLAF is fully operational .
Unlike the main areas of expenditure , which the Commission monitors and on which it imposes a system of sanctions , there is nothing comparable in these two vital areas of the Community ' s own resources .
The protection of the Community ' s financial interests , and particularly those of the taxpayers , who comply , cannot continue to be disregarded when it comes to indirect taxation .
In specific terms , for 2000 to 2001 , the Commission is proposing the level of increments for rice , whereas we are still waiting for the next reform proposal , which should already have moved forward .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is crucial that all employees are assured a decent working environment in order to guarantee that their health and safety is protected , which requires an organisation of working time that allows daily and weekly rest breaks , annual leave , holidays and other aspects .
That is why we have voted against this agreement , since what we want , of course , is a better agreement .
It is therefore time to take internal action in order to lend credibility to our external efforts .
This system is a crucial aspect in the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and will ensure rigorous control of the voluntary commitment made by the car industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in new passenger vehicles by 25 % .
I would also like to congratulate him because this is a very complex issue that he has addressed with great clarity and depth and also for the open-mindedness and negotiating skills that he has demonstrated in including many of the amendments that were tabled .
Secondly , rail transport is considered to be a great deal more expensive than road transport .
With regard to the high-speed rail system , I shall just highlight two aspects , which I think are crucial : the interconnection and interoperability of high-speed infrastructures with rolling stock and additional services are crucial for facilitating the mobility of persons and goods and for promoting a high-speed trans-European rail system that is efficient and able to respond to the needs of the public .

Savary report ( A5-0112/2000 )
The imposition of unsuitable structural adjustment programmes by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and inadequate cooperation and development aid actions by the industrialised countries , which fall considerably short of the 0.7 % of GDP recommended by the United Nations , both contribute to this gap .
The European Union and its Member States can , and must , speak up on this issue , abandoning their limited outlooks , which are full of conditions , which often accompany shamefaced announcements about debt cancellation , and end the aid cuts that have been taking place and which are proposed for the future .
I would remind you that in 1996 , the IMF/World Bank interim and development committees approved , at their respective annual meetings , an initiative on the debt of highly indebted poor countries , the HIPC initiative .
Within the Community , at their session last December , the Council of ACP-EU Ministers decided that unallocated programmable EDF resources could be used as subsidies .
The European Union believes that improvements to this initiative must be based on integrated programmes which link debt relief more closely to the objectives of sustainable development and the reduction of poverty .
I think that this rationale and this kind of intervention , no matter how well intentioned they may be , can be viewed , depending on how one chooses to interpret them , as a form of neo-colonial intervention .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that it has become quite clear today that the situation referred to in the question is of great concern and has attracted the Council ' s attention .
This is the crucial issue : debt is a symptom but underdevelopment is the disease .
Working towards good governance and working towards strengthening democratic structures and political participation are vital factors in creating free societies which provide for better management of internal resources and more appropriate management of wealth distribution and , in particular , which do not encourage corruption and the siphoning-off of funds .
