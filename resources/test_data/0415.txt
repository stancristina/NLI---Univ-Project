is very much taking into account the opinions expressed by Parliament in the draft report drawn up by Ramón Jáuregui Atondo , Kinga Gál and Cristian Dan Preda .
There is no problem .
In addition , the history of the European Court of Human rights and its case law has been highly positive for human rights in Europe .
I would like to say that we are pleased that there is a consensus with regard to the importance of moving forward with the development of the mandate presented by the European Commission and that there is going to be a Parliament sitting on this , as announced by Mr Jáuregui and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him and the other rapporteurs of this report , Mrs Gál and Mr Preda .
In other words , European industry needs to return to leadership and competitiveness in the global market ; it needs to back innovation and the development of new technologies .
In order to do this the Council believes that we need a global strategy to develop the technologies , including , in this case , electric technology .
We heard this in the speech by Mr López Garrido , and in the speech by the Commissioner , and it is reflected in the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow in Parliament with the support of all the political groups .
However , how are you going to speed up this standardisation in order to prevent this issue from delaying the introduction of electric cars in the European Union ?
Do you not think that it is realistic to think that electric cars will be widespread in Europe by 2015-2020 ?
However , I shall also refer at the end to the difficulties or obstacles which I believe we have to overcome .
What is more , the technology used by electric vehicles is the most efficient and best for the environment .
Finally , in spite of that , in spite of those advantages , electric vehicles will clearly require us to change many of our manufacturing systems , and also many of the technologies that I mentioned earlier , people 's habits and power distribution networks , and it will also even make it necessary to move towards a new communications strategy , as Mr van Nistelrooj quite rightly pointed out .
When consumers are preparing for the important decision of going to a dealer - because , as one of you said , it is a major expense for all consumers and households - they want to find out about prices and quality , to be able to make comparisons , and they can do that .
In all these respects , the future regulation will give consumers more benefits than the current one .
That is the truth of it .
There are large dealers , who have a strong presence in the market in some of the Member States , and there are also many small dealers who are happier with what we are currently proposing than with what has been in place since 2002 , because they have seen that certain aspects , not intended by the legislator in 2002 , have not been in their interest , but rather have made it difficult for them to withstand competition from the major dealers .
We all recognise the diversity that exists between the different regions of the Union , but it is precisely for this reason that , as the resolution states , Southern Europe suffers much more from the pressure of climate change , and needs Europe and its common policies .
This is a question of solidarity that the whole of the EU would benefit from .
I believe that it is a matter of concern that some Member States place so many obstacles in the way of the standardisation of non-discrimination and equal treatment at European level .
Some have called increasing maternity leave to 14 weeks progress , and indeed it is .
In Europe , and in rich countries , we have forgotten that the wars that cause refugees are wars for which we are responsible , for which our countries and governments are responsible .
According to the text agreed between Parliament and the Council , before the end of 2020 , all new buildings must have zero energy consumption , producing as much energy as they consume .
The report also discusses the challenges identified by the ' New Skills for New Jobs ' initiative .
There is no doubt that we need to offer clear and efficient channels of support for the European public so that no European dies due to a lack of organs as a result of shortcomings in the transplant system .
Our objective is simply to reach the point where no European dies because he lacks an organ that he needs in order to live due to systems that have not been perfected .
This is certainly an important debate , firstly because it has a direct impact on people 's lives and on the health of thousands of Europeans .
Moreover , Article 168 of the recent Treaty of Lisbon gives us the opportunity to create this common , high quality and safe framework for the process of donation and transplantation .
We are doing so by establishing a European model for donation and transplantation around values and principles that we all share : solidarity , fairness and cohesion , which are the symbols of the Union 's identity .
It is through the joint work of all the Union 's institutions that we have to reach an agreement that will enable us to launch a European service which , on the one hand , will give 500 million people the best guarantees of quality and safety and , on the other , will promote equal access to the treatment on which so many lives depend every year , and also the solidarity of our society
