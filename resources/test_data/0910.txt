protect air quality .
To attain these goals higher emission limits should be permitted for biofuels , as the proposal prescribes , and the air protection requirements for small combustion plants must be technically and economically reasonable .
We therefore have to do everything we possibly can , and one indication that we can do more than the Commission has been prepared to is this report on large combustion plants which has been produced by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
I therefore wholeheartedly support the proposal that old plants should be included .
I also believe we must improve methods for exploiting biofuels and for combined heat and power production , but , as far as biofuels are concerned , I believe it is essential that they should be subject to the same limit values as apply to other fuels .
I have just one observation to make .
Parliament has , quite rightly , presented its own addition to the Commission 's proposal , stating that the directive should seek to impact on the common aim and hierarchical structure for European policy on waste : waste prevention , recycling and reuse , and its exploitation as an energy source .
In my opinion , however , this is good quality biofuel , and there should be no sort of restriction on its use .
Furthermore , when other options fail relocation of the refugees outside the region and within the EU area must be an option on humanitarian grounds .
The extraordinary European Council at Berlin was held , at least to some extent , in very special circumstances .
This is because there was real effort to reach decisions : nothing was left to chance .
The basic attitude was that the talks should be conducted well , before any solutions were found .
The agricultural solution that pleased many Member States has simply swept serious problems under the carpet .
Good too was the fact that at long last agricultural conditions in the Nordic countries were taken into account to a reasonable extent , and that at least some success was achieved in limiting the seemingly unstoppable flow of money spent on agriculture .
Now Parliament has to ensure that the problems which are still on the table are discussed in cooperation so that Parliament can debate the whole of Agenda 2000 as one package in May .
Now we must focus our attention on highlighting the issue of unemployment in Objectives 2 and 3 to a much greater and more significant extent than is the case now .
The timetable for appointing the Commission must be established without delay , but at the same time we must ensure that we adhere to the objectives Parliament has for reforming it .
I hope that the developments launched so successfully in Berlin will manage to stay the course .
The Finnish Government may have already been elected as I speak .
The directive cuts fundamentally into national systems for informing workers ; yet we have not had sufficient evidence of the need for a supranational regulatory approach .
I certainly see a need for better provision of information to workers in the public sector .
Ghilardotti and Chanterie reports ( A4-0186/99 and A4-0184/99 ) Mr President , the example of Bosnia has shown that there is no peace - keeping without peace enforcement .
This means , in concrete terms , that we must have military personnel , guns , artillery and other equipment in Kosovo - and for a long time - as in Bosnia .
This is the lesson learnt from an operation that was ill-conceived from the beginning but which eventually will end in giving Kosovo freedom under the threat of arms .
Mr President , the debate here in Parliament on the BSE crisis , which is still troubling Europe , has been a good example of how Parliament has been unquestionably capable of tackling an issue that is worrying the citizens of Europe .
It is important that the European Parliament continues to take an active part in monitoring the effects of decisions taken , as well as ensuring that Member States are implementing them correctly .
I believe , however , we should distinguish between those Member States in which there is no apparent risk with regard to the disease , and those in which there is .
The BSE crisis , cases of swine fever , and resistant strains of salmonella indicate all too alarmingly that the basis for a Union agricultural policy is breaking up .
We cannot afford to be arrogant here .
We cannot jump to hasty conclusions one way or the other .
Mad cow disease was in the headlines about five years ago .
Have the resources set aside for the control of BSE been used in the best possible way ?
It is still not clear what action it is wise and necessary to take , and the extent to which that action should be targeted .
The Commission has implemented many of the recommendations made with regard to BSE in order to promote consumer health and protection .
Mr President , as this is probably the last time that I will address Parliament , I will use my mother tongue , which is Swedish .
Mr President , Estonia has progressed well along the road to membership .
My own guess is that we are looking at 2004 or 2005 .
Sooner or later - sooner better than later - the country should be capable of solving its minority problems and creating a society where all people , regardless of the language they speak , subscribe loyally to the principles of democracy and the rule of law .
Despite legislative improvements , particularly with regard to children born in and after 1992 , Estonia 's political 'establishment ' appears to be maintaining what in my view is a conservative stance on citizenship .
