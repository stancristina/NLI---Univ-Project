At the same time , they abolished the diplomacy of threat and pressure and replaced it with the language of reconciliation , compromise and understanding in good faith .
They live under a military regime in the guise of a pseudo-democracy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , maybe it is an opportunity as well as an honour to have the last word in such an important debate .
I think that this debate has highlighted the potential for the European Parliament , especially when it comes to Romania , on which I should like to say a few words .
The Commissioner acknowledged as much this morning and I think that we could use this as an example to the numerous groups of visitors who question exactly what we in the European Parliament can do .
I am sure that Mr Verheugen said no such thing .
The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy says yes , if Romania wants to join these euro-Atlantic structures , then we want to support this and I think it is important , especially in Romania 's case , that we do .
Commissioner , I should just like to ask you if the same phenomenon applies to other products , i .e . if there are coding systems for other products , because the culture industry is extremely sensitive , there is huge competition from America , which we are unable to withstand , as we know all too well .
I have two real - not rhetorical - questions .
There are also political aspects which I do not expect you to take completely in hand , but they are there .
There is a huge campaign in Bosnia and Kosovo to prostitute children , young children , both boys and girls .
The basic features of an agency such as this must be independence of action and efficiency , both of which apply in the present case .
Similarly , the Commission proposals also differ .
Having said which , I think the Commission could run a comparative check on these texts and then table proposals for similar provisions to be adopted for similar cases and existing unwarranted contradictions to be abolished .
As I understand it , Echelon allows certain Member States of the European Union - one Member State at least and maybe others - to attend top-level meetings in the European Union armed with knowledge of the negotiating tactics , positions and strategy of the other Member States .
Madam President-in-Office , I would be most interested in hearing your views on this .
The United States , Canada , New Zealand , Australia and our own United Kingdom excelled in this sort of espionage by setting up Åchelon , as our committee has confirmed thanks to the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur , Mr Schmid , and the coordinators .
In my opinion , Åchelon is one of the greatest scandals of all time .
We need to improve the security of information technology infrastructures and the application of efficient parliamentary and judicial controls on how secret services operate at national and European level , otherwise our citizens will lose all confidence in the information society .
It is high time we gave European citizens an answer to their question : quis custodiet ipsos custodies ?
In Greece , a new anti-terrorism law was passed in May 2001 in a bid to systemise and up the ante in the fight against terrorism without violating fundamental rights and the principles of the rule of law .
However , in the case of terrorist offences , the Council should immediately abolish formal extradition procedures and adopt the principle of mutual recognition of decisions on criminal matters , including pre-judgment decisions , as proposed in the report .
( EL ) The positions taken in the Watson report on an initiative at EU level to combat terrorism seriously threaten to undermine grass-roots movements and democratic freedoms .
It is clear , I think , from the above that the sole purpose of this whole diatribe is to terrorise and subjugate anyone and everyone who opposes the violent attack unleashed by the global capitalist system , especially now that the Socialist system has been overturned .
The aim now is to further strengthen and harmonise the criminal arsenal available to the Member States for dealing with terrorism .
Surely the two people killed by the Swedish and Italian state terrorists are the victims of terrorist action and deserve compensation ?
A broad spectrum of high-profile democrats , trades union and other social organisations has rallied against it .
I should like to take this opportunity to point out that one of the main outstanding obstacles to cultural cooperation between the Fifteen is the fact that the Parthenon marbles have been appropriated by the British Museum .
The accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union is clearly a very different issue from the accession of the countries of Eastern Europe .
If the Council takes its cue from the European Parliament , instead of constantly giving in to pressure from Turkey , we would have positive and quick results both for the Republic of Cyprus and for the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities .
( EL ) The only good thing about the report by the Temporary Committee on the Echelon Interception System is that it admits that such a system exists and that similar systems also probably exist .
However , it tries to take our mind off our concerns by playing down its powers and general impact .
All in all , it "urges the Member States to review and , if necessary , to adapt their own legislation on the operations of the intelligence services to ensure that it is consistent with fundamental rights as laid down in the ECHR and with the case law of the European
