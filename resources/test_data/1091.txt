This barbarous and , at the same time , grotesque regime must be contained .
Diplomacy should have led us in Europe to formulate joint or , at least , homogeneous positions .
Can you see anyone saying ' Yes to war '?
There is an alternative , and it is not peace : peace is what we have at the moment .
In Italy , to date , we have received approval from 57 Members of Parliament , half of them centre-left and half of them centre-right , including the former Prime Minister , Mr Andreotti , and other important figures who support this proposal .
This is our proposal , and may the others rest in eternal peace .
What the United States is asking from Saddam Hussein , however , is not to prove his innocence but to provide evidence of his own guilt , that is , to put his own neck in the noose to be hanged or be bombed to smithereens .
Indeed , we have shifted from a firm , rational position in the face of the dangers of Arab and Islamic terrorism and the terrorism of Iraq itself to a situation of unilateral decisions , and we must realise that we cannot accept this situation without undoing decades of progress made in international law .
Mr President , we are all agreed that every endeavour must be made to safeguard peace and that it is the duty of all of us to strive to avoid war .
I quote : ' On 7th of December , 2002 , Iraq submitted a declaration of some 12,000 pages ? [to] ? the Security Council . ?
There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared .
Whether we choose war or peace now depends first and foremost on the decisions Saddam Hussein makes , and Europe must ensure that the Iraqi regime cooperates with the inspectors .
Now , it is up to Saddam Hussein to prove that he is not supporting terrorism , that he has no dealings with Al Qaida and that he intends to bow to the will of the United Nations .
More coherent in the sense of believing more strongly in its values and showing some pride in them and more united in the sense of adopting a better thought out , consistent position .
In this regard , I would like to end with a question .
We are all for peace , we are all against war , we are all against weapons of mass destruction .
It is in the common interest , the interest of both Europe and the United States , to have the closest possible relationship with Russia .
Europe has therefore been dependent on the US thus far and must find its own role in the world , not just through the creation of a rapid reaction force but , above all , through effective coordination of foreign policy .
In his account of the facts with which we who are concerned with these issues are already quite familiar , the Commissioner mentioned a possible US attack .
Secondly , we must not give other countries , other potential Kim Jong-Il-style dictators - and they do exist - the impression that one only has to violate the non-proliferation treaties in order to be rewarded with support and assistance from the United States .
In this sense , governments are often indifferent towards the work of UNHCR and their recommendations go unheeded .
We need the provision of enough UNHCR financial and human resources to be able to act more effectively .
Lastly , Mr President , I would like us to go to Geneva with a conviction which I hope we all share - that the first and highest form of defence of human rights is to avoid the destruction , ignominy and violence of war .
Let us focus on the diseases related to poverty , on malaria and tuberculosis .
The European Union must now shoulder the responsibility of expressing the principles and positions we are discussing today in all international fora , starting with the World Trade Organisation .
That would bring more freedom and , therefore , greater competition and more opportunities in addition to urgently-needed humanitarian measures .
This type of policy is much more difficult , I repeat , than policies to grant aid , something which probably no-one - and I mean taxpayers - realises ; but it is by opening up the markets , much more than by granting aid , that we can give hundreds of millions of people real , lasting opportunities to escape from hunger and poverty and lay the structural foundations , including legal foundations , for economic growth , and civil growth too , in a spirit of freedom and democracy .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the statistics are now arriving thick and fast regarding what is , to say the least , a tragic situation .
Apart from the figures , though , I think that we should be shocked by the trend revealed by these statistics : this population which potentially has a death sentence hanging over it , despite the efforts of mankind , continues to grow .
In this connection , I would like to point out a development which has been overlooked to a large degree : during the G8 Summit in Genoa in July 2001 , at the initiative of the Italian Government , the summit of the most developed countries was preceded by a meeting with a large group of representatives from countries with public debt , starvation and poverty problems .
This is further confirmation of the need to speed up the adoption , which seems to be possible at first reading already , of this proposal for a regulation so that it can be swiftly implemented , in line with the European Union 's responsibilities
