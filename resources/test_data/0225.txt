will be responding to the worries expressed by our citizens .
Clarity , transparency and ethically sustainable action must be the guiding principle behind European decision-making , whether it is a matter of the Union ' s internal administrative culture or of ensuring the rights and security of our citizens .
The fact that Parliament is debating this important subject right now , well before the Extraordinary Summit at Tampere , indicates that the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam is being realised in the way intended .
Madam President , despite the splendid presentation by the President-in-Office of the Council , Mrs Halonen , I have to draw attention to the secretive way preparations have been made for the meeting at Tampere , which last week led to a grotesque incident after the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende published a story saying that a curb would be put on immigration from third countries , even with recourse to scare campaigns and threats .
A certain Finnish television reporter , who had used a quite harmless memo on the Tampere meeting he had got from a Member of Parliament , received a communication from the Secretary-General and the Speaker at the Finnish Parliament banning him indefinitely from entering the Parliament building .
It gives cause to suspect that narrow , strict security , which is ultimately based on repression , will ignore those very freedoms and fundamental rights of citizens whose enhancement ought now to be on the agenda .
Ignorance due to secrecy has no place in a mature political system , such as the one we should be building for a Europe of the citizen , of the individual .
Madam President , democracy demands that we take decisions through a system of majority ruling .
Privacy is a human right that cannot be abolished with an EU directive , a convention or national legislation .
There is legal provision for the protection of privacy in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and the European Convention on Human Rights .
But then it is necessary to recognise the existence also of crimes relating to the violation of people ' s privacy , which intelligence agencies in the USA and the EU countries are guilty of 24 hours a day .
There are types of crime that remain outside the democratic system , which the preparation of the Enfopol 19 document is connected with .
It is also a crime that American computer manufacturers and software companies install special ID codes in their products .
I hope that Finland will move from words to deeds in this issue .
At present , there is no visible prospect of an increase in transparency and public awareness during the Finnish presidential term : they only speak about it .
Madam President , Mrs Halonen , security is one of the main causes of concern for the citizens of Europe .
The idea of a common policy on asylum and supranational burden sharing sounds fine , but it will be very difficult to put into practice .
This is something that you also proposed , Mrs Halonen .
Recently , there have been suggestions that responsibility for co-operation in police and legal matters should be transferred from the Third Pillar to the Community .
This would , I imagine , make co-operation easier .
For that reason , we should consider at greater length the good and bad aspects of the proposal .
The question of transferring responsibility to a common authority will become of serious interest only if we want to establish supranational police squads for the Union .
I warmly support the idea to set up a working party to discuss the issue .
Madam President , given the time available , it will unfortunately be impossible to answer in sufficient detail all those questions that have been asked here , but we have made a note of them and in subsequent discussions and preparatory work , I shall try with all the means at my disposal to take account of the ideas expressed in them and provide you with additional information in a suitable manner .
The question raised by several speakers on the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is , obviously , in an indirect sense , the idea behind the meeting at Tampere , as we are preparing to take a new step forward to ensure for our citizens a safer EU area than before , although the drafting of the Charter is not actually the theme of the debate at Tampere .
As for European representation at Tampere , you may know that Mrs Fontaine , now presiding , will be present at the start of the meeting .
First , I will deal with Mr Pirker ' s question regarding immigration strategy .
As for the Eurodac Regulation , we are attempting to have it approved now during the Finnish presidential term , and you may know that we are awaiting a new report by the European Parliament on the matter .
I agree with you that Europe should not shut others out , but that it must be porous in its relations with the outside world .
We are members of the UN , the Council of Europe and the OSCE , and , for precisely these reasons , we are also able to create natural relations with the rest of the world .
Speaking on behalf of his group , Mr Sepp√§nen raised the issue of Europol surveillance .
To the question asked by Mr Schulz and others on the issue of the legal area and fundamental rights , I would like to state that I stressed that we must build an area of freedom , security and justice on the basis of common values , with respect for human rights and , in the same way , reinforcing the issue of non-discrimination
