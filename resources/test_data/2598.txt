We must follow the usual legislative procedures if we want to find a solution to this issue .
If this is really the Union 's strategy for Johannesburg , it is my sincere opinion that Johannesburg will become Rio-10 , not Rio+10 .
Lastly , Mr Aznar , as environmentalists , we were quite sure that little would be achieved in these six months in the area of the environment , but it is fair to say that we can derive some pleasure from the fact that , thanks , not least , to a huge public campaign which we wholeheartedly supported , your efforts to use the Council Presidency to further the progress of the national hydrological plan , especially to obtain Union funding for it , and to reform fisheries policy along the lines desired by the Spanish Government have not met with success .
According to this line of reasoning , Albania under the Communist dictator , Enver Hoxha , would have been a perfect partner , for it was impossible for people to emigrate from those countries ; nobody could emigrate from countries under a military regime .
In other words , the Council undertakes to present its strategic programme for the three years to come in consultation with the Commission .
Mr President-in-Office , you were in this House on 20 March .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , today 's debate has highlighted a number of essential issues tackled by the Spanish Presidency , with regard to which I would like to make a few brief remarks .
This concern has then been heightened by the difficulties encountered by the meeting held in Bali to prepare for Johannesburg .
This was an extremely ambitious goal , but the Presidency and the Commission have pursued it resolutely and successfully .
I must say that this is a good way of working , that we have had at least 30 or 40 telephone conversations in these six months and that it is precisely because of this ongoing cooperation that we have been able to work for the common good .
In other words , it will enable us to respect the term of the Presidencies of the institutions whilst facilitating long-term planning .
Mr President , in the dim and distant past - 1963 - I met Mr Turchi 's father .
Excise duty is a word which , associating as I do with pensioners and on the basis of my own personal experience , reminds me of liqueurs , beer , wine and Martini .
It would be - and it will be , if we succeed - a major undertaking , but Mr Rübig is famous in this House for representing small and medium-sized undertakings .
The chauffeur would be Mr Vatanen and President Prodi would , of course , be the parish priest .
However , we are in favour of their use being regulated , as , moreover , the international situation demands : 50 million hectares of land are cultivated in the world using GMOs compared with only 12 000 hectares in Europe .
This should prompt us to investigate the state of European research , and the role of Europe in the WTO and the - often unregulated , uncontrolled - use of products containing GMOs in developing countries .
Moreover , it would not appear appropriate to require economic operators to provide evidence of the quality of scientific tests , which , moreover , would be a unilateral requirement since not even the Cartagena Protocol gives any significant consideration to the issue of accountability , putting off any analysis even of the principles until after 4 years from the Protocol 's entry into force .
The European People 's Party 's attempt to repropose in plenary the line already overthrown in the Environment Committee must be firmly rejected .
Then another point which gives cause for concern is the lack of adequate measures in respect of the accidental presence of traces of genetically modified products .
Baia Mare , Aznalcóllar and , in particular , Toulouse and Enschede , have become synonymous with human and environmental tragedies to which we have a responsibility to provide a clear response .
In practice , the proposal modifies two fundamental criteria : the minimum thresholds for the presence of substances in sites and the inclusion or reclassification of new activities or dangerous substances , in order to strengthen controls and reinforce accident prevention .
Lastly , the accident in Toulouse , which occurred at a time of growing insecurity , has left a lasting impression in the minds of us all .
I would like to end by thanking all my colleagues who have taken part in and contributed to this process and the committee 's secretariat .
Therefore , Mr President , my group will vote against this report .
I would , however , stress that the report seems to be a repeat of documents which have already been adopted by the Member States and that , in my opinion , it does not represent much progress .
The report addresses the sensitive issue of sexual and reproductive health and rights , women 's reproductive health and the dissemination of contraceptive practices , it focuses at length on a policy of health and sexual education policy for young people , and , of course , it is also concerned with unwanted pregnancies and abortion .
Mrs Van Lancker does not undermine the principle of subsidiarity in this extremely balanced report .
Out of respect for grammar and the institutions , the amendment should read as follows : ' The financial framework for the implementation of this Regulation for the period 2000 to 2006 shall be EUR 4700 million and shall be subject to a mid-term review based on the implementation of this Regulation ? .
As I said yesterday in this House , most issues still outstanding have been
