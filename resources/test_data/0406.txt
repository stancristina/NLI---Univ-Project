Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is our duty to the victims of Haiti to help them rebuild a country that was devastated even before a natural disaster turned it completely on its head .
Thus , while we commend the United States ' support efforts , we must be on guard and refuse to allow the North American leaders to use this terrible disaster as a pretext to occupy the island , to run it and to establish military bases there .
