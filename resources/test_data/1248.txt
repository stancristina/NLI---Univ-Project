and accused of blasphemy .
This event is a tragic illustration of developments in Pakistan where freedom of expression and human rights are not respected .
What does the Commission intend to do in order to support those groups which are working to promote human rights and to establish the principles of the constitutional state ?
It would be more natural to hold the best pupil in the class up as a model .
Unemployment is at less than 4 per cent , and the country also has a genuine budget surplus .
The EU has therefore been too hasty in issuing a warning to Ireland , since the situation of the country is being disregarded .
The Netherlands now has higher inflation .
For Ireland , the threat of inflation is mainly from external sources , but the EU and yourself are demanding internal measures to get inflation down .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union ' s criticism of Ireland ' s economic policy is controversial .
Against the background of the crisis in the Nineties , it is therefore perhaps only reasonable for the EU to react .
However , that is why we must not forget our experiences of the crisis during the Nineties .
As long as only one small country infringes the guidelines it has itself accepted , the problem may seem small .
Now , however , there are worrying signs that more countries may be doing this , in which case it will be important to send out warning signals early on .
If we take part in EMU, we shall lose our economic independence .
The EU has issued a recommendation .
It will take time to restore confidence .
Overall , I think the Commission ' s proposal is a good one .
A transitional period will be required , but this is a justified aspiration and will pave the way for an acceptance of principles oriented more towards the market economy .
We cannot go on producing for meat mountains .
That means that more will need to be done .
Firstly , there are budgetary reasons concerned with making it possible to tackle the whole of this operation successfully .
We have for a long time been familiar with the problems and the reasons for these .
Mr President , let me begin by saying that I am a little surprised to see this report before the plenary sitting , because we in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities originally decided that it should only be adopted in the Committee .
I am sympathetic to Mrs Avilés Perea' s personal views on the issues of refugees , asylum seekers and immigrants .
I completely share the view that they must be accorded human rights , but the report as a whole does not attach enough importance to these issues .
The six priority areas listed in the Commission ' s report are well chosen .
Another of Parliament ' s important remarks concerns the Commission ' s priority number five : transport .
Helping to develop capacity around these forms of technology must be an important component of any development strategy .
The Americans and the British have made statements emphasising that the actions were taken in self-defence , as well as the fact that they were routine and must not be seen as an escalation of , or change to , the policy .
That was the Secretary General ' s reference to the high-level talks which have just now been concluded between the UN' s Secretary-General and Iraq ' s Foreign Minister and which therefore took place last Monday .
The common foreign and security policy is being developed gradually at the pace decided by the Member States and will obviously be that much stronger if the EU' s Member States hold a common view .
It might also be noted that the American Secretary of State , Colin Powell , has recently come out in favour of an overhaul of the American policy of sanctions .
It is important for the Iraqi Government to cooperate if it is to be possible to implement such a programme .
Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra put a number of questions to the Council , for example concerning the sanctions .
I believe it is extremely important that we should have a common view of the purpose behind the international community ' s action against Iraq .
Those demands do not , for example , include any change to the government in Iraq - that is a matter for the Iraqi people - but Resolution No 687 states very clearly what is required if it is going to be possible to lift the sanctions against Iraq .
Within the framework of the reforms being worked on by the UN Security Council , there is intensive discussion of the effectiveness of sanctions as a tool .
As was mentioned here in the debate , the issue is also being discussed of whether what are called smart sanctions should be introduced which , by being more specific and more clearly directed against those whom they are intended to affect , would be aimed at minimising the suffering of the civilian population .
Clearly , this may appear to be an attractive idea in itself , in view of what that man has done .
That is , unfortunately , impossible with the current regime .
I look forward to a continued exchange of views as to how we can strengthen international law even where Iraq is concerned .
Those people who have been smuggled in or who have , by some other method , made their way into the European Union have often suffered great tragedies on the way .
That practice , whereby a visa requirement is the rule rather than the exception , is unworthy of a democratic Europe .
