be covered by a basic instrument , there are several that have been made by the Commission to protect the Community 's financial interests .
The aim of this Draft Amending Budget is to establish fixed amounts for the EU of 25 .
The forest fires last summer in Portugal left a trail of death and devastation – 11 % of forests and 5 % of Portuguese territory caught fire .
We therefore regret that , when the reference amounts for the programme were being adapted , the opportunity was not taken to consider the needs of enlargement , in order to adjust aims and increase appropriations .
We refer to complementary programmes to the actions of Member States in fields such as the sixth research and development programme , the framework programme in favour of culture , Forest Focus for the protection of forests , Life III , public health , youth , education , including Socrates , and many others .
Worse still , the adjustment made to take account of the needs of enlargement is only EUR 10 million , or EUR 2 million per year .
At present , under the current legislation , when an official vessel of a Member State detects and pursues on the high seas or from the high seas , a vessel suspected of illicit drug trafficking , which is flying the flag of another Member State , it cannot take any action against it without obtaining the prior authorisation of the flag Member State .
We therefore need to find fresh ways of combating this type of crime .
Overall , the proposed amendments are aimed at improving the situation of the victims .
Among the good points were Recital L: ‘Failure by the Community legislature to achieve good quality in law-making can itself be detrimental to the correct understanding and application of Community law’ ; and‘its desire to see enhanced cooperation between parliamentarians in the European Parliament and Parliaments of Member States’ These points were sufficient for me to vote in favour .     .
Such pre-emptive action must involve closer collaboration with national parliaments and meticulous compliance with the principles of subsidiarity , proportionality and appropriateness .     .
This will make use of European cooperation between national police forces involving Europol and take into consideration the results of cooperation between intelligence services in the fight against terrorism .     .
Since the events of 11 September , terrorism has become a genuine threat .
I should like to highlight criticism in the report of the agreement being negotiated between the EU and the USA concerning the transfer of transatlantic passengers ’ personal data , which it deems illegal .
The report makes various general recommendations , which I welcome .
The common position submitted by the Council tallies with the positions previously adopted by Parliament .
Even though most of Parliament’s proposals on extending the Daphne Programme until 2008 had already been accepted , and even after funding had been increased to EUR 50 billion , we voted in favour of the rapporteur’s position .
Portugal is in exactly the same situation as Spain .     .
I should also like to point out that the original aim of this entire process was to bypass the Court of Auditors ’ criticism of the financing by certain groups in Parliament of their respective ‘European parties’ .
Otherwise , the transparency of these decisions is compromised .
I must reiterate the need – in accordance with the principles of appropriateness and proportionality – for provisions , especially financial provisions , concerning political parties at European level , to be extended and actually applied to all political parties at European level , without discrimination and regardless of whether or not they are part of European political parties or European alliances of political parties .
Food and animal feed must be safe for human and animal health .
The proposals contained in the report fall short of what is required , despite a number of welcome proposals , such as the application of the same ...     .
I am aware that this is a subject that has long been a priority area for the EU and , as such , I endorse the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
While we steadfastly oppose the misappropriation and commercialisation of human knowledge and of what is part of human heritage , we acknowledge the difficulty of striking a balance between legitimate property rights and the social and collective benefits of the item concerned .
Nonetheless , the rejection of certain amendments , especially those relating to the ‘federalist ’ tendency , in which caution was nowhere to be seen , led us to vote against .     .
We must launch an awareness-raising campaign , as soon as possible , in collaboration with these professionals .     .
Under the Italian Presidency , we were finally able to conclude an agreement on the minimum provisions applicable in the field of combating drugs at Community level .
After years of discussion in Council , an agreement was concluded last November on the minimum provisions applicable in the Community-level fight against drugs , and this agreement has been submitted once again for the consideration of the European Parliament .
I voted in favour .     .
Mechanisms for this purpose already exist , however , and so there is no need to create new instruments that remove tasks which fall strictly within the competence of the national authorities and which are sovereign Member State responsibilities .
Nevertheless , given the intergovernmental nature of border control and in light of the experience that each of the Member States has acquired in performing this task , I believe that each Member State should be represented on the Agency’s Management Board to ensure that it can benefit from the skills and knowledge acquired ‘on the ground ’ by each country at its own borders .
