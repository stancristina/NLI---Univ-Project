It must also be possible for every country that wishes to do so and that fulfils the stated requirements to become a Member of the EU.
We must be tolerant , and we must be good neighbours .
That is something that also emerged extremely clearly from Lech Walesa’s speech yesterday .
It is at least as important that trade unions exert influence upon developments in individual workplaces and so achieve better working environments .
I believe that it can be a success and a win-win situation .
I myself come from the Baltic area and live in Sweden .
When we invest , we must do so in new , clean technology that also creates sustainable development and makes for long-term , rather than just short-term , growth .
We have demanded more of the present candidate countries than we did of previous ones .
It should be possible to deal with infringements of minority rights in accordance with Article 7 of our present Treaty , in which case a Member State’s own rights would be revoked if it infringed minority rights .
Why is that the case ?
The new Swedish party , the June List , which I represent , stood for election on both these issues , and we have been given a powerful political mandate to combat the continued transfer of political power from the Member States to Brussels and to help ensure that European taxpayers ’ money is used efficiently and honourably .
We do not want a common tax policy or social policy .
Northern Italy ’s independent city states during the Renaissance and the host of German states during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries provided European history with periods of greatness .
The Commission and other EU institutions have so far had far too few women .
If you are elected , Mr Barroso , how many women will there be in the Commission ?
That is much too vague and woolly .
I think it important to say that today , because there are many who have maintained the opposite when it comes to Europe’s ability to contribute to freedom and peace .
The challenge now is also to make the European Union better .
On the contrary , the development of the former is an asset for us all and will help bring vitality to the European economy .
Both the Member States and the European Union must now do something that will take Europe forwards .
This must be an important task for the European Union .
Now , they are , in fact , happening again .
He appears to want to follow in the footsteps of another dictator , Fidel Castro , who is equally past his sell-by date .
In spite of countless attempts to influence the regime using the carrot and stick method , we have failed , and failed totally .
Peaceful demonstrators are arrested , tortured and given prison sentences following trials that smack of nothing more than farce .
Many people who have called the regime into question have disappeared in mysterious circumstances .
The official pressure must be intensified .
It is important to use this knowledge and to be creative in finding ways of supporting the forces of democracy in Belarus .
With EU enlargement , Belarus has become a neighbouring country of the EU , giving cause for increased contacts in those areas where such contacts are possible .
Right now , it is , however , unlikely that contacts will be improved as long as there is no decisive turnaround in the policy conducted in Belarus .
That distribution of power that is central to a democracy is at present absent from Belarus .
That is unacceptable from a democratic point of view .
Together , we must act to bring about increased support for democratic development in Belarus and must combat that isolation of Belorussian society and of the Belorussian people that many have talked about .
We do not regret the fact that there is a surplus in the EU budget , but welcome the fact that this will lead to reduced membership fees for the EU Member States .
The overarching principle should first of all be that the EU’s total budget expenditure should not exceed one per cent of the EU countries ’ combined GDP.
We do not believe that the EU should commit itself to far-reaching transfers between countries and regions .
Each country should thus be able to refrain from receiving subsidies and so be able to reduce its total gross contribution to the EU.
It is only for national parliaments to deduct taxes and duties .
My last point is that the EU must have a budgeting margin within the framework of the ceiling on expenditure so that the EU can act quickly in crisis situations .
A review of agricultural aid may , in the longer term , create scope for aid to countries with the weakest economies .
Most of these are children .
The surrounding world is aware of what is happening in Sudan but , in spite of this , is powerless to act faced with this humanitarian tragedy .
It is important to bear two principles in mind .
The action would thus have the support of the African countries , which would facilitate a lasting solution .
The plans for an EU intervention in the Sudan conflict also give the impression of being a springboard for the creation of an EU army able to act without a UN mandate .
In that way , the intervention would also take place within the framework of international law .
To those who wonder whether that is the case , I can put a question : have you ever stood in the thick of a raging war and really wished that some outside force – the United States , the EU or NATO – would come and intervene in your country
