As , however , energy consumption is growing by 1 % a year , the same limits must be achieved for coal as those we are now imposing on oil .
Mr President , we all have good reason to support Mr Poggiolini 's endeavours to improve the EU 's ecolabels , but the truth is the eco-labelling system is not working at the present time .
The Commission calls this harmonization .
It would be best if the Commissioner for the Environment , who is from Denmark , were to agree to take out of the Commission 's proposal the point relating to the proposed withdrawal of the alternative labels in five years ' time , because it might mean that perhaps the world 's best eco-label system , the Nordic Swan , will meet its death .
I would now ask everyone if this beautiful eco-flower should administer the deathblow to our swan , among others , which works so very well .
Eco-labelling is practically the only means environmental policy-makers have that provides the consumer with information on the environment when that consumer makes meaningful purchasing decisions .
It is visible and reliable .
It is not known any more among manufacturers than it is among consumers .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection voted on whether we would get rid of national eco-labels .
Now I hope that debate on the matter in the part-session will result in a decision that the national labels will be replaced only if the common European eco-label proves to be better than any single national label .
Mr President , the Commission 's communication now being debated by the European Parliament on the working principles and aims of education and youth programmes in the next millennium is of vital importance to the citizens of the Union .
The reform of the education and youth programmes is not just a technical process but a great opportunity to hold discussions on just those European values we wish to base our future on .
The active participation of citizens is best helped by a motivating European youth policy that offers , furthermore , a variety of learning contexts outside the classroom .
The role of national organizations in lifelong learning should be given more weight .
Through interaction we can achieve partnerships and forms of cooperation that will open up new opportunities for personal development and finding employment .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Philip Whitehead , whose report balances the points of view splendidly and goes into the problem in depth , at the same time skilfully managing not to bring the two attitudes to a head .
A new media industry , however , requires a new approach .
The old , paternal-style control from on high simply will not work with the new services , and the Commission suggests self-regulation as a solution to the problem .
This really must lead to the creation of an industry , rights of use and services with providers .
If they were , the problem would be eliminated .
No internationally-based agreement can work unless there is practical commitment through ongoing cross-border partnership .
The insistence on unanimity among Member States is extremely damaging , and only serves to allow one large country to put pressure on others .
The unofficial agreement to share the president 's term of office is fortunately only part of an unworthy show , as it will not be legally binding .
I would like to make a few critical observations regarding the hearings .
This we simply cannot accept .
But I would say , let last week 's hearings serve as a starting point for future dialogue between the Central Bank and the European Parliament .
This will be quite a challenge for the European Parliament .
But I am convinced that the general public will also agree on how important it is for the European Parliament to monitor the work of the Central Bank .
Mr President , in the talks Members have conducted on the nomination of the ECB Executive Board , it has been frequently mentioned that the Bank must endeavour to achieve the greatest possible openness and always keep Parliament informed of its activity .
In this respect the European Parliament could act as one side in an excellent partnership .
It is therefore obvious that power cannot be completely unaccountable .
Money , especially monetary policy , is not at all a neutral subject .
The hearings were important .
It must be said that the Bank system must be awfully delicate if it cannot allow one no-vote , not even in Parliament .
I am wary of the opinion that the European Parliament should be some kind of press outlet for the Central Bank .
Its key target should be greater employment .
That is the biggest problem in the Union .
Certain candidates for the Central Bank 's Board have not conceded that monetary policy could have different effects in various parts of the euro area .
The European Central Bank must also take account of the possibility of asymmetrical shockwaves affecting the economy when it determines appropriate monetary policy in Europe .
Mr President , I was a little surprised just now .
My report in no way deals with rare diseases , but very common ones .
Forty thousand people in the European Union die from air pollution every year , so there has been an unfortunate misunderstanding somewhere .
The European Parliament can today congratulate itself on giving its support to a ban on tobacco advertising in the European Union .
It thus also evaded a wolf in sheep 's clothing , i .e . mainly German representatives , who are trying to water down the whole tobacco advertising ban issue with arguments relating to health , and legalistic distortions .
Now is also our last chance to
