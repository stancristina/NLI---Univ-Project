' and withdrew from the coalition .
As we are all aware here , to scorn the freedom of the press is to attack human dignity , violate man 's quest for truth and thwart his full potential and we wanted to express this in the simplest terms possible .
However , there is another debate which I think , as a parliamentarian , involves questioning if it is conceivable nowadays to keep all these conventions , all these different conventions , and accept that these countries are not going to comply with them .
That is why I think that Europe needs to do more than just offer words of support and compassion ; we need to send out a strong message of our desire to stand by the people suffering the physical and psychological effects of this disaster .
For months we have heard that incessant rain has caused serious flooding in numerous regions of France .
Madam President gave me a positive reply and I thank her for that .
It is to be expected that we should express our desire for solidarity with this resolution .
It is a sign of progress that everyone here today acknowledges this .
I do believe that we should really be able to take the dimension of employment into account , and that is possible without amending the Treaties , simply by adapting legislation , because the Treaties already set the Commission the task of monitoring the effects of these decisions on employment .
We must adopt the directive on worker involvement in the European company and ensure that their representatives participate in supervisory committees and boards of directors where the decisions are taken .
You mentioned it yourself and it is cautious and to my mind , quite inadequate .
Mr President , Commissioner , this morning , the President of the European Parliament received employees from the Strasbourg branch of Marks & Spencer .
This position is no different , however , from that of the German government , which expressed its views at the Stockholm European Council and thereby sought to demonstrate its concern to develop an alternative in Europe to what here we would call the British blueprint for totally liberalising the energy sectors .
Instead of contributing to speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation , should the Commission , when presented with any new proposal , not undertake a study of the consequences of plans for liberalisation on employment , on working conditions and regional planning ?
We also have a programme covering Euratom research activities and then two programmes covering the activities of the Joint Research Centre , in the non-nuclear and nuclear fields respectively .
For example , there are opportunities in the specific programme to undertake clinical trials for cancer and degenerative diseases , which are some of the new possibilities opened up by genomics .
I believe that the dialogue established with the Commission will enable us to further clarify this determination to create the European Research Area .
I think that the current shortcomings are well known .
You are aware that we have the Marie Curie programme , which is a success , but we would like to double the resources in the proposals allocated to assisting the mobility of young researchers , and also to create grants to attract researchers to Europe , so that Europe once again becomes an attractive option for the best researchers in the world including third countries .
My second question concerns the instruments .
It is difficult to adapt to change and this is to be expected .
Studies of this type are planned .
At the Lisbon Summit , it was acknowledged that 25 to 50 % of the economy is related to knowledge and therefore to research and innovation .
First of all , let me take the content of the priorities .
We are managing 14 000 projects .
This idea must go forward , however , with , of course , a dialogue between the various scientific communities .
We oppose any form of European nationalism .
The only clear issue , which is putting an end to the second Member of the Commission for the larger States , seems to hold little interest for us .
First and foremost , let us find a better way to involve citizens in the preparation of the future of the Union .
Power on the one hand , democracy on the other .
It is a useful treaty , but it is a short-term treaty .
How can we reinforce the community of values , the community of solidarity which has existed between us for the past fifty years ?
Mr President , I should like to start by offering my very sincere thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission for the information which they have given us about the Union mission to North Korea .
Secondly , the Environment Council to be held a week after Gothenburg needs to take account of the demands of the European Parliament for the Sixth Framework Programme .
They should be free to decide what to do - as long as they are efficient .
Article 225a of the Treaty of Nice provides for the facility to create judicial panels to hear at first instance certain classes of action brought in specific areas .
I think that in certain areas we have , without doubt , tried to be diligent , to foster transparency , to foster greater budgetary prudence , a more efficient system , clearer , more transparent , faster application of standards for the beneficiaries of our aid , for those who implement some of our budgets , wherever there were shortcomings , and there are shortcomings , it must be said .
Its Kramer versus Kramer
