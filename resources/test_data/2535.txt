like to go a step further and make a connection with greater mobility in pay policy .
That is the everyday existence of more than 500 , 000 women annually .
Here , economic need is particularly great , and women have no other way of feeding their families and so become the puppets of dubious sponsors who promise them an income and prosperity in western Europe .
It is the basis of this agreement that incoming and outgoing mail cancel each other out and thereby create a national balance .
That is the problem in a nutshell .
We are currently reviewing the second one , which has been modified in line with the ideas we expressed there .
That is what I wanted to say about the questions .
How do you want to handle things generally ?
Yet things have not turned out so well and considerable problems still remain .
That is why we are looking for a directive proposal and do not want to have to wait so long for it .
And this is precisely where the problem lies : we , the Commission , have not succeeded in making this clear , as I can inform Mrs Schmidbauer too .
Why ?
As I said , though , the Commission is not keen to turn the tables and say : why have you decided everything this way ?
This was the reason for the delay , for the long consultation period , and in the end the Commission had to submit a new proposal .
We can live very well with that and it fully satisfies our requirements under the world trade agreement government purchases annex .
So I would like to know which of Mr HÃ¤nsch 's predecessors made the same request for the same privilege .
Secondly , this is a general resolution affecting all Presidents of this House .
I think this satisfies our political intentions linked to this reserve .
The Commission followed the advice , and both Council and Parliament supported this approach .
And I reminded you that it was precisely during the last Luxembourg Presidency that the budget procedure did not have a successful outcome .
Madam President , the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has frequently had to deal with the question of how the phasing-in of the ECSC policies is to be combined with the phasing-out of the ECSC.
Winter is upon us , reconstruction is sluggish in many areas , and the Commission has nothing better to do than fail to spend a sum of over ECU 100 million this year in Bosnia .
We expected a partial response to the question of unemployment , this response has been given .
The Council should be aware : this is the result of budget discussions here in this House , where there was a willingness to adhere to the decision or objective from the start of the year .
I want to thank Mr Lenz most sincerely for his close cooperation .
Not only is fresh borrowing not required , but a reserve has been built up too .
This applies not only to the formal cooperation with Parliament but to the subject matter also .
That is bad for Europe 's citizens and bad for the consumers .
This is entirely positive , but does not really go far enough .
Thank you !
Madam Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office , I too would like to join the ranks of those offering their thanks for the successes achieved under this Council presidency .
Thirdly , the Joint Research Centre occupies a distinguished position on the European research landscape .
Point six : a few words on the question of funding .
Nevertheless , I would like to hail the fifth framework programme for research , technological development and demonstration activities a comparatively successful instrument of programming .
Of course we cannot compensate for the decline in research sponsorship in the Member States through our budgetary allocations , but we can create considerable incentives for effective cooperation within the European scientific community and in collaboration with third countries .
Let me say a few words on the Euratom programme , even if Parliament is still being consulted on it .
Thousands of years ago the Chinese built the first ocean-going ships .
It is no secret that I regret cuts having been made in the Euratom programme .
Then the latter-day freebooters , the lobbyists , came along and stood up for particular interests .
All this needs to be fully reflected if we intend to explore and continue to introduce certain technologies .
How will you evaluate the new specification of specified risk materials , even in the Standing Veterinary Committee ?
There is no in-between where BSE is concerned !
But , Mr Fischler , Mrs Bonino , if you had followed our suggestion of including a restriction and not staking everything just on the internal market , we would not have the present situation .
It is not easy to read , but we can read it , and then we know .
Even the title of the Commission 's statement suggests that .
What remains is to continue to work on the Community energy tax , which has failed up to now , and to encourage research , technological development and demonstration of renewable energy resources .
It has been cut to ECU 22 million for two years , which is ridiculous when we have paid ECU 250 million per year for 15 years for fusion .
Those are the first two principles .
In my opinion , the state must fulfil the following tasks , and it is sometimes good to remember them .
The breakdown of the coins , the increasing sizes , recognition by the blind and visually handicapped , also the old , traditional minting methods - all things which we have discussed and decided here - seem vitally important to me .
