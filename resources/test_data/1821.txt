Commission is also interested in hearing points of view on other possible measures which may reduce the effect of sonar on this type of marine animal .
Studies have been carried out by two professors , one from the University of London , Mr Paul Jepson , and the other by Mr Fernández from the University of Las Palmas , published in ‘Nature ’ magazine in November 2003 , which highlight the effect of sonar operations on whales .
As the Commissioner knows , the European Union is currently heading towards some type of defence and security policy .
At least it is already included in the Union Treaty , and I believe that , within the framework of this Union defence and security policy , we must also consider the negative effects of such a policy .
When taking decisions , the Commission will undoubtedly have to consider the aspects within its competence , national responsibility in relation to habitats directives and the Member States’ margin for manoeuvre in applying the precautionary principle and , unquestionably , the specific reservations on military issues which must not stop us from insisting that NATO and the military authorities pay due attention to these problems , particularly in relation to those cases which do not raise specific problems in the short term .     .
With regard to the substance of the constitutional reforms , I would like to reiterate the statement of 29 January .
I will make a comment on your request for information on the sending of observers to the elections .
This solution was enshrined in an agreement between representatives of the government and of the Democratic Coordinator by means of a recall referendum , which is the constitutional mechanism laid down in Venezuela’s Magna Carta , which allows the popular support for the President of the Republic to be revalidated .
Mr President , it is also necessary to call for a redoubling of the European Union 's efforts , with the aim of ensuring that these agreements between the government and the Democratic Coordinator are complied with .
Other procedures could have been used .
But we want this process of restoring constitutional normality to conform to the spirit of the agreement of 29 May 2003 .
The Commission therefore welcomed the beginning of dialogue between the government and the opposition and supported the facilitation of this dialogue by the tripartite group consisting of the Organisation of American States , the Carter Centre and the United Nations Development Programme .
The Commission regrets the climate of violence that has been created , the loss of human lives and many injured and urges the parties to apply the Declaration against Violence and for Peace and Democracy , which they themselves agreed .
Although Parliament must be aware that the Commission cannot have prior knowledge of the result of the discussions taking place in the Council , we cannot exclude at the moment the introduction of new sanctions specifically aimed against the regime and which may be additional or complementary to the existing sanctions .
The Commission is pleased about the visit by Razali , scheduled for the beginning of March , which represents a final attempt to move forward the reconciliation process between the military government and the opposition , headed by Aung San Suu Kyi .
Today , however , we are once again debating this issue , but in rather different circumstances .
Let us be realistic .
The European Union – and this was demonstrated by the European Council , which has just been held – has fully and firmly declared war on terrorism .
To start with , we must make it clear that the new Directive is extremely careful about its potential socio-economic impact , since it does not impose new obligations which were not already contained in the framework directive ; it simply sets out their specific details .
Firstly , the exposure limit value above which no one is permitted to work .
In my capacity as rapporteur , I would like to thank him and all my fellow Members for their contributions and , in particular , the coordinator for the Socialist Group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , Mr Stephen Hughes .
Changes are taking place in the region , a region – as we all know – plagued with difficult structural and economic situations , serious ones , but there are undoubtedly encouraging signs ; there is a shared will amongst the Presidents of the region to move forward pragmatically in the field of economic integration ; there is a new stage for the Central American Bank for Economic Integration , which I believe to be very hopeful ; there are plans for the reform of the integration institutions , in particular fairly thorough reforms of the Central American Parliament and , in this regard , the European Union’s presence and voice must contribute to demonstrating clearly that we do not just indulge in diplomacy when there are situations of conflict , but that we apply the same effort and the same sense of priority which was put into decisively assisting the peace processes in the region , that we still have the will and the determination to aim at improving the political , economic and social situation in a region so devastated by historical and current problems .
As Mr Patten knows better than anyone , we live in a complex world , in which the European Union has both internal responsibilities , such as the birth of the Constitution or enlargement , and also external responsibilities : the new relationship with Russia , our continuing problems in the Balkans , our responsibilities in Central Asia , Iran , Iraq and Afghanistan , the Middle East problem and taking relations with the United States in a new direction .
