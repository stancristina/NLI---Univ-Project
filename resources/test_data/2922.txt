Otherwise , there is agreement that we will now implement a three-year employment initiative which can produce some positive results .
I am pleased that we have managed to set up some tight budget targets and even go on and meet those targets .
And I believe it is important that in the next three years we use our strength precisely to ensure that we in Parliament itself do away with greed and overconsumption and pursue a tight budget line .
Mr President , I agree with Mr Sindal that there is a need to prolong the Seventh Directive .
It is essential that we do not have a period without legislation in this field .
But it is also vital for the US to ratify the OECD agreement .
On the other hand , I am very concerned at the Commission 's proposal for the Council Directive on new rules on aid to the shipbuilding industry .
The Union 's aim must of course be to phase out aid to the shipbuilding industry .
The shipbuilding industry must prepare itself to survive without aid .
I can understand the Commission 's argument that we must have clear rules and not end up in a vacuum if the US does not ratify .
So you - and you in particular , Mr van Miert - must make every effort to put pressure on the US Congress to ratify the OECD agreement by the end of next year .
Madam President , it is slippery outside today , and I fell over and hit my head and so it may be a bit difficult to hear what I have to say .
Things are also slippery for eastern and central Europe on the way to the European Union .
How can we make sure that these countries will not fall over ?
We can go through the "acquis ' .
I would suggest that we prepare ourselves by examining all the legislation and throwing out all the laws which were not confirmed by , say , three years ago .
The Council of Ministers could adopt them , most of them by qualified majority , and Parliament can always throw them out in the cases where there are conciliation procedures .
It would also be to our own advantage .
Should they also join EMU and Schengen in abolishing their borders ?
The summit in Luxembourg would therefore be the start of dividing Europe rather than uniting it .
I think it is important that there should also be room for the small countries such as Luxembourg which is represented here in this chamber by the President of the Commission and the President of the Council .
I would like to end by thanking Luxembourg for an impartial presidency , and so let us not implement institutional changes demanding more power for the larger countries , which might , for example , make it impossible to have two Luxembourgers in leading positions as is the case today .
Mr President , this morning , I thanked the Presidency of the Council for having been so impartial for half a year , and today I would like to thank the Minister of State for coming here and answering questions at question time in person .
But I obviously cannot , as it will be given by the Schengen information system .
My suggestion to the Chairman of the Council would be that a rule be introduced whereby , if suspicions no longer exist , the person suspected is sent the information recorded or that , if this cannot be done because of investigations , that information should be given to an independent control authority so that there is always certainty that having suspicions about someone is taken very seriously .
A dream may well become a nightmare , and I can say that people in Scandinavia regard joining Schengen as containing a number of potential nightmares .
And , given that there are absolutely fatal problems of certainty in law about personal records , passing on and checking names , as the report which was published in the Spring shows , one might of course think that the Council has had some thoughts ( now that it has been resolved to integrate the Schengen system ) on how to resolve these problems of certainty in law , which are undoubtedly of a highly fundamental nature .
Madame President , we need more information to young people on the effects of tobacco , a ban on tobacco advertising and clear labelling .
We should also not be giving ECU 1 billion in tobacco aid to a dreadful tobacco in the EU on the one hand while giving ECU 11.2 billion to fight cancer on the other .
Mr Valverde LÃ³pez 's draft report contains much which is good , but stops just as it is beginning to get important , namely at the fact that the EU is not credible if we admit the risks involved in smoking but still go on producing tobacco .
This is hypocritical , and it is pointless .
I must say that he was unbelievably well paid by the tobacco industry to come and say as much nonsense as possible in a short time .
It is really scandalous .
Madam President , I am deeply shocked at being attacked by a member who cannot bear to hear the truth .
Madam President , I would be grateful if you would report the incident to the Presidency and that the necessary action be taken .
Madam President , I am very sorry about what has happened here .
But I forgive him .
I do not bear any grudge against my colleague .
I hope this will not lead to steps being taken over his conduct .
We will not discuss this .
I do not know what the translation was , but this is a political debate to which I
