This is mainly a translation issue , then .
It is too early at this stage to abolish subsidiarity and force everyone to give up the status quo with its freedom of choice and instead to introduce an opt-in clause .
The debate on constitutional issues could also be harmed because such action could lead to a loss of confidence in the EU.
The United States itself has not harmonised its legislation , for example .
Finally , we politicians must not legislate as soon as we see a phenomenon we do not like .
I am referring , in this case , to the French legislation and its disparaging concept , sectaire , for this is no edifying concept .
It is only when it is known which types of document are really to be made public that there can be talk of genuine success and increased openness .
Moreover , the political front lines will probably not be the usual ones .
We support Amendment No 61 concerning the supervision clause .
We have a situation , for example in Great Britain , in which 44 per cent of all e-traders do not know that they are contravening this directive .
Moreover , people do not know what service they can obtain .
We are constantly seeing different forms of spamming .
We have received different information about this .
The whole group must therefore be banned .
No amendment was therefore really needed here in the plenary sitting .
A better word in English would have been certification which , in translation , will obviously be clearer in the other language versions too .
Report ( A5-0280/2001 ) by Mr BÃ¶sch , on behalf of the Committee on Petitions , on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2000 [C5-0302/2001 - 2001/2043(COS) ] ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I choose to vote against the position adopted by my political group when it comes to the rules about sending out unsolicited advertisements to consumers via e-mail .
In the light of this , I consider that only an opt-in solution can effectively protect consumers from unsolicited advertisements .
My position on this issue has influenced my vote in the final vote on this report .
This is being seen for the first time now that a Swedish environmental study has shown that high brominated flame retardants , which were considered to be less dangerous than low brominated flame retardants , are also bioaccumulative , having been found in peregrine falcon eggs in Sweden .
This has now proved not to be the case .
A majority of Parliament chose to await the risk assessment that is at present under way in the case of decaBDEs .
The proposal is aimed at amending Article 3 of the Ombudsman' s statute so that the Ombudsman also has access to classified documents within the EU.
The Christian aid organisation , Shelter Now International has just recently been excluded from Afghanistan and forced to discontinue its activities .
Mr Patten , Mr Michel and also Mr Solana are acting to protect these people .
I still feel strongly for the families of those still missing .
I am convinced that , at the same time as we ourselves feel the horror of this event , there are millions upon millions of people out there in the world who have actually rejoiced in this act of terrorism .
This fills me with incredible horror and fear , as it means that we are facing a world in which there are millions of potential terrorists and perpetrators of similar outrages .
We all remember the Vietnam War , for example .
Is it a social war which , in one way or another , lies behind recent events or which is being declared through them ?
Otherwise , we shall never be safe , despite carpet-bombing and despite all the security services in the world .
Religious leaders have a particular responsibility .
In 1999 , Sweden became the first and only country in the EU to have this type of extra-territorial legislation , which hopefully will now make it possible to bring to book those Swedes who put their daughters through 'summer holiday circumcision ' abroad .
It is high time that we took strong measures to save the two million girls around the world who , each year , are at risk of genital mutilation .
The mortality rate among those who are subjected to this practice is high .
Several Members have highlighted the need to cooperate with religious leaders .
This would provide a clear signal that female genital mutilation is illegal at home and illegal abroad and that such mutilation constitutes a violation of human rights .
Eight percent of EU citizens , or around twelve million people , have felt harassed in the workplace during the past twelve months .
We also know that those who are harassed suffer more stress than others .
Harassment naturally has consequences for the individual , who feels less well , is absent from work more often and is ill more often .
In recent years , we have increasingly started to talk about more job opportunities and better workplaces , that is , about the quality of working life .
Quality in working life is about health and safety and the organisation of work , and so harassment in the workplace is a problem .
Firstly , we have to review the definition of harassment and , at the same time , try to obtain a common definition .
The Lisbon Process also includes qualitative indicators .
Women in particular are affected by atypical jobs , insecure employment , etc .
In that case , we shall have to conduct an analysis , but I find it pretty incomprehensible why the possibility of legislation should be ruled out in advance .
Let me take
