Part of the reasoning behind the programme is to serve as a symbol of cross-Atlantic cooperation , and so it needs to be as widely known as possible .
In this , too , I have received positive feedback from the other concerned parties , and I trust that it is one that can be discussed in greater length in time for the next agreement in 2005 .
I personally think we should consider the following names of statesmen associated with US-European relations : Churchill , Eisenhower or Lafayette , any of whom in my opinion would be an appropriate name for this programme .
Bowe report ( A5-0032/2001 )
.
There is much to be welcomed in the new directive when compared to its predecessor .
I particularly welcome the recognition of the possible wider direct and indirect effects and risks of the release of GMOs into the environment .
I am pleased that there will be a public register of the location of GMOs whether deliberately released or placed on the market .
The requirement concerning the termination of unauthorised releases also clarifies the need for a consistent response .
However , I regret the delay on the ban of antibiotic markers and the qualification attached to this ban , the streamlining and setting of shorter deadlines for the authorisation procedures and a number of other factors in this final result .
I have therefore abstained in the vote .
The whole regulatory package is not yet clear : for example in relation to liability and the export to non-GMO states .
Neither am I convinced that the research capability currently exists to fully assess the factors contained in the directive .
The needs of our environment and biodiversity should be paramount in this area .
I do not believe that is the currently the position of Council .
Madam President , I also welcome today 's vote on copyright and the information society .
This has been a very controversial and difficult area to legislate in but today we have achieved a victory for common sense .
We can be confident that in our vote we are providing - for example , in Amendment No 5 - protection for rightholders against potential Internet piracy and we have also knocked out some amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group which would have been very damaging for rightholders .
At the same time we are not denying access of citizens to the brave new world of the information society and , in particular , to the more disadvantaged users and communities .
Today 's vote means that we can now sign up to the WIPO Treaty and we can give international copyright protection to our creative industries .
The computer games industry in my own region represents a third of the computer games world market .
We need to protect these industries which create jobs and boost our economy - not just locally , but in the European domain .
We can now look forward to future reviews of legislation and the work of the contact committee to ensure that there is no violation or abuse of copyright on the Internet or any limitation on genuine private use or fair use .
.
Like other Members who spoke at the beginning of this debate , I have abstained in the vote because I am a rightholder in the field of television documentary archive and books .
None of these interests are directly involved in any financial gain for me should the amendments be passed , and in any event - in common with the rapporteur , Mr Boselli - I am opposed to many of them .
Nevertheless , it is the wisest course to abstain and to congratulate Mr Boselli on his successful negotiation of a report which comes so close to the common position and the balance which it achieved .
.
This Parliament can be proud today that it has voted to enhance disability rights .
In particular , this report is a victory for disabled transport users .
It has taken nine years to get this legislation .
The new technical standards we voted for will ensure that wheelchair access is available for public transport .
It creates minimum safety standards and puts in place access requirements which will be good for elderly people with reduced mobility and parents with prams boarding urban buses .
It is regrettable that the PPE-DE tried on a technical issue to get rid of this legislation with Amendment No 9 .
The European Disability Forum and Parliament 's Disability Rights Intergroup have campaigned long and hard on this issue .
It is cynical political manipulation to play games with disability rights .
With the vote on this legislation we can as Parliament say we are legislating for all citizens for equal access and equal rights .
.
May I wholeheartedly congratulate my Labour colleague Mr Miller on his report improving accessibility in vehicles with more than eight seats .
I fully support measures to improve accessibility for people of reduced mobility to urban buses with the introduction of ramps or lifts and low floor buses .
This will transform the lives of older people , people with disabilities and parents with children living in towns across the North-West who will now be able to use local buses as easily as everybody else .
Moreover , it is not just elderly people , people with disabilities - including blind people - and parents with children who will benefit .
We are seeking to broaden the definition of "people with reduced mobility " to include everyone who has difficulty when using public transport , such as those with heavy luggage , pregnant women and people with shopping trolleys and shopping bags .
We have all experienced getting on the bus laden with shopping bags from the local supermarket , and I for one certainly hope my bus ride
