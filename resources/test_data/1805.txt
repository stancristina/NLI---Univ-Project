.
But , on this issue , I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council .
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper .
In addition , however , and very importantly , because it is a transition period , there will be training , there will be advice , there will be support , there will be assurances .
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition .
Two other points I must make , because this is an essential question central to reform .
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia .
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline .
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials , the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system .
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring .
Lastly , the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable .
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction .
Change will have to come in any case , change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another .
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have , I am certain that we have installed , or that we will install on the basis of our proposals , a system that will provide the Union , its taxpayers and this House with complete security .
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that , apart from its own inherent merits , reform will be made necessary by accession , the enlargements , and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in .
It is essential that we have that reform , both for the sake of the current Union , and certainly to facilitate accessions .
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started , together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously , of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States .
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering .
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities , the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market , it will be difficult to see the joins .
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see .
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it .
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David ' s Day .
Thank you for the presentation .
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public .
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time .
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome , but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork .
Excessive paperwork .
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control ?
That is a clear complaint that we get .
That needs to be addressed .
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee .
This , of course , is welcome , but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure .
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee ' s work ?
Finally , the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged , as Mr Prodi says , by your actions , not your words .
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words .
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words , but we will try to lead by example .
As far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan .
We detest the excess of paper , but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control , sometimes the requirements of administration , which some call bureaucracy , are unavoidable .
