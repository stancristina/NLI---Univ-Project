Who could sleep peacefully with bombs under the bed ?
Mr President , I wish to thank rapporteur van Dam for the successful preparation of the report .
As is the case in many matters concerning marine safety , these rules are also agreed at the International Maritime Organisation on a voluntary basis .
Along with a further tightening of the rules , care must be taken that the decisions made are realistic and feasible .
Questions of safety and liability must , as far as possible , be dealt with on a worldwide basis .
The matter needs to be given a rapid passage , even though the common position of the Council has not included all the proposals of the Parliament 's first reading .
The Commission 's proposal for a common form for ports is a sensible step ( even though on this occasion it does not arouse political passions ) towards the simplification of port formalities .
For once we are getting a proposal from the Commission which does not increase bureaucracy in any way .
I support the Commission 's proposal , and take the view that we should welcome it with open arms .
I have made a few technical adjustments which are in line with the Council of Ministers ' preliminary position .
I also thank the members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , who succeeded in keeping the political animal which lurks in all of us under control , and did not churn out revisions of their own .
The general adoption of the IMO 's FAL documents will promote the efficient functioning of the common market , and it definitely represents a welcome improvement .
The significance of my report does , in fact , largely hinge on the question of whether we will have the courage also to approve the Commission 's proposal for deregulating port services .
Finally , I wish to give thanks once again for the cooperation of the Commission and of the Council .
Europe needs constructive action and less politically-motivated confrontation .
Ladies and gentlemen , the rudder is set .
Mr President , I , too , would like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Vatanen , for his excellent preparatory work , which aims to ensure the rapid passage of this important business .
Most Member States have already signed the IMO 's Convention on the facilitation of maritime traffic .
By clear , uniform yet flexible procedures , shipping will be made a more attractive alternative mode of transport .
There may be a particularly positive impact on local shipping .
Since several forms are in use , attention needs to be given , in the future , to how electronic communications can be better utilised .
Our group supports the approval of the report and its rapid passage through the legislative process .
My group interprets the wording used in the first amendment to mean that there is now no proper procedure at all .
On the basis of the above , my group feels that the amendment puts Parliament in a bad light , unduly and unfairly .
Since the beginning of September , we have intervened in this matter on four separate occasions : first orally , then by e-mail , following which all the Finnish Members signed and dispatched a letter to the Quaestors on 2 October ; finally , I raised the matter once again during the first session in October .
Finland is , technologically , at the top of the league ; and we are ashamed of such behaviour .
Mr President , it is probably indisputable that Europe-wide public opinion is demanding an immediate end to the animal cruelty associated with the transportation of live animals .
There is , however , no control over the implementation of these .
Mr Maat 's report recognises this situation ; it states that the directives issued on transportation are being violated .
It pays particular attention to the export of live animals to countries outside the EU , which , of course , always involves the longest journey .
The Commission must respond to these requirements ( which will form the opinion of Parliament ) in such a way that the ethical/moral demands of the civilised world regarding respect for life will , in the EU , also be met in the case of animals destined for slaughter .
This already forms the specific ethical basis of European agricultural production .
There exist such things as sparsely populated areas , islands , and long distances , and these areas too must be able to function ; in this report they have been taken into consideration in a balanced and even-handed way .
Animal welfare forms part of a greater whole .
This will further regionalisation , and the implementation and development of regional chains .
This was adopted by the Committee almost unanimously , with only one member casting a blank vote .
The draftsman proposes the creation of a European joint responsibility framework to cover services of general interest .
While the current market philosophy and rules of competition encourage privatisation , the EU should retain the principle of diversity , or in other words , there should be a number of options to choose from .
On the basis of these arguments the committee has adopted an opinion according to which the gradual process of freeing service industries must be implemented in parallel with retaining general services .
The Member States should have the right to ensure that services of general interest are also provided to the less advantaged of their citizens .
Mr President , I wish , first of all , to thank the rapporteur , Mr Meijer , for preparing the report ; he has done a great deal of work on this complicated issue .
This is highlighted particularly in towns where it is necessary
