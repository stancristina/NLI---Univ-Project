.
The stability of Morocco cannot be taken for granted : it is the product of the determination of Morocco 's rulers , and our cooperation has its part to play there .
It is presented as being a stabilizing factor in Moroccan society .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the agreement we have been asked to approve today is an especially important one both for our Member States and for the Kingdom of Morocco .
Undeniably , significant results have been achieved by Morocco in this field , thanks to the international mobilization of opinion to which this House made a powerful contribution .
I would like to dwell on the two points which are causing a problem .
Let us keep the pressure on .
Similarly , what right has the French government to give lectures on freedom of the press when , six days ago , the editor of an opposition newspaper , Mr Debeketsch , was prosecuted merely for holding certain opinions , arrested , and taken in handcuffs to a police station where he was stripped and then body-searched ?
I fully endorse this proposal .
The Commission will in future be preparing a regular report on innovation in Europe and on the policies that support it , drawing on completely reliable indicators .
The Union therefore has little power of its own to influence policy in this area .
I have set up a working group , including users , to make further progress in this area .
All these activities aimed at the SMEs are not , however , always very clear to them .
It must therefore play the greatest possible part in the acquisition of skills , such as creativity , a taste for experiment , and the aptitude for communication and teamwork .
I believe , in particular , that the two objectives aimed at by the creation of this instrument have been identified .
Like the evaluation report , the report prepared by Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel acknowledges the important contribution made by research to the definition and exploitation of an efficient European transport system which at the same time respects the environment .
Ad hoc groups , broadly supporting programme committees , were set up .
I believe a distinction should be made between the sharing of knowledge on the one hand and the conquest of new market shares on the other , thanks to the development of new classes of products through technological innovation , research and development .
This can provide a basis for defining a genuine policy of cooperation with third countries , designed to bring to the fore a Europe of competences .
I can tell you that a seminar on international scientific and technological cooperation , attended by representatives of all these bodies and of the Commission , will be held during the second half of this year .
Morale will benefit , and so will our health .
I do not say that scientology is a dangerous sect .
Now , hardly has this agreement been approved than we find Parliament voting to make Morocco a ward of court , accused of failing to respect human rights - rights which , as we know , are very unstable here , in what might be called this multi-track Europe .
I voted in favour of giving Parliament 's assent to the association agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco for several reasons .
Madam President , my answer to Mr Hallam , in particular , is that our British colleagues and the British government are scientifically right : there is no danger of horizontal transmission and the culling of cattle is scientific nonsense .
So let us begin with the background .
It is also a concern that I share .
Amendment No 9 proposes the creation of a René Descartes Prize to be awarded each year to reward and honour outstanding European research work .
The Commission would not be averse , for example , to a balanced distribution of funds among the proposed priority themes that are linked to the activities of the task forces and some other more generic areas which are the subject of specific programmes .
Mr President , I should like , very briefly , to indicate the position the Socialist Group will take on Mr Macartney 's amendments .
In conclusion , we note that there is convergence between these needs and the activities of the dockyards which exist in the countries of Europe , and we believe that the best possible use should be made of this convergence .
I am thinking especially of Jacques Delors ' Directive on CO2 -based energy , which was buried with great haste by the Council in Essen in 1994 .
Does this proposal exist , or does it not ?
If the new European monetary system is sufficiently flexible , as the rapporteur has claimed , then the United Kingdom should not have any serious objections to taking part .
The resolution proposes the right way to prevent currency fluctuations : stronger macro-economic and budgetary discipline in the Member States , which will boost economic convergence and prevent the imbalances which are the source of financial instability .
First , the new EMS cannot be more than a temporary arrangement , since the official objective , in theory at least , is still a single currency for everyone and convergence in the foreseeable future .
Another much more serious problem is that a currency is nothing more than a vehicle for information on the economy .
I know that I will not convince you , Mr de Silguy , since this is a religious question .
I have one comment on the report by Mr Pérez Royo .
But if you clearly explain to them what is at stake , they are against it .
