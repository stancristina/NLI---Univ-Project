recognised in English but not in Greek - so , flat-rate charges for access based on flat-rate connections by Internet service providers and the new telecommunications companies which have taken over the networks of the former monopolies .
The industry maintains that FRIACO results in increased use of the Internet and , because there are no time charges , users spend more time on the Internet and become Internet literate .
This issue will again be on the agenda of the open network provision committee at its meeting on 20 February 2002 .
Unbundled access to local loops allows newcomers to compete with established service providers by providing high-speed data transmission services and constant Internet access using digital subscriber line technology .
So the Commission is clearly operating at two levels .
On one level it is backing specific cooperation policies and the use of models which are already a success , and I have said how , and on the other level it is monitoring the application of binding decision such as regulations which , of course , play a very important role .
The partial suspension of rail traffic through the Tunnel is reducing the use made of its potential and , as a consequence , the return on the investment in this vital European transport infrastructure .
According to our most recent information , the situation has improved slightly .
Contacts with the French authorities will be maintained , Commissioner Bolkestein has suggested meeting his French and British counterparts and the ministers responsible for the internal market in order to discuss the matter on the fringe of the next Market Council on 1 March .
The Commission believes that approving harmonised rules will help stop certain Member States from being more attractive than others and it has already tabled proposals along these lines .
The current legislation of the European Union allows the Commission to institute infringement proceedings against a Member State found to be obstructing the free movement of goods .
The French government has already closed the site in question , a study has been carried out and initial efforts have been made to install the technology required but , of course , the level of policing , the number of police officers required and the installation of the high-tech equipment needed are matters for the French government .
Why are illegal immigrants trespassing on various sites used by rail freight transporters ?
These proposals stipulate that , if an asylum seeker remains in one Member State for an extended period , then that Member State is responsible for examining the asylum application .
As far as a long-term solution to the problem is concerned because , as numerous Members have said today , the problem today may be on the border between France and Great Britain , but tomorrow it could well surface somewhere else in Europe , we need a fast decision on a common asylum policy at European level .
I should therefore like to call on you , Mr President , when you intervene to try and get the green candidate released , to ask the Pastrana government to halt the bombings , release the hundreds of FARC members being detained in inhumane conditions , together with your three Irish compatriots being held in the same inhumane conditions , and call for the peace talks to resume .
The first concerns the strategy for sustainable development in the run up to the Barcelona Summit , which puts flesh on the bones of the endeavour started in Gothenburg last year , when the environmental dimension was woven into economic development and social cohesion , successfully in my view .
If used with care , biotechnological applications , and genetically-modified organisms in particular , can make a positive contribution both to the economy and trade and to environmental protection , for numerous reasons which there is no need to reiterate .
At the same time , if we are to establish consumer confidence , we need to pay attention to concerns on this count and the call for analytical control methods , as well as markers and tracers , to be applied to genetically modified organisms is a legitimate one .
The Commission proposal for a social security card is lacking in substance .
Naturally , what we need is for the Member States to run compatible medical IT systems .
May I also congratulate Mr Gahrton on a job very well done and on the skill he demonstrated in reconciling the basic positions of the various political groups on the individual issues and setting them out in his report .
Russia is called upon to play an equally important and pivotal role in averting conflict in the South Caucasus and resolving the highly sensitive energy question , with the countries in the region involved either as power producers or consumers .
It is a tool for moulding young people and imposing a certain educational model .
Even educational exchanges and the system for providing lessons operate as a lever in this direction .
Mr President , from a quantitative and operational point of view , certainly , the Socrates programme has progressed well and Commissioner Reding is one of the people we have to thank for that .
With Erasmus in particular , there is a risk , while it is good to give children a chance to study abroad , of disrupting undergraduate syllabuses .
We must not forget this , we must not turn a blind eye , we need to make this programme a programme of overall freedom .
The Youth programme is very mean towards a particularly vulnerable group of young people in Europe .
We therefore need special support for these vulnerable groups if we are to avoid ghettos and exclusion and ensure they become productive and creative .
Serious exploitation and myriad dangers jeopardise their formative , cultural and educational years
