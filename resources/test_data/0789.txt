The CARDS programme is so huge that it is impossible to adapt it to the present financial perspectives .
If it merely promises money , but is not prepared to give it , its credibility as a global player shrinks .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , consensus was achieved at the Feira Summit a couple of weeks ago on the idea that flexibility should be on the IGC agenda .
If and when that happens , will those Member States not in NATO be automatically excluded from those decisions , taken on the basis of flexibility , which lead to some Member States proceeding more swiftly along the path to a common defence ?
I refer in particular to the statement made last week by Alain Richard , Minister for Defence of the country holding the presidency , in which he expressed his concern in the event that non-aligned countries are fully involved from the start in second pillar development projects .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , there have been fears expressed repeatedly in connection with the reading of the framework directive on water , that it could be possible later on in the EU to transport water from one Member State to another against the wishes of the first country .
Mr President , draft supplementary and amending budget no . 2/2000 contains appropriations for the Council and for Parliament .
EUR 5.877 million are estimated to be required for renting , renovating and furnishing a new building .
They may be around 45 at first , but that number may later grow to 60 or even 90 .
Their pay will amount to EUR 758 000 by the end of the year .
The draft supplementary and amending budget for the European Parliament contains an appropriation of EUR 15 million for an additional prepayment for office space in Brussels .
The Committee on Budgets transferred EUR 38 million of unused funds this year by means of a C6/2000 to fund this office space , the Spinelli building .
In that way interest payments are saved and , at the same time , we have a little room for manoeuvre in the budget for the years to come .
Originally , when the budget was being drafted , the share of administrative expenses was to remain below 20 % .
As it is very likely that a considerable portion of the appropriations set aside for members ' regulations , for example , ( which amount to EUR 60 million ) , will remain unspent , and as more than half the year has now gone by , this ceiling may be reviewed at the end of the year .
The Council ' s budget is interesting , as there are appropriations in it for the first time for a common security and defence policy .
The scars left behind in Kosovo , after the crisis management operation , are frightening .
Article 28 of the Treaty is unclear , particularly regarding a common security , defence and military policy .
External Action - which is already now overburdened ?
In future talks , the classification of expenditure must be made clearer and executed more effectively , to comply with Parliament ' s wishes .
Mr President , and those fellow Members who are still awake , I would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda for their lucid reports , with reference to which we can at last try to revive the railways by opening them up to competition .
We all dash along in the same direction , like a flock of sheep , trying to convince one another that the railways will solve Europe ' s transport problems .
To be able to make reasonable decisions we have to identify the real importance of the railways for the economy and examine just how big a part the various modes of transport play .
From the economic point of view , transporting fifty computers a thousand kilometres is quite a different matter from transporting a hundred tons of grit ten kilometres , although the tonnage per kilometre is the same in both cases .
It is also quite a different matter to transport raw textiles weighing tons as compared to an enormous load of silk neckties - I had one for myself , by the way .
I am not mathematically gifted , but I see a dramatic difference in favour of road transport , whose share is more than 95 % .
But it is just because of this that we have to do all we can to revive rail transportation and support its gradual opening up to competition .
Mr President , having listened to Mrs Ber√®s and Mrs Bordes I am more worried than ever that the fine talk at Lisbon is actually being realised .
President Chirac yesterday emphasised with eloquence the importance of finding the right balance between these two objectives , and I wish you would listen to your President .
Mr Duisenberg , I remember last year ' s discussion on the 1998 annual report very clearly .
The report we are now dealing with also shows that progress was clearly made in this direction last year .
Mr Duisenberg , the fact that there are many econometric models does not prevent their all being published and made known to Parliament also .
This morning on the CNN news channel they presented some results of research regarding various intervention policies by the ECB , and the ECB came across as a good intervention-focused bank .
Mr President , information on the euro is for the public and is meant to satisfy their need for information in particular .
The information must come in cooperation with the Member States , but what , in my opinion , is of most importance is that NGOs are kept fully aware of what is happening .
The so-called
