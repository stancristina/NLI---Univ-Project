trading partners so that we can see whether or not sanctions need to be imposed and , if so , where .
I would like to point out here that the well-known problem of the estuaries of the Tigris and Euphrates and the problem of the marshlands are not of Saddam Hussein 's making .
I mainly want to explain the logic behind the political message we want to send out .
The bottom line is in the red but no one accepts any responsibility for it .
So what should we be doing ?
We talk about changing production and consumption standards , we talk about eradicating poverty , we talk about mainstreaming the environment in all policies , in farming , fisheries , industry , energy , tourism , water and air policies , but we have no objectives , timetables , indicators to tell us if we have reached our targets , mechanisms , capital , and the means to move and control the use of resources .
Reforming the international system of Bretton Woods institutions and of more recent institutions such as the World Trade Organisation , for example when their rules clash with environmental protection .
The role of the European Union is the sixty-four thousand dollar question .
To table commitments at international organisations in which it has enough clout to achieve some degree of success , to be a reliable partner , internationally and with the third world , so that we can hope for some sort of improvement post Johannesburg and so that , in ten years ' time , we do not find ourselves in the same situation we were in 30 years ago .
The Union played one of the leading roles at the Rio summit on sustainable development , making commitments on important issues without hesitation , although we must admit that several of these commitments were not honoured .
The Union must also recognise the right to development of developing countries , by taking initiatives and setting a proper example on all aspects of sustainable development and ensuring that non-governmental organisations are involved in all development plans .
The text is riddled with provocative proposals for crude intervention in the internal affairs of another country , overlooking the fact that interventions to date have basically strengthened the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein .
An example of the ? U 's feelings towards the long-suffering Palestinian people is given in the reference to the campaigns by suicide bombers , which it calls " the very worst acts of Palestinian terrorism" .
International solidarity also plays an important part , but that seems to be the last thing on the EU 's mind .
Coresponsibility levies were increased during the recent review , while quotas were kept well below requirements and actual production , with the result that prices and farmers ' incomes have collapsed .
The odd minor improvement is a mere distraction , concealing what is a very ugly situation for small and medium-sized farmers , who are inevitably ousted from their land , which is then concentrated in the hands of a few capitalist-type companies .
Accessibility to the environmental statistics kept by public agencies is of crucial importance , not just in improving public awareness but also in safeguarding the trust and democratic involvement of our citizens .
Similarly , the fifteen-day deadline by which the administration must respond to a request for environmental information does , I think , give government agencies time enough , while ensuring that interested parties are able to use information promptly and efficiently .
This strategy must be bound up with the quality of women 's employment and women 's professional integration and careers , because these are objectives which have been recognised as instrumental in achieving the strategic targets set in Lisbon .
And they do so , of course , in a way which goes beyond current statutory requirements . ?he incentive for companies to take this action must not of course fly in the face of the rules of the economy , which is why it is vital to make sure everyone is clear and knows that when companies implement social responsibility programmes , they improve both their profits and their consumer acceptance .
This is an area in which there are differing approaches and views and the Commission will present its final proposal in July .
These statutory requirements in certain Member States could help enormously in increasing transparency and we could use a procedure between the Member States to see what the positive results of this approach are .
Similarly , item 29 contains an important message on the need to mainstream companies ' social responsibilities and I totally agree with this .
These companies have a different basic approach and interests to other companies but can provide fundamental help , especially through cooperation and networks between the Member States .
Finally , on item 53 , I agree with what you say about core labour standards but , as you know , the Commission is already proposing to include core labour standards in bilateral agreements at European and international level and in all related policy areas of the European Union , that is , in trade , development , external relations and social matters .
Typical of the seriousness of the situation is the failure to implement EUR 10 million of the Structural Funds budget for 2001 .
May I say that the Commission is delighted that Parliament approved the Council 's second reading and say to Mr Podest√† that we promise to deliver the evaluation report requested for the end of September .
Obviously , the powers granted to EUROPOL in the convention ( to collect , process and exchange information ) no longer meet the EU 's current need to speed up the implementation of suppressive military instruments .
