I feel that , in this way , Mr Lund , we who have worked together with great enthusiasm and commitment with both your and my group , might resolve an issue which is extremely important to both the donors ' and the patients ' associations .
Mr President , clearly , after Bali , there is a great danger that the Johannesburg Summit will be nothing but a great media event which calls forth grand declarations of principle but which does not update or practically advance the Rio process .
I know that there are other major issues on which decisive progress needs to be made , but the real success of Johannesburg will be measured according to the progress made in the four areas I have mentioned .
In 2030 , when there will be 8 billion people , it will make a difference whether we have turned words into actions .
Mrs Hautala 's approach and the commendable cooperation of all - and I repeat - all the groups , and the willingness shown by Commissioner Diamantopoulou and the Spanish Presidency , whom I would like to thank , to find solutions , mean that the result we have achieved is significant .
All these decisions were subject to the control of the Court of Justice , which confirmed that they were fully justified .
Lastly , I am pleased to welcome the inclusion of an amendment tabled last June on employment in Europe .
I have to say that my task has been made much easier by the first-rate work of the current Council Presidency .
I am extremely grateful to the Spanish Presidency , for we have worked both well and hard .
There are many issues to be discussed at Seville , but today , before you , the Members of the European Parliament , I want to concentrate on two in particular : how the EU is run and immigration .
Mr Corbett 's proposals on the reform of Parliament that you are discussing in this part-session are also similar in this regard .
Last week I presented our project to the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament , but I would like to go over certain crucial points again now .
In this way , we can start right now to see how the Community method can be revamped in practical terms .
I also support the points contained in the proposal on continuity of work , the need to improve internal coordination and the possibility of reducing the number of Council configurations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as I said at the beginning of my speech , the most burning issue to be dealt with by the European Council is immigration .
At Tampere , we agreed on a number of objectives that are still valid today .
Was the same thing not said when Spain and Portugal joined and was the same thing not said about Italy when the European Community was first created ?
All this , ladies and gentlemen , will not suffice unless it goes hand in hand with a proper cooperation and development policy and the systematic use of all the instruments available to us : a policy to tackle the causes of migration , bilateral agreements and readmission agreements .
I am not saying we do not need lean , transparent , effective procedures too but that there is a problem of priorities .
We all agree on the need for a balance between these two requirements , but I feel that a sufficient balance has not yet been found .
In this situation , immigration is in danger of exploding uncontrollably , and so even security and control measures which may , in themselves , be appropriate are actually in danger of sparking off even greater illegal activity and of placing us in a position where we are even less able to control the phenomenon .
We need increasing cooperation to control the Union 's borders and the development of a single border policy - it is the Italian Government 's proposal which has been accepted and , I believe , selected by Commissioner Vitorino too - but we also need the costs of containing migration flows in Europe to be shared .
And , quite frankly , I want to say before this House that all these summits we have held , which ought to have shown increasingly great attention towards the Developing World , have not yielded the desired results .
Even yesterday , the failure of the largest countries to send representatives to the FAO Summit was a powerful testimony to the fact that this policy needs to be completely revamped .
It will allow us to reach a goal which we all share : the goal of preparing for enlargement of the Union with institutions which are able to cope with this difficult project .
To be sure , almost all the candidate countries have put up a commendable performance in developing their legal systems and economies quickly .
I regret to say that , in Poland , as in the other candidate countries , accepting compromises with Brussels , giving the impression of yielding ground , is seen as extremely negative , and there is now a price to pay for those who do so .
I will end by sharing a further concern with you , which has already been expressed by Commissioner Verheugen , namely that there is resistance to enlargement in the air .
It appears that the general issues have already been dealt with and I would therefore like , if I may , just to focus on Slovenia .
The European Union has been urging Slovenia to speed up the procedures and make good the delays in this field for years now .
The year 2000 was the first year
