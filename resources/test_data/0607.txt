own language or to speak in the Chamber .
I call for monitoring of these 'old ' cars , to ensure that they are always in a state of good health and to prevent them from harming the earth ' s atmosphere .
What I mean is , right now , I can imagine farmers running along behind their cows - Daisy or Buttercup , maybe - and fussing over feeding them hay , fodder and products from their fields , whereas they may well not have had time to have their animal ' s health checked .
We should use this as a springboard to create , at last , a European department of transport links , but , first and foremost , we should make it easier for pensioners and the elderly to travel between the European capitals .
As Mr Goebbels stated in his report , the European Parliament ' s task is not to assess practical adherence to the Maastricht criteria , for that has already been done , item by item , by the Commission and the bodies whose task it is to monitor these indicators and keep us informed .
Mr President , I congratulate the European Parliament on the major work accomplished during the debate on the Randzio-Plath report .
However , in recent years , the Commission has had to examine a growing number of claims related precisely to such internal compensation .
I would like to emphasise the fact that the directive makes no changes either , of course , to the provisions of the Treaty on the awarding of general services , or to the awarding of the management of these services to specific companies .
Mrs Berès , Mr Jonckheer , Mr Crowley , Mr Skinner and Mrs Maes remarked that it might be possible to exclude broadcasting .
This is because it provides clarity and therefore does not expose public services to the attacks which would otherwise have been levelled at them .
As Mr Olle Schmidt stressed , this transparency is essential not only for a proper application of competition policy but , indeed , if I may say so , it is also crucial for there to be a proper relationship between the authorities and the taxpayers , the citizens .
Parliament has attempted to deal with the issue on more than one occasion , but it has never appeared to find satisfactory solutions .
Finally , considering that there is a clear need for a common foreign policy displaying Europe as a coherent system capable of undertaking united initiatives , does the Commission not feel that it would be appropriate to create a structure to study this issue , which would work together with the local Churches , NGOs and civil society and act upon the conclusions reached ?
It reopened global dialogue with the countries of the African continent and , for the first time , associated the development aid policy with the upholding of democratic principles , rights and the fight against corruption .
The global economy must be accompanied by a global policy ; growth must go hand in hand with the upholding of human and civil rights and the consolidation of democracy .
Mr President , although I do want to congratulate Mr Konstantinos Alyssandrakis on his extremely comprehensive report , I have to say that , on this occasion , the Commission , in particular , and this final report have not been bold enough as regards the European space research initiative .
Well , in the United States , a famous pensioner , the astronaut John Glenn , went into space at the age of 69 .
This is why we support the Commissioner !
On 20 June , two Nobel prize-winners , Rita Levi Montalcini , holder of the Nobel Prize for neuroscience , and Renato Dulbecco , will pay tribute to this initiative , in recognition of the fact that , at long last , in establishing the research area , you have conferred great honour on all research scientists .
However , public financing and the European programmes need to target chiefly medium - and long-term economic and non-economic objectives , whereas competence for market-related research should lie chiefly with the firms .
We would like Mrs Diamantopoulou to inform us whether the clause on relations with third countries which deals with female circumcision is seen as particularly important and , in the interests of bringing the matter to a swift conclusion , we suggest that no further Union aid should be granted to any of those countries which permit or tolerate female circumcision .
We were of the opinion that the 1995 Solana agreements had provided a fair solution to the Italy-Slovenia disputes .
A genuine ethnic cleansing operation took place and disputes still remain which have not been resolved .
We do not feel there is cause for concern but we would certainly like the matter to be clarified , and I would like to say that we regard the Spanish compromise managed by Mr Solana as non-negotiable .
These measures , which have already been successfully implemented in some States , must be extended to cover the whole of the European Union .
Mr President , I was happy to vote for the Ferber report on the budget for the financial year 2001 , but I am not very happy with the minimal amount of space , money and European Union funds it allocates to supporting activities benefiting pensioners and the elderly .
I do not mean that we have to allocate to pensioners , the elderly and their problems the same proportion of our budget as they occupy of society , i .e . approximately 32 % at the last count .
Mr President , Mr Pomés Ruiz ' s report assesses the implementation of the Convergence and Stability programmes which are concerned chiefly with the European single currency : the euro
