The United States has thus discarded its historical role and , this being the case , it could be the start of a serious crisis , a crisis which , as Norman Mailer said , could affect democracy within the United States , and if it affects democracy within the United States it could also affect democracy in Europe too , and our freedom could be under threat as well .

This is the challenge which the Spring European Council tried to keep sight of and this is why President Prodi also reminded us of the burden of war on Europe 's economic revival .
One final point : I feel deeply offended as an MEP , as a European and as an Italian by the irresponsible tolerance which Mr Cox showed for the placards held up by left-wing fellow Members in this Chamber .
