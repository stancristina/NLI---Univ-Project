Finally , I have to address the problem of Parliament in Strasbourg .
I am not anti-Strasbourg .
I am certainly not anti-France .
I understand that Strasbourg was the symbol of peace and unity of our continent , but that was a symbol of the 20th century .
In the 21st century , I am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency .
I ask Parliament , Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem .
Madam President , coming back to a point that was raised earlier on : 9 May is , as you know , Europe Day and Parliament will be closed .
There is , however , a meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market being held on that day .
Will members of the public be allowed to attend that meeting as observers or will they be barred from entering the Parliament ?
Madam President , I thank the Commissioner for that report .
There were not a great many surprises in it and , to some extent , I welcome that .
A question remains , however , in relation to redeployment in Category 4 .
I heard you say there would not be cuts against the poverty lines .
You mentioned lines where there was not complete take-up and that there would be cuts in TACIS.
Can you give us some idea whether there will be any across-the-board reductions ?
Last year , the Council proposed a 10 % across-the-board cut in Category 4 .
Is the Commission making selective reductions as you suggested or will they be making any across-the-board cuts in Category 4 ?
I am still unclear as to what happens from the year 2003 .
If you are taking money from Category 1 for the next two years , where do you expect that money to come from in 2003 ?
.
The reason for this intervention is to clarify why this House should oppose the Commission ' s proposals to cut subsidies for school milk by half .
I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this House rejected these proposals by bringing forward these amendments not to cut the subsidies at all and I urge everyone to support these amendments .
There are several arguments for doing so .
By nourishing our schoolchildren we also support our dairy farmers who need our support .
But also we are preventing surpluses like those seen in the past .
Trans-European networks ( 1998 Annual Report ) Mr President , I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to colleague Hatzidakis for a very fine report to Parliament here this afternoon .
The Commission ' s 1998 annual report on trans-European transport networks gives a clear overall picture of the progress that has been made in certain specific projects as well as containing valuable information on the contributions made to these infrastructural projects by the various sources of Community funding .
Clearly , it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs .
At present , the funding is decidedly inadequate if we are to attempt seriously to meet the commitments entered into at the Essen European Summit in 1994 .
I share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the fourteen Essen projects are still facing difficulties because their funding is not totally guaranteed and no timetables have been drawn up for their implementation .
It would be useful if the Commission , in its future annual reports , specified what funding has been provided by national , regional and local public bodies and by the private sector , in addition to European funding , with a view to setting up the trans-European transport networks .
The Commission will shortly undertake a revision of the TEN guidelines .
I hope that in these new guidelines they will accord greater importance to improving access to trans-European network funding for Europe ' s island and remote regions .
It is important to place particular emphasis on the promotion of sustainable transport links with these disadvantaged regions if they are to share equally in the benefits of a unified single market .
If the revision of the TEN guidelines were to concentrate just on existing bottlenecks as announced by the Commission in its work programme for the year 2000 , this would focus the funding on the more economically developed central regions of the Union , perhaps to the detriment of the outermost regions .
A package of integrated financial measures needs to be deployed in order to press ahead with implementation of the network .
The Commission and EIB therefore should act together with national governments in implementing the TENs packages through the use of loan guarantees and other financial investments .
Mr President , as draftsman for the Industry Committee I just want to pick up on a couple of areas which I think need to be mentioned today .
Aviation is without doubt one of the most exciting and stimulating industries .
The opportunities for business and job creation during the last decade have played a major part in the economies of countries in Europe and worldwide .
For example , aviation in the UK contributes GBP 10.2 billion a year to the UK GDP and generates and supports 380 000 indirect and induced UK jobs .
It transports GBP 35 billion ' s worth of UK exports , maintaining unrivalled access to the global market , and this is multiplied ten-fold across the European Community .
When I began my career in the aviation industry 30 years ago , very few people could afford to fly .
But today , with the liberalisation of the market , flying for most people has become a way of life .
The report covers a number of areas and outlines fairly accurately the way the aviation industry has developed
