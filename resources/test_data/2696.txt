How does the President-in-Office of the Council think he will do this ?
Mr President , as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , I must confess I am more familiar with human rights violations of the fundamental rights within the European Union , which , as you know , come under the authority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , rather than human rights violations outside the European Union , about which my colleagues know a lot more than I do .
That is the message I wanted to pass on .
Unfortunately , international attention was focused on how extremely divided we were ; this division was chiefly based on economic advantage .
This year the opportunity to reinforce the UN position must be seized , since it was fifty years ago in Lake Success that the United Nations was founded .
The government rules over the largest part of the country now and , sadly , murders of the opposition leaders are increasing , including in the Cabinda region .
What has been done to promote and guarantee the work of the special rapporteurs ?
Mr President , Nigeria is a particularly bad apple in a basket of not too sound fruit .
However , the experience we have gained with boycotts of this kind shows that it is above all the people who suffer , whilst the regime the boycott is targeted at , is often able to keep its position for years to come .
The specific question about Burma I did not receive an answer to was : what is the Presidency intending to do with the invitation to the ASEM countries for the ASEM ministerial meeting ?
You will understand that I can only interpret Minister Henderson 's remarks to mean that he wishes to neither confirm , nor deny .
Perhaps I should interpret this as a tacit confirmation of what is happening .
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
However , I have to say that his report is excellent , even if in his contribution tonight he possibly concentrates a bit too much on the social consequences given that aircraft crews and pilots are among the best paid workers in the world .
This contravenes what is being requested in the seventh freedom .
Integrating environmental issues into all policy areas of the European Union will be a major task , but one that we have to face .
That is nice for travellers , but bad news for the descendants of the travellers , because cheap tickets lead to more passenger kilometres and that leads to more pollution .
I would also like to know if the subject of aviation and the environment is on the agenda of the next two Environment and Transport Councils .
This is evident from the emergence of low-budget companies , amongst other things .
That is why the introduction of a tax on kerosene within the Union is urgently required .
That is why , to my mind , such a certificate will not promote staff mobility , whilst the Member States are burdened with an extra administrative commitment .
Unfortunately , parliaments do not seem to understand my graphic amendments , which is why I was not able to submit them .
Madam President , I would therefore ask you whether in future , when as a group we submit to you the list of speakers per subject , you could keep to it .
For example , a registration requirement exists for manufacturers of ordinary compound feedingstuffs , or for so-called premixes , but there is no system of approval for these firms .
Thus , the eight day condition must be deleted .
We think it is extremely important that after the BSE crisis , this Parliament will have to deal in all kinds of areas with the food that people , consumers , consume daily within the European Union .
In Europe we are improving our standards .
The interviewees on the whole have little faith in their governments , as these restrict themselves to a risk analysis of new products for the safety of humans and animals .
Only if we use creation as God intended , is it able to serve man .
Education and health care have become taboo for women , and they are not allowed to show themselves in the street unless they are accompanied by their brother , their husband or their father , let alone voice an opinion in public .
A stop should be put to this .
From all of this , ladies and gentlemen , we can only draw the following conclusions .
For that reason I would like to say that I fully understand people getting annoyed with people who overstep the limits of courtesy , or who insult someone 's religion on purpose , but the punishment which is administered from government beats everything .
Madam President , the election of Dr. Khatami as president showed great promise in principle .
International attention must also be paid to the individual cases as mentioned in the resolution , so that this may save the lives of citizens .
If you are familiar with the fact , Mr President , that the current President Khatami was the Minister of Culture nine years ago and the fatwa against Rushdie came under his responsibility , then one has to seriously question the call this same Khatami now makes as President for dialogue and relaxation in the sphere of culture .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 12 February four Mauritanian people were convicted .
I believe the Mauritanian authorities when they say that they have legally abolished slavery , but then they should be interested in cooperating with all those who also want to see the last remote corners of this practice removed
