I am new in this Parliament and I regret that the first question whose reply I was expecting to hear in this Parliament cannot be replied to orally due to lack of time , but I doubly regret the fact that this is due to the attitude of some people who , by raising questions in this House which , in my opinion , do not belong here , deprive us of the pleasure of hearing Mr Fischler speak today of the problem of our fishermen' s daily bread , for example .
I do not think that dodging a question that we will have to face up to sooner or later is a good idea .
I would like the Commission to give a clear answer as to what the terms of their proposal will be .
I was perturbed to hear how Mr Poettering , on behalf of the European People ' s Party , added a so-called cultural criterion to our relations with Turkey .
But this message includes a rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey and at the same time , a push for the democratic values which today are still not being fulfilled .
This Europe that we are committed to is capable of sharing values with other great groups of humanity from whom a project based on a religious outlook would separate us .
The simple truth is that it is not possible to find absolute truths in a dispute whose origins are interwoven with the very roots of our civilisation .
Nevertheless , the fact that we have mentioned it so many times does not mean we can stop discussing the lack of vision of our contribution , as Europeans , to the peace process .
We would like to stress at least three of them : firstly , the continuing colonisation process , both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank .
Mr President , we are all delighted that the peace process in the Middle East has been relaunched .
Mr President , we cannot accept Turkey as a candidate for the European Union , because of its attitude of constantly denying the slightest recognition to the Kurdish people .
These are , to be precise , the need to include our citizens in this important exercise , and to deal with their legitimate concerns .
On the one hand , we are perfectly aware that this round should not result in empty words , but should instead provide a net benefit for everyone , especially for the developing countries .
( The President cut the speaker off )
And secondly , closer to home , the Commission needs to set its own affairs in order because now , the Commission services responsible for putting its claims to the dispute settlement body of the World Trade Organisation are completely toothless .
Perhaps these small islands have done so because the danger is much closer to home for them .
The first approach that we have to avoid is to think that economic development inevitably brings with it an increase in the deterioration of the environment .
Although it is true that there are means which would potentially allow us to fulfil the commitment made in Kyoto through national strategies and measures , the economic cost of the different options varies enormously .
In this way , Galicia differs from Portugal and Ireland , both countries in Objective 1 who have achieved extraordinary development , which has unfortunately not taken place in my country , Galicia .
I must remind you that in the Spanish Constitution , my country is defined as an "autonomous region " .
The only thing I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council is that this does in fact fall within the competence of the Commission , but I put this question to the Commission , who could not give me an answer yesterday , and I still have not received an answer .
I would like to know by how many boats each country has reduced its fleets as a result of the moratorium and if this method is proving useful in reducing the pressure on tuna populations .
This is a Parliamentary Question Time .
It is also true that Russia has , in previous weeks , suffered horrendous terrorist attacks which have caused considerable loss of life , supposedly carried out by guerrillas who are based in the mountains of the Caucasus .
The time limit seems reasonable , bearing in mind the delay which this directive is experiencing .
Therefore , I hope that , on the basis of the agreements which this Parliament adopts this week , the Council and the Commission will consider the possibility of definitively laying down the advisory committee procedure .
Only in this way for example can we guarantee the financing of the Union ' s structural policies .
Nevertheless , and bearing in mind that fishing policy is a Community policy whose funding is separate from the Treaties , a formula has been found between all of us that allows the Council ' s amendments not to be rejected in the first reading , including those referring to fishing , but rather defers their approval until such a time as financial agreement is reached with the Council .
We do not want to reach the second reading with a proposal to break the interinstitutional agreement and thereby end up with no Financial Perspective .
For this reason they only accepted the slightest and most miserly alterations to Category 3 ( Internal Policies ) and Category 5 ( Administrative Expenditure ) .
The Financial Perspective has also failed to take into account the question of the accession of Cyprus and Malta .
And here today , how many of us have had to insist on the question of the fishing agreement , a clear case of
