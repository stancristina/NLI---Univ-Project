We also want the process to be assessed regularly , with annual reports sent to the European Parliament .
These are the demands made by the committee .
That is important if the Commission wants to show that it is serious about the issue .
We approve the compromise which , for the sake of road users , I am pleased that we were able to negotiate .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party proposes that we vote on the original version .
That is not a linguistic , but a political , change .
It reads , 'increased access for the Mediterranean countries ? , when it should read 'developing countries ' .
The correct version states that the 'increase ? in the total EU quota is kept within the limits proposed by the Commission , but the Swedish text reads 'reduction ? .
On this basis , we think it particularly unfortunate that the report states that the compensation to be paid to those fishermen and ship owners hit by a temporary cessation of activity 'shall be fully paid by the EU? .
The report indicates a number of problems experienced by disabled and older people , a matter which is important and to which attention should be given .
Creating conditions enabling disabled people to participate fully in society is also very high on our liberal agenda .
We believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to the people they affect .
Secondly , Belarus is actually signalling , albeit in a desperate way , that it is seeking contact with the EU.
I would appeal to the Commission and to Commissioner Liikanen , whom I would call upon to approach Commissioner Patten , to step up all their contacts with Belarus .
It is also important for the European Union to state clearly that , within the framework of the union between Belarus and Russia , President Putin of Russia has a major and special responsibility for putting pressure on Belarus to act in an internationally credible way .
The EU 's opposition to the death penalty therefore has a conscious and deeply entrenched ethical and moral basis that provides the foundation for our civilisation 's view of human beings .
We find that extremely one-sided and difficult to understand and therefore choose to abstain from voting in the impending vote at 5.30 p.m.
We do not , however , believe that resources additional to those in the Commission proposal need to be provided .
In practice , that would create a second-class membership of the EU.
There is a major referendum project and calls for there to be a vote on introducing democracy .
Fidel Castro 's response to this has been to make socialism an inescapable part of the constitution , something which is a very serious matter .
The Cuban Government has , however , denied them permission to travel .
Madam President , when the European Union undertook to ensure there was a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , it was incredibly important , I believe , to establish good prior conditions for the development of renewable energy , particularly biofuels .
The proposal I shall confine myself to talking about concerns the possibility of reducing excise duty in the Member States , that is to say the Commission proposal for amending Directive 92/8 1/EEC .
I consider the amendments by the rapporteur and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which have been adopted by the committee , to have further improved the proposal .
Madam President , using biofuels may be really excellent from an environmental point of view , especially in view of greenhouse gas emissions .
If consideration is to be given to the overall environmental impact , there are significantly more interesting techniques , for example the production of ethyl alcohol derived from forest products .
It is therefore gratifying that the Euratom report indicates increased safety and greater awareness of the risks .
We have experienced a number of serious accidents and quite a lot of incidents that could have ended very badly if staff and safety systems had not been up to the mark .
Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members and those in the public gallery , the European Parliament is aiming to ensure that the Budget for 2003 is a real reforming budget .
The document we are debating and shall be voting on today is about providing the European Parliament 's delegation with a special mandate ahead of this conciliation with the Danish Presidency and the Commission .
The interinstitutional agreement governing these conciliations highlights three areas that are to be given particular attention .
With regard to agriculture , we are awaiting the Commission 's draft mid-term review , and many practical details are still missing when it comes to the reform of fisheries policy .
We hope it will be possible for some points to be considered as early as July .
We remain conscious of the fact that we also have to keep the promise we made last year of a further EUR 27 million to support the changeover from fishing to other industries in Spain and Portugal .
We also hope to be able to bring about a preliminary discussion on a few other important points .
The fact that we have too few resources in category 4 , i .e . external assistance , is a structural problem .
It would be excellent if we could find a solution to this issue in July .
The timetable for enlargement must be adhered to .
We also have to be able to show that we can actively implement new priorities , particularly within the field of administration .
It should not be assumed from the outset that we must use flexibility instruments .
Once the major round of enlargement is completed , it must be possible to redistribute these
