up a business .
It would be an example of cutting off your nose to spite your face , if Parliament or the Commission were to say that they refuse to make further attempts to integrate the financial services if no progress were made in terms of the taxation package .
We are in the process of achieving these , at least we are in the process of achieving those objectives that need to be achieved this year .
The Commission is trying to flesh this out and this also means that those state monopolies need to allow for more competition in the fields I mentioned a moment ago .
I have quoted what Mrs Berger said earlier about the hat which you cannot simply take off .
If you will allow me to highlight one aspect of it : we all hope , of course , that the difference of opinion which is keeping Spain and the United Kingdom divided over a well-known rock in the Southern half of this continent , will now be resolved .
I would like to make a few minor observations regarding a European campaign which intends to teach Europeans languages from other communities .
We have rightly reached agreements in this respect in the European system of national and regional accounts , ESA 95 .
I should have liked to hear the Commissioner confirm whether the Commission is indeed drawing up a proposal to amend Article 8 of the ESA 95 Regulation to the effect that all the Member States will , in the future , have an adequate legal basis to use ESA 95 for the calculation of the third source of own resources , that is to say , VAT.
We must , therefore , urgently find and accept a compromise and a more liberal attitude .
- ( NL ) In view of the inadequate management with regard to the buildings and personnel policy contracted out , as mentioned in the Kuhne report and in the report by the Financial Controller , we are of the opinion that discharge to the European Parliament in respect of the implementation of the 1998 budget must be postponed .
We form part of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , but by taking this position we wanted to express our disillusionment over what is being discussed here today .
This agenda is , of course , too restricted .
A guerrilla war is being fought without the civilian population being spared , in fact , the civilian population is also suffering the dreadful atrocities that can occur in wartime .
We are also delighted to hear that the Russians are at long last admitting to the fact that Mr Putin is contacting the Chechen authorities indirectly .
Who knows whether with help from the European Union and Russia , a Stability Pact for the Caucasus region can ever be achieved .
For example , proselytising against Islam and the joint teaching of boys and girls , a violation of the customary separation of the sexes in education in that country .
Our amendment in paragraph 5 is based on this very consideration .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wholeheartedly supports the joint resolution that will be put to the vote today .
Requests have been made to send letters , but to no avail .
It is very worrying and must be followed up .
The gulf becomes deeper instead of the other way round .
Those are particularly depressing aspects of the text now before us .
All this , Mr President , is a recipe for anarchy and a threat to democracy that could endanger the entire region .
The country cannot afford such a drain on its resources , as is evident from the economic situation .
It is also true that they are continually pressing for the withdrawal of troops from the Congo .
What is more serious is the fact that the demonstrators were arrested and the attackers left alone .
A quarter of the names on the electoral lists are fictitious or duplicates .
According to Commissioner Nielson , we spend 5 % on education as a whole and an estimated 80 % of that on primary education .
LÃ¼ had shown her true colours as an extremist and incorrigible agitator for the independence of Taiwan .
The Taiwanese have shown that .
China will only be able to be reunited if both Taiwan and the mainland adopt democracy , human rights and the rule of law as their guiding principles .
A third series of amendments that I have tabled concerns the availability of language courses and accessibility to them in the respective Member States .
It is an open secret that this situation differs greatly from one Member State to another .
Taking account of the internationally agreed trading rules within the WTO , the GATT Agreement and the internal market strategy of the European Union , we should be arguing in favour of introducing a tariff only system as quickly as possible .
Many schools reacted particularly to this point and I have also noticed among my supporters that people wondered whether things would turn out all right for school milk , whether it would keep going as an instrument ?
The European Commission has also commissioned a study .
You must also be realistic .
Nevertheless , on 10 December , the Commission decided not to withdraw the measures but to halve the subsidy .
I am not an opponent of school milk as such but I do object to the way we are going about it .
Will we read in the newspaper tomorrow " European Parliament in favour of school milk subsidies - to the rescue of the dairy sector " ?
Is it not more sensible to seek possibilities of financing such programmes elsewhere ?
