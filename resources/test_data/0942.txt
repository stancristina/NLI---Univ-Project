anti-personnel mines in the course of the next ten to fifteen years .
We perceive a problem in the CFSPs being 'relieved ' of responsibility for civil actions .
The report is based upon an assumption that the Treaties are to contain a fundamental element , that the common policies are to be included as protocols to the framework treaty and that there are to be different procedures for adapting the different texts .
We cannot therefore vote in favour of the report .
We should therefore like to see the texts reworked in such a way as to permit more rational and intelligible access to the objectives in developing the EU and to the resources for doing so .
The Swedish and Danish Social Democrats have today voted against Jos√© Maria Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado ' s report on closer cooperation .
We agree with the general principles laid down by the report , to the effect that closer cooperation should be developed within the European Union ' s institutional frameworks and that the political and legal conditions established by the Treaty of Amsterdam for introducing closer cooperation are aimed at limiting the risk of a breach of the ties of solidarity between the Member States and the risk of a disintegration in the common legal area .
We recognise that , where the pace and scope of European integration are concerned , a certain degree of differentiation within the process may be useful in so far as the common objectives are preserved and the differentiation is perceived as a tool used on an exceptional basis , in a transitional period and with due respect for the fact that it is entirely up to those countries which are not a part of the enhanced cooperation process to decide whether - and , in certain cases , when - they wish to accede to those areas covered by closer cooperation .
Removing the conditions which state that closer cooperation must remain within the framework of the Treaty and removing the right of veto and the opportunity for bringing the issue up in the European Council would constitute a breach of the quite fundamental principles according to which European cooperation in the EU operates .
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is voting against Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado ' s report on enhanced cooperation .
The ulterior motive is to be able to continue the development towards 'ever closer union ' without being hampered by the enlargement to which the EU countries have committed themselves .
In this way , Mr Gil-Robles proposes discontinuing the common foreign and security policy .
To allow decisions on ever more important topics to be made on the basis of qualified majority voting would be in conflict with basic democratic standards .
Those countries which are not so keen on integration are left with a poor alternative , namely that of copying the legislation without having any real say in it .
What they cannot do , however , is avoid the pioneer countries ' legislation .
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities wants a freer and more flexible Europe in which there is no pressure to be involved in everything .
We are therefore voting against the report .
Madam President , we now have a considerable amount of knowledge of endocrine disrupters .
We know that they can result in lower reproductive capacity .
However , at the same time , there is still great uncertainty concerning the collective consequences of the many endocrine-disrupting substances .
In my opinion , this is a really frightening prospect .
Naturally , this situation is untenable .
That is why it is a good thing that the Commission has led the way with a communication concerning an EU strategy for endocrine disrupters .
However , I think that the Commission 's strategy is a little too hesitant .
I think that what are needed are some more aggressive and effective initiatives in the short term .
First and foremost , it is important that the list of substances that are , or are suspected of being , endocrine disrupters be drawn up and that this be done very quickly .
It is also important that we have the necessary resources for the list to encompass all the relevant substances , expected to number approximately 560 .
Various measures may be taken : bans , phasing out over a shorter or longer period of years and other restrictions on use .
In this connection , I believe that it is important to conclude that it must be done without waiting for further testing .
I am thinking of pregnant women , infants and certain groups of workers who run a particularly high risk of being affected by these substances .
I also think that a major effort should be made to establish effective monitoring in the Member States and under the auspices of the EU.
Industry must be required to report on which chemical substances are being put onto the market , in what quantities they are being used and what the expected effects are .
We know that these substances can interact in a particularly unfortunate way .
Where research is concerned , we also know that international cooperation is important , including cooperation with the United States and Japan .
There must be a legislative framework that is based on the precautionary principle and on the principle of a reverse burden of proof .
In suggesting a legislative framework , I am also saying that I believe the rules should be binding .
I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the various groups and thank the Commission for the cooperation we have had in connection with the drawing up of the report .
I believe that the proposals are largely inspired by the chemical industry , members of which have made the effort to contact me
