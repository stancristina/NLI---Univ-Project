harmful or whether there are alternatives , and how harmful these would be and in what form .
We also believe that we should look into toys for older children , although we should still have this option available once the test methods are there .
Mr President , last month , we held a debate on tobacco .
By testing toys , it can be indicated whether or not this 'acceptable daily intake ' is exceeded in the case of humans .
Moreover , we do not know what the harmful effects of alternatives will be .
In this way , we can prevent the entire meat industry from going down the drain because of one isolated criminal act or incident of carelessness .
It aims to introduce reliable and transparent identification and registration regulations for beef , as well as labelling for beef .
Does this mean that the European Parliament , which has worked harder than anyone else to achieve a European Community patent , will not be involved , or at least be updated in good time and on a regular basis ?
The question we always need to ask ourselves as European institutions is : why is this one of our concerns ?
The plan is indeed sound .
In fact , projects which preceded this plan have already proved that this type of plan meets a real need .
I cannot help but ask myself questions then or , as Mr Perry rightly pointed out : why is it seemingly easier to obtain EU funding in Europe if you manufacture olive oil ?
Indeed not .
However , I also have some comments with regard to the recommendation , and I included these in my report .
I would therefore call on the Council to come up with a proposal for a common position within the short term .
This is why this should also be included in this report .
A number of MEPs have already described the effects of that .
Needless to say , services need to come first , because air-traffic control does not exist in isolation .
Then , everyone will need to put pressure on the Council of Ministers , Member States will need to take decisions that need to be taken and take the course which we have indicated a few times in the European Parliament and which is once again highlighted in Sir Robert Atkins ' report .
This , however , requires long-term efforts and specific , effective investments in alternatives .
We should keep thinking about the future of the transport sector and aviation , in particular .
This is why we call for a reversal of the burden of proof .
This previous system has now been changed .
I would ask you to request the Bureau to think about this very carefully and reconsider their decision .
The Committee on Budgetary Control endured an onslaught of harsh criticism by some and was at the same time given the benefit of the doubt by others .
In our view , therefore , it would be premature at this stage to pass judgement on this legal investigation .
Every item that is put on Monday ' s agenda by the House can be taken off the agenda again in the course of the week , should it transpire that , on reflection , fresh arguments have come to light .
In the light of this , I would like to make the following observations .
In sum , Madam President , I would urge you to ensure that a real dialogue is established according to the Dalai Lama' s five-point peace plan ; it will then be a happy day for Tibet ' s entire population .
The protocol was accepted in the General Assembly in May .
Madam President , the Moluccas require our attention once again .
Firstly , there must be an all-out effort to discontinue the supply of fighters and weapons by introducing strict border control .
In addition , the deployment of international peacekeeping forces deserves to be reconsidered .
It is not they , but the opposition powers working against this government that seem to aggravate the situation within the Moluccas .
Surely a country cannot take on the appearance of a police state for days on end because of a football championship ?
We also back the initiative from the Belgian and Dutch Home Affairs Ministers , which attempts to introduce travel bans for this kind of hooligan when high-risk events are due to take place .
I should right away like to express my sympathy and concern for our Italian fellow MEPs at this stage .
Did these handicapped supporters not want to be filmed or were they not allowed to be filmed ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , needless to say , all forms of violence should be denounced , including the outrageous expressions of hooliganism during Euro 2000 .
Extending congratulations in a resolution is very civilised , of course , but hardly the task of this Parliament .
Consequently , I believe that the amendments pertaining to this matter should be rejected .
Is this also being distributed ?
This is evident from the first and second Gulf War and another five years , the 1991-1996 period , during which Baghdad categorically refused to cooperate in the oil-for-food programme , which led to a completely unnecessary lengthening of human suffering .
Those tabling this resolution cannot possibly have it in mind to raise this awful spectre .
I am therefore of the opinion that the euro is only convenient for businesspeople , lavish holidaymakers and MEPs , but not for the majority of people .
As such , since time immemorial it has been common practice in this sector for different companies to compete with each other for the same route .
There is little point in blaming the workers for everything that could cause irritation among passengers
