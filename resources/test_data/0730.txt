also the reason for the two most important requests made by Parliament : that the overshoot penalty percentage should not be increased from 50 % to 60 % , and that the maximum guaranteed quantities be brought into line with actual production levels .
As Mr Korakas has rightly said , we could also invoke Protocol 4 of the Act of Accession of Greece , which calls for cotton production to be maintained in those areas where it is considered important to the agricultural economy .
He has been very willing to listen .
Ladies and gentlemen , I therefore urge you to vote for and support Amendment No 20 , tabled by Mr Garot and myself on behalf of the Socialist Group .
- Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur on the report presented and the work undertaken .
It is simplistic to talk of containing spending and only to present budgetary considerations for reforming the aid system , when what is really happening is that farmers ' incomes are falling whilst we are witnessing an increase in imports from outside the European Union .
Furthermore , in my view , Mr President , this aid is justified because it benefits the agricultural workers who need it as it helps to compensate for a reduction in their income .
In addition , this proposal is in line with the provisions in Agenda 2000 .
The budget has to be ready in June , and programmes relating to plantations in the first part of this year would not be included .
Nevertheless , the Commission cannot condone European agriculture abandoning these crops as a result of commercial agreements which have caused the collapse of such an important sector .
( The President cut the speaker off )
We are now proposing that the improvement plans be extended .
Community preference arrangements in those agreements made it hard for the sector to survive , not to mention a whole range of points already made concerning its environmental and social significance .
A flat rate of aid per hectare to be administered by producers ' organisations should be introduced and the structural crisis in the sector should be addressed .
Mr President , Europe ' s coherence and credibility are at stake in Kosovo .
It also contributed to Milosevic being discredited and defeated a few months later .
The European Union is contributing very substantial sums to the rebuilding of Kosovo .
At the same time we fully support the United Nations ' mission and both the incoming and outgoing Special Representatives .
We know that in principle this law should have a very wide scope .
You raised another matter in the resolution , namely the problem of the tension in the Presevo valley in southern Serbia .
For our part , the European Union has just received the plan and is studying it .
For their part , the Member States are considering how they could contribute .
In any event , we feel that this is an opportunity we should not hesitate to grasp in an effort to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict , particularly now that it seems a significant cease-fire is being observed .
In addition , the Commission is studying the possibility of supporting the revival of the peace and reconciliation process through programmes for the rehabilitation , demobilisation and reintegration of displaced people .
It is true , however , that there is still a big gap between the international commitments made by China and the human rights situation in practice .
As we very well know , dialogue is only an option , the purpose of which is to produce results .
The debate we have held today in this House will , without a doubt , be fundamental to the decision we take .
You refer in your report to the situation of former civil servants , such as Mr Latsamy Kamphoui and Mr Sackchittaphong , prisoners of conscience who are still being detained and whom the European Union has repeatedly called upon the government to release on humanitarian grounds .
As matters stand at present , repatriating them to Sierra Leone is unthinkable because two other objectives have priority : reinforcing the camps around Kissidougou , north of Gueckedou , and adapting the access roads to these camps .
With regard to Guinea , the situation has indeed deteriorated .
A mission from Brussels is discussing , in Nigeria , how the future programme for that country is to be implemented .
If action is , in fact , taken against them , it will undoubtedly help create an atmosphere hostile to the press in general .
The Commission is prepared to support any actions taken by civil organisations in Pakistan , with such actions to be funded through the European initiative in favour of democracy and human rights .
A substantial reduction in the troops stationed in Chechnya is planned .
However , for the practical benefit of these measures to be felt by the citizens , greater cooperation on the part of certain authorities is called for , especially the military prosecutors .
This involves travel permits and the possibilities for communication .
Pending such a solution , the Commission will continue to seize the opportunities offered by the many regular political contacts with the Russian authorities to convince them of the need to investigate violations of human rights in Chechnya more thoroughly and efficiently .
The Commission has now announced its decision to provide a further EUR 10 million .
We wish to be associated with the demonstrations of support and solidarity addressed by this House to the victims of this new disaster , specifically in Portugal .
Madam President , I should like to thank Mr von Wogau for having raised a subject I believe deserves to be debated
