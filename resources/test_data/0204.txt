; they perhaps need changing .
Parliament did a great deal to help move this matter forward , and I should like to congratulate the chairman of your delegation , Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca , to whom Mr Markov was keen to pay tribute .
It is not only a question of increasing them , but also of making them more effective .
Nevertheless , I very much regret what Mr Jarzembowski said about Mr Piecyk .
With employees forced to work at a furious pace due to the just-in-time phenomenon , one can rightly talk about a wage of fear .
It is true that heavy goods vehicles are involved in only 6 % of accidents , but 16 % of these accidents are fatal .
Parliament was more open to the demands of industry ; the Council was not ; the Commission was open to both solutions , but the conciliation procedure went in the Council’s favour .
On the other hand , the position that consists of accepting the Commission ’s plan to retain certain mandatory sectors , while rejecting the Commission proposal , is not coherent .
Any inequality based on a person’s gender is a source of injustice , social violence and incomprehension among our fellow citizens .
Although I am concerned about the social consequences in terms of protecting workers and keeping jobs , I also wonder about European industry ’s ability to tackle the mergers and transformations resulting from globalisation .
This convention recognises the specific nature of cultural activities , goods and services that can under no circumstances be regarded as mere commodities .
When that time comes , he will provide a detailed explanation of the situation in Palestine and of his policy framework .     .
I have denounced the way in which the chickens are slaughtered using electric stunning techniques .
I heard one of my fellow Members say a short while ago that there had been no farm closures , but that is incorrect because this is already a widespread phenomenon across the European territory .
Parliament has above all stressed that the internal market and competition should not be regarded as representing every aspect of European society .
This clause does suffer from some deficiencies .
If we want to implement this clause effectively , we must create the forums needed for a frank and constructive exchange of views on human rights .
Heat and cooling networks and biomass , particularly woody biomass , are important outlets for the timber industry , fit in perfectly with a sustainable European forestry strategy and can support European efforts towards sustainable development , particularly the aim of 12 % of all energy consumed being from renewable sources by 2010 .
This directive primarily relates to radiation sources such as lasers and infrared lamps .
Although it is regrettable that it has taken until 2006 to consider taking account of common-sense criteria such as employment , innovation , growth , economic and social cohesion and so on , we must not reject this reorientation of the policy , because we cannot prevent its existence .
That is not acceptable .     .
I would especially like to thank Mrs Gebhardt and all the Members most directly involved , particularly the shadow rapporteurs , who , over the past few months , have done some admirable work to enable us to reach the stage we are at today .
By definition , we need a compromise  – a compromise that honours and respects the principles of the Treaty and forms part of our programme for growth and jobs .
Even though this is just the first step , I really do not think that there is any strategy more social than one that creates high-quality jobs .
The supporters of this compromise also greatly overestimate , in my view , the effect of the social guarantees they claim to have introduced into the draft directive .
We are told that agreement has been reached between the two main groups in the European Parliament to withdraw the country of origin principle , which was the main stumbling block in the directive .
Our rapporteur also proposed to oppose the country of origin principle and the so-called ' Bolkestein' directive , which we should now call the 'McCreevy ' directive , on the basis that it placed 25 legal systems in competition with each other , created legal uncertainty and risked resulting in unfair competition between businesses that would no longer be subject to the same conditions .
This directive meets the aims set by the services directive , in that it guarantees the free provision of services whilst still allowing other objectives to be pursued , such as promoting European content , respecting cultural diversity and promoting pluralism of programming .
Nevertheless , services are provided by human beings , who have to be protected against social dumping .
We all want job creation , but jobs are not created merely by increasing competition and lowering prices with a view to increasing demand .
This is scandalous .     Madam President , I obviously find it very regrettable that , as fate would have it , this mistake crept in when one of France’s leading spokesmen for the ‘No’ campaign in the referendum was speaking .
This amendment , moreover , paves the way for the harmonisation for which we all hope and pray .
Will it cause a levelling down effect ?
With the country of origin principle , the Commission has turned its back on the Community method , which is aimed at sector-specific harmonisation .
Is that a good enough reason , however , to accept this compromise ?
I want helpfully to say to those countries that it is not by rejecting the compromise and thus , in the long run , the Services Directive or by bringing into question the Posting of Workers Directive that they will overcome this discrimination – quite the opposite .
