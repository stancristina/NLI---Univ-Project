been attacks on 65 churches .
You say that we act in accordance with Iraq 's priorities .
Moreover , the Christians in the previously relatively safe city of Kirkuk , too , have , for several months , faced a simply unrelenting series of kidnappings and killings , resulting in the flight of hundreds of Christian families .
Victims of human trafficking should never get the impression that they are alone or that they have been left in the lurch .
This is because there must not be even a small chance that anyone is sent back and then comes across the trafficker again .
It is time we combated illicit financial flow from developing countries and reformed European Investment Bank ( EIB ) policy in the direction of greater transparency with regard to tax have ns .
Europe 's political performance was simply poor .
In any case , I should like to thank you for the information you have always been willing to provide in discussions with us , with me .
In October , I congratulated all my Turkish counterparts on daring to hold that debate in spite of public opposition .
I also welcome the new zest that has been introduced by the Spanish Presidency when it comes to the negotiations with Turkey .
I see that the Turkish people are indeed taking up the challenge and are working hard to reform their own society .
Muslims who convert to Christianity , for example , are oppressed .
Therefore , prior to Thursday 's informal summit , we should like to see a statement by the Council and the Commission concerning not only the plans already proposed but also the measures that could still be taken to restore confidence in the euro as quickly as possible .
Commissioner , this is an example of the protectionism that keeps rearing its ugly head , and it is unacceptable .
We believe that , in the case of such cross-border restructuring operations , the European Commission itself must take the bull by the horns and set to work on a proactive policy instead of just watching and waiting .
You , the European Commission , must bring together the major industry actors to ensure that our automobile sector , too , does not become swamped with Chinese products in the near future .
Perhaps .
If two businesses merge , the European Commission must be notified , so why can this not be the case with restructuring ?
I would urge the Commission , in future cases of the restructuring of multinationals in Europe , to take ownership of such dossiers within the framework of its industrial policy rather than merely acting as coordinator between the various Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs .
Secondly , Commissioner , I was shocked to hear you say you are still not in possession of that dossier .
We have already held this debate , last September .
At a time when we shall soon have to look into whether it is permissible to promise that EUR 2.7 billion in State aid on the basis of a recovery plan , of a study by an independent consultancy , and at a time when all of us in Flanders know that Opel does indeed have prospects , I say to you , Commissioner , that you are being defeatist here .
In Germany , labour costs have been falling since the same period .
Cars are being rendered unaffordable , as people should be taking the bus .
I should just like to start with a few small points on which I do not agree with him .
Whilst I fully agree with Mrs Lulling that information is certainly very important , I note that - in my home country , at least ; it may be different in Luxembourg - it is actually the Christian Democrats who always put paid to this kind of thing .
The Dutch Reformed Political Party in the European Parliament has decided to refrain from voting .
I voted 'no ' to the question of whether we consider Barroso II suitable as a motor , initiator and inspirer of the European project .
A lack of a collective response is feeding public cynicism and political nihilism .
The Spanish Presidency can also set a good example in its own country , because the situation there is also urgent .
First and foremost , I think we must recognise that what we are witnessing with Greece is also the consequence of the failure of the Lisbon Strategy .
I therefore think that the approach has been wrong .
We will solve the problems in the euro area ourselves , so we do not need the IMF.
That is why I ask everyone , especially my fellow Members from southern countries , from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , to ensure most emphatically that the recommendation of the Commission 's environmental policy to include bluefin tuna in CITES Appendix 1 be adopted .
People apparently get a kick from shooting polar bears for fun , which I find truly repulsive .
However , there was not enough progress .
Rebuilding in bad places solves nothing .
I am uncommonly satisfied about the support and the creativity , but at this moment , I nevertheless want to emphasise that we are not there yet ; we may be adopting the frameworks , but the criteria must then be defined and that is still extraordinarily exciting , because you can do everything with money , even the wrong things , which I still have a few concerns about .
We are keeping an eye on the ball and will follow the situation on the ground
