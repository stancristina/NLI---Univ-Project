the European Parliament and for cooperation with the Council in the conciliation committee .
The public authorities are responsible for ensuring that the information they possess is made easily accessible , but the public is also entitled to receive environmental information following an express request made to the public authority .
In conclusion , I also wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Korhola , and all the members of the European Parliament 's delegation to the conciliation committee .
The Commission notes that the European Parliament seeks effective legislation and a strengthening of people 's right to high-quality environmental information .
Madam President , the word 'historic ' has been used a very great deal in connection with the write-ups from Copenhagen .
The EU is no Christian club .
There was undoubtedly a certain amount of drama in Copenhagen , but matters should never of course be too pre-arranged from the start .
Your objective , from Copenhagen to Copenhagen , has been crystal-clear all down the line .
As a liberal , I am very proud that it is a liberal government that has brought about these events .
Powerful leadership is needed , as well as the political courage to dare to implement a number of the institutional reforms required .
Referendums must be held .
Finally , we must also tackle the issue of how large the EU really can become .
The Swedish Presidency ended , of course , as a bloody police fiasco , while the Danish peace meeting may end up in the history books .
There has been no allaying of the anxiety , felt in Estonia for example , that EU bureaucracy will crush the newly won right to self-determination .
There has been no understandable explanation of why freedom of movement should apply from day one to capital , but from a much later date to people .
The enlargement process has thus again become a unilateral annexation whereby Brussels dictates and the candidate countries knuckle under .
Now , it is a question of ensuring that the referendums in the candidate countries are democratic .
The proposals are more often than not about control and repression .
Mr Haarder is well aware of this .
The fact that the EU is opening the door to immigrant labour should ease the pressure on asylum policy and , at the same time , give us an opportunity to cope with the increasing population problems .
That requires codecision making in this Chamber , something of which Mr Haarder is more aware than anyone else .
My question concerns the remaining problems , as mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council .
I have voted in favour of the resolution .
The EU would nonetheless be seriously threatened as a peace project if , in the future , the Council were to give Turkey a date for entering into membership negotiations while that country continues with the military occupation , begun in 1974 , of 37 % of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus , that is to say of a future Member State .
I , together with many others , fear that this change will seriously undermine that principle , something which would naturally be completely unacceptable .
The fact that China is pressing for this change to take place is not reassuring .
If a group such as Falun Gong , which is banned in China , were also to be banned in Hong Kong , it would be a serious offence against the principle of one country , two systems .
I am afraid that that is not the way it is .
Madam President , in September the Hong Kong Government tabled a proposal for a new law threatening freedom of expression , of the press and of religion in the region .
The law would increase the authorities ' powers to control and thus to censor everything printed in newspapers , as well as other media and other published material .
The Tibetan people have for many years been exposed to appalling treatment by Beijing , and this is continuing .
I do not believe that this development indicates any fundamental policy change on the part of China .
It is all the more worrying , therefore , that the two Buddhist Tibetans , Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup have now been sentenced to death .
As always , we condemn the death penalty wherever it is practised .
We shall continue to fight for the rights of Tibet , continue to condemn all human rights violations in China and hope that the Commission will step up the human rights dialogue with China .
It is a matter of justice that no one should be discriminated against because of their gender or for other reasons .
Any form of oppression , discrimination or stereotyping must be combated , and the opportunity of everyone to make free choices promoted .
It is not the task of politicians to determine how private employers take their recruitment decisions in the light of these considerations .
We believe that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs should have responsibility for those issues now being dealt with by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities .
I do not , however , share Mr Napolitano 's perspective which , at heart , appears to be in some way trying to reduce or even do away with the importance of the national political democracies .
The nations , and above all their governments and parliaments , must be the link between the local , regional and European levels .
Mr President , ' The states are the skeleton of Europe , and the regions its flesh and blood ' .
It is therefore only fair that they should be given a strengthened role to play now that we are reviewing European forms of governance .
