As the Commission wanted , I believe that we finally have a good basis for discussion .
Madam President , today ' s resolution comes at a turning point in work in this area .
That is why , and I wish to repeat this and make it very clear to your rapporteur , the Commission has a great deal of sympathy for the general approach that emerges from the draft legislative resolution .
Madam President , to conclude , the Commission reiterates its appreciation of the quality of the draft legislative resolution before us today .
We would even be in favour of a more clear-cut approach .
All these amendments are extremely serious , because they aim to settle notoriously persistent asylum seekers down for months on end to await a definitive ruling , which is bound to be negative .
At a time when the most rigorous measures are being put in place , our Parliament is indulging in an extremely lax approach which can only lead to an increase in illegal immigration and , along with this , further infiltration by terrorist networks .
- ( FR ) The report states that the Structural Funds , principally intended to promote regional development and the equality of men and women , still fall a long way short of what is needed .
This principle of the offence 's extraterritoriality must be firmly upheld .
As the rapporteur has emphasised , these practices are due to " the growing number of short-term contracts and insecurity of employment . "
This would , of course , be more practical for France , which would witness the dispersal of the tragic groups of illegal immigrants waiting in the north of the country to cross to Great Britain .
There is a need for another policy on the reception of immigrants particularly to regularise the position of those without personal documentation and to respect fundamental rights .
We have all been concerned and deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims ' families , of the injured and by the grief of the people of Toulouse .
Speeches relating to points of order :
I therefore suggest , Madam President , that the Conference of Presidents examines what significant political action we would be advised to take in this matter .
The European Union budget used to include a heading for emergency aid to deal with these disasters , but this was withdrawn .
Admittedly , we all know that this is a difficult debate , one that was opened during the re-negotiation of Agenda 2000 .
We must conclude that the precautionary principle did not prevail in this case .
In my view , we must change the way we approach these problems as patching up after each successive tragedy can only achieve so much .
Let us avoid sending our time bombs and dangers to other parts of the world .
I wish to pay tribute to the memory of the victims and also to the local authority workers , the emergency and medical teams , the Electricit√© de France employees and all the men and women who , with their skills and goodwill , gave their energies to serve the general interest .
Inspection bodies must publish their results .
What happened there is unimaginable .
In other words , a rapid action force could also quite easily exist in the field of civil defence .
This disaster has shown the limitations of risk management policy .
Putting the requirements of profit before those of safety is a crime .
This must by no means prevent our countries , with the European Union leading the way , from being able to adopt the measures necessary to guarantee the citizens the highest level of safety in their workplace and in their everyday lives .
Like my fellow speakers , I fully share the pain of all men and women in Toulouse and most particularly , the pain of the victims ' families .
I am however , rather surprised .
I agree with Mr Florenz .
I do actually still believe that this provision is essential to the effectiveness of judicial cooperation to combat money laundering .
I must in addition thank Commissioner Vitorino who always puts forward very sensible proposals , but has also proven to be very open-minded in his concern to make progress and who is willing for his proposals to be challenged if this moves the issue forward at European level .
Although we need to see all of these texts as part of an indissociable whole , there is good reason to be self-disciplined about the order in which we examine them .
Organising information campaigns in the countries of origin should make it possible to combat illegal immigration , but also to thwart the plans of criminal organisations which are at the origin of this modern form of slavery and which do not hesitate to have recourse to any means , in particular violence and terror , to achieve their ends .
A large number of these illegal migrants also benefit from criminal help , both abroad and in our own countries .
This is not an onerous task ; it is an honour , and I am delighted to be able to work together with you .
The Council has asked the Commission to evaluate its proposals on asylum and immigration in the light of the terrorist attacks in the United States of America .
An open coordination method of this kind seems to me to have the advantages of flexibility and transparency as well as respecting subsidiarity , while providing a powerful incentive to harmonise legislation and national practice - even spontaneously I would say - and being a good indicator of the areas in which Community intervention is really essential .
Slogans will not resolve the immigration problem .
The written communication focuses on legal immigration , but - apart from a few allusions - it minimises or
