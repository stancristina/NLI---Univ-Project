- ( FR ) The discussion on the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the EC and Egypt is a tragic illustration of the European Union ' s conception of foreign policy .
The same applies to the second proposal , relating to the European arrest warrant .
The so-called 'aid ' to the Balkans is , in fact , intended to 'support the balance of payments and help ease ... the external financial constraints ' of these countries , as stated in one of the FÃ¤rm reports ( Macedonia ) .
Was the Nice Council not aiming for a different objective when it mentioned 'the role of national parliaments in the European system ' as one of the four themes to be included on the agenda of the next IGC ?
The public will , once again , identify with the European project if the participants in the summit manage to present them with political objectives for which it is useful and necessary to strive .
In the confusion resulting from it , the linchpin of the European decision-making process , the national State , is abandoned .
Given that the same text was adopted at the last part-session and then rejected during this one , the least we can say is that the situation is unclear .
It is not research which must be restrained , but , rather , we must put an end to this economy based on profit .
This will therefore put the Union considerably behind its international partners , and leave many investigations in the air .
The negative vote demonstrates the inability of the rapporteur and the temporary committee to bring this difficult debate to a conclusion .
( FR ) The Fiori report represented an attempt by certain Members to reintroduce into European thinking an intended hierarchy for the dignity of human beings .
This new body aims , on the one hand , to meet citizens ' expectations by placing food safety at the top of their list of priorities , on a par with unemployment , and , on the other hand , to provide the European Union with a body that is able to defend and promote the European agricultural model on the international stage .
A new body is being set up - the European Food Safety Authority - and it must be said that this authority , because of the representatives appointed to form its Management Board , will necessarily be dependent on the European Commission , despite its legal title .
We are well aware that food contamination can affect a large number of people .
My second point is that it is the agency that must also stop the uncontrolled spread of contaminating transgenic products that are even infesting traditional cereal crops , since consumers are rejecting transgenic crops , whose only virtues are commercial .
In order to safeguard legal consistency , we demand that the conditional access systems and the other associated facilities are also included in Paragraph 2 , which is the purpose of Amendment No 26 , the only amendment tabled by our group .
I do not know whether all of you will still be here later on , or tomorrow for that matter , when I am coming back to Parliament .
In its current form , the work programme has unmistakably gained in clarity .
The introduction of euro notes and coins , in addition to the generalised usage of the new representative and electronic money will constitute an unprecedented qualitative leap forward in the development of Economic and Monetary Union .
The pace of the Council ' s activities is perfectly in keeping with that of the successive Council presidencies , and this will undoubtedly continue to be the case in future .
That is all very well .
In addition to this , half of the initiatives taken were not included in the legislative programme for 2001 .
And to start with , it is these national parliaments which should have the task of organising the debate with their citizens and to put forward proposals without having to pass through an artificial forum of associations , which are European in name but not at all representative .
That is a specific case in which we acted as intermediaries and basically each side saw the other ' s point of view , which finally proved the right approach to take .
With regard to one aspect of the international governance issues , we did not hide our disappointment at the outcome of the negotiations , although we accepted it .
This was because of pressure by a number of developing countries that were not really in favour of the idea and because of the American position , which could be described as reluctant , to say the least .
I think it is perfectly acceptable for me to say it to you in a definitive manner .
Indeed we must not conceal the inconsistencies between different interests and claim to always speak in the name of the south .
We believe that the parameters to be incorporated in these new inquiries must first be analysed with the Member States : density , statistical units , etc .
We abstained on the reports on the fisheries agreements with Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde because although they provide these states with a certain amount of revenue , the large-scale fishing by European countries merely formalises the plundering of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde ' s natural resources .
If it is to be effective and credible , however , the Authority will have to be supported by top scientific experts , while also drawing on the network of existing national agencies .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms , I would also like to congratulate the general rapporteur , Mr Costa Neves .
I would ask it to use this money
