I would like , at this point , to offer my sincere thanks to the other shadow rapporteurs , in particular , Mr Turmes , Mr Hegyi and Mr Blokland , who were reliable partners in negotiation despite differences in substance .
This is something that we can talk about .
I am also quite surprised !
I therefore believe it to be essential that the Commission 's reforms are implemented as soon as possible , and I would categorise the following points in those reforms to be of particular importance .
This avoids the need for tyre stocks to be destroyed , which would cause additional damage to the environment .
Ultimately , consumers have to be able to rely on labelling .
Here , however , they can see , that this package consists of regulations on monitoring , regulations on classification societies , accident investigations , insurance obligations , liability regulations , on port State control and flag State control .
There must be no repeats of the shipping accidents involving the Erika and the Prestige .
Then , however , you also have to do that with scientifically-based impact assessments that take account of the consequences for competition amongst means of transport , mobility costs and the competitiveness of Europe .
You say there are many options .
We demand the most comprehensive possible inclusion of all the external costs that arise that currently have to be borne by the budgets , and I will finish with my old ceterum censeo : the sensitive area of the Alps needs special protection .
I completely agree with you that if the Eurovignette is to be made more expensive as a result of exhaust emissions and noise , this extra money must also be used to reduce the environmental impact of road transport and not to fill holes in the finance ministers ' budgets .
Such children can remain in their own cultural circle or they can search out another one .
I have , I am afraid to say , heard no answer from you today on that question .
There was very much an opportunity today to provide a much more precise answer and to say how the Commission itself intends to assume its responsibility .
If you go on making speeches like this , the people in Lipsheim and Pfettisheim will begin to think that you have joined the French Communist Party .
It was excellent and we support it fully .
Amendment 92 will be the litmus test for you when we vote on it at midday .
My view of this is slightly different to that of my fellow members .
We also know why the measures already taken to stabilise the financial sector have not had any impact , or at least not a satisfactory impact .
It is essential for them to keep their jobs because otherwise , they cannot live an independent life in freedom and dignity .
Politicians are responsible for establishing these rules and we must not be diverted from this task .
Without a shared compass which will guide us through this crisis , we will unfortunately all get lost together in the fog that caused the crisis .
It is by no means certain that the measures presented in this report are suitable or satisfactory in this respect .
I have sent you the documents and you have failed to respond .
Given the other problems which there are in the world and , in particular , in Europe , it should be possible to solve these problems by mutual agreement .
Secondly , the problems relating to Macedonia have nothing to do with the fact that the democratic system there is allegedly not working , Commissioner .
I would like to underline what you said , namely that we are facing huge challenges in our neighbourly relations as regards stability , democratic change and now , of course , economic development as well .
This will be necessary and I hope that we shall still achieve a joint resolution on Russia .
I would be very grateful to you , and to the committee , if we could resolve this matter .
Thank you , Mr President .
It is therefore time we finally started talking specifically about a privileged partnership between the EU and Turkey .
We must be guided by the facts .
The first point relates to significant flexibility .
As I mentioned previously , we only have the possibility of saying yes or no , and that obviously imposes relatively significant limitations on the extent to which Parliament is able to collaborate in shaping the vote .
However , imagine that you had been one of the negotiating partners on the other side .
This is not even fully manageable , or even desirable , within the European Community itself .
I am actually very hopeful that trade will begin to play a larger role in this Parliament .
I would like to comment on a few things which you have not really dealt with in detail .
I know that sometimes it is against his beliefs with regard to trade .
I am very grateful for the excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency .
However , it is important for us to make sure that all people are in a position to make these choices .
We need consistency - and not just concerning the matter of alcohol - when it comes to both cosmetics and foodstuffs .
I have tried , as Mrs GrossÃªtete has said , to bring together various opinions .
Important areas now have to be urgently harmonised and regulated .
For example , the system of controls should be simplified , the administrative burden on the projects should be reduced and the size of the projects should be modified .
I hope that we can continue to work together in this way in future .
