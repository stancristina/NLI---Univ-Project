, this is what you are doing more generally for all EU Member States which , it is widely recognised , have fallen into bad habits in relation to the Roma .
The only criticism that can be levelled at the National Gendarmerie is the failure to declare this database , but the files do not contain genealogical information .
France is currently transposing the directive on freedom of movement as part of the fifth revision of its immigration laws in seven years .
To conclude this long debate , let me stress that it has served one purpose ; it has shown us the overriding need to address the nub of the problem , by encouraging national efforts and European policies as part of the rule of law on which European democracy is based .
Generally speaking , it is important for the Seoul G20 summit to mark a speeding up of the efforts to implement the framework laid down for promoting stronger , more sustainable and more balanced growth .
The war against protectionism is not won in a single battle but by maintaining a general state of alert , day after day .
This should take place within the context of a broader agreement to which all the major economies would subscribe and which would embody the ambition and effectiveness of international action and would fulfil the urgent need to protect environmental integrity .
Mr President , Mr Chastel , Mr Barroso , the financial , economic and social crisis that the world has been in for several years now is going to cost USD 60 trillion worldwide , which is the equivalent of one percentage point of annual growth .
Moreover , we suggest that , in a monetary union , debt should also be managed in common and that we should be able to envisage mutual debt issuance .
The more Parliament is brought on board in the early stages , the more chance we have of achieving a satisfactory and timely outcome .
That is the dilemma for the Commission .
Secondly , Mr Barroso , about the deficits : in my opinion , there are deficits and then there are deficits .
Can you not see the danger that is threatening us today ?
This harks back to the speech made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations yesterday , to the effect that we must follow our future course within the United Nations , through a root-and-branch reform of that institution and its governance .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this satisfaction is due to the fact that you have just passed amendments to the Council 's position on Draft amending budget No 3/2010 and on the draft budget for the financial year 2011 .
As a socialist , I do believe that a framework directive is indispensable for effectively tackling poverty , which affects 17 % of the European population .
This diplomatic service , for which the Commission has called so enthusiastically , will be a total departure from national heritages .
Indeed , Parliament will release the appropriations set aside if it receives satisfactory information from the agency on the follow-up to the 2008 discharge .
On the other hand , this would be a good time to question the contribution derogations enjoyed by certain States for historical reasons , and which have no grounds to exist today .
I believe it is time to have done with all this .
Extended maternity leave , improved working conditions ... women have been at the heart of the debate today in the European Parliament .
The European Parliament has chosen to have a strong position to negotiate with the Council and has therefore supported the principle of a 20-week period of leave paid at 100 % ( may I point out that in Sweden , maternity leave can be as long as 75 weeks , with 14 weeks exclusively for the mother , and the remaining can be shared with the father ) .
It is for these reasons that I have been unable to support this report , and why I consider that we should retain a sense of realism and allow Member States to keep a certain degree of flexibility on this matter .
Moreover , I regret that the provision that planned the possibility of extending maternity leave in the event of complication ( premature birth , disability , etc. ) was rejected .
Applying these measures poses a very great risk to the employment of women .
Extending maternity leave to 18 weeks , as proposed by the Commission , would have been an important step in improving the situation of women , by avoiding the pitfalls in the text as finally adopted by the European Parliament , when what is really important is to enable women to reconcile their professional life with their family life .
The vote on Mrs Estrela 's report is vitally important .
The directive has yet to be accepted by the Council .
The text passed today aims to confer on women in the European Union the right to 20 weeks ' maternity leave , which is four weeks more than in France , where women currently have the right to 16 weeks ' maternity leave .
Moreover , the agreement that we should get with the Council will allow a speedy entry into force of the directive and transposition by Member States as early as January 2011 .
MEPs have highlighted that the real aim of minimum income schemes should not only be to assist but also to support beneficiaries so as to enable them to move from a situation of social exclusion to a working life .
It is not assistance that Europeans need , but real jobs that pay a decent wage
