belong to at European level is very important , it does many very good things , but the essential thing is what happens here ’ ?
The European Convention was a success because it worked on the basis of European political families , and the interparliamentary meetings and the period of reflection will also be a success if we are able to work as political families , to understand each other and to reach agreements .
There is no soft law in the European Union ; the European Union’s great advantage is that it has developed a solid law , a positive law , which is applied by courts of justice , and we need precision .
In any event , I would like to thank Mr Lehne and Mrs Wallis for the work they have done and also to thank the Commission for persisting in this direction , because I believe that the future of the European Union will have to be shaped by means of a private law , as Mr Gargani has said , and , in particular , in the most immediate future , by means of an obligatory law in the field of contracts and not by means of mere recommendations .     Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Parish , on the work he has done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
In other words , we will all be winners .
The rapporteur , Mrs Laperrouze , has done an excellent job , and I congratulate her , because she has been able to reconcile the demands of the Members of this Parliament with the positions of the Commission and the Council .
I believe that this text that we are going to vote on tomorrow is a good step in the right direction .     .
During 2004 , the Commission completed its modernisation package .
Mr President , I would like firstly to thank the Austrian Presidency for its cooperation on this issue , and I would like in particular to thank Commissioner Wallström , who has shown considerable enthusiasm and commitment with regard to transparency and how to promote it .
It must start by opening up its doors to public debate ; the Council does not want to do so , however .
The implications of this openness that we want to see could be profound for the Council and would change its nature .
Please open up your doors .
Nevertheless , this demand is being met with deaf ears , an autistic response , and even no response at all .
Our group will propose a few minor changes and then support his work tomorrow .
The time has come to move ahead .
Mr President , I am speaking pursuant to Rule 134( 3 ) , as rapporteur for this report , to inform the House that the rapporteur is against the urgent procedure .
For these reasons , we are asking that our committee work during the remaining time so that we can bring a report from the competent committee to the House .
There is more coordination and a better relationship between them and I believe that we are achieving very positive results in practice .
I am very pleased that , as well as a general analysis of the European economy and of the role of the Lisbon Strategy and of the different instruments included in the broad economic policy guidelines for the economy of twenty-five , Mr García-Margallo’s report makes a particular reference to the challenges and needs of the eurozone , in which the twelve countries that share the single currency , the euro , need mechanisms for coordination and special attention in order to obtain the best possible results from the economic and monetary union .
Secondly , because , since we discussed the previous report , new factors have arisen : the relative failure of the European Constitution , a new financial perspective , some first interest rate rises , three candidates seeking to join the eurozone , and the Doha Round , which continues the Hong Kong trade talks .
Secondly , this report deals with what we might call institutional issues , whether of a constitutional nature or not .
With regard to taxation in an institutional sense , we call upon the Commission to respond to what the High Court of Justice has said : a uniform definition of tax residence , as an extension of citizenship , the principle of non-discrimination and a convention on double taxation .
We are calling for positive discrimination to be applied in favour of small and medium-sized businesses , with particular reference to the funding of risk capital .
As we know , scarcely a year ago , the employment guidelines were approved , and it was my honour to be rapporteur on that occasion .
Secondly , we have repeated certain fundamental issues which have not been adequately dealt with by the Commission .
They are horizontal reports , with which the enormous majority of Members of this Parliament identify , and which I believe reflect great forward-thinking and a great effort to achieve unity .
That was shown to be absurd .
Having established this principle in the modern democracies , democracy is representative and it is the parliaments that legislate ; they can make mistakes , but the only criterion for legitimacy is the parliamentary majority .
Commissioner , so far the Commission has done great work helping the outermost regions , but it is clear that in the new financial perspective there is a reduction in the European Union 's overall effort .
Independently of this process , we in the Commission of course maintain regular contacts with all of the States intending to enter the eurozone , we monitor them very closely and we cooperate with them in relation to the practical preparations for this important decision .
