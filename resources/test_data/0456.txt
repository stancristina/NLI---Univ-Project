and its population are at stake .
The European Parliament did not only pronounce judgment , it also tried directly and indirectly to influence the situation in Slovakia .
This depends on the negotiation formula .
That way the responsibility for Slovakia 's failure will be placed where it belongs : with the government .
It is also important , of course , that we make safety checks on highly radioactive waste .
And everyone has pointed out that at the moment there is no single country we can admit , as no single country is ready .
We are not talking about small reforms , we are talking about fundamental , far-reaching reforms which will adversely affect countless people .
This is what such a distinction may result in .
Then it might not be until 2020 or 2030 that the first country is able to join .
Speaking on the budget , on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs , it is clear that we are far from that .
Why has no attention been paid to the question whether it might be possible to simply elaborate on the existing model ?
Will countries like Russia or the Ukraine in future be able to lay claim to membership ?
I think he struck the right chord on that subject .
Because it looks unlikely that the financial problems within the Council will have led to the necessary solutions , enabling us to take the lead in the enlargement negotiations .
When the discussion goes the way it does in this debate , with the Irish wanting their money , the Portuguese wanting their money , and the Spaniards wanting their money , then at some point the moment will have to come when we find ourselves in a political crisis in this Community , with the risk that the candidates for enlargement , which should be able to benefit from the relationship with the European Union on time , will end up being the victims .
When I look at the objective 1 areas I notice that there are considerable opportunities for savings , for instance .
I have already said that I think that the discussion on net contribution is a mistaken one , but I have to acknowledge that it has become a political problem in a number of our Member States , and I think it is therefore necessary to arrive at a balanced distribution of the budget , whereby criteria other than the typical net contribution discussion are applied , whereas other criteria are needed .
This is also necessary to create more financial space within Agenda 2000 for the entrants than there is at the moment .
It starts with an important element from the socialist amendment : Asks the European Council to set in motion the enlargement process by a common act with all applicant countries .
This is not only an amendment which is extremely difficult to understand , I think it is also a very political amendment , because I assume that the Group of the European People 's Party will vote against the first part of this text .
That is a bit odd , which is why I asked for it to be removed with regard to Slovakia as well .
Madam President , I am glad I am not talking to an empty house , which is why I welcome the visitors in the public gallery .
Because monetary union without sufficient employment mobility aggravates this problem .
Many countries do not fit the EMU corset .
The coordination must also and explicitly be aimed at promoting growth which creates employment .
There is a sum of 26 billion left to spend in Wallonia , and 3 billion in Flanders , but in relative terms the underuse is primarily a Flemish problem .
I ascertain that in this regions a certain rhythm has been found , but that a transfer of financial resources from objective 4 to objective 5 is needed , as suggested by Mrs Van Lancker .
The situation concerning the Community Leader programme is extremely worrying , also in the rural policy sector .
This is an absolute scandal .
So we give our full support to the direction indicated in paragraph 40 , but not to the one indicated in paragraph 34 .
It should be ECU 750 million , of course .
But then we should also emphasize UCLAF 's criticism regarding the use of these funds .
How can one imagine that 20 kilometres down the road money is , as it were , transferred , and jobs are being transferred .
Mr President , for me Mr Decourri√®re 's report , which we have before us , simply confirms the collapse of the structural funds programme , particularly as far as Belgium is concerned .
That may sound hard to those who are unfamiliar with my country , but it does not make it any less true .
We have to observe that in the regions Turnhout and Limburg , which fall under objective 2 , payments are made out of only 49 % of the credits , and the results regarding unemployment are below the Flemish average .
Let us hope that this will be the case in the future .
That is why we should use principles like geographic and thematic concentration with the main emphasis on investment , infrastructure , information technology , the environment and vocational training , with an accent on endogenous development .
Who takes part in the negotiations ?
Who takes part in the partnership ?
It is this balance which we call the European social model , and we would like to preserve , improve and adapt this European social model where necessary in this new organization of work .
I think we have a report before us which is keeping pace with the times .
