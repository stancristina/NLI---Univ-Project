I also wish to make it clear , however , that what we are talking about here is not the creation of a European police force .
I consider this to be an extremely important priority , not only for the candidate countries but also to ensure that the guarantees that we have to provide for our citizens that enlargement will be accompanied by safeguards for the security of Member States .
Our priority is to see actions in the field of training launched as quickly as possible .
It is a proposal for a regulation that seeks to make exercising rights of access and accommodation for the children of separated parents easier , in an attempt to prevent children becoming a kind of hostage in the dispute between parents who are resident in different Member States .
In this way , the regulation responds to the need for a direct application of uniform rules on such important issues as the regulation of parental power and the exercise of visiting rights .
I wish to say in conclusion that I support the amendment proposed by the rapporteur in Article 1 , in which it must be specified that the period of access should not be less than one day .
As the House knows , the Commission and the Council have the firm intention of adopting a programme of mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters by the end of the year .
This French initiative therefore refers to the scope of the Brussels II Regulation and is , if I may put it this way , a revolutionary initiative .
The first is that we are working together with the Council in order to improve the text , specifically with regard to its most complex issue , which is the delicate balance between the need to guarantee that the child will be returned immediately after the visit , and also the need to safeguard the possibility of guaranteeing protection of the child whenever this should prove necessary .
I feel that we should lay down an indicative criterion but not a legal obligation , trusting judges who are called on to apply the law to be reasonable enough to guarantee that the rights of access they grant are effective .
I shall conclude , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , by saying that I am convinced that , with the adoption of this regulation that has a limited range but which is of symbolic value and important practical application , I am convinced , I repeat , that we are taking an initial , important step towards bringing the European Union closer to the citizens , particularly those citizens who , because of the circumstances of their lives , have had the misfortune to experience the tragedy of separation or divorce , which is always a tragedy , but which should certainly not have repercussions for every child ' s right to happiness .
Certain sports organisations claim that these conflicts can only be resolved by the inclusion of a reference to sport in the Treaty .
Other equally important sports organisations , however , such as the national Olympic committees , for example , or national sports federations , have specifically insisted on the need to develop Community actions for the promotion of sport .
It is in this spirit , Mr President , that the Commission will continue the intense dialogue that it has maintained over the last few months with the sports movement as a whole .
We all know , however , that when they were originally defined , or even when amendments were added at a later date , no one , but no one , not even those drafting them or those who took the decisions , thought for a moment that a current legal framework would hang this truly imperial weight around the neck of the sporting world .
Otherwise , no problem will find a satisfactory solution .
I repeat : we need to protect sport , not to abandon it .
This is even more true if we look at the specific case of the United Kingdom , which , together with other , equally European countries which happen to be outside the European Union , makes up the basic pool for long-established European competitions .
I appeal to the forthcoming IGC not to be another wasted opportunity for sport .
In fact , the EU directive governing this field , which was adopted unanimously in 1993 , laid down the conditions under which Member States could , if they wanted , apply user charges or motorway tolls .
All these measures are presently the subject of an examination by the Commission responsible under the EU Treaty for ensuring the consistency and coordination of national activities within the common transport policy .
If there is one area in which there has been no lack of unity , it is in this relationship .
By May , by Bonn , the European Union must take action on two fronts : firstly through diplomacy , since the scenario that the United States will ratify the agreement is the least likely , and so diplomatic action must be developed with the other members of the umbrella group .
I think that it is timely , on the eve of the Nice Summit , to question the current state of this spirit of "de facto solidarity " , without which , European integration can be clearly neither genuine nor authentic .
It is also , however , a text in which its authors , even in the knowledge that they risk predictable political failure , reveal a vision that is focused above all on the powers and competences of the European Parliament itself , and call for ever greater resources for parliamentary intervention without dedicating a single word to the crucial role of national parliaments .
