Will this agreement reinforce the European Judicial Area ?
The second issue concerns the doubts over whether a Member State has the capacity to decide if a person should be sent to the United States or referred to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court .
Nonetheless , this cannot be deemed adequate in terms of democratic control .
I communicated this to the Presidency of the Council in a letter sent in December last year .
If our message is not brought before the Council , Parliament would have to consider the possibility of taking its case to the Court of Justice .
My questions concern the contents of this agreement with a country whose judicial system remains significantly different from ours .
When , in the future , Member States are bound by this arrangement , how will it be possible to guarantee that a summons issued by the International Criminal Court takes precedence over a request for extradition issued by the United States ?
Has anything been done to ensure the United States allows the detainees to appear before a judge ?
It should also play a key role in our relations with our new neighbours following enlargement .
If we know , understand and trust each other , we can work together and improve our relationship .
The European Union should provide what our Mediterranean partners are always asking for : an area of shared prosperity .
The truth is that I would like it if Mr Ortuondo Larrea did not always bring up national concerns in this Parliament and if he could make contributions to European integration , which is why I believe we are all here .
There are certainly many and varied factors preventing the poorest countries from being able to board the development train and win the battle to eradicate poverty : external debt , first and foremost , the great shame hanging over developing countries , the fratricidal wars that devastate so many poor countries , the AIDS pandemic , corruption at every level of public life , but this failure can also be explained by the use of foreign models and the fact that development objectives have in the past been set without the participation of those receiving aid .
We should provide them with the means - in a word - to play a leading role in their own development , to which they have a right .
It is therefore a very broad concept , which has been effectively summarised in the report we are discussing today , for which I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer .
Democracy goes far beyond periodic elections and requires the implementation of flexible participation and dialogue mechanisms between citizens and institutions , as well as their democratisation , based on the concepts of good governance , transparency and combating corruption .
In fact , many fora and macroconferences have already been held in relation to the need to increase efforts to eradicate poverty , which is undoubtedly the most serious problem we face .
The tragedy of child soldiers means that , in some West African countries , mothers prevent their sons from attending school for fear that they will be kidnapped and not return home , as we have seen recently , last week , in Ivory Coast , in a report by various agencies and other NGOs present on the ground .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would also like to thank you for your Communication and congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work concerning this fundamental issue of education and training in the context of reducing poverty .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the Commission 's Communication , but above all I would like to congratulate Mr van den Berg on his excellent report , which I believe contains elements and measures that are essential in this task .
Therefore , and because it is their fundamental right , education must be our priority : high-quality , obligatory , general , public , primary education lasting at least six years .
Secondly , they will be discussed alongside the employment guidelines .
I should like to take this opportunity of highlighting the splendid work of the spokespersons for the various groups .
We understand that the Treaty states that national policies , supply policies and short-term policies are policies of common interest and should be coordinated .
Once upon a time there was a Spanish constitution stating that Spaniards should be fair and charitable .
This policy is aimed at achieving price stability .
It also has to check carefully to ensure Member States do not exceed the 3 % limit .
We stress that countries should also reduce taxes whenever possible .
We advocate increasing labour mobility .
Under investment occurs in the private sector .
It would then be possible to establish how best to proceed .
For the first time , the broad guidelines of economic policy cover a three-year period .
It is also the first time a specific reference to the Eurozone has been included .
The underlying problem however is not devising new plans , but implementing what we have already agreed .
The latter entailed implementing polices promoting cyclical economic patterns thus storing up problems for the future .
We fully agree on the need to increase employment .
Our yearly progress reports are contained in the summary reports .
The main idea behind moving from one to three years is to focus more on the application of annual principles , and less on their definition .
The sole exceptions are the recommendations we use to identify certain failures and , of course , the Stability Pact .
I think we share your disquiet .
If it is to preserve that balance , the European Union must make a more determined effort to take the action many have called for in recent times .
Another is failure to adopt technological innovation .
