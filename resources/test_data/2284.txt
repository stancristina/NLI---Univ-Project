so on ?
How many were simply transferred to another flag ?
How many vessels continue to fish either here in the Community or elsewhere under what is , in many cases , a flag of convenience ?
The Commission must get conservation measures right , but I am not convinced that MAGPs are the way to do that .
They can be circumvented easily and they do not fully take into account national measures such as days at sea .
How can the Commission reconcile this with the fact that its own report says , and I quote again : " It could be argued that a reduction in activity would have a more direct impact on the exploitation rates than a reduction in capacity . "
I hope that the Commission will review its position and not impose swingeing cuts on our fleets .
In Scotland , the proposed cuts would cost hundreds of jobs in particularly fragile rural areas .
The new proposals to cut fleets will , ironically , fall mainly on the Scottish pelagic fleet where MAGP targets have actually been met through control measures .
I welcome today 's reports on this agenda , but I hope the Commission will think again when it comes to the interrelation between fleet sizes and other conservation measures .
We have got to get this right so that in the long run fish stocks in Europe are conserved , thereby ensuring the continuing viability of our fisheries communities .
Mr President , firstly , can I congratulate the rapporteur and the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries on his report on the revision of the regulations on the conservation of fishery resources and technical measures for the protection of juvenile marine organisms .
This report , whose name probably causes more confusion than clarity amongst those people who have not been following , the subject is in fact a number of separate amendments updating the original regulation .
Firstly , with regard to separator trawls or nets with sorting grids used in shrimp fisheries ; secondly , the revision of minimum sizes for a number of bivalve molluscs and crustaceans ; and thirdly , with respect to the establishment of a closed area for fishing for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland .
It is on the last proposal that I primarily wish to speak .
This is a very good example of the eco-system approach to fisheries : taking action for environmental reasons beyond those applying strictly for fish stock levels .
In 1998 , a report by the Working Group on Eco-System Effects of Fishing Activities of the International Council for Exploration of the Seas identified for the first time that sea birds , specifically the kittiwake , which has been experiencing low breeding success over recent years , were in fact in competition with the industrial fleet , primarily Danish operators fishing for sand eels off the East coast of Scotland and England .
The United Kingdom requested the Commission to submit an appropriate proposal in the light of that report and the United Kingdom made initial approaches to the Danish government to encourage their support for the initiative .
It was suggested that a closed season for sand eel fishing should be introduced between April and August when the breeding birds were most dependent on sand eels for food .
The ICES subsequently looked at the science again and suggested a closed area stretching from mid-Northumberland northwards to include the Grampian coast .
This closed area is the one proposed by the Commission in December as part of the annual TAC Regulation and adopted by the Council .
These measures have , I understand , already been accepted in principle by the key parties involved .
I therefore hope the Council will be able , after this debate , to reach a speedy agreement .
It is important for the conservation of sea birds .
It is important for us to demonstrate our concern in this area .
Mr President , I should just like to say that I hope the Conference of Presidents will take serious note of the numbers - or rather lack of numbers - of Members in the Chamber voting on that very important report .
Mr President , as I was coming to Parliament this morning I remembered the night I sat by my father 's bedside looking at his wasted body as the lung cancer finally claimed him .
I am sure I am not the only person in this Parliament to have lost friends or family through smoking .
The fact is that if the laws on drugs which apply in most countries across the European Union were applied consistently , then tobacco manufacturers would all be locked up behind bars and condemned as murderers for deliberately making their products addictive .
Yet when it comes to the greatest killer drug of all , we apply different rules .
There is no consistency and we say that people should be allowed to choose for themselves .
As a Liberal , I agree with that position : people should be allowed to choose for themselves .
However , everything possible must be done to ensure that those decisions are made with full knowledge of the consequences .
The manufacturers say that everyone knows the risks already ; that there is no need to increase the size of the health warnings , and that they certainly should not adopt the sort of proposal I am putting forward , to supplement the health warnings with some hard-hitting pictures to drive home the consequences .
Frankly , the manufacturers have an addiction of their own : an addiction to trying to mislead us .
If the rules on advertising were changed , manufacturers would grasp the opportunity to promote their products in every possible way , because they believe that advertising works .
