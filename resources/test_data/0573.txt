for a directive on more energy-efficient public procurement should also be issued immediately .
The quantitative and qualitative targets set at the Lisbon Summit and the fact that promoting high levels of employment was included in the European Union 's main objectives has helped fight unemployment and reduce the number of unemployed to 13 million .
What happens , however , when a Member State such as Greece , where unemployment has risen from 6.3 % to 11.1 % in the ten years between 1990 and 2000 , has had the same recommendations on combating unemployment since 1998 ?
The European Union 's restructuring policy does not create jobs , it restricts them , especially full-time , stable jobs , while so-called growth deprives millions of people of the right to work or offers them a poor substitute in the form of part-time employment , with all the financial and social consequences that has for family life .
Pronouncements about combating poverty , full employment and so on are hypocritical and their only objective is to foster self-delusion among the working classes and take the edge off the social problems which the very policy of serving multinational interests creates .
I should particularly like to take this opportunity of thanking the Danish Presidency for the way in which it has cooperated on this novel experiment by the dual presidency , which is no easy task .
The second point I wanted to mention concerns the development of military capabilities , which are perhaps the most important factor in completing the Union 's operational capabilities and which have also made considerable progress .
A conference was held on improving capabilities , giving both the Member States and third countries the opportunity to make additional contributions , and the action plan on capabilities was adopted in Laeken .
It says that we have the political will to implement the CFSP mechanism , even if it is still unfinished .
And as part of this procedural operational framework for the defence and security policy mechanism , I should also mention that framework guidelines defining the funding system for military operations , which is again a very important aspect , were adopted in Seville .
As far as the first question is concerned , progress has not been exactly spectacular .
I should like to point out that this is not entirely accurate because , although resolving this issue would certainly make it easier to complete permanent arrangements , the fact that it is outstanding is no reason to delay on individual matters .
As far as relations with third countries are concerned , significant progress was also made in Seville , which adopted arrangements to broaden the provisions made in Nice on the involvement in European defence and security policy of potential partners , such as Canada , Russia and the Ukraine .
A great deal of more or less important progress has been made , but there is too little time to describe it all .
For our part , we shall do our very best during our presidency .
He would also observe that , basically , European policy in both areas of tension is conspicuous by its absence .
Where we have intervened in crises , we have not intervened either to create a crisis or to resolve it , we have intervened merely in order to manage it .
It needs a stratagem defined in terms of a number of general principles on which we all agree .
Thirdly , a balance in relations between the centres of power on the world map .
Having said which , I think that important progress has been made but that more needs to be done , because a Common Foreign and Security Policy forms an integral part of economic development and peace and every other kind of development .
I shall confine myself to two comments : first , on the question raised by Mr von Wogau , who highlighted an interesting shortcoming in Europe 's defence and security policy , to do with the absence of a single market .
We do in fact agree that this is an area in which cooperation , be it on the production side or be it on the research and development side , as well as more general cooperation between countries can bring in significant results .
My second comment has to do with the question raised by Mr Lagendijk .
These are principles which Parliament itself has called for and they are included in the Treaties , which is why we are working to make a success of them .
And there are very specific reasons why not .
We can , to a large degree , give real expression to the aim of bringing Europe closer to its citizens , the promised strengthening of the democratic credentials of the European Union and , more especially , of the European Parliament , and the much-vaunted objective of greater transparency , by properly developing the institutions of petition and complaint .
In both cases , whatever else , these issues should be at the top of the agenda of the political groups .
The second , the Ombudsman 's report , examines complaints about the failure of Community institutions to comply with Community law .
At the same time , in view of the fact that , one way or another , all three reports involve national authorities , such as national parliaments , national courts and national administrative departments , and many of the issues touched on in them depend on their degree of involvement and control , I think that the possibility of these reports being debated in the European Parliament in the presence of representatives of the national authorities should be addressed .
Obviously these problems will increase with enlargement .
I shall confine myself to a few words on the content of the report
