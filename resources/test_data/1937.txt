, we and the Commission have a responsibility in this area .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I firstly wish sincerely to thank Mr  Hughes and Mr Andersson for raising this issue .
It is also , ultimately , a question of civilisation and a question of how we see each other as people .
Are we certain of that ?
Would European legislation make for a more effective solution to the problem ?
Since the Commission put forward its proposal , it has taken us 22 months to arrive at the first reading and , just as Mr  Harbour stated earlier , clarification is required to prevent those of our fellow MEPs who are less familiar with our procedures from being confused during the vote .
Listening to the debate on these issues , you often get the feeling that every country has the world’s best education system .
He has not succeeded in obtaining recognition in Finland for the crane operator’s examination he took in Sweden .
We must not again act in a way that makes it simpler for companies than for individuals to move across our borders .
I am , however , pleased to see that regulations concerning language requirements are being introduced that are more precise than those put forward by the Commission .     We have voted in favour of this report because its content is sound .
We regret that the report makes no distinction between those areas of immigration to be handled at European level and those to be handled at national level .
We also believe that the concept of civic citizenship does not add anything of value but , rather , contributes to conceptual confusion .
Those Member States that require assistance in monitoring their borders must be able to obtain this following application by the responsible authorities of said Member States .
The paragraph supports the development of a European Corps of Border Guards , made up of special units , which would be financed by the Community .
Zimbabwe has for a long time been a completely lawless country , economically impoverished and badly affected by AIDS .
Mugabe must go .
The whole of the international community must be crystal-clear in its condemnation of Mugabe’s regime and tell him that our patience is exhausted .
At the same time , we in the EU must support the opposition .
The important work for peace done by Archbishop Courtney must not , of course , die with him , but must live on .
The rebel movement , the FNL , has denied all involvement , but nor does it support the peace process .
The peace process is very fragile .
The wounds in Burundi following 300 000 or more murders will never heal if justice is not seen to be done and the murderers not held accountable .
That is worrying , not only in anticipation of the turn-out at the forthcoming parliamentary election , but also because there is a danger of confidence in the entire European project being undermined . 2004 will therefore need to be a very successful year , as it potentially can be , given the impending historic enlargement and unification of Europe .
It is interesting to observe that the Norwegian Social Democratic politician , Thorbjørn Jagland , has nominated the EU for the Nobel Peace Prize .
That is why a Constitution needs to be adopted , and it is only fair that people also have their say about such a Constitution in conjunction with the parliamentary election .
I hope that you can use all your diplomatic sleight of hand also to convince your friends in the Council of the urgency of the matter .     Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to do as the Commissioner did and note that his area is one of the most important for European consumers .
Unfortunately , it has had quite the opposite effect in the country I know best , namely Finland .
Now , no such services can be provided .
As emerged from the parliamentary question to Commissioner Monti in December 2002 , we expect you to look seriously at this issue so that all new businesses are given a genuine opportunity to operate and so that certain standards do not become standards that reduce competition and the free flow of information .
The effectiveness of the codecision procedure has made a substantial contribution in this case .
The directive on public procurement stipulates full competition between tenderers .
There were few of us who , at the beginning , had believed that the final outcome would be so close to our starting position .
Our aim was to increase competitiveness , to promote equal treatment and to improve our tools for combating organised crime and corruption .
Thought can , however , still be given to such matters .
I even wish , unusually for an MEP , to thank the Presidency , which dealt with this issue and with which we negotiated .
Without all these combined efforts , it would have been impossible to take this step .
We expect this step to contribute to more intensive European trade , the consequence being gains in terms of prosperity for the EU , our citizens and our European populations .
That is something we are really pleased about .
I believe that this is very important now that we are talking about a competitive Europe .
I believe that what the Conciliation Committee has arrived at , and which really is closer to the Liberal idea , is what the majority signed up to at second reading .
I really do believe that the final outcome we arrived at is a tool in this context too .
I want to thank all the drivers who contributed to this end result , and I note that we have steered the matter into a safe harbour
