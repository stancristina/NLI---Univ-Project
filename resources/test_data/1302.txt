for information services , all of which constitutes real violations of the rights , freedoms and guarantees of the citizens of the various Member States .
Mortality rate while waiting for a heart , liver or lung transplant usually ranges from 15 to 30 % .
I should like to make clear that the reality of volunteering may still be somewhat blurred in the statistical data , in definitions and in their usage .
We should encourage it and recognise it , but never view it as an extra that we can take advantage of or use as an excuse for doing less towards offering and creating a constantly improving quality of life in European societies .
It is worth remembering that , in accordance with the 'n+2 rule ' , this amount will 'expire ' if it is not used by the end of 2008 .
This legitimises social dumping and attacks on collective negotiation and bargaining in the EU and encourages 'competition ' between workers , in practice imposing the prevalence of the 'country of origin' principle , that is to say , paying lower salaries and downgrading protection of workers ' rights in contractual relations with employers .
In the last two years , we have witnessed around 100 prison sentences and other punishments meted out to people who have signed the movement 's petition .
This report contains a proposal in paragraph 8 that seems to me to be well-intentioned overall , but it includes a suggestion to ban fishing activity over seamounts , which would be impracticable in the Azores , since almost all deep-sea fishing is over seamounts .
Finally , as pointed out , we stress the need to find different and appropriate solutions for different species , taking account of the selective fishing gears used in each region . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur .
In the European Union , therefore , we major raw materials importers have to view this issue with special concern .
Because we believe that these important Fisheries Committee proposals must be reflected in the resolution to be approved tomorrow in the plenary , we are re-tabling a set of eight amendments for which we seek your support . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the Commissioner and the Commission on this initiative , which surely offers a new opportunity in response to the problems of the outermost regions and their people .
I would also like to say in conclusion that although the Committee on Fisheries ' opinion certainly focuses on the essential aspects , there are some details that could be highlighted .
In addition , to ensure that measures in favour of these regions and the clarification of their status are more coherent and effective , not only must their specific outermost nature be taken into account across the board in the various Community policies , but also an adequately funded Community programme providing support to these regions must be set up and must encompass all existing measures .
Above all , the Committee on Regional Development hopes that the integrated maritime policy will have a very positive impact on the development and protection of the EU 's coastal regions , islands and outermost regions .
Furthermore , it is essential to improve the working conditions of seafarers , guaranteeing jobs , respect for the principle of equal pay for equal work , a reduction in working time and no application of the multi-skilling requirement , and resisting any renewed attempt to liberalise port services at EU level , in particular as regards intra-Community shipping ; the 'sound financial basis ' for the maritime policy should not be built at the expense of the European Fisheries Fund and the common fisheries policy , but should be based on the principle that new priorities will require new financial resources .
The budgetary process has now begun with the submission of the Commission 's proposed Community budget for 2009 .
On the other hand the report makes no mention of guaranteeing workers ' rights , in particular with regard to the EP 's increased outsourcing of services over recent years .
Steeped in neo-colonial ambitions , it seeks to return many countries to the role of producers of raw materials for the countries of the EU , using technology and dominance and control of the market mechanisms - including financial speculation - to promote economic dependence and exploitation by the multinationals .
That is why we sought to present them again and also to be consistent with the view which we take in Portugal .
Secondly , there must be an effective policy to combat speculative trade and finance , and there must be information for consumers and guarantee of transparency .
In view of all the above , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats tried to amend the report in various aspects , in particular as regards the content of the demand for a non-discrimination directive ; they were not successful since the voting went against them .
In fact , the February 2007 Commission decision did recognise that Member States should retain the right to grant authorisation for the operation of complementary ground components within their territories . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Aubert report on illegal fishing was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Fisheries , as the rapporteur , whom I congratulate , has already mentioned .
In any event , with this report and the subsequent regulation , the European Union is taking a very important step and sets an example that ennobles us and fills us with pride .
