Yugoslavia .
And solidarity , let us not forget , is a duty which cannot be replaced by goodwill or charity .
As a result , the Union 's financial instruments must be well defined and match the realities .
Mr President , I believe that Mr Herman has presented the issue in its proper terms .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the annual report of the Ombudsman , Mr Södermann , covering the year 1995 , has two features which I think warrant attention , namely that this is the first report of the Ombudsman to the European Parliament and that the period which it covers is very short .
For all those reasons I think the European Parliament must express its entire agreement with the contents of the European Ombudsman 's First Annual Report and must encourage Mr Södermann to keep on working with the same sensitivity and the same meticulousness as he has done so far .
The Soria family , like the families of all the victims of that sinister era , demand justice .
It may even encourage justice in Chile to act in freedom and without fear .
We are motivated by the basic principle with which I began this speech , that is , that without justice there is no democracy .
Mr President , let us render unto Caesar the things which be Caesar 's and unto God the things which be God 's .
Politics take on a purpose only if they extend to practice and do not keep repeating the same thing , each time with less impact .
In the second place it should be said that the present directive needs to be revised to include in its field of application occupations and categories of business likely to be involved in money laundering and similarly the directive should be revised to bring greater flexibility into the measures to be taken and the provisional confiscation of goods suspected of being of illegal origin .
The building of Europe must develop by means of respect for the cultural and linguistic heritage of its citizens and initiatives like this help to encourage that diversity .
The European Charter on minority languages forbids any kind of discrimination with regard to their use and the safeguarding of that principle may be endangered by an upsurge in new forms of communication in privileged languages .
Support for the weaker languages deserves special emphasis , particularly in bilingual regions .
An initiative that the excellent Mouskouri report , which I shall vote for today , has undoubtedly improved thanks to the tabled amendments .
It is simply a political declaration intended to strengthen the position of both ACP countries and European banana producers , defending what is done by the banana COM.
A compromise solution has been found that I think is reasonable for everyone .
Mr President , as this is my maiden speech I should like to begin by thanking the presidency for their kind words of welcome on 20 May and thank all of my colleagues that I have met here in this excellent Assembly .
I think that production is not too high but demand is too low .
Yet its geographical position presents the main obstacle to its development .
Since Ceuta is not part of the customs union , products from the city face a much harsher quota regime than Moroccan products .
This will give the Ceutan aquaculture industry a breath of fresh air and at least help to start up the activity and seek markets with better future prospects .
I think we must not underestimate the importance of that and I think Mr Prodi 's government has acted with delicacy , with what the Italians call finezza .
At the same time I should like to nip something else in the bud , a venticello which is going round Brussels too , which consists in saying that this solidarity in the face of the mad cow crisis , payments to the producers who have suffered loss , will come out of the common organizations of the market and in particular those of the countries of the south .
But the Italian presidency , which I was saying earlier had shown such finezza , did not do so on another subject .
If it does not produce positive results , to make any kind of enlargement is madness .
That has meant that the Italian Government has had to concentrate on that problem , which is a real problem , but which has determined the outcome of the European Council .
But I would say that this Parliament unanimously regards the European Council of Florence not as a step forward but as a step backward or at least a phase of paralysis which shows there is a crisis in the Union .
I shall try to contribute something to this debate and I shall therefore go back to two words which are constantly in the mouth of Mr Santer , the President of the Commission , and which have been mentioned by Mr Prodi : liberty and security .
We must lay down certain common conditions for entry , for residence , for the legal system in the Union for subjects of third countries and we must make possible mutual recognition of jurisdiction which will give full effect to the judgments pronounced by the courts of each State , and we must resist terrorism , fraud and the other forms of organized crime .
Security , Mr President is no doubt the other essential dimension of necessity .
We are speaking of rules , Madam President , that is of legislative provisions .
Simplification , codification , the best technique of legal draftsmanship is therefore an urgent task which cannot be deferred .
On the one hand there are specific fields which the Molitor Group did not deal with and which affect citizens , such as legislation on the environment .
