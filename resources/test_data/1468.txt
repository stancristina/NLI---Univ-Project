As a result , when determining the eligibility criteria for funding , we must consider the possibility of taking certain aspects into account other than purely per capita income .
Before this House , I want to thank them both , and also their institutions , for their extremely positive cooperation with the Commission , particularly during this difficult struggle with the economic crisis .
This is the first time that a report has referred not only to the European Investment Bank , but also to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , or EBRD.
I believe most of the speeches expressed a high level of agreement and consensus on the guidelines that have just been set out by the Presidents of the two banks , at this time of crisis but also of opportunity .
Of course the Commission is ready right now to work together with Mr Maystadt to identify the most effective tools , which at the same time comply with our rules , in order to find a solution to such an important issue , particularly at a time when the EIB and also the EBRD are having to resort to markets where it is more difficult than in previous years to raise finance under favourable conditions and with the highest possible rating with which both banks work .
I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Blokland not only on the question but also on the resolution that he has drawn up .
We do not believe that this is a matter for the Commission to decide ; on the contrary , we think that this ought also to be decided in an international agreement .
The European Commission 's proposal does not demand that the food involved in the programme be produced exclusively in the Community , since it considers that to be contrary to the rules of the World Trade Organisation .
It is difficult to comprehend why , at a time when it is most needed , the Commission wants to save Community money from the CAPs most social facet , especially since there is a budgetary surplus every year in the agricultural budget .
This approach is in keeping with this Parliament 's position on other similar programmes which we were recently discussing in the House , such as the plan to hand out fruit in the schools .
I want to make it clear that the Spanish Government participates in a practice that is systematically linked to mistreatment of its citizens , destruction of the environment and large-scale corruption .
Mr President , it is clear to us and to Europe , to the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and to us in Europe , that energy has become a foreign policy tool , an element of change that is capable of sparking conflicts or uniting us , and this is precisely the subject that concerns us today .
The European project will only have credibility if Europe is perceived as a place where every kind of discrimination is outlawed .
It may not be what I , or many of us here would have done , but it is a good starting point .
The Mediterranean and the Atlantic Canary seaboard have become pathways towards a non-existent ' El Dorado ' for many people who have nothing , full of risks in transit , and frustrations and penalties upon arrival .
We must also hunt out traffickers from their networks with intelligence and specialised forces , and at the same time toughen up criminal laws in the destination countries .
Indeed , our very strong first-reading agreement on ownership unbundling gave the negotiating team a lot of leverage during the talks .
I must admit that Parliament hoped for a much more ambitious agency .
We have broken a taboo once again : the free market is not sacred and is even less so in times of crisis , when the pockets of European consumers are emptier than ever .
Nevertheless , we are aware that responsibility does not so much lie with the Commission as with Member States , and that the low implementation is particularly due to the approval , in May and June 2007 , of funds included in the solidarity framework and management of migration flows , and to delays in the implementation of other specific programmes ( such as those relating to civil justice and information , and drugs prevention ) .
The Spanish defence minister is currently in Somalia leading the operation to protect the tuna fishing boats deployed in the Indian Ocean against pirate attacks .
On a number of occasions , the Commission and the European Parliament have lamented the low level of compliance and we have requested , among other things , that Member States increase controls , harmonise inspection criteria and sanctions , and that inspection results be more transparent .
Mr President , Commissioner , there is one initial , major objection that has to be raised against this proposal : that is , its total failure to consult the sector concerned .
Mr President , I would like to use these last two minutes of time to express my thanks .
We are in a similar situation as regards the possibility of extending or , in any case , postponing the period for implementing the electronic system .
Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for highlighting some of the main concerns raised by the Commission 's proposal .
We have just witnessed the Commission 's strong commitment to communitising and standardising control , and it would prove difficult to understand the way in which the remaining measures serve , on the contrary , to break up and fragment that control , or the fact that different rules are created for the same activity , depending on where it is carried out .
In my view ,
