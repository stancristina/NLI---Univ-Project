everywhere and in highly worrying proportions , particularly for everyday goods and essential items .
There is the rub , Mr President .
Mr President , I would like to comment on the second proposal for a directive and I shall also take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election .
If adopted in its current form , I think it might represent an improvement on the current situation .
I am also concerned by the emphasis placed on biodiversity , with the headache involved in setting up the Natura 2000 network , both in France and elsewhere .
The Americans said that they do not want Galileo because it is incompatible on a strategic and military level with GPS.
But , I know , as all of us in this House know , that you , Commissioner , are making every effort to bring this project to fruition .
There are risks , undoubtedly , but I do not think that we can undertake military activities when our goal is to prevent or to manage conflicts in order to keep or find peace .
There is economic liberalisation as well , within the framework of the general agreement on the commercialisation of services .
The 'Everything but Arms ' initiative was undertaken without consulting the ACP countries and penalties are still random .
First of all , the Committee notes that the European Union is one of the world ' s most important fishing entities and we must be aware of this .
Furthermore , these quotas must in no way become individual or transferable .
We would like to have a common fisheries policy that also believes in the future of the fishing industry .
My last point concerns penalties .
These regions have fought for respect for their differences , as laid down in Article 299( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam , and so that their specific characteristics can , at last , be taken into account in each of the European Union ' s policies and , more importantly , in the common fisheries policy .
We cannot subscribe to the approach adopted by the rapporteur or to that of the Commission .
Furthermore , the increases requested would strip the directive of its impact to the point where it no longer has a raison d ' être .
We abstained from voting on this report .
But be careful , ladies and gentlemen , let us not be mistaken .
That is why it is important to reiterate that , whatever commitments have been made by the European Union under the WTO , they do not override the legal commitments undertaken by the European States towards their developing partners .
As has been mentioned several times , this report aims to help the markets and industry 'reap the benefits ' of new developments in the European space policy .
This is why it calls for the 'public funding of infrastructure ' in this area and casts no doubt whatsoever on the policy of subsidising private profits with public funding , which is a permanent feature of the European institutions as well as the European States .
Miguélez Ramos report ( A5-0470/2001 )
I simply wanted to say this in plenary as well , because if we accept that the Council can pass an act under the co-decision procedure , taking away the power of co-decision from Parliament , we are playing into the Council ' s hands .
I am thinking here of the State to which you belong , namely the Netherlands , where you have not approved the policy , but I now also have in mind Belgium , Portugal and Spain , where Members of the Partido Popular Español are conducting some very worthwhile experiments in Madrid into risk reduction .
Mr President , at the Tampere Summit , the European Council declared that the legal status of third-country nationals should be approximated to that of Member State nationals so that they have a uniform set of rights as close as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I can only welcome the Commission ' s initiative on the freedom of circulation of third-country nationals within the Schengen area , since this is something that I , myself , specifically wanted when we discussed the two previous reports .
The directive on working time in the road transport sector aims to do away with situations where unfair competition and social dumping exist in the single market .
Today , I would simply like to give some details in response to the four categories of questions raised .
This is the reason why , following a suggestion made in last year ' s report by Mr Lipietz , we carried out internal restructuring and set up an environmental group within the project department , whose specific task is to ensure that proper account is taken of environmental aspects when assessing such projects .
To sum up , Mr President , we are determined to ensure that the EIB remains an institution that serves the European Union , something which requires , by necessity , greater cooperation with the Commission and strengthening dialogue with Parliament .
Then , also , there is the issue that you have not tackled today and that we will continue to bring up in the forthcoming meetings that we shall have with you , namely , how can we avoid a possible disagreement between the European Parliament and Commission ?
So far , so good !
Political rights are , however , an integral part of any integration policy .
Secondly , we cannot give this proposal a legal basis without distorting the meaning of Article 63( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community , which only provides for 'measures ' regarding residence and not a 'status ' in the full meaning of the word
