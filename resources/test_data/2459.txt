Question No 41 by (H-0342/00 ) : Subject : Institutional reform At present , 'whistle-blowing ' means that a member of the Commission staff has to breach Articles 12 and 17 of the Staff Regulations , accordingly , if someone does come forward as a whistle-blower , he/she will almost certainly be disciplined .
Point 47 of your action plan makes reference to this situation but offers no remedy for it .
How do you plan to address this ?
Are your staff currently examining this problem and , if so , which members of your Cabinet or Directorate-General are actively involved in finding a solution to this contradiction ?
Questions to Mr Byrne .
Mr President , the honourable Member 's question refers to the Commission 's proposals on whistle-blowing in the consultative document on reform adopted by the Commission on 18 January 2000 .
Following that , more detailed orientations were set out in the White Paper on reforming the Commission which was adopted , published and presented to this Parliament on 1 March .
In specific response to the honourable Member 's question , Articles 12 and 17 of the current Staff Regulations do not prevent members of staff from reporting wrong-doing within the Commission and it is consequently not the case that officials have to breach the regulations in order to properly report suspicions or concerns .
In addition , last June the Commission decision implementing the regulation establishing the anti-fraud office , OLAF , explicitly made the provision that officials and servants of the Commission , and I quote , " who become aware of evidence which gives rise to the presumption of the existence of possible cases of fraud , corruption or any other illegal activities detrimental to the interest of the Communities " are obliged to inform their hierarchy or the Secretary-General or the Director of the European anti-fraud office , OLAF .
That legal text also specifically guarantees that officials and other servants of the Commission shall , and I quote , "in no way suffer inequitable or discriminatory treatment as a result of having communicated such information " .
It follows that Articles 12 and 17 of the Staff Regulations do not prevent staff from reporting wrong-doing either within the Commission or to OLAF .
In neither case would disciplinary action result from making such reports .
In the White Paper on reform and elsewhere , the Commission has made direct commitments to reforms which will further improve rules related to the reporting of suspected wrong-doing .
More precise rules on the rights and obligations of officials to report wrong-doing through internal channels and to OLAF are required , and rules defining external channels for the reporting of alleged wrong-doing need to be compiled and proposed , as they will be .
These rules on whistle-blowing will be put forward for introduction into the amended Staff Regulations and officials who follow them would not be subject to disciplinary action .
The Commission will present detailed proposals in a document scheduled for October of this year .
As the law requires , consultations on those proposals will be undertaken with staff and with the other European Union institutions .
Preparatory work on the proposals is progressing under the Director-General for Administration .
One member of my cabinet has specialist responsibility for reform of personnel policy , including whistle-blowing , and others are naturally actively involved in the overall issue .
Further to my question , as the Commissioner has just stated , the Commission is now drawing up its " whistle-blowing " charter to a certain extent .
Will this be framed , for example , along the lines of the Swedish Government 's or the British Government 's rules on whistle-blowing ?
Could the Commissioner inform Parliament as to the exact circumstances in which Paul van Buitenen now finds himself ?
Is he still being disciplined by the Commission and has any of his pay which was docked in the past been refunded to him ?
I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question .
Firstly , the development of the proposals relating to whistle-blowing will take full account of best practice in several of the Member States .
The Commission is acutely aware of the provision long established in Nordic democracies , recently developed also in the Public Disclosure Act in the United Kingdom , and several other comparable pieces of legislation .
As the honourable Member would expect , this institution will take account of the breadth of provision and seek to ensure that in terms of accessibility , usability and career security we provide the best possible attainable system to ensure effective whistle-blowing because we believe it to be appropriate as a complement to good conduct in an international publicly accountable administration .
As far as Mr van Buitenen is concerned , he took up employment on 1 April in the Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection in Luxembourg in a very responsible job , as the House would expect .
He is not currently the subject of any disciplinary procedure and the honourable Member should be aware that immediately after he ended his period of suspension last April Mr van Buitenen 's full pay , conditions , status and pension rights were restored , as were his rights in all other respects .
I reported to this House previously that Mr van Buitenen , a short time after ending his period of suspension , was informed that he had a right to seek employment in any of the European Union institutions in a job for which he was qualified .
He made a couple of applications , one of which was for a job in the Commission .
He was successful in that application and I am pleased to say that he was duly appointed .
Mr President , when Turkey joins the European Union the impact and the benefits will be considerable .
