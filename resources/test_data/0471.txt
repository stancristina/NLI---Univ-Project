European Parliament should therefore support the spirit of this report as defended by our colleague .
The resolution does indeed , in points 5 and 20 , stress the importance of multi-lingualism , but for the moment that remains essentially a vain hope .
In this regard I should like to mention a region not considered by the rapporteur - the Alpine region - although European Union/Swiss negotiations are at a standstill , the associations of the Chamonix valley have for their part managed to cooperate with their Pi√©mont and Le Valais counterparts as needed to fight pollution .
For several years past the Union 's island regions have been trying to make their voice heard ever more clearly and with greater solidarity .
In addition to the reasons just given by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , I should give this one : the budgetary texts are usually discussed during Strasbourg part-sessions .
We are also convinced that the adoption , as soon as possible , by the European Parliament of the text proposed to us concerning excessive deficits and strengthening the surveillance and coordination of budgetary policies is absolutely vital if we are to have the text finalized in time for the Amsterdam Summit .
How is it possible to reconcile analytical taxes and synthetic taxes , distribution taxes and progressive taxes , declaratory taxes and pay-as-you-earn taxes , taxes on capital and taxes on labour ?
The rapporteur is quite simply asking for a Directive to recognize these so-called medicines and those who practice them .
Not at all .
The implacable law of the markets applied to housing throws on to the streets millions of people - young people in particular - who are unable to find a stable job .
Similarly , our Commission regrets that questions concerning the Court of Justice are dealt with separately .
It is my hope that the European Parliament will follow the guidelines of our rapporteur and support his amendments .
Finally , while we go along with the preoccupation with fighting for jobs , we do not want the implementation of a common employment policy .
There is nobody here because those who want to fight and continue to fight the fight for quotas no longer believe in us .
Mr President , my colleague , Professor Cabrol , who followed the conciliation on the health programme , is unfortunately absent , and has asked me to speak on his behalf .
The non-auditive consequences of noise should also be dealt with , especially the effects on sleep , work performance , schooling , medical consultations ( their number ) , the consumption of tranquillizers and even neuroleptic drugs .
This is incorrect given that the French Constitution lays down a 30-day period for ( MPs and ) MEPs invited to join the government to decide whether to remain MEPs or accept ministerial responsibility .
Now he is himself falling into the trap that he thought others would be falling into and got a taste of his own medicine .
Mr Donnelly often goes to the United States .
Tomorrow , when it exists , if it exists , it will be even worse as the right conditions will not be there .
What did he do when he was a member of this Chamber , until last Friday ?
While it is a necessary aim for completing European Union , it is a political aim and we know full well that it is because it cannot be built without budgetary stability that that stability is necessary .
The first is that this transitional system is inappropriate and must be replaced and the second is the difficulty in setting up the final system .
The nearer we get to monetary union and the more we can gauge the main consequence : the urgency of economic union .
To achieve that , we must do all we can to ensure that the switch to the single currency takes place on the planned date but with an economic union that is also committed to , serving growth and employment .
Nobody want quotas as an absolute but it is , as they say in mathematical logic , a necessary but insufficient condition .
Mr President , the 1996 report by the European Monetary Institute reveals once again the weakness of growth in Europe and the unbearable levels of unemployment , which continue to weigh down on public accounts and aggravate social imbalances .
I offer the example of what has happened to national rights : in Spain , for example , when the Basque Country lowered company tax rates , companies left Madrid for Bilbao .
Not only are people opposed to it , but in any case even if nobody opposed it , such an upheaval , which would call for most taxation levers in our countries to be harmonized and very substantial European levies to be raised , would not be possible in the short term .
It is true that this realism has been stimulated by the negative positions taken by several Member States .
For a country like mine , that means sharing 15 million francs or so between 3000 professional beekeepers and some part-time bee-keepers , in other words not very much .
As the head of a French local authority located on a border , in the Nord department , I am fully behind the adoption of the eighth directive which is in line with fifteen years of regulations in favour of harmonization .
Commissioner , I wanted to speak in this debate as I was the rapporteur for this directive , and I wish to confirm what you said .
The European Union must ensure that it regularly meets demand from its traditional non-Community customers .
Yet , in reality , you only leave the choice between lowering prices or set-asides to guarantee the CAP 's future .
That is what shocks me .
