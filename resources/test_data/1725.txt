International observers should be present at these elections so that they can observe how the elections proceed and vouch for the final result of the vote and for the legitimacy that the elections need , and guarantee that the result is accepted by the international community .
The European Union will continue to follow developments in that country in the light of these principles and will not fail to draw the necessary conclusions in the event that these principles are not adhered to .
We must not be under any illusions about what is really happening here .
We shall see what happens between now and then .
It is not just whites who are in danger .
We believe that the action taken by the European Union on this matter and the attention it has paid to it are still very much an issue , and I can guarantee , on behalf of the Council - and , of course , also on behalf of the Commission , which has already adopted a very precise course of action for the forthcoming elections - that this matter will continue to feature on our agenda .
As Mr Ribeiro e Castro said , we feel that it is extremely important to monitor developments in this matter between now and the elections .
I would like to say that the Turkish Foreign Minister , Mr Schem , has stated officially that no such list exists , which is why , in the light of an official statement like this , we feel that we should not continue to insist on this point .
The Council will monitor all of these issues and will not fail , whenever necessary , to convey any information to this House which is relevant to progress with this accession strategy and , in particular , its views on Turkey ' s compliance with requirements for the future opening of accession negotiations by the European Union .
This will , of course , oblige Turkey to adopt a set of attitudes regarding traditional aspects of EU external policy towards countries in that area .
With regard to the first question , these issues are obviously open to political interpretation , although they are based on a historical assumption which we all acknowledge and which is extremely important , but which is not a precondition for reopening dialogue with Turkey .
Turkey must practically demonstrate that no matter how it views the situation in Armenia , if it wishes to open negotiations with the European Union and if it wishes to join the European Union , it will , of course , have to respect the whole framework of good relations that the European Union enjoys with Armenia .
As you will be aware , this is a matter for national parliaments , and they have the final say , as these are mixed agreements , in which there is a Community dimension and a national dimension .
This depends to a large extent on national parliaments .
Honourable Members will be as aware as I am of the fate that befell the launch of the new round of WTO negotiations in Seattle , which has , of course , led to delays in addressing issues of this kind .
We will continue to address the issue of preserving national identity and the need to maintain a set of instruments which , without in any way distorting the competition rules , can , in some way , ensure that the core values of European identity will be preserved .
And as regards my own country at least , there is considerable concern that these cultural issues , and specifically the language dimension , should be the very top priority in the discussions that the European Union will be holding with its WTO partners .
The Council is currently studying this issue , which is highly controversial .
The Council considers that a very thorough assessment must be carried out of the requirements of the Balkans and of the real ability of the people there to absorb these funds , particularly bearing in mind and focusing very closely on the role of the European Union as one of the international funding agencies in this area .
If Parliament feels that there is a contradiction , it can address this contradiction by comparing it with reality , and the reality is that , contrary to what the honourable Member has just said , nowhere in my speech did I say that direct aid would suffer as a result of this redeployment of appropriations .
They come from the specific EDF budget , which is why I say that it would be rather difficult to transfer EDF appropriations to aid for Kosovo , because they are not part of the Community budget .
Perhaps it would be worthwhile for honourable Members to consider whether the common agricultural policy will ultimately be compatible with the outcome of the next WTO round .
I myself , as Chair of the preparatory group , intend to have this issue put on the IGC agenda once again by the end of the Portuguese Presidency .
It is obvious that the European Union must oppose any actions that could involve the violation of other states ' borders .
The aim of this Charter is to commit Member States to focus on these instruments and to provide a specific response to the specific needs of small - and medium-sized enterprises .
This Charter is , however , a broad policy document and is generically aimed at all small - and medium-sized enterprises .
Nevertheless , although we are aware of the situation , we would ask them to be patient for another three weeks , until they actually see the draft Charter which will be presented at the European Council .
Mr President , under Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
