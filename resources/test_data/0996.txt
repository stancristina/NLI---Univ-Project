great risk to birdlife and with large financial losses as a result , since the unknown perpetrators mentioned ALF.
For Finland infantry mines are a vital force in our land defences .
Although the situation on our eastern border , which is , furthermore , the sole frontier the EU has facing Russia , now appears more peaceful than before , the permanence of this situation in the long term is unfortunately not guaranteed .
A ban on the use of infantry mines would mean an intolerable increase in the cost of defence for Finland .
That is why the call in the resolution on land mines made by the EPP group to change options in border-zone security is meaningless unless it includes concrete suggestions as to how a country like Finland can , when threatened with conflict , protect her land borders efficiently and effectively .
Madam President , disarmament would never get off the ground if in negotiations we always returned to the idea that in certain circumstances certain weapons of defence are indispensable .
We Finns should now admit that the military threat in Europe has greatly diminished and security policy is based more on repelling threats from outside .
A full sixth of the surface of the Baltic was covered in flowering algae and the bluish-green algae was responsible for the eutrophication of the sea .
This will have to be quickly addressed .
The Commission is a full member of the Baltic protection organisation , Helcom .
The protection of the Baltic Sea should n't really have to sink in EU bureaucracy .
The Green Group would also like to emphasise that it is essential to bring in an environment tax to lessen the use of fertilisers .
The TACIS fund should definitely be used more efficiently for the protection of the Baltic Sea .
It is , furthermore , absolutely essential that the protection of the Baltic sea gains prominence when the EU begins negotiating membership with Poland and the Baltic countries .
With its vulnerable shallow bays and large loading points the Baltic is in a really serious crisis at the moment .
We know in principle what the sources of the pollution are , and what the biggest problems are , but no measures have been taken .
Actually , it is not a question of whether there are enough organisations , enough agencies , or even enough sources of funding .
The real question is how these can be put to better use than they are now , and how things that have to be done can be prioritised so that the Baltic Sea can become cleaner and safe .
All those known to be responsible for effluent must cut down the amount they release into the sea .
The Helsinki Commission regulations must be taken seriously .
The harmonisation of environmental standards for the Baltic , and generally , must be an essential part of the strategy for the enhancement of unification with these countries .
It is now high time we got away from the drawing board and addressed matters in a practical way , got some practical co-operation going for the environment in the Baltic Region , instead of just consultants ' reports .
In the present situation the EU and its Member States are in an excellent position to get this co-operation into gear .
It is vital to restrict the overloading of the waters , mainly due to agricultural fertilisers , with recourse to stringent regulations for both present and future members of the EU.
The Helsinki Commission has a programme for action to reduce nutrient loads .
The heavy floods in Poland and central Europe this Summer will have a real effect on the Baltic in terms of fertiliser pollution .
The result will be that next Summer we 'll have an even worse algae problem than we did this year .
Fast .
That sea is the Baltic .
It is best seen in the development by the EU of northern projects and the start-up and co-ordination of projects in a programme which can be reported on regularly to Parliament , so that we can see how the Commission is spending our money .
For this reason , it is very important that this subject is prominent also on the budgetary agenda .
The EU beef markets were shaken when mad cow disease made an appearance and became publicly known .
From the start of 1993 a quality regulation came into force followed last February by a livestock identification scheme and provision for passports for animals , animal identification schemes and the marking of beef .
The new schemes threaten to become mind-bogglingly complicated .
When we know how the meat comes to be contaminated , its elimination will be easy and restored confidence in the markets will be nothing less than overwhelming .
It is therefore most desirable that the Commission concentrate more earnestly than before on discovering and eliminating the source , and monitoring the work carefully .
Hormone meat might flood EU markets in the not too distant future , and problems arising from that will require sturdy weapons to deal with them .
Mr President , Mr David Hallam 's report on the function of the agri-monetary system for the years 1995-1996 describes the scheme admirably .
In serving these basic tasks the system has done well .
In the future the agri-monetary system has to face two challenges : the possible implementation of the third stage of EMU, and agriculture turning its attention to world markets .
The switch to a single currency from the start of 1999 should bring a certain degree of stability to the common agricultural policy .
On the other hand , there will remain the problem of those countries that possibly stay outside the EMU area .
The formulation of the system , however , is becoming a burning issue , as other speakers have mentioned
