The biodiversity issue must be higher on the European priority list .
It is important to stress this last point because there are some airlines which are casting doubt on this .
In particular , Article 15 of this agreement states that the joint committee can make recommendations for eliminating any potential overlaps or inconsistencies and avoiding any duplication of measures and costs .
However , there is a downside to this agreement .
Exactly what efforts have the EUSEC and EUPOL missions in North and South Kivu been making to increase security for the local population and to prosecute the perpetrators of this summer 's atrocities ?
I sincerely hope that the European Union will work on the vital reinforcement of the UN mission there , since this is something that is urgently needed .
Do you mean to comply with the Regulation in this respect ?
We were mired in generalities for a long time and were slow to launch specific projects .
I understand that the title has changed and that the Liberals have changed their position , but the substance is still very complicated and we still want this to be discussed first in the Committee on Employment , because it is a very important and complicated discussion .
We do not want to oppose it , but this is the reason why we will abstain in the vote on this topic .
Commissioner Oettinger has already appeared in plenary a couple of times to set forth what he stands for and what he wants to do .
We want to see the mandate of the European Agency for Maritime Safety ( EMSA ) extended .
With a view to the 10th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD) , the EU wants to contribute actively and constructively , via a realistic , ambitious approach , to a global consensus on the measures to be taken beyond 2010 to promote biodiversity .
In the process , these partners were to be encouraged to further identify needs and prioritise them in national and regional development strategies and plans .
I have to be honest with you : my spirits are sinking a bit in that regard .
I hope that you do convey this message about international mainstreaming to your counterparts at international level .
When reforming agricultural policy , we must look beyond merely sustainable agricultural policy and must take a firm stand .
Progress has already been made in this field in the recent discussions in Montreal , but it is true that a number of other issues need to be resolved ahead of COP 10 .
These conclusions are to form the basis for determining the important issues for COP 10 and also the Council 's position on these : the revised , updated CBD strategic plan , the negotiations with a view to the ABS Protocol , the strategy for mobilising funding , particularly via innovative financing mechanisms , sectoral integration and synergies between the fight against climate change , desertification and policies to promote biodiversity .
That is important for young people , for business people and for everyone .
The matter is quite simple , in fact .
Last year , we asked for proposals by the Commission for more sophisticated instruments .
Thank you very much for that .
The Regional Development Fund and the Social Fund should continue to operate together .
The Committee of the Regions has made a proposal to that effect and I would recommend that you consider it , at the same time as you consider the wording of our resolution . author . - Madam President , I shall be fairly brief .
Finally , Commissioner , last weekend , I stumbled over another item that we have not been informed about and that might be relevant for this debate .
Well , I can give you a copy of one of the MOUs that mentions PNR.
All Europeans have a right to a decent living , as do all world citizens .
There is one choice that we have to make here : is 2010 to be the year of fine words and empty promises on poverty reduction , or do we take a specific measure that helps millions of Europeans ?
Development funds - funds under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) - are intended for this purpose ; for combating poverty and not for the EU 's cooperation with industrialised countries .
You said , or your words implied , that , at first glance , most European legislation is being properly observed .
I do not believe that such an investigation can be carried out by the Hungarian authorities alone .
I wish you would be as determined in this particular case .
Just this week , you published the Commission communication on the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
First of all , I would like to know whether the existence of these databases can be confirmed .
The Commission does not hesitate in other areas .
Such a measure will enable us to kill several birds with one stone : it is an effective instrument against speculation and the revenue will enable us to address government deficits and the funding for pressing social projects ( the environment , development aid , infrastructure projects , etc. ) .
There are other , less rigorous ways in which measures allowing a better balance between work and private life could be put in place .
A twenty-week maternity leave period on full pay is not a feasible solution for our social security systems and government budgets .
Will this ultimately not lead to a situation which is the precise opposite of that intended ; that is , there will be fewer jobs available for young women , because employers will simply not be inclined to bear all on
