State pensions are heavily financed but provide services which are inferior to those provided by private pensions : this is not true competition .
Therefore , the European Union should promote an international , bilateral and multilateral action cancelling the Third World debt with no conditions attached .
Neither Parliament nor our meetings are broadcast anywhere in Europe .
She would find it extremely useful and also a saving , but she will not be persuaded .
I had to reply : " Yes , it is true " , for when I took the floor yesterday - and I repeat the request again now - I called for progress to be made in European space research and I mentioned the fact that , in the United States , there was an astronaut , a politician , who went into space at the age of 69 , that is when he was a pensioner .
I am concerned because I would not like the State budgets and pension agencies to try to hold back this research , which would have negative implications for them because of the greater expenditure they would incur .
This is because , in general terms , we do not have confidence in institutions which , in violation of the democratic principle of the separation of powers , interfere with other institutions , with the result that they either upset the balance between the legislative , executive and judicial authorities or they find themselves without a specific function because everything is already being done by other institutions .
However , we must not forget that the fundamental principle of self-determination is all too often disregarded , sacrificed on the altar of another , equally valid but opposite principle , that of the territorial integrity of the States .
There it is .
Today ' s pensioners and elderly people lived through the Second World War : they know what racism means .
Even though many women choose to become prostitutes as an easy way of making a living , I would make no distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution : all prostitution is exploitation .
But who are the clients ?
The poverty and marginalisation of the women in their countries of origin , the high earnings guaranteed to traffickers and the low risks they incur , and the substantial demand for women for prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation are the factors behind the growth of this trade .
The Tampere European Council recently charged the European Union to fight against illegal immigration and , amongst other things , against those who profit from the trafficking in human beings .
On the other hand , the Member States and candidate countries must intervene themselves at legislative , administrative and police levels in order to eliminate this crime and , at the same time , increase international cooperation with Europol and Interpol to fight criminal networks .
With regard to whether requests for the quorum to be tested are intended to sabotage proceedings , I would refer you to events in the Italian Parliament .
The point I am trying to make in this explanation of vote can also be found on page 11 , line 14 of the report , and it is the only line out of the 722 making up the report which reaches the crux of the matter : it states that we must fight for "information and awareness-raising activities with a view to reducing the demand side " .
A young 20-year old , who had , sadly , suffered a serious road accident , rose to his feet and said : " I have suffered this serious road accident but I am , so to speak , content because I have received EUR 500 000 from the insurance company " .
I therefore call for measures to be included in the regulation that will put a stop to this injustice .
The rules governing warnings have also been consolidated : we were not content simply to increase the amount of space dedicated to warnings but the messages have been made clearer and more personal as well so that they will be more effective in dissuading consumers from smoking .
In this context , having discussed the matter at great length in the Group , we considered that we should keep the situation as it is : that is , keep the derogation for Greece and refuse to extend it to nicotine and carbon monoxide .
This is a major industry which , moreover , hires more women than men to do seasonal work .
Last century , smoking was part of the culture .
Well , in my opinion , we have two main tasks : we must endeavour to provide accurate information and give everybody the chance to choose whether to smoke or not , and I hope that they will choose not to - my own family has suffered bereavements through this - and , at the same time , we must bring about a change of culture in the relevant industries .
It is only in this context that there would be any point in providing incentives to our tobacco growers to change the type of crop they grow .
Unlike in the European Parliament , all the councillors smoked like chimneys during committee meetings .
Madam President , before I left to come to Strasbourg , I said goodbye to a pensioner - Mrs Lucia Boroni from Mozzanica in the district of Bergamo - who had come to see me off .
" Of course , Mrs Boroni , this is the future , the future of the citizens .
I will dwell on a few critical aspects which I feel should be brought to Parliament ' s attention .
The regulation of the market must not hamper its development and , in particular , the development of new television services .
In addition , considering
