It is all very well to adopt measures in favour of the least-developed countries , but what benefits them more , and they say this themselves , is greater viability for their exports rather than a growth in the volumes exported , which in reality benefits the marketing companies based in the most developed countries .
I would like to put a final question , Mr President .
In any event , the members of the Committee on Fisheries believe that this is not good and we hope that it will not happen to us again in the future .
Our intention is to provide a technical and political consideration of the whole of the sector , both extractive and processing , to analyse its position within the European Union and the world in order to draw conclusions which we can deliver to the Commission and the Council in order to increase awareness and sensitivity towards this important industry and finally to propose a series of specific measures to improve its defence .
It should be given incentives to retain the Community flags in the face of the temptation to take flags of convenience ; that a census be created , authorised by the respective RFOs , and that illegal fishing and landings by these fleets be effectively controlled in order to put an end to unfair competition .
We are therefore asking for specific things , such as : a specific action plan , a global framework for structural support , a defence plan to deal with third States and , to this end , the creation of units and advisory committees as I just said in my speech .
We want fishing and marketing to respond to sustainable and environmental criteria , as well as food safety principles and that , therefore , control mechanisms be established at borders so that imported products have the same phytosanitary guarantees as those originating from our own fleet and industry .
What to do and to do it as soon as possible , because the introduction of a disease of this sort could have harmful consequences which are very difficult to put right if they are not tackled in time .
In this regard , I believe that the European Union must ensure recognition of this plurality within it .
We must not forget that the right of each Member State to define , apply and adapt its cultural policies is subject to national legislation and , therefore , this must be done in accordance with their respective national legislations .
We must prevent the Union from becoming a means for standardisation , and I would like to point out that the preamble to the draft Constitution spoke of a ‘Europe united in diversity’ .
Certain nationalist parties who have tried to use language as a political tool have moved on from racial nationalism to linguistic nationalism .
I personally went to ask you to support us in the Convention – you are not from my political family – but you supported us in this challenge from the outset .
In other words , achieving , as we Socialists believe , full employment , gender equality – I would like to welcome the fact that the Irish Government has been the first to appoint a female Ambassador to Coreper , thereby entering into the most sexist realm of the Union , I congratulate it – social cohesion and technological development .
Finally , Mr President , an important issue , since we are in an election campaign and my distinguished colleague , Mr Poettering , has raised the issue .
Nevertheless , I regret that certain members of the Commission have made statements referring to a two-speed Europe , that is , dividing Europe up just when we are about to reunify .
We wish the Irish Presidency every success over the coming months .     Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Taoiseach , Bertie Ahern , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the President-in-Office of the Council began his speech in his own language , Gaelic ; you also did so , President Cox , at your investiture , as well as the President of Ireland .
At the same time , I believe it would be important – and it seems that the Presidency has not considered this – to schedule a debate on the financial perspectives which President Prodi announced this morning .
There have been a series of premature candidatures .
Human rights are a priority issue , which must be applied in a universal and indivisible manner , regardless of the cultures on which each country is founded .
I am not going to go too far into this , but there are 700 people there , awaiting trial in a situation which is legally indefensible .
It is not sufficient , however , to condemn .
Immigration is a reality that needs to be regulated , and we must not bury our heads in the sand or look the other way .
I think that is impossible .
Article 21 prohibits all discrimination on other grounds , including on grounds of nationality ; Article 23 guarantees equality between men and women in all areas , including employment , work and pay .
Furthermore , the problem is currently arising – with tragic results in many cases , as we are seeing – of the emergence of a hidden economy in sectors such as agriculture , domestic service and construction ; an economy which is fed partly by illegal immigration and which leads to subhuman situations and conditions both from a strictly employment point of view and from a social point of view .
On voting issues , ladies and gentlemen of the Left , there must be no room for demagoguery .
That is what our Constitution says .
It is necessary to stress the possibilities arising
