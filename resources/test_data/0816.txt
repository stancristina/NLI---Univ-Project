I therefore voted in favour of the Ferreira report .
Looking at the whole population aged from 25 to 64 , the employment rate of those with higher education qualifications was 84 % in 2001 , that is to say , approximately 15 points higher than the average for people of all levels of education and almost 30 points higher than for those who had not progressed further than lower secondary education . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , Mrs De Keyser , ladies and gentlemen , we are here to discuss the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on the European Court of Auditors ' report on MEDA , the European programme on the countries of the Southern Mediterranean .
Politically , however , we are faced with a serious dilemma ; on the one hand , to provide development cooperation and humanitarian aid to people who are victims of leaders who have little or no regard for their well-being , and , on the other , to ensure that Community funds are not diverted for the purpose of purchasing arms , terrorism , propaganda , indoctrinating children in particular , racism , xenophobia and hate , and suicide bombings , as has come to light in the case of funds granted to Lebanon .
Anyone who still refuses to grasp this reality will once again have to face facts that it was impossible to predict . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Pirker and to say to him - although I am sure Mr Weber will do so with greater authority - that the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will of course support his report , which is aimed at improving cooperation and the decision-making process in asylum policy .
Firstly , I feel it is necessary to create a single EU-wide procedure to ensure that decisions are taken quickly and are duly substantiated and fair .
This point has been clarified and I think , from this point of view , we can consider ourselves quite satisfied with the results of this European Council .
This result has been achieved but , as has already been emphasised , we have a mandate , which is excellent , but we still do not have the Treaty .
For this reason , I would like once again to congratulate the German Presidency and all those who contributed to this result .
We are well aware that the negotiations were difficult and also that the European side wanted to find a mutually acceptable solution more strongly than the US side did .
I still cannot accept what I consider to be an excessively long data storage period .
In addition , the text rests on a very conservative view further fuelled by a culture based on suspicion and conflict .

However , the idea that some translations are dispensable is being encouraged on grounds of the financial question , and by appealing to the need to define priorities and restrictions such as the size of documents .
Despite the rapporteur 's having mitigated the scope of the initial proposal , by underlining , for example , that 'the responsibility for the protection of critical infrastructures lies solely and exclusively with the Member States ' and considering 'that a Community approach is only justifiable if at least three Member States , or two Member States besides the one in which the critical infrastructure is situated , are affected ' , the fundamental objectives are not called into question .
Its strategic nature means that the energy sector is vital for a country 's independence and sovereignty .
The intention is to further increase the profits of the agro-industry and large-scale farmers .

Here , too , we have to be demanding about the opening-up of those markets and about respect for intellectual property rights , for example .
Protecting our interests depends on promoting many of our values and , if we do manage to promote them , we shall certainly be defending our interests . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , what we have just heard from the current President of the Council proves that this is going to be yet another wasted opportunity to put on the agenda some of the serious economic and social problems that need changes in policy and responses on the part of the Community institutions : for example , the unequal distribution of income , increased job insecurity and the poverty in which nearly 80 million people live , including increasing numbers of workers on low pay and fewer rights , old people with negligible pensions , and women and children being
