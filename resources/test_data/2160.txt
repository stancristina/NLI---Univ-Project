I am referring particularly to the report 's discussion of recognition of the parties ' legal personality , clarification of the scale of the resources available to them , and openness regarding their Community funding , which should be subject to normal audit inspections .
Mr President , a statute for European political parties , with transparency of financing as its principal theme , is urgent and essential .
This requirement also means , however , that if the CFP is to be correctly applied , it is essential to guarantee flexibility for Member States in the application of measures for the management of the fishing effort .
We are also in favour of delegating the responsibility for coastal and other fisheries management to Member States , as well as encouraging the discovery of solutions on a local level .
I would also like to emphasise , as did the rapporteur , that the decline of fisheries has other causes , notably pollution and sea transport .
I read recently that it dried up completely five thousand years ago , as demonstrated by the layers of salt on the sea floor .
There is no doubt that delegating power and responsibility to Member States , as well as teasing out solutions at local level in order to reduce the fishing effort , is to be welcomed .
In point of fact , though , research must indeed be a priority for the European Union , and organisations under its umbrella , if errors are not to be made in future regarding the state of fisheries resources and marine biodiversity .
It certainly constitutes a challenge .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on a point of order , I would like to emphasise , as Mr Leinen 's speech confirms , and as I said yesterday , that we are introducing a new precedent today : we are going to approve amendments which have not been agreed on the basis of proposals suggested by my fellow Members , but a new type of amendment , negotiated with the Council .
.
The intention is merely to facilitate the procedures for submitting applications and the form in which visas are issued ( the Organising Committee will simply have to forward a list of participants to the services responsible for issuing visas in Greece ) .
The adoption of a uniform short-stay , multiple-entry visa may lead to improvements in the processing of data , which will certainly make it easier for the organising country to keep track of and monitor entries and exits from its territory and the whole Schengen area .
In view of this , I voted in favour in order to support the rapporteur 's position and to welcome the Commission 's views in this Action Plan , especially when it refers to the specificity of the Mediterranean as an essential parameter in the ongoing reform .
This highly negative assessment identifies a number of unacceptable problems in this instrument , which is so crucial for reducing inequalities in regional development .
I welcome the fact that the Commission is sensitive to this injustice .
I agree with the Commission 's suggestion that greater responsibility should be given to the Member States ' administrations and that procedures should be simplified , based on the adoption by the Member States of best practice , together with suitable training for administrative staff entrusted with these tasks .

I share her concerns regarding the 4.1 % deficit seen in Portugal in 2001 ( which thus does not conform to the macroeconomic criteria ) , which the present Portuguese Government inherited from the previous socialist government .
.
It should be remembered that macroeconomic criteria , especially the increase in the public-sector deficit , affect the allocation of Community funds .
( PT ) I find myself forced to abstain .
On the one hand , however , this fact did not have the automatic effects that might be inferred from clause 8 ; and , on the other , clause 9 regrettably ignores the fact that the new Portuguese Government has - forcefully - already taken all the measures required to correct the situation .
Moreover , it is important that the sites with the highest accident risk should be mapped and represented graphically .
We also regret that our proposed Amendment No 5 was not approved , since 'new priorities require new financial means ' .
In its version of the Draft , the Council rejected this request since it could not reach internal agreement on the manner of financing this measure .
In addition , although I recognise that the final positions reflect highly positive advances compared with both the Commission 's initial proposal and the rapporteur 's obstinacy - a development that I welcome - I still have differences on essential points : the failure to provide for an expanded system embracing all legitimately constituted political parties , since the Treaty does not authorise discrimination between political parties 'at European level ' , recognising also that they are all 'important ' ; the requirement for a level of self-financing that I consider too high and which I fear will be a source of problems at a supranational level ; the non-jurisdictional system for rejecting funding , as I do not think the obvious existence of the right to appeal is sufficient .
Why ?
( PT ) The essential problem of developing countries with regard to energy - in contrast to the situation in more developed countries - is not the replacement of current production sources with other , less polluting ones .
I believe the rapporteur has made an excellent contribution to this cooperative effort to share the best technologies .
I share the rapporteur 's concerns about the lack of a clear financial commitment by the Commission to back up the diagnosis made .

Lastly , I appeal to the leading role of the
