In this sense , the sensitive issue of the risk of contamination of traditional seed by GMOs must be included in the series of directives concerning the marketing of seed with which we are dealing here today .
Moreover , appropriate measures must be taken during the transport and storage of traditional seed , so that the accidental or technically unavoidable nature of any GMO pollution can be proved .
The Commission , as you have just reminded us , wants to be given the power to decide whether a substance falls within the 'sweeteners ' category , without going through the process of approval by the European Parliament .
Before I finish , I should like to mention the issue of fine bakery products .
What are the main concerns highlighted by this report ?
It would be reduced from 400 mg/l to 350 mg/l . mg/l .
We would like all possible information to be sent immediately to the medical staff , who could be under obligation to respond and take decisions in this field .
This report also raises the question of banning animal testing .
Some might say it is simply a coincidence that this crisis is taking place now that the Stabex system has disappeared from the Cotonou agreement .
They must agree to adopt codes of ethical practice in agreement with the ILO and the UN and pay a fair price for raw materials , a price that reflects the social and environmental costs of coffee-growing and production .
This has been proven .
As if poor peasants in Rwanda , Ethiopia or Haiti could oppose Nestl√© and its counterparts , when the European Parliament does not dare to do so !
I would suggest that it should be amended as on the voting slips : 'convinced that as a result of the fact that the laws of war are currently inappropriate in the light of new international situations in which civilians are the main victims of conflicts , the United Nations should be entrusted with the task of defining how international humanitarian rules could be better applied whenever a multinational operation is envisaged ... ' .
I think this amendment should satisfy the Socialist Party .
Out of solidarity for researchers and sufferers of these diseases , we therefore voted against this report and against all the amendments , many of them worded in an equivocatory fashion , which aim to make the situation worse .
The Verts/ALE Group , which is in favour of natural law , has thus been emulated by the socialists in passing on the rumours circulating on the Internet with regard to the risk posed by this substance .
The shocking conditions of these expulsions , however , which have led to death in transit , have been brought to light , not to mention imprisonment in the destination countries .
.
If the goal , however , as stated in one paragraph , is to convince all Europeans of the virtues of the European Union in the field of 'security , solidarity , equal opportunities [and ] cohesion' , this is not a good start .
Propaganda is , indeed , the right word to use when we read , for example , that the European Union 's communication strategy should rely on the support of opinion formers , target information to different population groups using attractive media such as sport and formulate messages in such a way that they can easily be included in education systems .
All the rest should follow on from that .
If we want the European Union to defend its objectives and its values on the international stage and contribute to peace , freedom and stability in the world , in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and international law , it urgently needs to develop a genuine ESDP as an integral part of the CFSP.
The solution proposed is therefore strengthening the military capabilities available to the Union requiring the development of a European security culture , as quickly as possible .
In this case , it is all the more regrettable in that a mid-term assessment of the current programme has revealed that the current specific programmes have suffered from a serious lack of resources .
Demand will grow and fossil energies will decline .
This is therefore a strategic project , not just in the military sense , but also quite simply in terms of what is Europe 's most valuable asset , in other words its technological progress .
As you are aware , I would like to emphasise the need for the space sector to serve mainly peaceful objectives .
I too believe it is important to send a strong signal to the forthcoming Council of Ministers .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we cannot cover in a few minutes all the problems affecting European space policy .
We must learn lessons from this concerning the discussions held which will lead to the adoption , between now and the end of the year , of a White Paper on the subject .
The second factor is the scope of the proposals .
I can give you two examples to illustrate this point .
The state-of-the-art and permit concepts should be retained so that the polluter pays principle can be effectively applied , and so as not to allow that principle to be replaced by the 'taxpayer pays ' principle .
There should be more prevention .
Secondly , Mr Corbett 's report suggests that , if the Commission were to undertake a new legislative initiative , because it thought it would be impossible to overcome its disagreement with Parliament simply by amending its text , the text prepared by the Commission would be provisionally applicable until the adoption of the new legislative text .
Three of them have the same goal , namely to delete the phrase 'either [or 'or '] to withdraw
