I would ask you to confirm that , if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects , then this official has got the wrong end of the stick , and that , if he has not said this , then there is no story .
It is not much fun , of course , having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself .
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference , Mr Barnier said , during his presentation in Parliament , that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but , when I look at page 63 , I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say , the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination , the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and , with a few exceptions , of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting .
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States ' election processes ?
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels ?
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is , to a large degree , about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future .
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann' s work on this matter .
These are all improvements to the common position .
First and foremost , I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years .
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position .
And , finally , I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we , as consumers , are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and , at the same time , obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which , I believe , there is broad agreement .
Finally , I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges , emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but , at the same time , be set a target , namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero .
I think that Mrs Lienemann' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council .
Mr President , the four chief objectives which the EU countries ' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows : that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income ; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable ; that social integration should be promoted ; and that sustainable , high-quality health care should be guaranteed .
Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from .
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets , which is a problem for many Member States .
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda .
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU , we often use the expression social convergence .
As liberals , we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies .
It is , of course , a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy .
It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern .
That is the case with minimum social entitlements , which are established by treaty .
It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies ; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation .
But convergence should be about goals , not means .
I can support the report , but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste .
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems , if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient , or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries .
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission ' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly , and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold .
There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions .
Mr President , having listened to the Council and the Commission today , I just had to look at my agenda .
But we have not heard a single word on this subject , and I find that deeply embarrassing .
It ought to have
