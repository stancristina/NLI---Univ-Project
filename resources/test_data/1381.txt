encouraged them to take a firm stance in face of the attempt by Islamism to impose its ideological influence , and genuinely to represent the interests and values of the international community .
The decentralisation of the economic policy and the centralisation of monetary decisions are , as it were , a basic contradiction in terms within the Economic and Monetary Union .
Ladies and gentlemen , what I have just said clearly demonstrates the extent of the challenges before us .
We must hold such a debate during our presidency .
However , they can only fluctuate according to those same economic conditions .
Furthermore , it is clear that the situation in Europe and worldwide will be worse during the third quarter than it was during the second quarter .
We are experiencing the consequences of a negative external event .
Mr President , Madam President , Commissioner , much has already been said about the issue of the Growth and Stability Pact .
However , Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to find out from you about the progress of work within the Prima Renault group , and about the state of discussion on the issue of corporation tax .
This would be a very useful role for the European Union to play , both in its capacity as the Chair and a key member of the FATF.
I think it is time we recognise this .
Public or mixed economy choices should balance market forces .
Its forecasting errors are now legendary , and it has an irrational fear of inflation .
For once , the European Union had the opportunity to show that it intended to have an effect on world affairs , to become more than what it actually is , simply one more piece of the jigsaw of liberal globalisation .
The third effect of budgetary expansion is the dispersal of cash people have been hoarding , prior to the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January next year .
It is having a recessionary effect in these countries .
Consequently , I think I explained clearly how our thinking is developing .
It took us fifteen years to recover from the effects of this policy .
New services have necessitated new technologies and have also led to an increase in the number of broadcasters .
This commitment demonstrates that Parliament understands the importance of the Television without frontiers directive and its implementation .
It began this year with a wide-ranging consultation with the industry .
The views of Parliament will be taken into account at each stage of the process .
They are currently experiencing considerable difficulties in transposing the acquis into their own legislation .
Revising the Television without frontiers directive will be a considerable and highly complex task in which I will continue to need the resolute support of Parliament .
This will enable us to assess the level of the relations established , and to decide if the level of technical and economic assistance can still be justified .
Therefore , in the case in question , the application of these provisions falls within the competence of the Greek government , which Mr Trakatellis should address directly for the answers to the questions he has raised .
Enactment would be a way of putting an end to the systematic discrimination against women and girls in legislation and in practice and a way of removing the obstacles preventing women and girls from exercising their fundamental rights fully and equally .
Finally , may I remind Mr Sj√∂stedt that the Schengen acquis was published in Official Gazette L 239 on 22 September 2000 .
In my view , it is absurd to have this debate now , when we had the debate on the Stability Pact this afternoon , and in the meantime , the Conference of Presidents thought it would be worthwhile to find time for a debate on television without frontiers .
In some ways , this role is more political , in which the Commission must display its ability to make innovative proposals , to develop medium-term prospects .
Mr President , the Peijs report states that , over 20 years , government expenditure has increased from 35 % to 50 % of the GNP .
It also confirms the fact that the issue of the price of drugs is at the heart of the debates on access to treatment and the importance of research and development and , above all , it stresses the need to focus efforts on diseases that particularly affect the South , as well as forgotten illnesses .
It also involves , and I will end here , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , clarifications on the contribution of the European Union .
Effective and coherent action against these diseases should therefore offer different solutions depending on the case , but also combine measures on several levels .
Pharmaceutical firms need to be made to respect human rights .
This is very true in the case of AIDS , where there is no known cure , whereas there are cures available for tuberculosis and malaria .
The political leaders of the big imperial powers , both American and European , are trying to channel the legitimate emotions caused by the attacks in New York to serve a policy aimed solely at ensuring their domination over the world , and not at preserving the interests and the safety of the people .
All that is needed is to observe how easily some people call any behaviour that goes against prevailing thought 'terrorism ' , such as is the case with the anti-globalisation activists or those who are against NGOs , in order to be worried about possible confusions .
Is it not as a result of seeing every removal of controls as a step towards freedom that we have paved the way for terrorists such as those who went on to attack the United States
