the situation in the transit field , we shall be seeing classic forms of contraband developing .
The rapporteur , Mr Wynn , is right to propose the discharge , even though we are extremely dissatisfied with the conclusions of Amsterdam .
And from this point of view , the terminological debate shows just how dangerous the road is down which people are trying to send us .
Your report , Madam , is a moderate report , but it is , as the saying goes , ruthlessly moderate .
Like many of our colleagues , I wish to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
They show an accumulation of fraud and inertia , without really explaining where this paralysis comes from .
Mr President , like many of my colleagues , I would firstly like to express my full admiration for Mrs Sch√∂rling 's report , which our group will support unanimously , provided the Tobin Tax is passed , of course .
The REX committee simply wishes account to be taken of the situation , of the financial crisis in South-East Asia and of its consequences on European shipyards .
However , we have to note that every time a European shipyard is pulled out of difficulties through extraordinary aid , the Commission immediately imposes new reductions on production capacity , which result in new job losses .
Either the leading trading power in the world remains a shipping power , or it will become dependent on other countries to ship its goods , and it will very quickly become an idol with feet of clay .
Although I am not a specialist in olive oil , going on what I know , the current maximum quantity for the whole of the European Union is 1 350 000 tonnes .
I have explained the basis of the Commission 's proposal .
This will enable us to make take stock of this banking aspect .
Finally , I stress that the Commission is certainly not insensitive to problems that might materialize from the abolition of duty-free on intra-EU travel , but it will insist that the appropriate instruments be used to tackle any such problems without re-opening an issue which , as I have stressed several times , simply implies having ordinary citizens bear the burden .
Industrial policy and commercial policy , on the contrary , require realism and pragmatism .
Firstly , Europe has imposed on itself measures which its competitors did not .
It is not a question of human rights .
However , these replies were all given last June , at the time of the vote on Mr Martens ' report .
Its gross national product has been growing by 5.5 % over the last four or five years .
This is where it is a question of gaining a better balance in our partnership .
Indeed , what happens at the moment ?
What does the honourable Member want ?
The Martens and Rocard reports , which have both been rightly praised , have drawn up a framework and defined the ambitions of a renewed and deepened cooperation , emphasizing the necessary political dimension of the agreements , the promotion of democratic values and the support for a process of regional integration .
It is with this in mind that the Russian efforts to build a rule of law and a market economy must be evaluated .
If we refuse to recognize the breadth of the transformation underway , if we do not commit ourselves fully to helping Russia , we run the distinct risk of seeing this country turn quite naturally to other countries for support .
Heckling : ' April fool ! ' )
Mr President , with regard to electoral campaigns , in France we have already given an opinion and I would prefer that we keep to the subject in hand .
We must strengthen the possibility of the European Parliament becoming the place of dialogue with the ECB , the place for transparent and regular exchanges - at closer intervals , in my opinion - the place where the President can express himself and where , on behalf of our people , we can question him without challenging its independence .
It limits itself to a number of pertinent comments , it recognizes that the ECB will become the first supranational monetary authority in history and will thus consequently hold unprecedented power , far greater than that of the German Bundesbank or the American Federal Reserve and that , for the first time , an area in which federal political decisions are taken within the European Union will emerge .
Must all Europeans give up sugar just because its German grandmother is diabetic ?
Mr President , when a governing body receives orders from no-one and is made up of a very small number of people , what is it called ?
It is that , when she rightly explains that the concept of monetary stability is a concept which must be tailored to the circumstances of the situation , she gives the Central Bank , rather than the Ecofin Council , the role of fixing the criteria for stability , which could have moved the balance back a little bit in the other direction .
As the reports on convergence from the Commission , the European Monetary Institute and the Bundesbank have reminded us , this stability will be obtained by keeping salaries in check and lowering the overall cost of labour .
Let me give you an example .
I do not question this position , but I think it lacks precision .
I would like to say something to Mr Brok .
In my role as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets I have , for the moment , decided not to recommend the freeing up of the funds put to one side by Parliament
