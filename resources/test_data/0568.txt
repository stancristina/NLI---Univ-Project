The Commission must be given the responsibilities and the resources that it needs to draw up a roadmap , whereby we can grow and can create more jobs , just as we have done for the internal market and the single currency .
You said , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that we are living in a time of challenges , such as globalisation , climate and demographic challenges , and that we must look to the future with courage .
It is a shining example of modernisation and progress .
The social aspects that will be adversely affected by the liberalisation policies , and by the deepening of the internal market for services , continue to be treated as though of secondary importance .
This criminal military action forms part of a long-planned Israeli strategy to destroy the Palestinian Authority , its institutions and its structures , including those that meet the people’s most basic needs .
I therefore support the Boepels report and the amendments that she has tabled .
This initiative forms part of the securitarianism that the EU is drifting towards , and follows the adoption of other measures which , on the pretext of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’ , undermine the citizens ’ rights , freedoms and guarantees .
These amendments were as follows : - No provision in the present regulation can be used or invoked , within the framework of relations between the Member States , to undermine the rights , and the salaries , working conditions , qualifications and training of the various strata of civil aviation personnel ; - a reduction in the flight duty period – a maximum of 160 hours in a period of 28 consecutive days , distributed as evenly as possible throughout this period and a maximum of 40 hours in a seven-day period , with two rest days – so that the flight and cabin crew are able to guarantee safety . - certification of qualified cabin crew , with an appropriate , valid licence that is accepted by the relevant authority , which certifies that the person concerned has the appropriate qualifications and skills to carry out the duties allocated to them .
Hence our abstention .     .
Major obstacles continue to prevent agents in the sector from working together both within and outside national borders .
Europe has failed to respond adequately to the evidence that technology and investment in material and human resources in the area of research and innovation are vital components in development and growth , particularly given the current state of affairs in the world economy .
The main factors standing in the way of meeting the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy are well known : poor performance by the Member States , fragmentation of the labour markets , inefficient , inadequate use of human resources and reduced mobility of Europe’s workforce .
It also , on the other hand , contains proposals that we tabled in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , including the proposal to call on the Commission to refuse Community aid to companies which , after receiving such support in a Member State , transfer their manufacturing operations to another country without completely fulfilling the agreements entered into with the Member State concerned .
Although the EU is an economy essentially based on the services sector , it remains an industrial power on the world stage .
This document could not be accused of not containing the kind of conclusions found in a final report .
In adopting this report , we are asking the Board to put in place the conditions to discover the truth about what happened , and with the key amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats we are contributing towards a balanced , accurate and fair report .
This committee of inquiry will help to clarify how far and to what level of political authority Europe 's complicity went .
If this is the case , it is clearly outside Community law .
I await the results of this inquiry with interest .     – I too am suffering at the moment because of the game between Portugal and France , not , incidentally , France and England , as Mr Corbett predicted .
Ultimately , these procedures will be at the sharp end of the legitimacy challenge facing all political ranks .
In a European democracy , which is our project and our desire , comitology would set out the reality of networking that strengthens and does not detract from the legitimacy of the political union .     – Mr President , Mr  Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , this is not the first time in this Chamber that I have advocated a European policy on legal immigration – for humanitarian and economic reasons – and measures to step up the fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings .
Although the implementation of integration initiatives will be done at local level , it has broader implications .
The Union deals with capital and the movement of commodities , but does not pay attention to those who see Europe as a dream of a decent life .
The only fair criterion on which to base our decision is respect for human dignity .
This is a fair , intelligent approach , which replaces the current policy focused on border controls with a two-way migratory flow strategy .
No.
The EU must therefore make a commitment to fair trade , if only to appease the conscience of a common agricultural policy that spreads hunger and poverty in the countries of the South .
This will lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness , and ‘makes perfect sense’ .
In the past decade , there has been a huge rise in acts of terrorism around the world
