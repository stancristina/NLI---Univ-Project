for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex .
I should , moreover , also like to point out some grounds for satisfaction for the Presidency , and I believe for other institutions too , in the overall position adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation , which stresses the connection between the Charter and the social agenda and which concludes that the Convention ' s proposed Charter , adopted by the Heads of State and Government , "represents an important step towards the construction of a social and a citizens ' Europe " .
We are left with a feeling of bitterness .
The issue is more important than that .
It is a fine text because it is readable , clear , precise and framed with an eye to the future - well , we shall see , but in the meantime , as of right now , it is possible to read it as if it were a legal text , and that is what we sought to achieve .
To adopt an expression used by Catherine Lalumi√®re , I would say that we have to "put it into orbit " .
It is , of course , possible to highlight this or that article , to welcome the genuine progress made in affirming a number of new rights relating to developments in our societies or in reaffirming crucial fundamental rights .
Madam President , the draft European Parliament resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights has the same ambiguous foundation as the work of the body itself .
On the basis of the current treaties , today ' s debate actually has no legitimacy whatsoever , and that is a poor omen for a Europe which claims to wish to ensure that fundamental rights are respected .
Thirdly , it says to both existing Member States and to applicant states that when you become a member of the Community you become a member of a community of values .
I would like to stress how important it is to refer to the national minorities and cultural and linguistic differences in the chapter on equality .
We need not be naively optimistic , we shall surely find instances of human rights violations , but collectively we have a duty to ensure that it is possible to bring a legal case against such infringements , that there is a suitable court to prosecute such crimes , and a public administrative body to investigate them and prevent them recurring .
This is an important amalgamation at a time when the European Union is required to define the legal status , in terms of rights and duties , of third country nationals legally resident within the European Union .
Listening to this debate , I am pleased to see what appears to be a clear majority in Parliament in favour of this text , even if there a number of you still have to be won over .
I therefore believe that a reasonable approach would be to consolidate the foundation we have in this Charter and then to make ready for the next level .
It guarantees that the European Union respects and shall respect the implementation of these values within States .
This is the spirit in which the preparatory work for this report was carried out within the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and I should like , at this point , to thank all my fellow members for the contribution they made towards finalising this report , which , like the Commission , concludes that Turkey does not currently fulfil the Copenhagen criteria .
It is hard to understand today how it can remain divided by a wall , while in many other places , notably in Berlin and Sarajevo , and even more recently , between North and South Korea , such walls have crumbled over the past decade .
It is therefore up to us Europeans to support this country on its very long and difficult road to accession .
We must , however , also beware , as your report wisely emphasises , of setting new , extravagant conditions on Turkish candidature .
Let me stress the fact that Turkey must be treated on an equal footing with the other candidates .
As you know , however , this pre-accession aid will be more particularly intended to help Turkey achieve the objectives laid down in the future accession partnership agreement .
This is the phase which Turkey is now facing .
There is another matter , and if we have to vote on it today , the majority of my Group will vote in favour of this resolution .
We cannot play about with the dignity of nations .
I welcome this report and will vote for it .
The Charter therefore has no binding force upon countries whose legislation does not go quite so far as the minimum contained in the Charter .
I should now like to list my reservations concerning a number of specific articles .
This applies particularly to the economic and social rights listed in Chapter IV of the Charter .
As I stated in the debate prior to this vote , my hope is that if the governments meeting in Nice wish to adopt this Charter as a political statement , they will preface it with an introductory statement to this effect and pointing out the basic jurisdiction of national parliaments over citizens ' rights .
Human rights may not be under immediate threat in the EU , but accountable democracy is .
It is a proud boast of many Europeans that we are free to do anything which is not expressly prohibited in law .
Very quickly we shall have to incorporate it into the Treaties .
