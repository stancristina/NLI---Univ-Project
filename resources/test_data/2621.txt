invisible workers - to which reference has just been made - is also made apparent by agricultural statistics according to which the proportion of women varies slightly from 0.2 % to 0.3 % , although nobody can deny that , as there is such a wide range of tasks to be done , women may well do more work on farms than men .
If I might say one last thing , Mr President , if you want to do something to keep women in rural areas , you have to ensure that they suffer no discrimination either as regards fair payment for their work or as regards social security .
Over recent months , a series of accidents involving buses has occurred , in which people have died or been severely injured .
Mr President , Commissioner , when one considers your statement in technical terms , you are certainly right to say that price-fixing and quantity-fixing are offences against equality of competition in the European Union .
Some two million people lost their lives , while an incalculable number were displaced and deported .
Everything demonstrates the total power wielded by the autocratic Communist Party , which evidently cannot reconcile itself to the idea that other parties have to exist .
As a matter of priority , Laos must become freely accessible to the media , so that the world can learn what is actually going on there , and so that the country 's continuing deficiencies are not hidden from it .
It is as follows : Qa . ...
If we do not want to carry on patching things up year after year , we have to give some thought to the causes .
I have now been an MEP for more or less fourteen years , in which time I have been involved in environmental policy , but I also know perfectly well where we all stand when it comes to passing real legislation .
We did not manage to do that .
If , though , the decision is taken in the autumn , it is envisaged that we will begin the lawmaking process next year .
One - the strengthening of the law , the right of recall - is a matter for the Convention on the Constitution , and the second is , of course , a critical observation .
We MEPs take the view that there are two principles that must be adhered to .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it goes without saying that precise assessment of risks when giving credit is of crucial importance to the stability of the banking system , and so , whilst supporting the Basel II agreement 's objective of strengthening the banks ' hand in evaluating risks , we nevertheless have a number of critical observations to make .
If Basel II were to be implemented as it has been drafted by the Basel Committee , then it would be easier for businesses that do not need money - that is , loans - to have access to credit .
Basel II still needs to be discussed .
It is about credit standing and the collateral needed for it .
I believe that we have now taken another major step forward in this ongoing debate , thanks in particular to Mr Mastorakis 's report .
It seems to me that you think that distributing money here , there and everywhere will somehow keep everyone happy .
I welcome the threshold of 75 % of GDP per head at NUTS II level being retained as the main criterion for determining Objective 1 status , provided that at the same time the so-called statistical effect is neutralised .
My second point is that if you look at the Constitutional Treaty our vision has won through , because now it is actually a question of negotiating our statement of beliefs .
That is why it is not only a just but also a robust solution that needs to be found for the 18 regions concerned .
I am confident , when I say a dispute is drawing to an end , that at the latest at the second reading a solution will be found that is acceptable to the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
That is why , Mr Barnier , it is right for you also to take the path that the rapporteur has proposed , and proceed on a step-by-step basis .
It is , of course , for the Commission to ensure that this agreement is promptly and properly implemented throughout China , and you , Commissioner , and also Vice-President , de Palacio , can perhaps say something about why this is so .
How , though , do things stand in practice ?
My final point is that it matters a great deal both to me and to my group that we should now - great and important though this reform is - keep this Regulation open-ended .
That will be happening with effect from 1 January 2004 as an equalisation of burdens between the Community and the shipowners .
That is indeed so , but the implementation of such a measure is quite simply not in their capacities .
As a matter of principle , I regard anything else as an excuse !
The increases in yield or the extension of the irrigated areas , which are the possible consequences of the Spanish Hydrological Plan would thus have no effect on the total amounts paid , nor could the implementation of the plan have any effect on the production of milk , to which quota rules apply .
( DE ) Mr Ferr√°ndez Lezaun , the initial estimate that can be made of this can be only a very rough one , as there are no binding provisions relating to irrigation , for example , on which fruits or crops farmers are to cultivate on the irrigated areas
