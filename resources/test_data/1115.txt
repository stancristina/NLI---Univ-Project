colleagues and the other political groups for the intensive , fruitful co-operation we have had prior to this second reading also .
Now the European Parliament is repeating its demand , which the Council has not approved , that the Member States should oblige employers to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace .
The Committee has found that a certain system that may be very useful in preventing and remedying damage resulting from sexual harassment is that each workplace should have a confidential counsellor people can turn to in such cases .
Every day we hear examples of how employers still ask young women whether they intend to have children in the next few years , and this is how a very large number of people seeking employment might become the victims of serious discrimination .
This also covers the issue whereby a person must have the right to return to the same job , or at least a similar one , and with the same terms and conditions of employment , after a period of maternity leave , for example .
We all understand how important co-ordinating work and family life is for young families and our children too .
This directive does not lay down legal provision for new rights , but seeks to protect those who want to exercise their rights - both fathers and mothers - from discrimination at work .
Parliament is proposing that the plans for equality in the workplace be adopted .
It has been a joy to see that employers ' organisations have also actually approved this idea .
I believe that , united , we will see a decision taken on this directive soon .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Migu√©lez Ramos , for this excellent report .
The issue is also a timely one , as the applicant countries are receiving guidelines for verifying territorial classification in their own countries .
With the present NUTS classification system one problem is that classifications by country have shaped themselves according to each country ' s own needs and traditions .
Units vary in size and , for example , a low population density or gradual depopulation are overlooked .
We would ask you to support our group ' s amendment , whereby islands and the outermost regions are added to the Subparagraph of Article 3 ( 4 ) in order to avoid unnecessary reclassification .
The goal relating to the comparative classification of territories will be difficult to achieve , and will take time .
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner Lamy , it is my pleasure to be able to state on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats that the major Parliamentary Groups have found it very easy to reach agreement on the joint statement which we will decide on tomorrow following this discussion .
This shows that on certain major questions a general view predominates over party lines .
He had energetically and skilfully shuttled all over the world trying to create a basis for a new WTO negotiation round ; on which a decision needs to be taken in Doha in mid-November .
My group fully supports the negotiation line that the Council had already decided for the Seattle conference .
Now , if ever , it must be shown that we cannot be intimidated by terrorism ; instead , we shall continue - on the 'business as usual ' principle - with our policies of international cooperation for the sake of freer and fairer trade .
This road , ladies and gentlemen , would be a road to protectionism , and then on to trade wars and also , subsequently , to possible armed conflicts .
It would be a road which would make all enemies of freedom , democracy , the State under the rule of law , social development and human rights nod with satisfaction .
I would like to mention by name my colleagues Erika Mann and Konrad Schwaiger .
I believe that during the next few years we can develop Parliamentary monitoring of world trade ; this is important in order to open up to citizens the work of an organisation such as the WTO and , through this , to seeking approval of the activity falling within its sphere .
The report is a good one , but it still fails to take the full measure of the profound change which has taken place in international politics following 11 September .
Here , in Europe , we have been wary of excessive dramatisation and have avoided using the word 'war ' .
My personal view , however , is that , in time , history books will come to refer to this period as the Third World War .
We need a broad global perspective and grasp ; we need something which , in English , can be called 'global governance ' .
Rapid advances have been made , particularly in crisis management .
In the initial phase at any rate , the main question is probably this : how are the different geographical positions of the various Member States to be taken into account in sharing the burden and dividing the work among them ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the report under consideration states that the struggle against terrorism must become a central plank in the EU 's foreign and security policy .
September 11 revealed with one bang the prevailing error of the old security policy .
The benefit of each depends on that of all others .
In this policy of dependency , we will use , in the first instance , social workers instead of soldiers ; nurses instead of bombs ; and teachers instead of missiles .
We must get away from armed security , this hangover from the cold war
