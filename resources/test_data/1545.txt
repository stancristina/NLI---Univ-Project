Naturally , that is how dock workers – and not simply dock workers but also dock work companies throughout Europe – have realised that the desire was now to engage in competition through social dumping , that is to say by resorting to the social break-up of an entire profession , whether it be public or private .
There has been no genuine consultation of the interested parties .
Ship owners can make workers , who are taken on without guarantees , work for low pay and subject them to whatever working conditions they want .
Of course , we know its limits , but this cannot stop us from being ambitious , I have said it and clearly too .
To this end , awareness campaigns , which seek to inform the public , are imperative .
What is the point , furthermore , of defining soil at European level , of drawing up a scientific soil catalogue by 2007 with harmonisation of scientific data on soil , other than to note their diversity , which is already known ?
To a certain extent , the European Parliament wanted to contribute to informing the public more by producing a map showing risk areas .
The Union only has significance for the citizens by means of the implementation of its policies .
Should we rejoice at this ?
I remember that this issue was mentioned several times .
A glimmer of hope has been offered by the so-called Geneva accords , negotiated over more than two years by the delegations led by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabbo .
At that time , let us remember , the declaration at the origin of this process gave us great hope .
We must demand that Morocco accept this plan before anything else .     Mr President , since the reunification of Europe is about to become a reality , even though , as we know , there is still much to do , we are witnessing a page of history being written .
At economic level , we must launch a genuine Marshall plan for the Mediterranean with a view to genuinely establishing this shared prosperity , which was already included in the Barcelona declaration .     Mr President , I would like to inform the House of the problem that I came across yesterday .
I nonetheless rebel against the obstacles that impede the recovery of waste , which – supported by the Court of Justice’s judgement in case C-228/00 – will penalise my country ’s cement manufacturers .
That is why the bulk of European funds should be used to finance this type of research which , alone , will be able to meet the urgent requirements of those who are ill .
Lack of security , disappearances and human rights violations for which the Russian military forces are responsible continue with complete impunity .
Because the fact is that Russia is a huge power at our borders , and no one knows exactly how to take the bull by the horns , all the more so because everyone wants to have Russia on its side .
When Mr Putin moralises , perhaps with good reason , about Iraq , he does not think about what we are saying , because it is of no consequence to him .
They would certainly have said to me in reply what they said to my fellow MEP , Mr Wynn , in which case I should have reminded them of what my colleague , Mrs McKenna , pointed out to them on the subject of the Treaty of Nice .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is no coincidence if , on the eve of the vote on the resolution prepared by our estimable fellow MEP , Mr  Queiró , we are able , as he has just reminded us , to share his delight at the announcement last Monday of the decision by the External Relations Council to create the European Defence Agency and to ask a team responsible for establishing this Agency to propose the relevant legal , institutional and financial arrangements .
I would therefore take this opportunity to salute the courage of the rapporteur and of all those within the committee who have backed his report by having written , or agreed , that the persistent refusal of many Member States to increase their defence expenditure is in danger of jeopardising the European Union’s military capability and the very coherence of its action within NATO .
That is good news .
For the sake of their security , the States must remain the sole masters of their considerations .
This is why the Commission is rejecting certain considerations concerning the nature of this research .
We reject it and we will vote against .     Madam President , it is interesting that we are discussing EU-Canada relations on the same day as Mr George Bush is visiting the United Kingdom and trumpeting the so-called special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States of America .
We both value , in a way that some other countries do not , the multilateral institutions of the world and we value the international rule of law .
Given my desire to avoid entering into an argument on this point , however , I shall begin by stressing the following point : regardless of the usefulness of the European Women’s Lobby , if some Members – and I agree with the previous speaker here – are calling for the extension of the programme for women , it is because they know from their dialogue with the relevant associations that the main problem lies in the way they work .
To that end , however , we must also simplify procedures with a view to ensuring that the largest possible number of associations can benefit from this new
