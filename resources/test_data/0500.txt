.
This Parliament must protect the health and quality of life of the people that we represent .
There is no safe threshold for dioxin emissions and more research is being done on the effects of micro-particles on human health and the environment .
So we have to ensure that there is frequent testing and monitoring , that regular and detailed information is made available to the public , and that real action is taken against breaches of the rules .
Measuring emissions twice a year may give an early indication of what is happening in an incineration plant and in the air that the local community is breathing .
Measuring once every two years would not do that .
So we must set the highest possible standards and not make exceptions which will weaken this very important legislation .
Mr President , unusually tonight I am not speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group , largely because I have some particularly strong views about this directive .
I do believe that Mr Blokland has produced the wrong report at the wrong time for the wrong reasons .
It is not so long ago that we addressed this issue and produced a set of rules that were appropriate to the situation , and which Mr Blokland was seen to be happy with at the time and did not complain about .
Given a task to do , Mr Blokland has produced a new and revised report that has certainly exceeded anything that we have done before .
We cannot say that it is all wrong .
Indeed there are many sensible proposals put forward in areas where the technology makes it possible to advance .
But quite frankly we cannot expect , having already given industry one set of rules to implement only a year or two ago , to hand them a completely new set of rules so quickly .
We have to expect that it will take time to implement this report .
Mr Blokland has also exceeded in many ways the brief he was given .
In particular , the scope of this proposal goes far further than previous directives and brings into its legislative fold a great many processes which require separate legislation , and need to be separately regulated because they are inherently different from the simple process of combustion .
If one is being kind to this directive one could describe it as being good in parts , like the curate 's egg .
Unfortunately , this is going to give environment policy a bad name .
We should not be constantly re-regulating incinerators .
We should be seeking ways to avoid incineration in the first place .
Parliament 's objective in waste management strategy is not to constantly tighten rules on existing incinerating plant , it is to change the role of waste management , to change the type of waste management that we do .
We would be much better concentrating our efforts in the next few years on recycling , re-use and other methods of reducing the waste heap .
If we do not , we will very soon find ourselves back with this problem again .
Mr President , I certainly agree with Mr Bowe 's final summary .
Although the common position places firm controls on permitted emissions from waste incinerators , I know that whenever proposals to build such an incinerator are made in my country , people rise in protest , they distrust the operator 's claims and I have a degree of sympathy with them .
So I and many of my colleagues will be backing most of Mr Blokland 's amendments because we want the highest possible standards .
I have no problem at all if these prove technically difficult to achieve - no problem , because Britain has a shameful record of having the lowest household waste recycling in Europe and great room for improvement .
Many of us believe that any government in our country will encourage the construction of waste incinerators as an alternative to encouraging the alternatives .
It would be a case of " throw it on the furnace " and putting it out of sight and out of mind which to my mind is a false approach .
We have to concentrate on reducing waste , recycling what is left and leaving incinerators as a last resort .
Mr President , I find myself in agreement with Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Paulsen and - rather alarmingly for both of us - with Mr Bowe .
But I want to make a particular point in relation to an alarm which has been raised in the United Kingdom by the agricultural sector literally in the last few days .
A number of United Kingdom MEPs have been contacted by farming interests , who are very worried that the incineration directive will apply to all on-farm incinerators in the United Kingdom .
There are said to be several thousand of these , and the full effect of applying the controls outlined in the directive would be to put up the costs for each incinerator to operate by an estimated £200 000 .
Typically , such incinerators deal with animal waste from the agriculture sector and with the disposal of empty pesticide containers at a rate of less than 50 kg an hour .
Both processes satisfy the criteria of best practicable environmental option and are accepted by environmental inspectors in the United Kingdom .
No exception has been moved for these under Article 2( 2 ) and the closure of incinerators following the entry into force of the directive would pose enormous problems of cost and of disposal of animal waste for UK farmers .
My question to the Commissioner , which I hope that she will able to answer when she comes , is this : since we have not moved an exception to take account of these on-farm incinerators , is this the first time the European Commission has heard of this difficulty ?
