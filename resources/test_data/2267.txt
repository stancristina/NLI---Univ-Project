our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but , on the other hand , we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10 % of the total ; so statements of principle , of support in principle , are not enough because they have not worked .
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen .

Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said , the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking .
Children have lost parents , families are bereft , hopeless , helpless and they have lost absolutely everything .
But of course , as others have said , this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate , woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness .
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place .
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region .
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet . 85 % of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is .
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing .
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million .
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there .
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift .
As you say tons of food , water purification equipment , tents , blankets .
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources .
Are we ready to pay for those resources ?
Mozambique is , of course , one of the poorest countries in the world , but one of Africa ' s great success stories with its work on economic growth , on poverty reduction , on democracy in spite , of course , of massive debt pressures .
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured .
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country .
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us .
This debate , I think , has summed it up .
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening , and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics , and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear , because this report is a radical one .
This report is a wake-up call to Europe .
This report recommends radical measures , which in essence will make it easier to employ people .
It is as simple as that .
The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets .
This is the only way to go forward , because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs .
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that , because Europe has to wake up .
It cannot create jobs just by government spending .
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours , as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people .
The real world simply does not work like that .
And if Europe wants to be left behind , left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism , than yes , vote against this report tomorrow .
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe , then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report , because it will deliver those jobs , and it will deliver those opportunities , and it is the only way to do so .
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome .
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other .
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation .
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002 , it is important that swift progress is now made .
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation , this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations .
