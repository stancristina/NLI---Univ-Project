avoid prolonging the legislative process , and therefore voted in favour of Europass , which will enable it to enter into force as early as January 2005 .     .
In addition to making qualifications and skills comparable , the proposal before us also helps to achieve the Lisbon 2000 objectives , to turn Europe into the ‘most dynamic and competitive area in the world ’ by 2010 .
In the last seven years , the world has become more globalised and societies have become more complex and diversified .
The first of these is credibility .
We therefore wish to make it clear that we reject the Financial Perspectives , of which the average annual spending falls between the Commission ’s proposal and the ceiling of the ‘Letter of the six’ , which I mentioned earlier , and is moving ever closer to that ceiling .
Much remains to be done and , despite all the policies that we have been pursuing , enormous problems still exist in terms of the production and trafficking of drugs , and in terms of drug use , which continues to hit extremely high levels in all Member States .
The truth is that the political project on which the Commission ’s proposals are based was not actually at risk .
I am aware that some Member States remain convinced that the EU budget should be limited to 1 % of gross national revenue .
Let me state this to you clearly : we cannot have more Europe with less money and a union ceases to be a union if the objective of cohesion is forgotten .
This means that we must reach a political agreement in June of next year .
Let us look at what this means with regard to each of those topics .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , terrorism is certainly one of the Council’s most important portfolios and we must combat it globally and unstintingly .
This is something that Jacques Delors said , and with good reason .
What I am wondering is that with an agenda of which I have only mentioned a few topics , with the desire for a joint , EU-level external service , what resources will we use to seek to influence the international scene ?
This sector has already shed more than 1 million jobs in the last ten years .
Given that this is a threat to all of us , the most appropriate strategy is one that leads us to act together , bypassing national level and even the areas of internal justice and security .
The EU and its Member States must streamline their defence capacities and strengthen their channels of diplomatic cooperation , their information services and their legal and law enforcement coordination , in a genuine synergy of national and transnational policy .
In Parliament we have adopted and recommended various measures .
Some people in this House felt that it should be rejected for this reason .
I voted in favour of opening the process of Turkey’s accession to the EU.
I voted in favour , although we have not had the opportunity for serious contemplation as to where Europe should extend , and because I do not accept the political and cultural borders of the ‘Christian Club Europe’ , nor the prophecies of the ‘clash of civilisations’ .
I endorse the rapporteur’s position that this must be an open-ended process , without a predetermined outcome , albeit a process that does point towards accession .
One must also take into account the fact that this particular form of crime is more often than not only one element of broader criminal activity , encompassing various types of crime spread across an enormous geographical area .
It should be pointed out , however , that there is a long way to go on this issue , especially as regards implementing a common agricultural policy that respects the existing cultural diversity , whereby policies are put in place that promote small and medium-sized farming , in contrast with the current measures in place , which , if they achieve their aims , will sacrifice and penalise farmers with fewer resources .
I feel , however , that there remain aspects that could be clarified , such as the distinction between residues – in the context of maximum residue limits ( MRLs ) – and pesticides .
That is not to overlook the worrying signs in the area of human rights and civil liberties that have come to light in Russia , as regards political processes and procedures and the question of Chechnya .
Improvements are to be introduced to training , in-country assessment and the related information and judicial procedures .
It does , however , among other points , highlight this threat to ‘the European humanitarian tradition ’ and criticises what is termed the ‘outsourcing ’ of the process of application by sending applicants for refugee status to a third country , and condemns the lengthy processing of asylum claims .
Statistics show that in 2003 some 70 % of the world’s refugees remained in their region of origin .
The truth is that neither the concept of Fortress Europe nor that of Sanctuary Europe has much to do with reality .
Furthermore – and this makes sense within the logic of the report – it takes the view that the subsidiarity principle is not very important in this area .
The slackness and decriminalisation that have been proposed are well known ways of removing responsibility from the public authorities and are a false ally of those whose drive and judgment have been subdued by the effects of drugs , and therefore constitute a deeply flawed message to give to the youngest members of society .
Firstly , Parliament should be more involved in programmes specifically developed and supported in this field
