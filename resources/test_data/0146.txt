Parliament seeks to express its anguish and alarm about the current situation which , despite being the result of the removal of internal borders , which is so beneficial in all other respects , is not being sufficiently addressed by the Community authorities .
Commissioner , you have said on many occasions that the new rapid alert system is part of crisis management , and that it would be the responsibility of the Commission .
I would like to refer to two of the controversial issues of the Regulation : the procedure for the choice of headquarters and the criteria for it .
In this respect , its seems to me important that these plans strengthen , in each case , the study of the local conditions in which the concentrations are produced , in order thereby to combat them more effectively .
And not only did it exist , but it had also already adopted the majority of what we were discussing .
It contains three giants : Japan , China and India , which are going to be increasingly important on the international stage .
To this end , the Maastricht reform drew up the CFSP and for the same purpose various proposals are currently being considered with a view to 2004 .
In this communication the Commission confirms its will to make progress on decentralisation and on the deconcentration of external aid .
We hope that in the coming weeks the Commission will approve a new communication , a more ambitious one , which takes account of the opinions of Parliament and finally allows us to rationalise , organise and improve the external service , so that it may become an effective instrument for a solid European Union external policy .
That is why it is important to take the direction indicated by Mr Galeote .
To this end , the Commission must be present on the ground , the officials must have direct contact with the reality of under-development , with the development agents and the local authorities , and very much increasing support for , and support from , both local and European NGOs .
Have limits been placed on the number and length of the nets which can be used at each tide ?
With regard to Regulation ( EEC ) No 2158 on the protection of forests against fire , an action framework was established to reduce the number of fires and the surface area affected by them , providing for the co-funding of fundamentally preventive actions .
Parliament is requesting EUR 0.23 per hectare .
However , I would like to say that I consider it a failure that the financial contribution of the Regulation on the protection of Community forests against fire is being reduced from EUR 70 million to EUR 49.4 million , and that in the case of the Regulation on atmospheric pollution it is being reduced from EUR 40 million to 35.4 million .
This innovation is therefore welcome .
This is a modest step , since it only involves administrative obligations , formal obligations , that is , certain secondary aspects of the tax , but it seems to me a step in the right direction .
Madam President , having listened to Mr Harbour , it seems to me that we are not going to have much debate tonight , because the Group of the European Peoples ' Party and the Socialist Group basically agree in their support for the Miller report and the proposals now being presented to us by the European Commission .
Some of the amendments contained in our opinion have been incorporated into the text , as he has said .
It is therefore necessary to impose universal service obligations , but naturally the discussion on the size and conditions of the universal service will have a high ideological content .
Neither does it seem to us acceptable to vote against , as happened in committee and which has been said will happen now , certain amendments which propose , for example , that a change in telephone service provider should not mean a change in the customer ' s number and that , if it does happen , it should be done without cost to the user and at a more than accessible cost .
In summary , she has improved on the Commission ' s text .
Madam President , I would ask you to take note of this serious problem , which affects these two European citizens and their families , so that you may urge the Georgian authorities to immediately locate and free these two Spaniards , who are being deprived of their main fundamental right ; freedom .
With regard to the Gothenburg Summit , we are all reeling from the shock of the Irish referendum , which is a significant wake-up call .
Because it is not simply a question of discussing whether the Structural Funds are maintained for some and not for others , but rather of finding out , firstly , how we can all contribute , and the President of the Commission has recently talked about the suitability of a European tax .
That is how things are done .
In this respect also I would ask Mr Poettering to speak with his political friends in the governments in order to achieve a process of reducing tension , which is essential to the future of humanity .
I would like to ask you now to show a little more daring - as a French revolutionary would say , de l'audace , encore de l'audace , toujours de l'audace [what we need is to dare , still to dare , and always to dare] .
We are terribly concerned when Mexicans die in the Arizona desert , but we are completely indifferent to the fact that people looking for work in Europe continually die off our coasts .
