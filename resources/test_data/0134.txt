materials are carried through , strengthen the security , safety and intervention systems and speed up the adoption of a European directive on tunnel safety .
Let me also point out that the resolution fully endorses the opinion delivered by the Committee on Fisheries .
In that spirit we must also help these countries combat flags of convenience and other vessels which fish illegally in their exclusive economic zones .
As a Member from Réunion , I am naturally interested in the conclusion of this seventh fisheries agreement between the EU and Madagascar , given its implications for fishing in the Indian Ocean and , obviously , off Réunion too .
Allocating flat-rate aid per head of sheep and goats instead of the present system of compensatory payments is harmful to small-scale stockbreeders and in no way improves their incomes .
I voted against the second part , against the commentary , and I am shown in the register as having voted in favour .
In my view , we cannot express a sound opinion on research programmes lasting several years , whose ethical aspects are fundamental , and then suddenly vote on the Fiori report which could lose a significant amount of its political impact .
We requested the opportunity to meet the Sakharov Prize winner , of course , but we were refused outright , and what we find particularly disappointing , especially since this concerns the Sakharov Prize , is that we were unable , at a time when we are combating terrorism , to meet Leïla Zana .
As far as the Commission is concerned , we believe that there is no obvious incompatibility between these two documents , since Annex III of the framework agreement regulates the forwarding of confidential documents to Parliament which cannot , in any case , be forwarded to the public , due to the exceptions laid down by the regulation of 30 May .
In order to exercise this control further , the French Senate has also set up an internal specialised working group responsible for investigating issues of police and judicial cooperation .
I regret that we did not choose a better way .
The Commission has already launched , pursuant to Article 25( a ) of the directive , an independent study to assess the impact of measures for promoting the production and distribution of European television programmes .
Item 27 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Committee to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of setting up a European Promotion Fund .
I am pleased to see that the Court of Auditors is keeping a good distance and we must do the same thing with the error rate .
Furthermore , it is natural for the European Union to be vigilant about whether or not a country like Laos observes the clause on human rights enshrined in the cooperation agreement that it signed .
Tens of thousands of Laotians , starting with the royal family of Laos , have quite simply been murdered in dribs and drabs .
Our group will therefore oppose a number of paragraphs which fall within a sectoral approach that we will not support .
The fact that it was necessary to present the various amendments to the House once again obviously indicates that what I have just said about objectives , and above all , about the resources to be implemented , has not received unanimous support .
I think that services of general interest , as their name suggests , must be subject to the rights and obligations that the general interest demands .
Education , health , public transport , postal services , telecommunications , water and energy supply , and refuse collection must remain public services which must not generate profits ...
Secondly , one of the objectives of the training and assistance programme is to protect the euro outside the euro zone , which is not actually an area of the Community competence .
We must , however , be very attentive to the Commission ' s attempts to wield imperialist powers .
We believe that we must urgently block the liberalisation process and re-appropriate public services by freeing them from the markets .
The citizen will see through this .
Who knows of a school bus service , in a rural area , managed by the local authority , that has to rely upon external markets ?
Nautical services for piloting and mooring are universally recognised as services of general interest .
Otherwise , we will be going against both the Erika-Maritime Safety package and our desire to remove lorries from the major transit countries .
I refuse to put the cart before the horse by making proposals first and only then taking advice .
We are analysing all that in order to find , together , the most effective way of making progress in this matter .
I wish to make it quite clear that the Belgian presidency cannot be held responsible for this failure .
It appears that of the part falling to national governments , 47.5 % will be covered by the European Union .
This is the body that has the task of drawing up the list of substances that should be banned and the body which governments and sporting bodies must then deal with .
Some of these projects involved Greek and Latin .
Incidentally , Article 3 of this Treaty imposes the obligation of integrating concerns about equality between the sexes into all Union policies .
Furthermore , another problem is that , often , European scenarios do not correspond to the detailed scenarios drawn up by Member States .
If we wish to remain masters of our destiny , we must give priority to action on two fronts .
I asked the Commissioner two very specific questions and I am rather disappointed that she has not managed to give me an answer .
