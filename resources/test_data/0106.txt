Staff Regulations year after year .
It is also proposed that we should have a common support service to help the small agencies with burdensome administrative tasks .
I am pleased to be able to state that it has been possible to grant discharge to three of these , Galileo , the European Railway Agency and Frontex , after examining all of the information they provided us with .
We have requested information on this , but have not received all of it .
The committee and I therefore propose that we postpone the granting of discharge until Cepol has provided a full declaration in this regard .
This is why we are postponing the granting of discharge .
There are still a number of flaws and shortcomings in this area and a number of things about which we have reservations .
What is sometimes problematic is the lack of evidence for the indirect costs and personnel costs , and the overestimation of such costs .
Although there was not very much debate on my reports on discharge for the agencies , I hope that all of my fellow Members will choose to support them , irrespective of how they voted in the committee or of what they have previously indicated .
I know that many of you think that these points are very controversial , but in my opinion at least they are a given .
At a time when ordinary people are seeing their pensions reduced , politicians must not save their own skins by using more of taxpayers ' money for their own pensions .
The slaughter of seals in the way that we have seen pictures of from countries outside the EU is terrible and should not be allowed to occur .
The whole process is surrounded by strict rules and it would be a very poor way of managing natural resources if the animal were not permitted to be used once it had been shot .
Every year hundreds of millions of animals - pigs , cows , sheep , hens , horses and other animals - are slaughtered and transported throughout Europe .
However , this regulation is not really about that , but about how we can reduce the suffering of animals at slaughterhouses .
However , I am deeply concerned about several other amendments put forward by this committee and by individual Members .
It is unfortunate that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has completely deleted the proposed time limits for transport to the slaughterhouse and the waiting time inside the slaughterhouse .
It is also incredibly important to allow Member States to go further and have more ambitious provisions than those laid down here .
We have found a balance between religious tradition and animal welfare that most people are happy with .
In total , investments amounting to EUR 3.5 billion are proposed for 2009 and 2010 - money that is to be provided from the Member States ' budgets .
Instead , an increase in assistance from EUR 3.5 billion to nearly EUR 4 billion is proposed !
In general , this is a very good report with many good aspects , but on account of repeated demands for growth and for Member States to introduce minimum wages in conjunction with legally binding social conditions , which would involve a huge transfer of power to the EU , I am abstaining from voting .
We have chosen to vote in favour of this report because the European Parliament needs to prepare itself to be able to implement the changes that will occur in connection with its work if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force .
Prior to that , the draft Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands .
It would have been desirable if the report had instead dealt with the problem of this Parliament 's lack of democratic legitimacy .
I have voted against the draft report .
The Treaty of Lisbon , which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty , was rejected in the referendum in Ireland .
I do not believe that the European Parliament should have greater influence on the EU budget .
During my time in Parliament I have noted time after time how the federalist majority wishes to liberally hand out grants for everything from cultural projects to structural support and increased EU bureaucracy .
This liberal expenditure policy is being conducted by the EU at a time of financial crisis when Member States are having to cut their expenditure on health care , schools and welfare .
We Conservatives have today voted in favour of Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert 's report on criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for applications for international protection lodged by third-country nationals or stateless persons .
We advocate a generous common asylum and immigration policy centred on people 's needs in accordance with the commitments made by the Member States in the Geneva Convention .
We also consider it regrettable that the right does not wish to give asylum seekers the right to enter the labour market within six months .
The June List is in favour of the realisation of the internal market and supports the work on seeking solutions at EU level to the environmental challenges facing Europe .
While it is undoubtedly good that a small possibility of self-determination is now being proposed through the introduction of a negotiating procedure , it is nonetheless small comfort and does not change the clear - even if not explicitly expressed - aim of creating an EU state .
The EU must not conduct a common foreign policy because such a development risks taking away from people their opportunity to hold their elected politicians accountable for their actions in their relations with foreign countries .
I have therefore voted against it in the final vote
