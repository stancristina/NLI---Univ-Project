Unfortunately , everything is a matter of urgency for the EU.
But if Yugoslavia is both the reality and the metaphor illustrating the difficulty - even now - of ensuring the coexistence of different ethnic groups , then we must acknowledge - as you have done - that true coexistence can only be achieved in the bosom of Europe , and not by creating small statelets which are increasingly inward-looking and ethnically homogeneous .
I would remind you that , according to the report from the European Environmental Agency a few months ago , eleven of the top twelve environmental problems have either worsened or remained the same within the European Union since 1995 .
Your words convey the idea that development amounts to continuous growth , without any attention to the natural limits of resources .
I nevertheless wish you all the best for your work .
Obviously , an act of government is embodied in a government ; it cannot simply be summarised in a programme .
There has also been some difficulty concerning the timing of the investiture .
Mr Verheugen , on behalf of the Council , has stressed the need for a rapid investiture procedure .
I have been accused of having too much confidence in the market and too little in social Europe .
You may think I am saying this to receive your endorsement or backing .
Obviously this is a gradual process .
First of all out of respect for certain countries which have their own internal acceptance procedures ; secondly , because we must begin by setting out our work programmes and intentions , and then we can build the Commission .
The facts , though , are very plain : it is difficult to build a new , serviceable edifice without giving it a defensive structure .
These encompass major sectors , ranging from pharmaceuticals to fine chemistry to health appliances : sectors in which Europe is extremely weak and has huge scope for job creation and for harnessing intelligence .
It is immense because the situation confronting us is becoming increasingly difficult and almost untenable socially , economically and especially in regard to the organisation of government structures .

My second point - and the House finally approved this at its last part-session - is that Milosevic should be indicted as a war criminal .
That is a problem that we must tackle immediately : we cannot wait to see his corpse before we begin discussing what ought to have been done .
In the circumstances , however , we have to point to the inadequacy of the measures taken and the precarious nature of political intervention by the European Union in the past .
The European Parliament must act immediately to restore the kind of democratic conditions that apply in our countries , because representatives and militants of the opposition party are still in prison and some members of the Albanian Parliament have been deprived of their parliamentary immunity .
Something new is needed , because the air strikes are no longer having an effect : either the attacks continue against the same targets that have been attacked up to now , or attacks are launched on the cities .
We need to see what cards Milosevic has in his hand , and for that to be achievable , the air strikes have to be suspended .
We should have catered for the dreadful tragedy of the exodus and deportation , but at the moment we are floundering in the dark , with no coordination , with a great deal of goodwill , certainly , but with no scientific approach to humanitarian intervention .
We were slow to react and we failed to react in the right way , and the issue facing us today - and Mr Dupuis said as much - is that we must realise that the time has come to mount a huge information campaign directed at the Serb population , so that they too understand that right and might are on our side and not on the side of Milosevic .
Let me begin with you , Mr Rocard .
In the final analysis , there is clearly some divergence of interests .
It is true that what we mostly see are the camps with their dreadful conditions , but honourable Members should realise that the great majority of the deportees have been taken in by extremely poor Albanian or Macedonian families , as we all know , and that one of the major efforts we are making is to provide aid to those families , specifically to prevent social tensions and to ensure that the refugees do not find themselves on the street after enjoying a month 's generous hospitality , thereby creating social problems .
These are not the kind of refugees we are used to , they are actually deportees , human time bombs to be used if , when and where Milosevic so decides .
We hear the call for a political solution .

But we went for a different strategy : we decided that the Rothley line was the one to follow , and here we are today with Mr Rothley himself complaining that the whole thing is unacceptable .
In the first place , it seriously prejudices and curtails Parliament 's autonomy , just when the Treaty of Amsterdam accords us prime responsibility - albeit within the framework of an appropriate interinstitutional agreement in which the Commission and the Council participate in full - for drawing up our Members ' Statute , along with clear rules governing their material conditions of work .
I would remind the House that , along with the Statute , there are other crucial issues on the agenda .
The people who are concerned with the consumers ' interests will remember the distance selling debate in this House and whatever divisions still exist - and there is still time and room to find some convergence -
