Environment Committee 's lead in removing category from the compulsory scheme and that the Commission and Council too will agree not to impose this additional unnecessary burden on producers and consumers alike .
In previous debates here I have supported the principle of having a clear set of rules for appropriate labelling information on beef and beef products .
My belief is still that our beef production industry , as well as the consumer , has everything to gain from the customer confidence which a sensible compulsory labelling scheme can provide .
Of course , we must have clear information permitting full traceability from farm to plate .
There is no doubt or controversy about that , but controversy has surrounded the proposal that category of animal be included .
In judging the value of label information , I believe that its relevance to food safety must be foremost in our minds .
In a recent exchange of views within our political Group here in Strasbourg , Commissioner Byrne and his cabinet officials stated quite clearly that there was no food safety benefit arising from the categorisation proposal .
I cannot support its inclusion .
In relation to country or Member State of origin , could I ask Commissioner Fischler to clarify whether , apart from the compulsory information that we are discussing here , information regarding the area of origin , such as Scotland or the Orkney Islands for example , can be displayed prominently on a voluntary basis ?
Mr President , I would also like to concentrate on this issue of category of animal labelling .
The original proposal called for labelling as steer , heifer or young bull , which would be sexual discrimination .
But recently I was staggered when the Commission - just as Mrs Doyle has said - reported it had not finally decided on the precise terminology !
This effectively means they are asking Parliament to give them a blank cheque to determine what category of animal means after we have voted on whether or not to include it .
This is very sloppy , very amateur and unacceptable as a way to treat this House .
It is not even a food safety issue .
It is extra bureaucracy and red tape - which is probably why my own government in the UK has supported it .
But it is not in the interests of consumers , nor of the industry and , specifically , it is not in the interest of small abattoirs which would have the greatest difficulty in dealing with it .
I therefore ask the House to support the deletion of category of animal as a compulsory labelling requirement , just as it did on the first reading .
If countries wish to include it voluntarily that is a matter for them .
Assuming we vote for deletion , I would ask the Commission to take note that we shall not be moved on this issue .
So they know what they have to do .
Finally I ask the Commission and the Council to take note that we welcome the principle of labelling beef by country of origin and that we call on the French presidency to set an example by making an immediate commitment to accept all beef so labelled from all EU countries and let the consumer decide .
Mr President , Commissioner , can I first of all say I very much welcome this opportunity to follow the debate on this issue , but quite frankly I think it has tried our patience for a long time and most of us would like to see it resolved as soon as possible .
We have to ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve and whose fears we are trying to allay .
There is no doubt that consumers are tremendously concerned and I think we have to be able to allay that concern so that consumers can feel confident that the food they buy , anywhere in the European Union , will be fully traceable and good for whoever purchases it .
For that we need an effective system of traceability and control that will restore confidence .
I come from an agricultural background and it seems to me that what you need to control is the whole life span of the animal from the moment it is born to the time it is slaughtered .
If you can achieve that then you will go a long way to allaying the consumers ' fears .
You can put in controls that will be so bureaucratic that they just will not work , so we have to concentrate on what is workable .
Categorising beef as steers , bullocks or heifers will not do anything to allay the fears of the consumer .
This is taking foolishness to the extreme and I ask you to reflect and take on board the views of the committee and the view of this Parliament on this particular point .
I am simply pointing out that the Commissioner should not give the impression that there is no room for conciliation on this .
We have room for conciliation and the advantage , if we adopt these amendments tomorrow , is that Parliament would be openly engaged in the final form of this proposal , which otherwise we will not be .
We welcome the fact that this is going to be a great spur to innovation and development and the competitiveness of European industry in the future if it does get through the IGC and onto the statute book .
Following up Mrs Fraisse 's question and your response to that , the borderline must be established as to what is acceptable for patenting and what is not .
In the biotechnology area there is still this grey area .
You purported to have reached an absolute decision on this
