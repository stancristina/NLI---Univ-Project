introduce an ongoing day-by-day flow of consultation and information and , in that way , build a true partnership at work : a partnership that can deliver improved innovation , competitiveness and productivity .
We want to see that true partnership .
We are tired of the linkage of various directives in this package , with the excuse that we cannot look for a review of the European Works Council Directive until it has been further bedded-in and the European company statute is in place .
Yes , we need to establish linkage , but in taking this package now and taking a holistic approach to the need to improve information and consultation for workers .
We believe that if this framework of legislation can be updated in this way , coupled with the new observatory on industrial change , it can give us the tools for a more pro-active approach to industrial change within the European Union .
I would also like to make an appeal to the Liberal Group .
We were given a mandate by this House in January to look at this issue of restructuring in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
We have done that .
We have come up with an oral question and a resolution in a spirit of cooperation .
I would ask the Liberals , in the spirit of cooperation , to withdraw their highly destructive resolution .
It would be helpful .
Mr President , unfortunately it is very timely that we should be discussing these issues today in the light of current examples of restructuring .
As has been mentioned earlier , the Anglo-Dutch company Corus - the steel company - is a classic example of a company making decisions based on profit with no regard to the disastrous social costs of its actions .
Corus has just announced total job losses of 6 000 in the UK - nearly 3 000 in my own constituency in Wales .
Despite months of speculation over possible plant closures the company was unwilling to reveal its future plans to the government , let alone to its own workforce , until the formal announcement was made on 1 February .
There was no prior consultation with the workforce , although since announcing the decision the company has been holding what it calls " consultation " . There is speculation that Danone , a profitable company , is to shed 3 000 jobs in Europe .
Again there has been no consultation with the workers and no discussion about alternative ways forward .
That is why it is so important to adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers without delay , together with a review of the European Works Council Directive and the Collective Redundancies Directive , which incidentally proved to offer so little protection to the Corus workers in my constituency .
Companies cannot be free to wreak such havoc on people 's lives and communities .
There is a positive framework of controls and sanctions which we can use .
We must make sure they are effective .
I wholeheartedly support this report by Mr Dover which aims to improve working conditions for young people in Britain .
It supports the view that the UK falls into line with a 1994 directive which limits the working hours of young people to eight hours a day or 40 hours a week and bans night work , although it provides for exceptions in special circumstances and for certain kinds of work .
Employment , particularly youth employment , is of course extremely important for both our young people and our economy .
We must not do anything to harm the job prospects of young people in Britain .
Sometimes , however , employers take advantage of our young workers and force them to work unnecessarily long hours .
Long hours and difficult working conditions are extremely dangerous and can be harmful to the health and productivity of our young people .
It is therefore vital that working hours are monitored and that employers are prevented from exploiting youngsters at work .
Exploitation is harmful and irresponsible .
We must act to curb it and ensure that our young people are protected from exploitation and its destructive effects by hard-pressed or greedy employers .
The legislation for reducing the working hours for young people already exists .
We just need to make sure that it is used .
The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of these measures .
I find it ironic that the Tories who constantly argue against Brussels bureaucrats interfering and who opposed this legislation , do in fact support this report on social policy .
This illustrates their totally schizophrenic attitude towards Europe .
The Labour Government is at the forefront of providing jobs for our young people and also measures to protect them at work .
I strongly urge the House to show its support for the protection of young people in Britain and to vote in favour of this report .
Savary report ( A5-0016/2001 )
Mr President , as the first speaker from my group , I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur on behalf of all my colleagues who work closely with him .
We welcome the robust way that he has defended the balance of this directive .
As the rapporteur said earlier , with the compromise amendments - the set of amendments passed by our committee - I am sure that we have the right directive at the right time .
No one pretends that it is perfect .
It is important to emphasise that .
There has been considerable difficulty in reconciling national traditions and exceptions .
There are countries that have levies , for example , on recording media .
We have sustained the objective of this directive because , above all , we want to encourage new creative artists to exploit this new technology
