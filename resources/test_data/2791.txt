I welcome the fact that Parliament has responded to the Commission by adopting this report so quickly .
The proposal for a directive was devised in this spirit .
Following meetings held with non-governmental organisations , provisions on secondary school pupils and volunteers arriving in the European Community were introduced into our proposal .
We therefore welcome this proposal , which is another step towards approximating national legislation on admission and residence conditions for third-country nationals , the final goal being to create a comprehensive legal framework regulating admissions on the basis of the reasons for immigrants ' visits .
Finally , I would encourage Parliament to seek a broad consensus in favour of adopting Amendment No 37 , on conditions of access to work .
Nevertheless , since we have before us an initiative on the application of Directive 2001/40/EC , which was rejected due to its lack of a legal basis , we are once again unable , by the same logic , to adopt any stance other than a rejection of this initiative .
Rather , it covers expulsion decisions taken on the basis of national law .
It simply synthesises a vision of Community law , in an obviously tendentious manner , and gives voice to expansionist desires which , though not new either , are no less surprising for the clarity with which they are declared .
I am profoundly doubtful of the usefulness and benefits of this type of interpretation of the application of Community law .
Above and beyond that , moreover , given the exceptional character of MFA , it should be an occasional , short-term and one-off subsidy , in contrast to current practice in several beneficiary countries .
It contributes to promoting intercultural understanding , to the dynamism of training in Europe and to the quest for high standards in education .

Establishing a single monthly allowance fits in with a federalist view of the mandate of an EP Member , by seeking to transform today 's national Members of the EP into future ' European MPs ' .

While FTAs undermine the non-discriminatory principle of multilateralism , as long as they are WTO-compliant and WTO-Plus , they are incentives and complementary models for new global trade initiatives ... ' , putting the EU forward as a model to follow .
( PT ) Recalling what could be called the 'relevance ' of trade agreements concluded in recent years , the rapporteur emphasises that these are also driven by the desire to promote political stability , which consequently makes them an integral part of the Union 's external policy .
By once again imposing the original wording , however , the majority is causing Parliament once again to persist with an approach that I believe to be unrealistic and unacceptable .
Strengthening political stability and democracy ; 2.
Whilst criticising some aspects of the agreements ' content , the EP 's recommendation supports their broad thrust , and so we have voted against it .
I believe that the attempt to impose the State model at Community level does not reflect the current State of the Union .
In addition to the significant adjustments proposed for some sectors , the proposal 's main innovations can be seen in what is known as the decoupling and modulation of direct aid paid to producers .
The essence of this compromise , which I hope will become the position of the European Parliament , is the following : Firstly , to support only partial and gradual decoupling of direct aid , limited to the arable crop and male bovine sectors .
In fact , our position is that aid totally decoupled from production as proposed by the Commission is an interesting model in theory , but poses risks in its practical application and ignores the reality of European farming , the great instability of the markets , which still need border management and protection instruments , and the extremely heterogeneous nature of European farming , in which there are huge differences in income levels and degrees of competitiveness and , consequently , greatly differing effects on the implementation of a decoupled payment scheme .
To conclude , the European Parliament is thereby making its contribution to adapting the CAP to the new needs and realities that are emerging , but is doing so in a way that avoids or at least minimises the risks of production being abandoned , of increased unemployment and of creating further serious imbalances in some farm schemes , particularly in the less-favoured and outermost regions .
It will promote unfair competition between the forms of productions entitled to aid and those that are not and create further hurdles to entering the sector , particularly for young farmers .
What is required is for instruments to regulate the market to be promoted , guaranteeing the maintenance of a price that is fair and that compensates for farm production , for the principle of Community preference to be guaranteed in order to protect the internal market , and for consumer safety and food sovereignty to be promoted , taking account of Portugal 's conditions and specific characteristics .
They form part of States where there is an enormous deficit between milk consumption and production .
Only three-and-a-half million are entitled to direct aid - only three-and-a-half million .
Two areas of production , cereals and bovines , which between them account for 21 % of Community production , receive 60 % of aid ; I repeat , 21 % of production receives 60 % of all aid .
Why have you abandoned the ceiling , Commissioner ?
There could certainly be a problem in the countries they leave behind .
I shall say , first of all , that , according
