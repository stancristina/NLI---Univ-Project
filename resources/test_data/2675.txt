especially with regard to their implications for the accession process and so as to promote their settlement through the International Court of Justice .
It is necessary , therefore , to come up with new instruments to guard against a serious crisis re-emerging despite a high level of internal consumption and good use of export opportunities .
The market in pigmeat is subject to cyclical fluctuations with which economists are familiar , but the duration and the extent of the 1998/1999 crisis was unprecedented and highlighted the way this phenomenon is being amplified .
That is why our rapporteur proposes that the European Union should make a greater commitment by co-financing the regulatory funds .
The Court of Auditors was asked - and a number of speakers have reminded us of this morning - to explicitly name the Member States in which fraud and irregularities have been uncovered .
- I welcome this report by Mr Averoff on a proposal to grant funds to Greece in order to relieve the interest burden on EIB loans for the reconstruction of the Attica region which was devastated by the earthquake of September 1999 .
But we cannot support the amendments tabled by the European Parliament which aim to profoundly upset the balance of the system in favour of the Commission .
Once the vote has been taken , this report on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat will simply add to the tonnes of paper of common agricultural market legislation .
It supports the economic activity of the rural community , often in regions where there are few alternatives .
Historical truth is the guarantor of democracy .
Following the example of the rapporteur , we are bound to admit that Turkey has progressed on certain levels and that there are positive signs .
Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey .
On the whole , our interests are undermined , they are not defended with the necessary force , and the role of the Commission is primarily that of a police officer vis-Ã -vis Member States to get them to apply the binding decisions that have been adopted , sometimes in spite of themselves , in the regional organisation in question .
On the contrary , in all international negotiations in which the European Union is involved , it is important to begin by strictly defining the Commission ' s role , which should by no means be to replace Member States , but to support and coordinate alongside the Member States concerned .
Mr President , I would like to conclude by saying that the Group of the Europe People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is satisfied by the work that has been carried out during the course of the third reading .
The second is the establishment of a Community system to monitor health systems and their capacity to respond to specific needs : the collection of statistics and comparable data ; the development of effective cooperation between the Member States and the pooling of good practice .
It should be the citizens of the European Union who decide the outcome of this social debate and the volume of funds that must be allocated in order to guarantee the fundamental right to social protection .
The same applies to the health of all the citizens of our Member States and the cohesion of our territories .
Lack of investment by Member States and growing health privatisation can only result in selection by money , growing inequality with implications ...
Firstly , the emergence of cases of BSE in cattle born after the ban on animal meal was imposed .
We propose that the Commission and the European Union should thus undertake to extend these tests at a European level , in the light of scientific recommendations .
This very day in Brussels , the experts on the Standing Veterinary Committee at the European Commission have been meeting with a view to preparing ways of extending the European programme for carrying out screening tests on cattle .
As soon as this proposal to set up the European Food Agency was presented by the Commission on 8 November , the Presidency enlisted the work of the Council .
Commissioner , Minister , we must have strict controls in order to guarantee that specified risk materials are separated out throughout the entire animal food chain .
It is therefore urgent that measures are taken to reassure consumers and to restore their confidence in food safety .
The justified mistrust of consumers threatens the entire beef sector and the spectre of ruin haunts our livestock producers and small artisanal enterprises .
Our citizens know - because we cannot lie to people with impunity - that the crisis is serious .
They know that if we are discovering sick animals in France , it is because we are looking for them , as was said earlier .
The results of the European assessment , which were published in July 1999 , suggest that it is 10 to 300 times more sensitive than the three other tests assessed at the same time .
But , faced with the crisis , it is necessary to guarantee health and food protection for consumers and an income for livestock producers , butchers , tripe butchers and wholesalers alike , all of whom are victims of the negligence of the public authorities , at both national and Community level .
Adopting emergency measures and common sense measures by banning the use of MBMs for all species would indeed be a practical application of the precautionary principle !
Production must be improved , and the budget of the CAP must be used to reorganise this policy .
Now , the Community cannot cultivate more than 5.5 million hectares of oil seeds , nor does it have the right to do so , even though our needs are in the order of 18 million hectares .
