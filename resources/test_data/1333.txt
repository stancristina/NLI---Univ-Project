To keep harping on about these aims , for which there is , in any case , no broad support to be won , during the current Intergovernmental Conference is unwise in our view and will contribute to Parliament ' s losing influence .
We have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole because we wish to put pressure on the Heads of State and Government to achieve a good outcome in Nice .
- ( DA ) The Liberals ' five Members of the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Lalumière ' s report on the common security and defence policy , because we are in favour of strengthening the EU countries ' power to act and , therefore , NATO too .
There are nonetheless a number of features of the report about which we have reservations .
Secondly , we are sceptical about the ideas for establishing a proper European space policy , if the intention behind this is for Europe to have a defence system such as that which the United States is in the process of establishing .
Thirdly , there are a number of points in the report which leave one wishing that the European Parliament had more influence in devising a common European security and defence policy .
Further institutionalisation of security and defence policy in the EU is therefore a development that we cannot support .
Nor , furthermore , is it a task for the European Parliament to define what capacity a European rapid reaction force should possess and whether or not it should , for example , include a capacity for intervention by air and sea .
Parliament ' s desire for all Member States to contribute financially to the European rapid reaction force , even if they are not involved in operations , is in our view inappropriate since it could mean , for example , that some countries are involved in a conflict they do not wish to take part in .
In connection with this , it is also important to emphasise that those Member States that are neutral must not in any way be compromised .
We do not consider that an arms build-up , with the resultant increased military expenditure , is the answer to the challenges faced by Europe in 2001 and beyond .
Secondly , the reports set the stage for a split with the non-aligned countries which , it is proposed , would be involved through their financing of the common European security and defence policy .
The introduction of a new form of territorial defence , which would come under the aegis of a Vice-President of the Commission it has also been proposed , is a point that we cannot support either .
What we definitely do not need is the development of further military structures .
Theorin report ( A5-0308/2000 )
Mr President , to begin with I would like to congratulate Mr Maaten on a splendid report .
When I listen to Mrs Palacio and also to Mr Lechner I am reminded most of all of the reports we are receiving from American courts right now .
I believe that reducing the limit values for the tar content and reducing some of the limits for how much nicotine and carbon monoxide cigarettes may contain will have an extremely significant effect on health in Europe .
The secrecy on the part of industry surrounding additives which we have witnessed so far should naturally be brought to an end .
This is also something we must put a stop to in an effective way .
I simply do not understand why a majority here in Parliament want to propose more lenient rules for exports than those proposed by the Member States ' own governments - the governments which , however , also represent the many industries referred to .
It simply cannot be ethically justifiable to act in this way , and I therefore hope that on this point we arrive at the responsible line which I believe the Council and the Commission have proposed .
Mr President , the fairly unanimous message from the President-in-Office of the Council , the Commission and heads of government is basically that the Treaty of Nice secures the framework for the unification of Europe .
These messages contain such huge and monstrous distortions of the truth that we have to go back to history ' s most famous propagandists in order to find exact comparisons .
What has been decided is unnecessary to enlargement , and what is necessary to enlargement has not been decided .
Centralised power and superpower dominance are increasing drastically , as if we had not already had enough of these .
No, it is an extension to the power of the élites and , in reality , the unfortunate agenda for Eastern Europe is , of course , subjection .
The EU does not negotiate with them .
Moreover , none - and I repeat , none - of the crucial problems associated with the enlargement project and involving the integration of incompatible social and economic systems are recognised as problems .
The EU and the EU' s policy are not the solution , but the problem .
If we are nonetheless to vote against this report , it is because we do not believe in the effectiveness of the resources proposed by the report for combating fraud and crime .
It is the very establishment of a form of economic administration at EU level that creates the problems , because those models for redistributing EU taxpayers ' money which have been established by the so-called ' Community ' are poorly designed and in many cases quite unwished for .
