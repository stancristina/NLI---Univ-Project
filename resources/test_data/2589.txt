European Parliament later this morning , refers to something quite vital : preservation of the Community approach .
I think that the motion we are to vote on today demonstrates this new role for the European Parliament : a parliament that decides , a parliament that looks , at all times , for the direction in which the Community should head .
That clear signal should be sent in the new Treaty .
What hypocrisy to say that European women are being defended !
Despite some positive aspects , what is proposed at the IGC is clearly insufficient .
Because it sets out from the premise that the European Parliament and national parliaments both represent European citizens and , as Mr Corbett said , we must not fight in vain , we have to head in the same direction in exerting controls and conducting legislative activity .
I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her splendid work , her practical proposals in which the wishes of the national parliaments are reflected , as they were expressed at the hearing held in Brussels a few weeks ago .
Has it undertaken any initiative in face of the decisions taken by the Chinese National Assembly on the legislation in Hong Kong ?
Please answer that question .
You are in charge of the European Union and you are stopping the European Parliament from having any further powers .
You mentioned measures to be taken by the Council .
You said rather smugly that the European Union has decided to spend 3 million ECU on this campaign .
For these regions , which have the scantiest means of defence , the disappearance of the banana would be like the disappearance of dairy cows in Holland .
It is obvious that if the 15 Member States united their forces , the agreement would be a better one and strike a perfect balance between the United States and the European Union , with neither winners nor losers .
However , the Code deals with equality in terms of women 's and men 's wages , but it is only voluntarily applied by governments , employers and workers ' representatives .
I must say that I am not very optimistic that it will have the effect that most if not all of the European Parliament would like it to have .
It is not right for women doing exactly the same work as men to be receiving 20 , 25 or even 40 % less .
The people 's awareness needs to demand the set of values required by the sustainable development model .
Fourthly , research into the possibilities of global models for the use of energy .
In the joint motion on the disruption of the internal market ( B4-0488/97 ) , my name is missing .
The rapporteur points out in her report that this should not be directed at a few elite youngsters who already have all that information and all those possibilities , but at a wide group .
I am quite convinced that their choice should at least be respected .
That is why I firmly support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the Commission proposal on a budgetary increase for the programme and the need to recognise a legal status for European voluntary service .
I think that it is our obligation to help and support them whenever it is possible for us to do so .
Both the Commission and the Council must act promptly , urgently and efficiently to have the principle of the free movement of goods respected and avoid any further transgression , which is intolerable in any civilized society , and we think that the European Union is and should be a civilized society .
Madam President , one of the regions suffering most from these unjustifiable attacks on Spanish lorries carrying fruit and vegetables is Murcia , for three reasons : the number of its lorries and drivers , the size of its fruit and vegetables production and because exports and marketing are a major activity in the region .
One more year and we are attacking this serious attack on a basic principle of European construction , the free movement of people and goods .
They would be tried and would be sentenced to some kind of punishment .
I am equally convinced that we shall agree to demand , as we are asking in the resolution , the payment of compensation promised by the French Government and that that payment , as we demand , covers all types of damage caused .
We are now in the thick of the IGC and I should like to ask the Commission to make sure not only that something comes of these denunciations but also to urge the Government concerned to make sure that these acts do not go unpunished .
The Commission can and must freeze aids to the French fruit and vegetable sector to put an end to this violence .
What has Europe done ?
Big criminal organisations have never been intimidated by the death penalty and all that has happened is that they have made sure that no witnesses survive any crimes they commit .
This is not the first time that the European Parliament has expressed itself on this subject .
Mr President , I just wanted to point out that this morning my voting card was not in my place and my neighbour 's was there instead .
Mr President , first of all and not merely out of politeness or custom - I must congratulate Mrs Fontaine on the work she has done on a text which has an extraordinarily light touch .
And company law is not the same in Britain for example as on the continent .
Mr President , I shall retain only one point from the speech I had prepared and that is to congratulate the rapporteur on her competent work .
