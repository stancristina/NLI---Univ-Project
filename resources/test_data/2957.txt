medium-sized enterprises in particular .
It is not surprising that the whole of industry is rallying round Mr Manders .
Mr President , I insist on congratulating Mr Manders as I think that he has performed his task admirably .
May I perhaps say - Christian democracy being the midfield defender incarnate in my country - that very many things would not have happened without voluntariness .
The same applies to pedestrian safety .
At the moment , however , we are still seeing different Member States giving conflicting travel advice about the so-called infected areas .
The Council of 6 May called on the Commission to continue to coordinate the EU 's action in respect of SARS and to consider developing a plan concerning a general preparedness for transmittable diseases and public health threats .
What would we have done ?
What should we do about these ?
The second is to reinforce and accelerate scientific research into preventing and fighting such diseases .
Our biggest shortcomings relate to the first method ; containing the spread on a global scale .
Mr President , SARS may not be a cause of hype in politics , but it certainly is for our citizens .
The second thing that I regret is that it has been agreed not to take any additional measures to check everyone leaving an aircraft , because that would be a false security .
In this regard I note that the Commission did in fact already have this competence through that sixth action programme .
Unfortunately no other conclusion is possible at the moment .
We must also have joint travel advice because there certainly is something the matter .
Cases of SARS have also been discovered in Greece and Finland .
I am really hoping to be able to persuade Mr Dover not to extend the health insurance scheme to former Members .
Once we have a European Statute , it will be a different matter and then we can talk about it again .
In view of the forthcoming enlargement , Parliament will have to apply itself to its core activities more than ever .
I have the impression that it varies somewhat from one language to another and is certainly not proportional to the number of Members who speak a language .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her explanation and I should also like to say that I am very pleased that we are able to hold this first debate on the budget that affects the new countries in the presence of the observers from these new countries .
When I look at the guidelines adopted by this Parliament in March during the vote on the standpoint of the Parliament , then at first sight the Commission has acted wonderfully well in accordance with those guidelines .
As the Commissioner has already said , a great many parts of category III must be determined under the codecision procedure .
We have noted that there is a 1.4 billion margin in the budget .
Strengthening of border controls , the position of Kaliningrad , attention to nuclear safety and so on and so forth .
In all categories , in all policy areas , we see a steep increase for buildings .
But what I find more interesting is the background against which this raid took place .
Look for example at the reactions of Mr GÃ¼l , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , and Mr Cicek , the Minister of Justice .
Is this not once again the so-called deep state , with its generals and pashas , that rumbles through everything , as it did with the attempts of Prime Minister Erdogan to find a solution to the Cyprus problem , the restoration of the ban on HADEP and the continuing detention of Mrs Zana who , as a Sakharov prizewinner , has very special symbolic value for us ?
I think that it must also be made clear to the Turkish public where we stand , that there are conditions attached to accession and that whenever there is a violation it will be said over and over again that we do not accept that , so that the deep state knows that in the European Union there is no future for its way of thinking and acting .
Everyone has said how important the cooperatives in the different European countries are and it is also very good of course that we can bring about a European Statute for them .
At the first opportunity it abuses its position again !
I regret that the Commission has actually rejected all the amendments to the Regulation , and do not think they have been sensible in doing so .
This Parliament learns , but not always .
A second aspect is the link with regional policy .
There is also no European regulation on taking bicycles on the train .
The UN weapons inspectors are the only ones who can demonstrate that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction , but they are also the only ones who will very probably demonstrate that Bush and Blair were wrong when they started this war because there were supposed to be weapons of mass destruction .
That is not the Common Foreign Policy that my group has in mind .
The war has been won by the few , but the peace can only be won by the many .
The food stocks of Iraqi families are totally exhausted .
But only the UN can end the sanctions and in particular open the door to substantial international contributions and judge with authority whether the new Iraqi Government is truly representative .
I should like to hear what he has to say about this .
To combat this injustice the 'polluter pays ' principle was developed long ago , but businesses continue to exert pressure to undermine it as far as possible
