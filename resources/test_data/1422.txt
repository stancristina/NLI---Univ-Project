A survey in Britain reveals , for example , that only 5 % of accidents involving the self-employed are reported , compared with half of those involving wage earners .
The Commission must therefore be commended for raising the issue .
The self-employed must not be able to freewheel when it comes to the EU rules on the working environment .
We should , however , have liked the Commission to have looked at some of the amendments that try to make the recommendations more binding .
I am aware that there is no basis in the Treaty for doing this .
Perhaps the Commission should be called upon to table a proposal on the subject to the Convention that is currently at work .
- ( DA ) Mr President , I have been asked to make a statement entitled 'Preparation for the European Council meeting in Brussels on 24-25 October 2002' .
As we know , the agenda will be dominated by the important topic of enlargement and also , in this connection , the subject of Kaliningrad , in which the European Parliament has of course taken a great interest .
Therefore , the important thing is for the European Council to reach as many decisions as possible , so that as little as possible remains to be done in Copenhagen .
At the European Council meeting , the Chairman of the Convention will inform the European Council of the status of the Convention 's work , and the President of the European Parliament will also speak to the European Council .
The meeting with the President of Parliament has become an established tradition which I know is valued highly by Heads of State and Government in the European Council .
Bearing in mind the agenda before us , it will of course be particularly interesting to hear the views of the President of Parliament on the issues the Council will be discussing , that is , enlargement , and also the related subject of Kaliningrad , which I shall come back to .
It is very convenient that the discussion with the President of Parliament is taking place immediately before the working meetings on enlargement and Kaliningrad .
I now wish to say a little about enlargement .
It must be decided which of the candidate countries will be able to conclude accession negotiations this year .
On the basis of a comprehensive evaluation of the progress of each individual candidate country , the Commission concludes that 10 countries will be able to meet all the criteria by the start of 2004 , and on that basis it is recommended that accession negotiations be concluded as planned here this year .
Decisions are also to be taken in Brussels on the outstanding issues in the accession negotiations in connection with the financial package .
The European Council should also take a decision on the matter of the net position of the candidate countries in relation to the EU budget , and agreement has been reached as to the basis for these calculations .
The European Council in Seville concluded that the EU 's positions concerning the outstanding , financially onerous , chapters will be presented to the candidate countries at the beginning of November .
That means that the Brussels European Council must take decisions on these matters if the timetable laid down in Seville is to be met .
The Danish Presidency will insist on this , and so the meeting must go on until a solution has been found .
It will require a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone concerned , but a solution must be found .
The matter was discussed in Seville : the Commission was asked to study the possibilities for an effective and flexible solution to the question of transit ; a solution which would be in conformity with the acquis and would have the agreement of the candidate countries concerned .
This has been discussed twice in the Council , and it was also discussed here in Parliament only last week , on 15 October .
Over and above the principles on which the Seville mandate was based , the EU has emphasised Lithuania 's sovereign right to control its borders and to reserve the right to refuse entry .
The Council has agreed to give Lithuania a guarantee in that respect , and ultimately the Council agrees that Lithuania must be compensated for any additional expense arising from a solution to the transit question .
This is a solution which entails many problems of a technical , economic , legal and political nature .
The EU has not , however , ruled out examining the possibility , and the Presidency will continue to work towards a solution which satisfies all parties to the greatest possible extent and can win the support of the European Council .
The guidelines I mentioned here were followed at yesterday 's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg .
This is the EU 's position , and it seems to me , therefore , that the 15 governments have prepared themselves as well as possible for the discussions which are to take place at the European Council meeting in Brussels , and also for the subsequent talks with Russia which are to be conducted by the Presidency , and which will culminate in the EU-Russia Summit in Copenhagen in November .
Helping the work of the Convention along is an important ambition of the Presidency 's .
The number of proposals is rising , the mounds of paper are growing , and it seems to me that we have been witness to an extremely exciting debate on the future of Europe , both in and around the Convention .
In the shape of the Convention , we see for the first time - and in the full glare of publicity - something as extraordinary as a genuine debate across European borders .
As a rule ,
