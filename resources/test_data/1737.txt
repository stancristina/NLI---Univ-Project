I would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments in this regard .
We also reject quotas and a ceiling for this production , as this would limit the possibilities to develop diversification and employment possibilities in disadvantaged regions .
We also believe there should be a balance of support between farmers and processors .
The rapporteur , Mrs Schierhuber , has agreed to put a limit of EUR 600 per hectare to farmers directly , provided that the farmer proves to the competent authorities , within 18 months after having applied for the subsidy , that he has delivered the fibre to a processor .
We also agreed if this proof could not be provided to the competent authorities within that period , the subsidy should stay at the level of the premia for set-aside land .
I congratulate the rapporteur and call on the European Parliament to support the Agriculture Committee 's report .
Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for her handling of what is a very complex matter where both producing and non-producing Member States have serious reservations regarding the Commission proposals .
In very broad terms , I welcome the Commission proposal to bring flax and hemp into the arable area payments scheme .
A single area payment is in line with the view that growers should respond to market demands rather than be driven by CAP subsidies .
However , I shall not repeat the many reservations about the proposals that colleagues have already mentioned .
We should note that flax and hemp are environmentally-friendly crops .
Compared with mainstream crops such as oil seeds and cereals , they require low levels of chemical and fertiliser treatment .
They also produce renewable raw materials that can displace synthetic fibres derived from petroleum and other mineral resources .
We should welcome , therefore , the expansion of industrial crop activity and the opportunities provided for diversification .
However , I wish to raise the question of land eligibility , which appears to be a particular problem in the UK.
Most of the flax and hemp grown in the UK is on land ineligible for arable area payments .
The Commission proposals , as I understand them , threaten the UK growers and would leave UK processors with no domestic supply of raw material .
It has been suggested that the land eligibility rules should be disregarded for flax and hemp so that any land could be used for those crops , but without an increase in the base area .
This would allow expansion , should market conditions encourage growth , and allow new growers to enter the market .
It would be helpful if the Commissioner could comment on this matter when he responds to the debate .
Mr President , I also warmly congratulate the rapporteur who has shown enormous commitment to this report .
We thank you very much for it .
We are clearly in a very serious situation .
The regulation for South Africa expired on 31 December 1999 .
It is clear , as the rapporteur has suggested , that we need to proceed with some urgency in order to provide a legal base for our essential work in South Africa .
This budget line is the work of the European Parliament .
I was the budget rapporteur in 1994 when the Development Committee established the line .
That was because we wanted to see practical and tangible assistance for South Africa 's peaceful transition to a free and democratic country .
Surely that has been one of the most encouraging events in recent history .
Now the Republic , with its new President Mr Thabo Mbeki , faces new challenges which , in my view , require sustained partnership with the European Union .
This is not the time , as others have suggested , to have the kind of mean-spirited delays that we have seen from the Council ; neither is it the time for political point-scoring by other institutions of the European Union .
Indeed , it is my view that the Council has rather cynically orchestrated the eight-month delay in response to the first reading in order that it could better manage its negotiations on the South Africa trade and development agreements .
This has put life-saving programmes at risk and any delay now would exacerbate the existing impression in South Africa of a European Union which seeks only to serve its own interests first .
Coming as this does after ouzo and grappa , we are in danger of sending a very bad signal to South Africa .
Decisions need to be made .
We cannot risk delay .
For example , I am very familiar with the South African Human Rights Foundation .
That would be endangered .
The Foundation for Cultural Initiatives programme , the South Africa Labour Development Trust , policing in the Eastern Cape - all these programmes would be very seriously threatened by delays .
If there is delay , if agreement is not reached on the regulation , then new programmes will be affected too .
Even the 2000 budget of EUR 1.54 million would not be committed .
Let us be clear what we are talking about .
We are talking about water and sanitation programmes which do so much to improve the quality of life of people in the townships and rural areas .
We would endanger the SADC HIV/Aids Programme , regarded by all as being one of the most efficient the European Union operates .
We risk jeopardising economic developments in the Eastern Cape and work in the Eastern Cape with the Ministry of Education .
We risk jeopardising support for social housing programmes in South Africa .
In this Parliament we have to make every effort now , as the rapporteur has said , to make it possible for this money to move as speedily and as efficiently as it can to the people
