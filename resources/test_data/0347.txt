In order to obtain background information for my report , I sent a bulky questionnaire to a number of regions in each Member State .
The first is the increase in effectiveness and results .
The regions feel the financing provisions are complicated , partly unclear and open to interpretation , although the aim has certainly been otherwise .
Management and its follow-up must be flexible and proportionate to the size of the programmes or projects .
The n+2 rule for financing must be kept in force .
The Court of Auditors has also criticised the complicated practices associated with the Structural Funds and called for simplification and better results , and this has also been the Commission ' s aim , although there is still much to be done regarding this both by the Commission and the Member States .
The Member States have not been able to forward their documents on time , and the Commission was slow to process documents .
In this way there would be more preparation time for both the Commission and the regions and the sort of delays that are occurring at present would not arise as we move into the next programming period .
The Commission should review and clarify the rules for compliance with additionality so that this principle would also apply at programme and regional level .
The fourth conclusion of the report is more effective evaluation and monitoring of the Structural Funds .
Parliament should have open and transparent channels for obtaining information and arranging follow-up .
My colleagues also tabled amendments regarding the content , which in themselves were worthy of support , but fell outside the scope of this report .
The measures to achieve economic balance have been insufficient : they have been heading in the right direction , but they have been insufficient .
Additional costs resulting from difficult conditions , for example in island regions and mountain areas , must be compensated for with combined efforts and precisely defined regional policy measures .
Furthermore , the sharp disparities in unemployment rates and structural problems must be taken seriously in planning regional structural policy .
Aid action under the Structural Funds must also be better coordinated with national employment targets .
For example , extremely sparsely populated areas , long journey times , and cold and hot climates mean additional costs , which will also be there after enlargement .
Whatever the case , it is important to have improved coordination between the various forms of aid granted out of the funds available .
It is important to ensure that all the Union ' s resources are spent effectively , and that includes the most remote regions .
We have to ensure together that the whole area of the Union is included in the single market and derives benefit from it .

We have also had some experience of it in Finland , which became involved in the programme while EU membership was still being negotiated .
We are very pleased that Finland is of interest as a destination .
Every year we receive more than 3 000 foreign students .
The respondents stressed the importance of study in a foreign country , above all with regard to personal and social growth .
Finland earned special praise for the excellent facilities in its universities and colleges , particularly computers and libraries , as well as for the study guidance provided and student halls of residence .
The report under discussion pays particular attention to the processing of applications and the flow of payments .
With regard to this , I would , if I may , draw everyone ' s attention to Parliament ' s role as a provider of guidelines .
While , on the one hand , we insist on greater efficiency and flexibility , we might , on the other hand , be increasing bureaucracy and making it take longer to deal with matters .
Now it has to fill out as many as one thousand eight hundred separate payment orders .
Therefore , a small rural university in Finland , for example , has to embark on a costly procedure for the sake , let us say , of two minor projects , even though , under our laws , the State Audit Office will perform the same task in any case .
Mr President , I first wish to thank my Swedish colleagues , Göran Färm and Per Stenmarck , for their excellent reports .
This means that the budget should not include unnecessary appropriations and that economy should be a feature of financial management .
Proper budgeting leads to a decrease in payment arrears and promotes the implementation of budgeted programmes .
In the year 2000 , EUR 8.5 billion in appropriations were unused , and last year the amount was as much as EUR 12 billion .
The Commission is unable to implement those areas of policy that Parliament has held to be important and for which it has authorised appropriations .
For that reason our group not only supports budgetary discipline but is also strongly in favour of the Commission 's programme of reform .
Accountability and result-oriented management are the key words here .
There are special requirements associated with enlargement .
In this regard our group also believes that the appropriations connected with enlargement are absolutely crucial .
Mr President , my thanks go to the rapporteurs : you have completed an enormous task .
