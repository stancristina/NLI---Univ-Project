and both Germany and the Czech Republic in actual fact sent 170 generators to Sweden .
Aid from the structural funds can be provided within the framework of the current programmes and , if the production potential both of agriculture and of forestry has been damaged , aid can also be provided for re-establishing and introducing preventive measures within the framework of what is possible in terms of rural district policy .
If the Swedish authorities wish to request aid from the Solidarity Fund , I would recommend them to approach my colleague , Commissioner Hübner , who deals with this specific area .     – The fact is that what we have here is not , of course , an isolated case .
As the questioner puts it , it is of course the ultimate crime , moreover , to use this information contrary to the interests of suspects .
We may therefore expect the Council to adopt a basic position on these problems without wrapping them up in waffle about matters being taken into consideration .
This is a most fundamental issue .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
First of all , my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Maštálka , for his work in drawing up this report on promoting health and safety at the workplace .
This is a great waste , of both human and economic resources .
This is money that could have been used instead to promote employment and create more and better jobs : a clear objective of the Lisbon Strategy , which aims to make the EU the most competitive region in the world .
The EU has already presented a number of directives on health and safety at work , and this legislation is working .
Yet the common framework directive from the EU is not enough .
The accession of ten new Member States to the EU presents us with a great challenge as regards the creation of a good , safe working environment in these new Member States .
We need a greater focus on prevention and implementation , something that is also proposed in the report , and , in this connection , we need a detailed survey of the specific situation in the new Member States , too .
It would be useful if the Commission were to draw up a report on this .
It would also be a good idea for evaluation reports in future to focus more on evaluating the degree of practical compliance with legislation by the Member States .
We must pay special attention to the situation in small and medium-sized enterprises .
It is very important , then , that the Commission take appropriate steps both to give a structure to the work on safety in businesses and to stimulate the social dialogue on the working environment out in the workplace .     – Mr President , I too should like to thank the Commissioner for emphasising that , in line with the Lisbon objectives , Europe should be competing on the basis of knowledge and not on the basis of poor wages or environmental destruction .
Separating scientific and sociological research when drafting the Seventh Framework Programme has , however , in actual fact put sociological research into budgetary competition with technological research in relation to the IST programme .
Socioeconomic research in the information society is a precondition for our achieving this objective .     Mr President , thank you for giving me the floor .
Over and above Parliament’s rejection , expressed by the President , I should like to ask whether there are further initiatives the President has considered taking in this connection .
If the President could come up with an offer of further initiatives , that would be very helpful .     Mr President , I will begin by saying that , in innumerable areas , the report contains congenial positions , and there is no doubt that it is incredibly well intentioned .
However , the problem with it , of course , is that it completely skates over what are the real problems in the European economy , and I am puzzled that no questions at all are asked as to why things are really going so badly .
Why does the United States have , on average , a 40.5 % higher gross national product per inhabitant than we have in even the richest part of the EU - 15 ?
The European economy is moving too slowly because we engage too little in research and development .
Only 63 % of all people of working age are in the labour market .
It is no good sharing out poverty , as this report proposes we do .
Try looking at the figures for my own country , Denmark , and you will see that it has succeeded both in implementing a socially aware policy and in creating growth .     Mr President , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance welcomes the GSP Agreement , but still has major concerns .
Regrettably , the majority rejected a number of the NGOs’ amendments – which the Greens supported – with a view to extending the number of countries entitled to aid .
This means that EU taxes to the tune of more than EUR 200 million per year are now imposed upon the tsunami-hit country of Indonesia .
In actual fact , it looks as if the great spirit of self-sacrifice in the EU countries has been converted into old-style EU protectionism .
We want this agreement to be extended to all the countries that comply with the sustainable development criteria , irrespective of their size .
Will the Commission please tell us when we are to obtain the proposal ?
For example , another country hit by the tsunami , namely Sri Lanka , is affected because its clothes production only constitutes one link in the manufacturing chain
