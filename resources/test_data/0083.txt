into Europe , however high the continent builds the walls at its borders .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who helped to put together this report .
Mr President , migratory flows , from both within and outside the Community , cannot be stopped , even if politicians would like it that way .
We are living in times of demagogy , populism and fundamentalism , and it is , accordingly , the job of Europe and the Member States to pursue policies aimed at integration .
Mr President , I shall now turn to good practice .
On a visit to Hamburg I was able to see how this system has been successfully applied to state schools .
It is this view to the future that forms the basis of my report .
According to the 2005 UN report , the number of children dying every month due to poverty is equivalent to three times the number of victims of the tsunami that hit South East Asia in December 2004 .
Yet the gap between rich and poor continues to widen .
There are around 70 million poor citizens in the Europe of 25 .
It is high time we made a clean break from neoliberal policies and the guidelines of the European Central Bank .
Whilst counterfeiting rates remain high , measures taken to combat forgery are bearing fruit .
It also remains a fact that , in geographical terms , the country is right in the middle of Europe and the EU.
The measures put forward seek to protect the overall interests of the fisheries sector .
This issue of fisheries is of vital importance to my country and , even though this particular case does not relate directly to Portugal , I read this report with great interest , because I feel it is essential to protect the species and to look after the interests of this sector , which plays such a crucial role in a number of Member States .
I should also like to stress the importance of this proposal to the development of fisheries in the Baltic , with particular regard to maintaining fish stocks .
In each country , a network of interests could be set up between the agencies , the Member States , the institutions and the economic powers , with the aim of establishing assessment criteria that favour the best possible assessment of their own institutions and harm those institutions and teaching systems that are not up to the mark .
Implementing these systems represents a major step forward towards the mutual recognition of university qualifications in Europe , something that we very much wish to see .     .
The report does boast some balanced points , such as establishing ‘trade links with China in a spirit of cooperation and complementarity , while ensuring that the two parties can maintain and develop harmoniously their industrial , agricultural and service sectors in order to guarantee the best possible living standards for all their inhabitants’ .
The idea that the flow of goods from China is somehow going to dwindle is an illusion .
I should like to make two recommendations to the Commission .
The second recommendation relates to matters outside the EU.
Defeat is a bitter pill to swallow , but losing because your opponent has broken the most basic rules of the game is disgraceful and unacceptable .     .
The resolution adopted today is a further effort in this vein , but the time has come for questions to be asked as to whether this is the only way forward , and whether it is necessary to broaden the international alliance in order to force Iran , using the weapon of diplomacy , to honour its international obligations and to respect minimum standards at national level .
Lastly , let us take action , first and foremost , in the name of our principles and our populations .
This report confirms a number of the objections that we have made , namely : - the failure of the European project in its attempts at achieving the highest standards of education and the failure of the education system in various countries ; - the productivity crisis in the current economic and social fabric , which is reflected in employment and in inappropriate performance-related pressure in the education system .
Hence our abstention .     .
Short-, medium - and long-term measures are required if we are to rectify this situation .
Kant rejected this notion of tolerance , which in fact does not allow for the perspective of putting ourselves in other people’s shoes , which is the perspective of justice .
The teaching of language is the most basic prerequisite of human communication , of citizenship and of the awareness and exercise of rights .
The reasons for this are twofold : firstly , and most importantly , because the rewards for breaking the law act as an incentive for illegal immigration and for the networks profiting from it ; and secondly , because illegal immigration itself overstretches our ability to integrate .
I voted in favour of the Pack report on new challenges for the circus as part of European culture .
That being said , I cannot help but question whether this is the kind of debate expected of the European Parliament .     .
We might look into additional Community aid , for example , to support the building of affordable housing .
On a practical level , the urban issue is treated on the basis of the precautionary principle within regional policy , within the framework of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
I therefore voted in favour of the Beaupuy report .     .
This report is the new Europe’s first dealing specifically with poverty among women
