Mr President , before we move to complete the vote on Mr Duisenberg , I would like to ask you if Mr Duisenberg is here to declare his respect to the European Parliament when we vote on our position on whether or not he is appointed to the European Central Bank .
Is Mr Duisenberg present ?
Since I voted against this recommendation and the meaning of the recommendation , I wish to justify my position , because I realized that Parliament had made a parliamentary ...
Perhaps this is the role of Parliament , perhaps this is what we did with Political , Economic and Monetary Union in other eras .
Both at Amsterdam and in the Treaty there is the notion of external borders , the notion of the integrity of the European Union and there is the notion of mutual political solidarity .
If all this exists , why this apathy ?
The gentlemen of the Council did not manage to agree on the President of the Central Bank , making a mockery of the euro before it even gets off the ground .
The only thing that matters to them are the interests of banks and bankers .
I do not want to disappoint you .
He is driven not by personal criteria but by criteria of class .
Naturally this poses a question : will this European Union not have a defence policy ?
And one last point , since a lot has been said about Mr Milosevic...
Let me settle with him .
Mr President , during those days when 56 Foreign Ministers and Ministers of National Defence - 56 ! - from 28 European Countries , 10 of which are Members of our Union , took part in the celebratory sitting of the Western European Union under Greek presidency in the beautiful town of Rhodes , two American envoys , Mr Holbrooke and Mr Gelbard , went back and forth between Belgrade and Pristina in a desperate attempt to find , between Serbia and Albania , some treatment for the bleeding wound of Kosovo .
In the multi-paged text of conclusions which was given out yesterday the many ministers of the WEU expressed , among many other ambiguities , their own concern and their readiness to promote a realistic and clear approach to tackling the problem .
It is quite the opposite with the on-the-spot visits-cum-forays of the American envoys .
At exactly the time when we are welcoming the inception of EMU and the establishment of the euro , the long and faltering march towards the OSCE , the vagueness concerning the incorporation of the WEU as an arm of defence , despite the wishes of Maastricht and the minced words of Amsterdam , are restrictive burdens which inhibit the integration of Europe .
It is an immediate priority .
It reinforces the intransigence of extremist Albanian organizations who only aspire to independence and prevent a realistic approach to the problem by the moderate forces of Albanians in Kosovo , who are in the very large majority .
To conclude , I have two observations for the President-in-Office .
Does the President-in-Office regard this as a constructive position for Albania ?
I understand and respect the fact that questions must take place , but you must tell us when we will talk about Kosovo since it is not possible - and I have been in the European Parliament for 9 years - to strike off speakers who have been announced and who have been approved by the party .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , from your answer I gained the impression that the issue is not being faced with the attention its seriousness demands .
I also think that few markets are as dangerous as those of video games .
I wish to express my concern and make a protest , since we did not have the time to examine more questions .
I would like to ask a question which is not simply rhetorical but fundamental : if I consider that my question is timely and serious and , given that its debate has been adjourned for this specific reason , can I bring it up again at the next sitting ?
This is a policy - and you , Mr VicePresident of the Commission , have said it yourself on many occasions this morning , and I agree with you - which faces problems , mainly due to the fact that there are flashpoints in the important area of the Mediterranean .
I direct this remark to the Council .
It is not enough to complain about the fact that problems exist .
We must put forward proposals and these proposals can be put forward .
These are countries which are important factors in peace and stability in the Middle East .
We must find the right way to combat it .
Nevertheless , in Algeria it is being sought , in the Western Sahara it is absent , in the Middle East it is essentially a spectator , and in Cyprus it is politically downgrading its original constructive involvement .
It is not possible to have issues extended , in this case the problems of India , and for us , who have been registered by our groups , not to be able to speak .
I think - and I address myself to the Council , which is naturally not listening - that we should at least protect Mr Gonzáles , a very successful Prime Minister , from being appointed representative and intermediary , and the two sides should not deal with each other and make contact through Mr Gonzáles , but operate via the American intermediary .
Words are not necessary , nor is the deception that is being perpetrated against the European Parliament on the part of the Council .
However , it has taken three whole years to arrive at today 's debate .
How can there be
