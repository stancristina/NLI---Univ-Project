a resolution proposed by our committee to plenary emphasises the importance of the European Development Funds to the European Union 's contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals , with the primary objective of eradicating poverty .
Another matter we refer to is that , as regards the funds managed by the European Investment Bank , which are not audited by the Court of Auditors or controlled by the European Parliament within the framework of the discharge procedure , we consider that it would enhance transparency and efficiency if information were provided and included in the reports of the European Investment Bank on the European Development Funds .
Finally , we wish to enhance the visibility of the European Union 's external action .
Several Member States signed the memorandum of understanding , as the rapporteur said , and I am delighted that my country , Greece , is one of them .
Simply learning a 'lingua franca ' is insufficient and fails to reflect Europe 's true identity .
The purpose of the indicator is to measure the proficiency of European citizens in foreign languages in four linguistic skills : reading , comprehension , speaking and writing .
The addition of Polish as the sixth language , at the initial phase , is something that will be determined by the budget , if of course it is feasible .
However , they may be included within the framework of the strategy on multilingualism on which the European Parliament is preparing a report and with which they are more in keeping from the point of view of content .
In many countries foreign language learning tends to mean simply learning English .
Mr President , Commissioner , proficiency in at least two foreign languages should form part of the basic set of skills of a typical European living , studying , working and generally circulating in the European Union .
I cannot close without mentioning the living example of multilingualism and its importance which we find in this House .
The Black Sea turned red .
Observers at the time said that there were squares piled with the heads of innocent people .
On the contrary , the other day it coerced the French parliament into withdrawing the Armenian genocide bill and three days ago in Vienna Mr Erdogan embarrassed the Greek prime minister because we want to acknowledge the genocide of the Turkish Greeks .
At the same time , however , the governments and the Commission itself should make the corresponding moves , so that we can all , if nothing else , give children the minimum human right to bread and water without the need for them to debase themselves body and soul .     – Mr President , the period of reflection expires in 2007 and I imagine that it is for this reason that the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , presented the Commission 's position last week .
To close , I believe that it is our duty , as an institution , to dedicate at least one more sitting of the European Parliament before the cut-off date of 2007 to debate this most serious issue .     – Mr President , in the procedure to rekindle interest in the ratification of a European constitutional treaty , it would perhaps be useful to correct the text so that it supports institutions which have created and highlighted the particular character of European culture and the European economy .
Apart from equality between men and women , apart from the rights of children , the difficulties encountered by every family during its creation and development need to be recognised , because these are the main reasons for Europe 's demographic problem .
This regulation should , above all , aim to make consumers more aware of the importance of a healthy , balanced and harmonious diet .
In many rivers , eels migrating upstream for spawning have fallen by over 95 % .
However , we propose the following : the measures taken must not be fragmentary ; they must be scientifically proven and must be taken in cooperation with fishermen .
However , what is important is the final finding on the matter in question .
The Europe whose borders we do not know ?
The Europe which has no foreign policy , but is led back and forth by the Americans ?
The Europe with no energy policy ?
Talk to me about a single electoral system !
Consequently , we are not one Europe with a future , because for one country , one nation , one union to have a future , it must know what it is and where it wants to go .
Fortunately , however , we received a lesson yesterday : a lesson in patriotism and culture from an Indian , Mr Morales who , of course , escaped the ethnic cleansing we Europeans carried out in his country .
Unfortunately , however , we spoke little about the context and , by contrast , we allowed a school of thought to burgeon that the problem was actually in the text .
Unlike the text the context has become more and more problematic over the last year : we have a series of laws that increase anti-terrorist cooperation .
The new Marco Polo II programme provides many opportunities in this direction .
It gives new room for intervention in small - and medium-sized enterprises , something in which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has often expressed an interest .
To close , I thank the rapporteur because , with his proper handling and negotiations with the Council , he made it possible for us to have an acceptable text which we believe will quickly be put into practice .     – Mr President , Commissioner , road freight transport in Europe has increased enormously over recent decades and will increase by more than 60 % by 2013
