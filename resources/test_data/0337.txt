administration .
Besides some form of labour reform , we also need a complete administrative reform , which has already got off to a good start with the White Paper on administrative models .
As you , yourself , said a couple of days ago , our esteemed competitors the United States and Japan are further along the road of promoting and developing innovations than the EU ; one of the reasons for this is that in those countries enterprise and risk-taking are rewarded to a significantly greater degree than in Europe .
Enterprise can be promoted early among schoolchildren and students .
It is a significant factor in innovation .
Even before this , in the course of my work I have stressed the importance of adopting a Community Patent which will cover the entire area of the European Union .
We must create conditions which make it possible to produce a whole raft of new ideas , out of which we may perhaps develop that one breakthrough innovation .
New technology is not the key to a good future ; we need non-conventional thinking in all fields , in firms as well as in public administration .
Madam President , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Finnish language programmes have been removed from Parliament ' s television network .
Could I request the President to ask those concerned to correct the situation , as it is odd , particularly during these times of crisis , that one Member State ' s programme signal should have been removed from the television network without any explanation .
That is why economic policies to create confidence will perhaps have an unparalleled impact on the behaviour of consumers and investors , and , hence , on how long the period of slower growth will last .
Now , after the Federal Reserve ' s drop in interest rates yesterday , all eyes are on the ECB.
It is no good waiting .
Firm commitment on the part of every country to the Stability and Growth Pact will create just the sort of confidence the pact itself seeks and the economy now needs .
Switching to the euro will mean slightly increased costs for all points in the production chain .
They should not be used for scaremongering and thereby increase inflationary pressures .
Mr President , I would like to ask the representative of the Council what the general timetable is for deciding to establish planned agencies such as the Maritime Safety Agency and , in particular , the Food Safety Agency , and is the intention to take the decision on all of them in one go or separately for each agency ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like first to thank my friend , Karla Peijs , for her excellent report , in which she aptly describes the vital importance structural reform measures have for the prosperity of our societies .
The public finances of a State in the euro area are no longer the private affairs of that State .
Many governments in recent years have relaxed their budgetary efforts , relying mainly on cyclical receipts , such as the proceeds from mobile telecommunications system auctions .
Member States must honour the commitments of the stability and convergence programmes unconditionally .
It will take perseverance and determination to balance public finances .
Nevertheless , this is what we have to focus on .
Simultaneously , the potential for economic growth has been weakening throughout this period .
Only in this way can we achieve the ambitious aims of Lisbon .
The report draws specific attention to the triangle of poverty , health and education , no part of which can be ignored without action in the other two areas coming to nothing .
Poverty has sometimes been compared to war : it takes prisoners and it kills .
I therefore also want to remind our Member States of the 0.7 % target , to give some credibility to our calls for altruism in the pharmaceutical industry .
In any action taken , however , it has to be borne in mind that , without viable basic health care , no other developments are possible .
No matter how fearful the prospects of communicable disease are , making us feel a spontaneous need to take specific action as a consequence , it should never be done at the expense of basic health care .
We should bear in mind the Copenhagen Social Summit pledge to attain universal and equitable access to primary health care .
She took part today in a peaceful demonstration at the nuclear weapons base at Faslane , Scotland , and was arrested at eight in the morning along with twelve Irish students .
Quite recently , the International Court of Justice has stated that the possession of weapons of mass destruction contravenes international law .
Mr President , we are currently debating a directive which concerns participation by the public in decisions which affect the environment .
The report has , however , also stirred up some political passions .
It must be possible to find a balance between , on the one hand , guaranteeing broad opportunities for participation by citizens , and , on the other hand , avoiding deliberate and vexatious delaying tactics .
The vote taken the week before last in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy led to an unfortunate and illogical conclusion , which must now be rectified in plenary session so that we can correct a situation which is embarrassing from the point of view of the Parliament 's reputation .
I stated that information gathering and public hearing concern the entire public at large , but I limited the legal safeguards following the decision to a more restricted public , in other words those whose rights are infringed by the decision
