are concerned , and this is why my group will be giving Mr Sylla 's report its unqualified support .
I refuse to believe that .
Politics , and therefore a government , is never neutral .
I would refer in this connection to the shameful statements made by some of his group colleagues during the debate on Cuba this morning .
I should even like to shift the focus in some cases .
This is with good reason .
Access to drinking water and proper sanitary provisions are fundamental rights of the population .
After all , this is the best guarantee for democratic legitimacy .
In other words , standards not just for working conditions , but also for animal welfare and the environment .
Restricting production is a useful tool in this regard and must be recognised as such by Europe in Cancún .
Today we talk of a socially corrected market with attention to social standards , the environment , consumer protection , respect for intellectual rights , etc .
These constraints must be a permanent factor in the inclusion of less developed countries in the world trade system .
Since China has resolutely pursued the path of an open economy and has engaged in the world trade system , the results have been spectacular .
That is not perfect , but things are moving in the right direction .
I cannot repeat it often enough , and Mr Deva has also used the example : for a fifth of the poorest people in the world , the amount that this European cow receives in subsidy per day is more than they have to live on each day .
Apart from agriculture and medicines , the core of the Doha negotiations , the trade in services will also be on the agenda in Cancún .
Social democrats are in favour of public services remaining in government hands , a public responsibility of government control .
We are also sure that the Commission can take action in this direction .
Attention is focused on these three diseases .
If the disease is not treated , then the parasite moves from the blood to the brain .
Failure would have destroyed confidence in the ability of the WTO to have a development round to tackle the injustices in the world trade system .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , at the moment , some 40 million people speak a regional or minority language in addition to one of the Union 's official languages .
In 2001 , the European year of languages was particularly intended to draw attention to the importance of languages , to language diversity , and to stimulating language teaching .
Deaf people are often excluded from many areas of society on account of their disability .
It is an important directive , and thanks to the Commission 's regular reports , we are gaining a clear insight into its functioning , which enables us to prepare well-considered proposals for a possible revision in future .
Excellent children 's films have been made in Europe .
In a united and , soon , enlarged Europe , it is important for us to be aware of this cultural diversity .
I should now like to ask you whether this is still possible .
It should read as follows : starting with complete freedom of movement .
( NL ) Respecting and safeguarding the linguistic and cultural diversity in Europe is an honourable objective .
.
The language of this latter group is still not being recognised within the EU , unless it happens to be the same of that of the neighbouring country .
To what extent has Cuba as a country and the Cuban population over the past 40 years had a reasonable chance of developing its own policy ?
This turned me into a supporter of Fidel Castro even before he took over state power at the end of 1958 .
It is a pity that Cuba should unnecessarily isolate itself from its friends in Europe .
India is an open , tolerant and pluralist society in which religious freedom forms part of the constitution .
Anyone who does draw this distinction need not make a forced effort to keep religion out of political debate .
It would be sensible simply to recognise this .
Oppressive dictatorships were backed for fear of mass rebellion .
In the Basque country in Spain , a newspaper and a popular political party are banned , and the results of elections are heavily doctored because the excluded political grouping cannot in any way put forward candidates .
This illegal and incorrect practice nevertheless remains in place .
Also , Mr President , Article 79 of the Association Agreement between the EC and Israel stipulates that in the event of possible non-compliance with this Agreement by one of the parties involved , both are required , via the Association Council , to reach a mutually acceptable solution .
Hindus fear Muslims and Christians , particularly demographically speaking .
The European Union should also look into this issue .
India is , moreover , the only country in southern Asia that has opted in favour of a secular and pluralist state model .
She has been held illegally for more than three months , during which time she has gone on hunger strike .
Mr President , on this European Car Free Day we discover that the direct train between Brussels and Strasbourg has been abolished .
.
Suggestions were made , and I think that the Commission worked quickly and well in this case .
We are also asking for clear management structures - and this is very important - for safe have ns .
Either we have to take them out of service if we think that they are dangerous , or , if we think they are still OK , we must check them very thoroughly to establish whether they are in order or not .
