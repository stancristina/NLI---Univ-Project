to do with its causes but which are suffering considerable damage .
Commissioner Kinnock can take this opportunity to launch such an ambitious policy .
We want these degenerate and unscrupulous criminals and traders in child abuse to be identified , punished and obliged to undergo specific treatment which prevents them from reoffending .
We must therefore apply the principle of extraterritoriality .
Mr President , the issue that we are addressing today represents one of the greatest scourges that modern society - and above all , of course , the public authorities , including the European Union - must tackle .
Along with the specific promotion of information campaigns aimed at families and professionals in the education , health , legal and tourism sectors , therefore , we must not neglect the introduction of measures of a general social nature which reduce the possibility of criminals finding their perfect prey in conditions of poverty and social marginalization .
And I wish to say , as an aside , that we must work harder and with greater imagination to prevent such cases , to protect children in the private sphere .
This report seeks to step up the measures to ensure that children can live without fear and develop freely , with their rights and freedoms being respected .
I am able to inform the House that Spain has already begun to modify its penal code along these lines .
Nevertheless , I am pleased to affirm that we have established as priorities the conservation of resources and the maintenance of employment in the fisheries sector .
It is important that the report states that fisheries must be treated as simply another sector of economic activity .
It calls for alternatives to be found to the restructuring of the fleet , as well as for economic support to alleviate the latter 's socioeconomic consequences , which may seriously harm local communities .
Are they afraid that women might use legal instruments to demand equality and defend themselves from discrimination ?
Mr President , the common position represents a step forward in the elimination of discriminatory practices in so far as it recognizes the difficulty of proving the many subtle forms of indirect discrimination in judicial or extrajudicial terms .
The main problem is that commitments are not a good indicator of the percentage of implementation , since payments only amount to 44 % of commitments , and less than half the funds allocated to the Phare programme since its inception have reached their final recipient .
The demand made in Mrs Kjer Hansen 's report for a six-month deadline between the commitment of funds and the signature of the relevant contract could be one way of ensuring transparency and preventing the abuses that are currently observed .
Mr President , everyone is aware that the Phare programme is the principal instrument of financial support for the pre-accession strategy .
I welcome the fact that the Commission is talking about concrete reforms to tighten up programming and financial management .
Although this may shock us adults , because when we were born there was still such a thing as distances , borders , and so on , young people today regard it as normal and part of the world we live in .
Lastly , Mr Sainjon asks a question which is perhaps the key to understanding relocation : are globalization of trade and relocation of production in the developing countries responsible for the rise of unemployment in Europe ?
As the Commission and Council have pointed out , it has to be taken into account that we are talking about a sector in crisis , and that compliance with certain of the proposed measures would be too onerous for owners of existing vessels already facing all sorts of serious difficulties .
A book recently published in the United Kingdom states that it is an objective of my country , Spain , to be generating 800 megawatts in wind power by the beginning of the coming millennium .
Indeed , the committee - and naturally our group - rejected that amendment , which seeks to eliminate the concept of energy production from urban waste , after serious debate .
In short , Mr President , we believe that these and other amendments have helped to enrich Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz 's excellent report , and we hope that the Commission will accept them , so that they can form part of the final decision on which the Altener II programme will be based .
In fact , this change was already applied before 31 July of this year , and consists of the fact that a maximum of three vessels belonging to the quota for the second year has been transferred to the quota for the first year , so that what was formerly a distribution of 25 and 40 vessels has become a distribution of 28 and 37 vessels for the first and second years respectively .
Logically , therefore , Parliament should approve these four changes to the fisheries agreement with Mauritania , which benefits the Community fleet and will be in force until July 2001 .
This is a prerogative of the European Parliament which must never be renounced , and compliance with which means giving greater power and control to the people and , ultimately , guaranteeing the European project .
In view of the lateness of the hour , Mr President , I think that instead of making a full analysis , it would be better , taking advantage of the presence of the Commissioner , to tell a story , like a tale from 1001 Nights .
Apparently the Chinese have a technique - I do not know if they learned this from Confucius or Lao Zi - whereby their vessels sweep a given area fishing simultaneously , so that , after a few sweeps , there are no fish left and there is no possibility of fish in the future
