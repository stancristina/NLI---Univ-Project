In Spain this is known as institutional filibustering and is tantamount to hoping to arrest the progress of the vessel of the European Union and there are two words behind this - one is subsidiarity and , paradoxically , the other is globalization .
I fully agree that we could obtain much more for the money which is to be spent .
I therefore think that the subsidy provides some compensation for diminished use .
However , the improvement noted in the Objective 1 regions of the four Cohesion States - Greece , Ireland , Portugal and Spain - must be stressed .
I shall not mention which those States are , but for four of them the Commission says that it has no data and only incomplete data for the other three .
Finally , we reaffirm our confidence in decentralization as a method of managing the Funds , although it is appropriate to point out that the current system has an inherent contradiction , since , whilst the management of the Funds falls in almost all the States upon the State , the responsibility for that management falls almost exclusively upon the Commission .
That means that budgetary surpluses remain for allocation - and these might be very considerable - and we shall therefore have to decide how to use these amounts for the benefit at least of those States which have been the most assiduous in implementing the Structural Funds .

In our opinion it is an error , and we know we are in a minority in the Parliament , to strain national budgets to make social policies , just as it was to punish large deficits with curious sanctions which run counter to the traditional concept of the redistribution of wealth .
As regards the second objective - providing the Union with the means suitable for a more effective foreign policy , we think there was too little political willpower on common foreign and security policy and we would mention trade policy , where Article 113 dealing with trade policy became totally bogged down .
No-one thought two or three weeks ago that it would be possible to conclude the draft Treaty in Amsterdam .
This is something pointed out previously by the chairman of the Socialist group and I think that we must have moved further forward in the field of creating a European legal area because , when the acquis communautaire of the Schengen Agreement is incorporated in the European Union , we might find ourselves in a situation where , since there were no national frontiers , a person might commit a crime in one country with no border checks then enter another country .
I think that the most fundamental duty of the Commission is transparency before the Member States and if the institution over which Mr Santer presides thought that the Community laws - including the judgments of the European Court in Luxembourg - could be interpreted as by Mr Santer , that opinion should have been put before all the Member States and not merely before one - and within the framework in which the problem had arisen .
I repeat my concern at the excessive weight and veto of the Member States in the decision-making process , the modest progress in the role attributed to the Committee of the Regions and the limitations now in existence for the development of European policies in the field of external relations , justice and domestic policy , even within the scope of economic and monetary policy which is absolutely necessary and essential since we are to have an internal European market and the prospect of Economic and Monetary Union and a single European currency .
Myopia ruled the day .
The extension of voting by qualified majority and of policies governed by the co-decision process is another key political barometer .
It would be impossible to understand the scope of the Treaty of Amsterdam without mentioning that its birth was preceded by the ratification of the irreversible launching of the single currency .
In my view , reducing or postponing question time merely detracts from the importance of this dialogue between Members and Council representatives .
I therefore feel Mr SÃ¶derman is to be commended on his report and on his work and that Mr Papakyriazis is to be commended for his interpretation of it which has enabled us to give the report our unanimous approval in the Committee on Petitions , and I believe that the report will also be unanimously approved in this part-session .
The agreement with Mauritius has also benefited from this arrangement between the Commission and Parliament .
I am referring to questions as to whether the agreements are to be used only by Spain and Portugal .
Mrs Larive rightly states that the control measures - i .e . restrictive measures - adopted by the host country are , in principle , contrary to free movement .
The national regulations of the other fourteen Member States should be harmonized so that such consumer protection extends right across the internal market .
I would , however , request that Mr Funck , whom our committee has appointed to present a report , be allowed to give the House an informal oral report , under paragraph 5 of Rule 97 of the Rules of Procedure .
Yet , however questionable this exclusion of moral issues may be , it appears more questionable still to claim that - from the standpoint of consistency - the public interest is being defended when , in reality , legal instruments are being created which enable the industry to claim that it has invented natural processes and the circumstances are such that industry might gain a total monopoly of control .
The Commission 's new proposal has not attempted to examine such wider social implications or explore alternative forms of intellectual property rights which reward genuine innovation without guaranteeing the monopolistic
