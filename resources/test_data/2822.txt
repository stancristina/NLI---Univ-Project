I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee .
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text .
In particular , I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon , the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks .
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13 .
This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish , whether diseased or not , from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold .
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold .
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway .
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective .
In Norway , with their much longer experience , compulsory , 100 % culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation .
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread .
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA .
This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission , security measures to curtail escapes , treatment of waste and effluent , methods of detection and diagnosis , farrowing and rotation , disinfection of equipment and many , many more .
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers , others will be incorporated into codes of practice .
All will be beneficial , not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required .
Your votes , colleagues , in favour of my report in full , as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee , will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland ' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others .
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise .
As he said , fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years , the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend .
Now , as he said , in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually .
Regrettably , although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago , it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another .
Wild salmon , trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment .
But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens , it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans , and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said , that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species .
It can , nevertheless , in the affected fish , lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures .
So this report , Mr President , provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease .
By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling , similar to the system used successfully in Norway , the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence , not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter .
By recommending the research , development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA , the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine .
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Hudghton , also for this report .
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90 % of the British aquacultural industry .
The industry is located in some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities .
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence .
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical , realistic and
