I have to say that I feel particularly proud , because almost ten years ago to the day , with the help and support of President Martens , President De Clercq , who is still our colleague , and President Spitaels , as President of Parliament , I made the first proposal that was given form in Article 138 of the Treaty , now Article 191 , in which , in agreement with President Lubbers , we succeeded in having the political parties incorporated into the Treaties .

Mutual recognition , which is also based on the principle underpinning the European Union , namely mutual trust between States , which is in turn based on the Member States providing an equivalent level of protection of human rights , and in which they are seen to share the same procedures .
