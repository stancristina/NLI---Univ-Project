It is still more difficult , and takes a still longer period of time , to re-build a country , and that much longer again to get people to begin to trust each other once more .
We must ensure that we are involved and make our contribution so that the Iraq of tomorrow is a still better Iraq .
The reports of terrible violence and of terrorism directed against women , children and civilians – mainly Iraqis of course , but also foreign journalists , aid workers , business people and military personnel – are alarming .
In common with many other countries in many other parts of the world , we are split on the Iraq issue , and this has meant that we have only been able to agree upon a fairly watered down resolution .
We have a role to play when it comes to supporting the election , the economy , the construction of a civil society and the devising of a democratic constitution .
It would be better if those countries with which the EU signs fisheries agreements were instead given assistance so that they themselves could develop their own fisheries .
We do not accept Amendment No 7 by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , whereby the Commission would be given an independent source of income .
Stability in the real economy and , thus , employment therefore presuppose instability in the budget balance .
This step is being taken because large and powerful countries failed to meet the demands made in the Stability and Growth Pact .
The problems are now diminishing for countries with high structural budget deficits such as France and Germany , but increasing for countries with high public debts such as Italy , Greece and Belgium .     Mr President , I should like to begin by making one point : let us look to what is really important in the European economy , namely that we now have low inflation and low interest rates throughout the European economy .
It has put political pressure on those countries that increase their deficits and , for that reason , it is of interest to us all , irrespective of whether or not we have the euro or of whether or not we participate in monetary union .
The solution does not lie in change but in reform of the European economy .     At least ten countries are to hold referendums on the Constitution .
The EU institutions must support the people and democracy by being neutral in what they have to say and by matter-of-factly pointing out the changes in respect of previous treaties .
Portugal is said to have at least 20 000 illegal abortions per year and to have some of Europe’s highest figures for teenage pregnancies .
Women have rights over their own bodies , and the right to sexual and reproductive health is part of the Convention on Human Rights , ratified by all the EU countries .
The exemption invoked is that of national security .
Finally , Portugal has broken its promise to the EU , other Member States and the European people when it comes to the freedoms of movement .
I thus wish to call upon both the Commission and the Council to take clear action on this issue without delay .     Mr President , as all my fellow MEPs know , women have had the right to vote and the power to take decisions concerning themselves and their assets for more than a century .
In addition to accepting responsibility for their own lives , women have had responsibility for their children’s lives too .
The action taken by the Portuguese Government is not only a declaration of women’s incapacity but also breaches the European Parliament’s resolution to promote information campaigns concerning sexual and reproductive rights .
I do not usually go in for conspiracy theories , but I cannot refrain from reflecting upon whether the action taken by the Portuguese Government does not in large part have to do with the fact that it is precisely women and women’s own organisations that are at issue .
I should , however , like the Commission to clarify the position to be adopted by the EU in these negotiations with regard to two points .
Can we rely upon the EU doing everything in its power to oppose the holding of secret ballots in these votes ?
I wonder if we can rely upon the EU also supporting the demand for a zero quota for export .     We do not consider this report to be an issue for the European Parliament and have therefore chosen to abstain in the vote .     We Swedish Social Democrats have decided to abstain from voting on a number of amendments .
If this cannot be done , there will be insufficient impetus for pressing ahead with the European project of unification .
It also makes demands of our ability to operate in an international context .
I believe that the European Union must also develop a policy for the Middle East that dares to get to grips with the problems that Iran now presents .     Mr President , the situation in the Middle East appears to be one of complete deadlock .
The question is that of whether he is the man who can lead Israel to peace .
I do not believe that these gentlemen can bring about lasting peace in the Middle East .
We have made so many plans , had so many conferences and meetings and held so many debates in this House , but nothing happens .
We must consider having a practical international presence in the region that can supervise the withdrawal from Gaza and perhaps also remain there in the longer term
