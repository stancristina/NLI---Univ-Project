polar icecap had decreased by 40 % in just a decade .
We are acting on the international scene by encouraging countries on the outside , such as the US , to sign up .
The trade in emissions rights is one such instrument .
The trade in emission rights is thus one of the instruments we will need in future .
Neither the Council nor the Commission have wanted to meet the European Parliament halfway in our demand for the directive to include products as well .
For some obscure reason , the Commission and the Council have not wanted to accept this , despite there being scientific evidence .
I would have preferred to see a proposal for a ban as early as 2002 , but we have not been able to get that far .
We cannot wait any longer .
We wish to emphasise that , at present , we consider cooperation through Eurojust to be the preferred form of prosecution cooperation within the EU.
Mr Vitorino knows as well as I do that we are concerned here with a framework directive .
Because the European Parliament has significantly weaker decision-making powers than it ought to have where framework directives are concerned , I would take this opportunity to draw attention to this deficiency , as I also did in the case of the point raised by Mr Vitorino when commenting upon the amendment .
They have obtained access to digital circuit-breakers , which means that electricity and water can be switched off and transport brought to a halt .
We are concerned here with cross-border crime .
It may also put an end to the type of 'legal shopping ' , which we cannot of course encourage , in which criminals have the option of being sentenced in countries that have lower penalties .
I think that this is a proper approach .
Human rights lie outside the jurisdiction of the Court .
That is something I should obviously like to see right now .
I hope , however , that a new constitution will mean our sorting out these issues and really being able to obtain a legitimate system .
I want to conclude by thanking all my fellow MEPs .
That is something which Mr Vitorino surely understands , and I hope that he will help exercise this pressure .
In many countries , the shortfall in funding specifically for medicines is quite large .
This time , I believe , however , that it would be important for the Commission to follow up trends in medicine prices , taking into account differences in different countries .
This may provide us with very valuable information on various restrictions .
Monitoring information would allow us to keep better track of how much money is being used in this sector .
Finally , I , like Mr Rod , stress that I am glad that the effect of medicines on the environment will also be taken into account .
They have been a great help to many patients .
Today , everyone with access to the Internet and with sufficient linguistic ability can find out about treatment principles and information on medicines .
Finally , a comment on Mr Rod and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance : Your proposal for double testing of medicines is not just poor but could even be dangerous .
In spite of this , I believe that it is vital for moves and travel across borders within the EU to be made easier for families and individuals who are travelling with a pet .
Therefore , it is necessary to adapt the health rules for transporting pets for commercial purposes to this directive .
However , we have voted against Parliament 's amended proposal .
Transparency must lie at the heart of creating a common stance within the EU on immigration and migration .
The opportunity for foreign citizens who are not refugees to immigrate to Europe as migrant workers should be expanded .
As Swedish liberals , we see European integration as an opportunity to solve cross-border problems such as the environment , trade , movement across borders , human rights and conflict management .
Here the democracies of Europe have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .
It must be clear to all citizens that the EU will only tackle issues about which it is most expert , that is cross-border issues .
The proposals should not just apply to actors and dramatic artists but to all occupational groups .
Mr President , let me start by thanking my colleagues , particularly those on the Committee on Budgets , and the Committee on Budgets ' secretariat .
I would like to begin with some fundamental reflections on the EU 's budgetary system .
We have been able to tackle a number of points ourselves by improving the internal work of Parliament itself .
This year we have come further than before , not least when it comes to the traditionally problematic section on what are known as the A30 grants to various European organisations .
Despite these improvements I am still not satisfied .
During this year 's budget process we have already received proposals from the Commission on use of the flexibility instrument in three cases .
Now , however , we have to ask ourselves how many such flexibility instruments and how many ad hoc solutions we will need before we realise on a wide front that the entire budgeting methodology needs reforming and to become more flexible .
Note that I am not looking to abolish the budget ceilings .
This is an important area which I hope we can continue to discuss in the years ahead .
I would now like to mention a more general problem before going into the various budget headings , namely the implementation of the EU 's budget
