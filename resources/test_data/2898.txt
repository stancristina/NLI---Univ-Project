the European People ' s Party and , after you had twisted the arms of Parliament ' s largest group , Mr Poettering obviously did not think he had any choice .
Is it a sign of European democracy in the future , not to have any choice ?
I will not be in a position to support this form of democracy .
It is being said that we are getting a strong Commission , stronger than the one which is now bowing out .
There are a lot of positive things to say about this .
Twisting the arms of the European Parliament ' s politicians , steamrollering through ideas such as common defence , common taxation and a common policy on social benefits ( which , into the bargain , it is recommended be reduced ) ; bulldozing policies like these through , irrespective of how the populations in Europe see things .
The previous speakers did not think that all this was symptomatic of what future co-operation would be like .
Promises were given at the Conference of Presidents .
This sits ill with the requirement that the Commission be endorsed in the one go : either every single member or no-one at all .
I cannot recommend a "yes " vote .
I shall recommend saying "no " to the proposed Commission , and this for political reasons but , first and foremost , for democratic ones .
It is with growing concern that I have heard the President-designate of the Commission ' s , Mr Prodi' s , remarks about the role of the Commission .
The aversion to a federalist Europe is , of course , due to the fact that EU countries are generally much better at solving their own problems in accordance with their people ' s wishes than an overpaid officialdom out to lord it over the continent .
We all know that it will , at best , be a very big task to bring the Commission ' s ponderous and high-handed bureaucracy up to the standard we require of public administration in our home countries .
It has been disgraceful to hear a number of Commissioners dismissing the need for quite elementary changes which in fact are a prior condition of stamping out the scandalous states of affairs which characterised the previous Commission and a number of earlier Commissions , and which have turned the EU' s administration into a caricature of an accountable democratic administration .
If the Commission does not take full responsibility and exercise complete authority in connection with the whole administration , then any talk about proper administration is just empty words , and I am certain that Mr Kinnock , like most of us , is used to better things at home .
There are a number of people from my group who have talked on this matter .
Personally , and on behalf of the group I represent in Denmark , I have to say that I cannot vote for the Commission .
The first is that the political programme which has been put forward promotes a degree of integration which goes far beyond what there is a mandate for from 80 % of the Danish population and , what is more , from the populations of the other Member States .
The EU is to make its presence more keenly felt across national borders , and , to an extent , that is a threat to our nation states .
As we know , this was the scandal that was uncovered in connection with the first report by the Experts ' group this spring .
However , none of this even enters into the equation .
It is especially scandalous that someone like former Commission President Delors ' right-hand man , who was responsible for setting up the criticised security services , should have been waved through this Parliament without so much as having to answer a single critical question .
Madam President , the members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group intend to vote against this motion for a resolution .
The main reason for this is that the resolution aims at introducing a legal situation which goes beyond the EU treaties in force .
It will not be possible to stop organised crime , the trade in human beings , money laundering and terrorism just through co-operation between police forces if , at the same time , the doors to the free movement of people between EU countries are opened , both for EU citizens and everyone else , and certainly not if controls on the EU' s external borders are weakened , as will inevitably happen when the EU is enlarged .
The solution is not to use resources in a non-prioritised way to move poor countries ' populations to Europe , but to employ resources for the purpose of exporting European development to poor countries .
The motion for a resolution is devoid of any reference to these central solutions , and it is aimed solely at promoting federalist development in the European Union , a form of development which a majority of the population in my country , Denmark , dissociated itself from in the 1993 referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam .
There is one paragraph in the motion for a resolution which I have a lot of sympathy for , and that is paragraph 7 b , in which the criticism is made that the texts to be decided upon within the context of the Schengen collaboration have still not been made public , in spite of the fact that they have been Union law since May of this year .
This is the only paragraph which can be supported .
Under cover of the concept of an area of security , peace and justice , what we have here is an enormous leap forward in the development of the Union .
