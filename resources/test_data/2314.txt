In February I proposed - in vain - that the funds used in land purchase should be set aside for public structures , as in our view , public money should not be used as private real estate capital , even under the guise of environmental protection .
Does this mean that the institutions are to adapt spontaneously or that the European Commission and Council will be able to operate with 20-21 members just as they do with 15 and , empirically speaking , solutions will be found ?
As regards the flexibility of the second pillar , perhaps you will allow the presidency to take the Intergovernmental Conference in hand , which it will do following the ' General Affairs Council ' next Monday , 10 July .

Lastly , the motion for a resolution was not put to the vote following the adoption of a motion of non-intervention , on China ' s initiative .
The commitment expressed by the countries of the region to implement reforms and generate the right climate for sustainable economic progress lies at the very heart of the Pact .
The Council noted that the United Nations Security Council , in its Resolution 1302 , invited the UN Secretary General to appoint independent experts to draw up an in-depth study on the humanitarian situation in Iraq .
Similarly , the policy observes the obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty with regard to those Member States who consider that their common defence is provided within the framework of NATO , and it is compatible with the common security and defence policy established within this framework .

I believe I have already answered the questions relating to the maintenance of sanctions and the assessment of the situation .
No one is saying that Austria has been expelled from the European Union , something I stressed earlier .
At the same time , these measures were adopted by 14 Member States on a political basis , and we are , of course , continuing to act on a political basis while once again fully respecting Austria ' s rights as a member of the European Union .
Mr President , I shall endeavour to act on your good advice .
