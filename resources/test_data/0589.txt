complete power over cultural heritage , namely agricultural policy .
However , the main criticism from both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control concerns the extra bonus which the Bank ' s employees received over and above their normal bonus and which substantially exceeded both the maximum levels set and the budgeted costs .
The methods for deciding about this additional cost were also criticised .
We are also pleased that the ECB now recognises that OLAF must be able to carry out internal audits .
Secondly : the type of bonus system discussed is quite usual in the banking world , but the levels of bonus allocated in this case and the way in which the system was dealt with genuinely merits criticism .
On the contrary , the Bank deserves substantial credit for the well-managed transition from EMI to ECB.
Instead , the EU' s contribution to the Palestinian education system should instead promote peace and reconciliation in the Middle East .
I can speak from personal experience , having spent 25 years commuting between Denmark and Sweden .
The alternative recommended by Swedish politicians is the OECD model for frontier taxation , which advocates that tax should be levied in the country of residence .
However , a model such as that , too , would require some form of fine tuning in order to create an entirely fair situation , for these are complicated issues .
However , the fact that progress has been slow does not mean that nothing is happening .
I believe there is a lot to be learned from this .
Obviously , the Member States have prime responsibility , both financially and legally , but , for the EU' s part , it is important not only to legislate and to collect funds - good though these activities obviously are - but also to publicise the many good examples there are and to use its own financial resources to encourage sound development .
The work must therefore continue and , in the present situation , the directive ought not to be changed or reviewed .
This revision incorporated the provisions of the 1989 Basle Convention on movements of hazardous wastes into Community legislation .
Furthermore , the provisions of the Basle Convention did not apply in the 1980s .
Thank you for your answer .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is well aware that people have died and been injured as a consequence of fires - a fact it deeply regrets - and we express our sympathy to the relatives of the victims .
Improved fire safety within the Community , especially fire prevention , is a high-priority issue in the programme of Community measures in favour of civil protection .
In close cooperation with the Member States , the Commission is also assessing the consequences of the Council ' s recommendation on fire safety in existing hotels .
There may still be certain weaknesses when it comes to coordinating fire safety issues .
Obviously , a good deal of progress has nonetheless been made in this area .
Just like the public , they are , in fact , affected more and more by cross-border factors .
Firemen have to work with ever more vessels , vehicles and products from countries with which they are unfamiliar and whose levels of fire protection they are not used to .
I interpret the Commissioner ' s statement here to the effect that there is now just such a coordinating working party as a step in that direction and , that being the case , I should just like to thank her for her answer .
However , it is not entirely easy because we are also dealing with states of affairs which differ considerably from one country to another and in which systems are often devolved to the greatest possible degree to local level .
A lot can be improved now that we have a civil protection division , specifically with overall responsibility of this kind .
We therefore have a plan involving increased opportunities for the Commission to , for example , arrange joint exercises for emergency services and contributions to civil protection from different Member States .
Where is it to be found ?
We also have to coordinate our emergency teams .
I should like to thank Commissioner Nielson for his answer and for the efforts being made on behalf of all refugees specifically in the Molucca Islands where the largest group is de facto Christian .
On Christmas Eve , a large number of coordinated bomb attacks against churches - including the cathedral in the capital , Jakarta - took place at a variety of locations in the Indonesian archipelago .
In November of last year , representatives of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) and of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) visited Kosovo .
The EU countries which take part in these missions do so on the basis of national decisions .
In the interests of the greatest possible transparency on the issue , views are , however , being exchanged within relevant consultative bodies .
This is a natural part of a crisis management organisation ' s activities , and work of this kind is being done both within NATO and the WEU , as well as within the UN.
Through the Commission ' s aid programme , the EU is offering support to the countries of the region in their efforts to get to grips with their environmental problems .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , during the meeting held in Pyongyang between 25 and 27 November of last year within the framework of the political dialogue , the European troika emphasised the most important parts of the European Union ' s strategies towards the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea - strategies which had been approved by the Council at its meetings on 9 October and 20 November
