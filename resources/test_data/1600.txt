In the case of Kosovo we have borders within the framework of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
From this viewpoint I think that assurances of a border commitment would help the Yugoslav government to make the necessary moves .
These are the five countries which feel more intensely than any other country that a conflagration in that tormented region would destroy in the Balkans the peace that has succeeded , with so much bloodshed , tears and horrific losses , in gaining a foothold after the partition of Yugoslavia .
Anything else would throw lighted torches into the powder-keg of Europe .
Fewer and fewer working people are supporting more and more pensioners .
What must we do ?
There must be increased participation of the private sector , increased personal responsibility of the insured person for the amount of their pension , and increased capitalization of the current system of redistribution among the generations , which , under today 's conditions , does not seem to be a very efficient solution .
Third , we must at the same time promote a policy to increase the birthrate .
I promise on my part that in future I personally will do what I can to help find a solution to the demographic problem .
It is a report which , in my opinion , is accompanied by an extremely important and substantiated explanatory statement , which sheds a great deal of light on the issue .
The amendments do indeed complement a second generation foundation which was only created in 1995 and which , in a short time , has demonstrated the value of its creation and of its work .
By definition , this cooperation is structural and powerful .
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Titley , Mrs Hoff and Mrs Mann on their excellent work and I will just make a few comments .
Such an issue cannot be debated fully if it is not accompanied by a European Union policy with respect to third countries .
For Ukraine to play its part it must be given special assistance in this area .
Consequently , violations of human rights and basic freedoms , which constitute a virulent rejection of democracy , are unacceptable in European Union cooperation .
However , it introduces two important parameters into the operation of MEDA.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy unanimously requests its approval .
It also has a fundamental significance which goes beyond this .
Consequently , in these circumstances the European Parliament has both the right and the obligation to intervene in the process .
I agree as far as it goes but there is another side to the issue .
Mr President , I would first of all like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism on their initiative in encouraging the European Parliament to deal with tourism .
Consumers are rarely informed of their rights and , more importantly , they are often misled about the services provided by inaccurate advertising and conditions of participation in package holidays .
The proposed transparency of the services provided and of prices , which must be offered to travellers , is of course vital , as well as the total reimbursement of costs should the organizer become insolvent or bankrupt .
I agree with his recommendation to postpone the discharge , and I also agree with the reasons he gives in his report about why that should be done .
Or if you will , what is Parliament worried about ?
In my view , the issue ought to be tackled by adding something to the interinstitutional agreement between the three institutional bodies , which as we all know , happened in the case of the investigative committees .
All this , of course , is related to the issue of the UCLAF 's autonomy , a body which has been successful so far .
Mr President , the report is a good one because it is moderate , if I can say that ; it considers the issues in light of a real situation that exists in the area of the EU 's economic interests that are being affected , as we have seen recently .
The authority must exist , ladies and gentlemen , because - and I speak as a practising lawyer - the Commission cannot arraign any Member State .
However , the UCLAF itself must put its house in order and , mainly , adopt practical measures that will enable it to deal with the problems .
One of those measures is that its staff must not be bound by the employment conditions applicable to Commission employees .
I believe we talk about globalization every day , we talk about the world society , about the global village , and we must finally grasp the fact , declare and demonstrate what we mean by it all .
I think the great debate that began in the world - and I am being literal , not exaggerating - with this Conference must represent an opportunity for the EU to adopt a responsible stance , to claim the role it rightly has in world society and demonstrate , by its own example , what it is capable of and what it is doing .
Commissioner Flynn , I consider that the EU now has a real opportunity , with Parliament 's support , and I should like to hope that Parliament will express that support unanimously , without small-mindedness and without counting the pennies .
Despite what some speakers have said , I believe there is agreement that , on the one hand , aid from the private sector certainly distorts competition and reduces efficacy , but on the other hand too , nobody can pick up a blue pencil and strike it out entirely , and the Treaty
