capacity and heightening the efficient use of the day .
When EMU begins , the public sector will also come into its own in terms of employment as t will be working on the issues of balancing out trade levels and other problems that come along .
That is why the public sector should be higher up the agenda than it is .
Madam President , for the first time in European history we have a golden opportunity to create an employment strategy for this part of the world .
The council , on the other hand , got involved only quite recently , in accordance with harmonization policies , after necessary political changes in Member States ' governments took place after elections .
The Commission 's concrete targets have been criticized , because they are hard to measure .
Job creation is the keyword .
There is obviously a limit to the EU budget , but good use must be made of all the benefits of structural funding and the European Investment Bank .
In the market economy , taxation is also an effective way of controlling supply and demand in the labour market .
The criteria for the employment programme must be as plausible as those for EMU, and the Luxembourg summit must produce the criteria for both .
Mr President , I also wished to speak to explain why I eventually voted in favour of this report .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this report although , unfortunately , during the debate in this Chamber Mr van Velzen 's report declined in value .
However , I consider it important that Parliament has clear aims on employment and the shorter working day to present to the summit conference .
Although I voted in favour of the report as a whole , I do not subscribe to the notion of creating low-paid sectors , which is included in the Liberal amendment , and was approved by a majority in Parliament .
The improvement in the employment situation is the main principle behind the budget .
The most important innovation is the new employment initiative , which , hopefully , will achieve statutory status .
It might also be worth explaining the possibility of utilising interest subsidy loans .
This has been approved but the important thing is that the ECU 1 billion that the Council cut be restored to the structural funds .
The administration of the EU special agencies is still unclear .
For this reason , their administration procedures should be clarified .
The other problem is heading A-30 - " Community Support Measures ' in administrative expenditure .
This part of the budget should be made clearer .
Mr President , at the moment Europe is experiencing deflation , and that is the wrong way to go about preventing unemployment .
That is what Mr Tillich meant when he said that Parliament has done its homework and its housework too .
This is the feeding of the five thousand .
But that was then , and I do n't think it is going to work this time .
Let us turn to Mr Tomlinson 's report .
He refers to defence aid for a European political defence machine , and he has changed the bases for parliamentary appropriation so that it can be used as aid for a general European defence machine .
I get , after paying all my expenses , ECU 12 , 000 a month cash in hand salary and expenses , and that is much too much .
Mr President , is the fact that the Member States have approved the Community 's directive on public procurement only a question of paying lip-service ?
Last year the Commission was obliged to deal with 148 matters concerning complaints against the Member States .
This is only information about when nothing has been done .
I cannot help feeling an urge to adapt Machiavelli 's saying about the relationship between morality and law : ' Without morality there is no law ; without law there is no morality . '
There are more cost-efficient ways of implementing what we have agreed on in the Union .
It would increase the risk of serious economic consequences , as the Committee on Legal Affairs also suggests .
I share the view of the rapporteur , Mr Tappin that it is possible to combine these rules .
That is the most important part of public procurement for the benefit of the citizens .
Mr President , public procurement form a really important part of our financial activity .
I 'd like to mention , for example , that many local authorities have begun to implement the long-term development strategy , Agenda 21 , and they really strive to implement ecological criteria in their own areas of activity .
They may also have importance for the solution to environmental problems at Union level .
Likewise , the social criteria are terribly important .
Who are we to blame ?
I am very happy that Mr Tappin , the rapporteur of the report , was glad to hear these views , although , unfortunately , most of our proposals were overturned on the Committee on Budgets .
The report is especially important because , as has just been said , public procurement accounts for ECU 720 billion of EU gross domestic product .
Public procurement is paid for publicly , that is , the market is responsible to the consumer .
Effective public procurement is said to enhance opportunities for industry and business to exploit the common markets and to improve competition for European businesses in world markets .
Public procurement has proved beyond the reach of small and medium-sized businesses .
Delays in payment to procurement units only help to hinder access to markets on the part of these companies .
These are viewed almost exclusively from the private business angle
