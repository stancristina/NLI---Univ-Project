for , and which he needs in order to carry out his work .
These employees must be bound by the truth in order to ensure the proper treatment of citizens within this system , and tackling this was one of Denmark 's clear priorities .
I should like to hear where the Presidency stands on the plans to put the Iranian resistance movement on the list of terrorist organisations .
We have a problem , and I should like to hear the views of the Danish Presidency on this .
Mr President , the Copenhagen Summit will be a historic event .
Europe is growing together , which is a good thing .
However , the EU membership that is now being negotiated is not the kind the applicant countries will actually receive .
They can say 'yes ' to the EU , but as early as next Christmas , when the Rome Summit has buried the Treaty of Rome and the constitution of Rome is born , they will be given the status of constituent state of a new federal state .
This is unfair , as Mr Haarder also said .
If a referendum says 'no ' to membership , the country 's representation can cease in the same way as when Norway voted 'no ' to EC membership and had to find an ambassador job for its Commissioner .
They must not join as second-class members , but instead have equal rights from day one .
When Denmark , a rich country , joined in 1973 , we actually only paid 20 % of our contribution in the first year , 40 % the next , 60 % the third and 80 % the fourth , until , after five years , we reached our full contribution .
We should bear in mind that EC and EU membership is , of course , not just something one receives .
Everyone has to pay , but only very few receive subsidies from the EU budget .
We should perhaps now look into redistribution , or Mr Rasmussen runs the risk of getting an unpleasant surprise when people realise how much they will have to pay in contributions to the EU.
Just a few words about the next point on the agenda .
The debate confirms that there is massive support for what is happening next week .
I should like to thank Mr Poettering for putting the Copenhagen European Council into exactly the right perspective from the outset .
The thanks given to the Presidency are also due to the Commission , especially Mr Verheugen , who has now been working tirelessly on this for years .
I do not know about 'now or never', but in any case it is time for action .
Despite the difficult problems that remain , we have come so far that we cannot justify failure .
As regards Cyprus , I fully agree with Mr Verheugen .
The EU and the international community must declare in plain terms their readiness to give the necessary assistance to meet the great challenges reunification will present to Cyprus and its two communities .
Concerning Turkey , the basis is clear .
The accession negotiations can commence when the Copenhagen criteria have been met .
In Copenhagen , a strong and positive signal will be sent to the Turkish politicians and population .
I agree with Mr Poettering that this is not the main subject for Copenhagen .
We shall not forget the prospect of Turkey , however , neither shall we forget Bulgaria and Romania .
They will be given a roadmap for the last stretch of the way .
I wish to thank the President of the Commission for his support for the content of the packages that the Presidency has presented to the ten countries , and I wish to thank Mr Verheugen for his word of caution against overloading the agenda for Copenhagen with all sorts of other issues .
He knows better than anyone how difficult and complicated the enlargement process is , and he knows the danger of entering into detailed discussions on the individual packages at the Copenhagen Summit .
I also wish to thank all of those who have said that we should not argue over small amounts at this decisive historic juncture .
The art is not to have opinions and make suggestions .
We must keep in mind that the art is to reach a consensus , or , in other words , to put the finishing touches to the packages in Copenhagen .
This would mean that the MEPs from the new Member States could play a part in approving the Commissioners from their countries .
A new election date could help ; and we have tried to arrange this , but without success .
If this is the case , it is good that we have another solution , one that may not be perfect , but is tolerable for all parties .
I believe that the Council has now stated - and in any case I have stated four or five times here in Parliament on behalf of the Council - that the new countries will be put on a completely equal footing with the old Member States at the Intergovernmental Conference , where a new treaty is to be adopted .
This is not something I have made up ; it is in Article 23 of the Treaty of Nice .
In a way , it is bad enough that they have to accept a treaty that we are in the process of amending .
Finally , I wish to give my support to something that many have expressed .
If only nine applicant countries are ready , they will join .
Lastly , I wish to say to the President that the Presidency looks forward to seeing him and the Conference of Presidents in Copenhagen directly before the summit
