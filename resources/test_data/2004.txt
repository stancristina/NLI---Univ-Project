.
Within this context , the European Union must consider the best way to demonstrate its leadership in the field of climate policy on the international scene .
Ladies and gentlemen , you can rest assured that we can say loud and clear that the European Union was not the problem in Copenhagen .
In looking to the future and thinking of what we must leave for future generations , Parliament can do a lot .
These results were fed back , in the form of a report , to the European Council itself .
It underscored , however , that their recovery was still somewhat fragile and called on the Committee of European Banking Supervisors to provide regular information on the amount of capital available for additional borrowing .
I would simply like to say that on 7 December 2009 , Mr Trichet , the President of the European Central Bank himself said that there are no restrictions to supply for banks to borrow money from the European Central Bank .
( ES ) I am referring to question No 9 on the list I have , or No 8 on the current one , from Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou : the Economic Situation in Greece .
In addition , the Commission 's Communication regarding the means to reinforce Kosovo 's political and socio-economic development has been welcomed .
Of course , certain requirements still need to be fulfilled regarding this and , in this respect , the Commission is working with the countries affected .
The majority of the Council , which is currently unanimous , was in favour of unblocking the interim agreement and it has heartily positioned itself in association with Serbia As for Kosovo , you asked me about a matter , honourable Member , which relates to domestic policy and to internal decisions by the Spanish Government .
This has even led to the modification of the European Union 's rural development policy .
It will be one of the focal points , one of the priorities of our Presidency .
That is an essential factor in improving developing countries ' capacities , including for their own benefit , and it must be done with the participation of indigenous peoples , of the local population and the establishment of national forestry control systems .
The Council attaches the greatest importance to Alzheimer 's disease and to neurodegenerative diseases in general .
It is therefore important that there is cooperation on a European level in this respect .
On the other hand , as you know , I have previously mentioned the existence of a high-level group for joint planning in connection with these conditions which , in this case , are chronic and not contagious .
That is what this high-level group was set up for : to work and prepare subsequent decisions .
There is a responsibility in business to respect those human rights and there is a responsibility for all parties involved to guarantee access to adequate remedy , with the aim of protecting and improving those human rights .
I think that the European Union needs to facilitate best practice across Europe , and that this will produce the legislative proposals which can improve this situation .
I think that this should be the starting point , and that it is in that context , in something that is still , to a certain extent , pioneering , where these forums should be shaped , where everyone concerned should take part in a dialogue which should give rise to the subsequent measures .
Subject : EU financial supervision The President of the ECB , Jean-Claude Trichet , said to the European Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday 7 December 2009 , with regard to the topic of EU financial supervision and agreement by EU finance ministers , 'that is not necessarily the best solution' , because there are , for example , no provisions for the planned EU authorities to have direct powers to issue instructions .
These are the three European authorities on banking , insurance and the stock market .
Consequently , we expect fruitful cooperation with the European Parliament so that we can bring this important step forward to a conclusion , which I believe is historic and is in line with the approaches which have emerged from outside Europe , from the G20 , as the United States is preparing a similar regulation .
I think that these matters you have raised are , like others , perfectly arguable and debatable , and I am sure we will come to an agreement , because it is absolutely necessary , between the two legislative bodies of the Union : the Council and the European Parliament .
What is the Presidency 's position regarding solidarity between Member States , particularly within the euro area , where one of them is faced with the prospect of insolvency ?
It also says in the treaty that neither the Union nor the Member States will assume or respond to the obligations of the central government or other public authorities of another Member State .
This has enabled marked progress in many countries , something which benefits the countries as a whole , whilst opening up markets .
Article 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets it out clearly and there , also , the solidarity of the European Union is expressed : in the joint discussion and joint adoption of objectives with a view to a coordinated economic policy .
That is the most suitable , most in-depth and far-reaching form of a policy of solidarity in the Union .
That criterion of independence should be respected , because it is a fundamental element of the economic and monetary union that we adopted several years ago in the European Union .
It must be said that Turkey has experienced positive changes
