the right channels available to them for making these demands .
Just as there are big differences from one old Member State to another , we cannot , of course , lump the ten new Member States together .
Consumers are often not especially demanding with regard to the quality of the products and services they buy , and institutionalised procedures for complaining about defects in , or problems with , products or services either do not exist or exist to only a limited degree .
There are several places where intervention is possible .
In many of the old Member States , independent consumer organisations play a central role in placing consumer issues on the political agenda and in helping and representing consumers in disputes with businesses .
One major problem in this context is the consumer organisations ’ lack of financial resources .
Only in a few countries does the ministry responsible make resources available and , in those cases in which financial resources do exist , the amounts are often very small .
Over and above government funding , another possibility is EU funding for projects through the Commission .
A second problem is that the political influence of consumer organisations is often quite limited .
Firstly , many organisations have difficulty securing enough support from the public , due both to their weak economic situation and to the public’s relatively low awareness of consumer issues .
Moreover , there are great differences as to how consumer organisations in the new Member States are structured .
It is very difficult for the organisations to convey their views with sufficient force in the decision-making process and , thus , in the public debate .
Undoubtedly , they are enthusiastic , but they are difficult to hold onto in the long term .
Responsibility for solving these problems is not located unambiguously in the one place .
The governments of the new Member States have a responsibility for taking consumer issues far more seriously than they do at present and , at the same time , for providing the necessary support to consumer organisations .
It should be understood , however , that a high level of consumer protection and an efficient market economy are not mutually exclusive but are , on the contrary , dependent on one another .
It is a responsibility for taking the lead and ensuring that consumers become more aware of their rights and role as consumers in the internal market .
I would therefore hope that we might have a constructive debate on the report .
Firstly , the sugar reform really is not nearly thorough enough and does not even come close to rectifying the scandalous imbalances that exist in the relationship between the EU and the sugar-producing countries .
This is something that the financial benefits resulting from the reform could easily pay for .
The ACP countries ’ dependence on Europe will probably only be exacerbated if they are now locked into producing sustenance for our cars instead of food for people .
We expect you to deliver a balanced outcome .
Here in Parliament , we have in actual fact delivered when it comes both to REACH and data retention , on which we are voting today , showing that it is not only when there are summits that the EU actively makes things happen .
Six months ago , your Presidency made a point of presenting a very visionary programme that attached importance to future investment in research and development .
What , however , has become of those promises now ?
The new proposal should also tackle the outdated British rebate .
That is something they deserve , and it will also be in Mr Blair’s interests clearly to distance himself from the voice of the past , embodied by Mrs Thatcher .
Mr Blair must and should show leadership so that the EU’s by now tarnished image can be polished up .
Research and development are to be welcomed , but not rebates and support for the industries of the past .
The ball lies in your court .     In the vote on the budget , the Social Democrats have voted in favour of block 1 , involving a strengthening of central budget headings for research , development etc .
It must , however , be stated , that the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament cannot support the EU’s contributing financially to the spread of nuclear power , either within or outside the Community .     Regarding letter of amendment No 1 , the Danish Liberal Party does not believe that the destruction of foodstuffs is appropriate .
However , the problem is aid for production , not aid for destruction .
Regarding letter of amendment No 2 , the Danish Liberal Party wishes to solve the problems of famine in developing countries , but believes that doing so requires a far more serious and coordinated effort than that indicated in this proposal .
The wording is also fairly unclear .
Such reform has , however , already been decided on with the new Statute for Members .
Overall , Mr Bonde’s amendments have to be characterised as ill thought-out .     The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted in favour of the report , because it is crucial to devise accompanying measures for the Sugar Protocol countries .
My group wishes to see practical European cooperation without wanting to construct a common state .
The place for common fundamental rights is in our own constitutions and in the European Convention on Human Rights .
The EC Court of Justice in Luxembourg must not be a rival , seeking to build a new state .
Our countries ’ voters must decide for themselves to whom they will give citizenship and at what juncture , as well as the rights and duties they will assign to such citizens .
