Madam President , in approving proposals on traceability limits for genetically modified organisms in raw materials , all we are doing is to open the floodgates to the gradual but constant release and movement of genetically modified food and feed .
Our fears are not unfounded , if account is taken of the increasingly suffocating pressure from the USA to import genetically modified products .
We must fight to ban imports of products made either from genetically modified raw materials or containing GMOs , not for limits on how these products are moved and traced .
I thank the Mr President-in-Office .
Today I heard your Prime Minister , President-in-Office Berlusconi say , in so many words , that he was opposed to the attack on Iraq , that he is opposed to the disdain shown towards the UN and that , at all events , he did what he could to prevent this evil .
Especially now the pretext put forward about the existence of weapons of mass destruction has proven to be a lie .
Will it act to stop this criminal occupation ?
One of the most basic reasons to which this situation is ascribed is the constant increase in air traffic and , more importantly , the lack of a common system for managing the airspace of the European countries .
As in numerous other sectors of European policy , the choice of a real Community policy and uniform regulation have been judged more efficient .
The Council set particular store by issues of public order , security and defence .
It is obvious that we are being drawn into a conciliation procedure .
Thus , of necessity , things are moving towards the conciliation procedure .
I hope that the Council has got Parliament 's message and is prepared to enter into a substantive discussion during the conciliation procedure .
As I said in committee , and I repeat here too , if the bell tolls for someone today , we must not forget that it may be us that it tolls for tomorrow .
Mainly , we must not ignore the fact that this Union is based on a certain specific philosophy and on a certain specific Treaty .
Of course , we are prepared to discuss a transitional arrangement .
Mr President , first of all I wish to congratulate Mr Lisi on the wonderful work he has done .
The Council then proceeded to adopt a common position which , to some degree , takes account of the position of the European Parliament , which is why , at second reading , as the rapporteur rightly said , we are concentrating on three essential issues : first , the right to claim compensation , not only by the operating air carrier towards the tour operators or other person , but also , similarly , by anyone who has incurred expenses or suffered losses towards the operating air carrier ; secondly , the deadline for notifying passengers and , thirdly , the issue of frequent flyer programmes .
Consequently , I totally agree with the rapporteur .
What we want is for the specific consequences on the economic and social life of both sexes to be evaluated and , of course , for the budgets to be restructured so that , through them , gender equality can be promoted instead of being undermined .
I regret that the European Commission does not have at its disposal either methods or reliable statistics for analysing the budget by gender .
.
They are also discussing the opening up of public services and utilities in these countries , so that the multinationals will have unimpeded access .
The Communist Party of Greece does not believe in the reformation of the WTO , so that inequalities in international trade can be levelled out and the countries of the developing world can develop .
I thank the Conference of Presidents for approving the initiative of the Committee on Women 's Rights to draft this report and all the political groups which , with their participation and amendments , have enriched the initial draft of my report .
Our policies must therefore be based on the principle of equality between men and women if we really want to give development opportunities to all rural citizens , men and women alike .
The policies of the European Union to strengthen the role of women in rural areas have not had the anticipated results .
Only one in five farms are managed by women and the majority of these are small farms .
Social security differs from country to country .
The Member States , for their part , must also recognise and safeguard the work of women farmers , as regards security and pensions , with contributions at levels compatible with family work .
It is proposed to direct the funds obtained from redistributing direct support to programmes in favour of women farmers , while we call on the European Commission to make provision within the framework of the future programme for the Structural Funds for rural development , in the new programme period , for a special programme for women farmers , due to the fact that , so far , the horizontal lines in the Structural Funds have not achieved the expected results .
Mr President , the report mainly identifies the unfortunate position of women farmers .
It is a known fact that these programmes refer to complementary actions as far as farming and rural development are concerned and the level of funding under the so-called second pillar is not only trivial , but also mainly profits those who exercise a business activity in the subsidised sectors of these programmes .
Women farmers ' acute problems are the result of the CAP and anti-farming policies .
Mr President , I too should like to warmly congratulate and thank Mrs Kratsa for her own initiative report .
We particularly hope
