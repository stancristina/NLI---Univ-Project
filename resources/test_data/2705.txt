I think that , in spite of everything , fluctuations in the euro/dollar exchange rate are , unfortunately , higher than this sort of value , and it is true that we have to deal , in the long term , with speculators who expect far greater devaluation .
As regards the question you addressed to the Council , i .e . the idea of study , please be assured that I shall convey your idea , most sympathetically , to the chairman of the Ecofin council , who incidentally is also a Government Minister , and perhaps this will also answer Mr Harlem Désir ' s concerns .
This sets my mind at rest somewhat .
The decision therefore applies to the production and commercialisation of products derived from animals that are made from or contain materials from animals of bovine , ovine or caprine species .
There is also statistical evidence that there is an increase of BSE in France and Portugal .
As usual , however , I can assure you that we shall give you a specific answer if you put a specific question to us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our budget for 2001 , with its EUR 92.5 billion in payment appropriations adds two new items to the traditional features .
I hope , Mr President , and this is my concluding remark , that we are at least going to cut the EUR 50 million budget lines financing the Israel-PLO peace agreement .
Nigh on two years later , we have not yet brought matter to a conclusion .
We shall therefore offer her our support , in spite of everything , in the hope that the Council and , in particular , the Commission will be careful not to take advantage of the weaknesses of the text in order to attempt to make nonsense of it .
Since the Commission has decided not to obstruct the adoption of the regulation at first reading on the basis of this compromise text , it will accept these amendments .
The text would be improved if it were amended to make that clear , perhaps this can be done when it is proof-read .
In order to rule out any misunderstanding concerning the Commission ' s reluctance to make full use of the scope afforded by Article 299( 2 ) , I propose that an enlarged forum for dialogue should meet annually and an annual report should be drawn up .
So , it has been a long wait , and the hopes expressed by our peoples have built up throughout this long wait .
I think it extremely important for the European Union as a whole , quite apart from the obvious interest it has for every man and every woman resident in our seven outermost regions .
We must somehow find a way to ensuring , as Mr Marques has just mentioned , equal opportunities for all citizens , but do so by finding the middle ground between the two requirements I have just mentioned , i .e . adapting policy to the regions which need it and compliance with the common rules mentioned in Article 299 .
That is the third point .
In the field of agriculture , we are preparing the reform of the implementing regulations for measures under the POSEI programmes .
As for the revival of the diversification of the economy , we have made progress in a number of key areas .
Moreover , in the next few days , I shall have the opportunity to sign , on behalf of the Commission , several regional programmes which are , or are going to be , definitively approved in the coming days : the Single Programming Document for Réunion , in the form of written procedures which have been all but completed , the SPDs for three other French overseas departments - Martinique , Guadeloupe and French Guiana .
Earlier , Mr Pohjamo , you yourself mentioned this anxiety , echoing the work and the commitment of Mr Sanchez , and let me at this point ask you to convey our wishes for a speedy recovery to him , given his current health problems .
Most of all , however , I would like at this point to mention one point that is particularly important to the future of these regions .
The first of these questioned what our future plans were , and asked for a multiannual programme .
I shall then , with your participation , if you are willing , devote my attention to conducting the dialogue on European issues - and the future and the place of the outermost regions form part of these issues .
It must be independent with regard to the Member States , the European institutions and the agro-food industry .
Sound scientific knowledge is certainly essential to help assess the risks linked to the food chain , from the farm to the table .
Let us require excellence and independence of it .
We need a stronger political will to resolve certain crises .
To conclude , Europe must support and deepen the Ottawa process to ensure that we do not have another weapon creating dozens of victims every 20 minutes , as is happening now .
So I welcome the work done by my fellow Members , Emma Bonino and Luisa Morgantini , who have once again brought the political debate into the heart of this Parliament .
Mr President , I think that as far as trash is concerned we have had an example of this in Mr Martinez ' s statement .
That is not the case .
So this agenda sends out a strong political message to European citizens , who all too often perceive Europe as merely the creation of
