When Sweden , Finland and Austria became members , there were safeguard clauses lasting up to one year .
Then there is Kaliningrad , as mentioned by Mr Poettering , Mr Titley and Mr Brock .
We will not allow ourselves to come under pressure , but neither do I want to spend time discussing with anyone where a summit is to be held .
I do not want to spend time on this .
We are giving priority to enlargement of the EU.
I will not therefore get involved in matters of diplomacy and protocol concerning where meetings are to be held .
And that is what I hope we can do at the summit between the EU and Russia , that is , make a decision on Kaliningrad as well - a decision which abides by the principles emphasised by a number of Members of this Parliament ; in particular , that whatever solution is found must be based on full respect for the sovereignty of Lithuania .
If there is no solution a visa will simply be introduced .
Naturally , however , we all have a common interest in finding a solution jointly with Russia , because we have an overall interest in developing a strong strategic partnership between Russia and the European Union .
We must try to find a reasonable solution to transit from Russia to Kaliningrad , but this must be done with full respect for the sovereignty of Lithuania .
Allow me once again to thank you for a very fruitful debate .
And enlargement of the EU is the driving force behind all this - it is the key to Europe 's future .
The European Parliament , the Commission and the Presidency have together fought for enlargement .
The end is now in sight , and we have today confirmed our common will to see it through and conclude the first round of enlargement negotiations in Copenhagen in December .
As agreed in Agenda 2000 , on 10 July this year the Commission submitted the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy .
Commissioner Fischler presented his discussion paper on the future development of the common agricultural policy at a Council meeting on 15 July .
The Danish Presidency has had discussion of the mid-term review on the agenda of all the Council sessions in July , September and October , and the Council has thus had a thorough debate on the main topics in the Commission 's discussion paper .
The conclusions of the Brussels Summit emphasised , as the Commissioner mentioned in his contribution , that this was without prejudice to future decisions on the common agricultural policy and the funding of the EU after 2006 , nor to any result following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the conclusions of the Berlin agenda , that is , Agenda 2000 , nor to the international commitments entered into by the EU , inter alia in the launching of the Doha Development Round .
I would like to emphasise that , like the European Parliament and other institutions , we knew from the start that our discussions on the discussion paper were to form a basis for the Commission 's submission of legal proposals at a later point in time .
Before I start my review I would like to thank the European Parliament for its discussion of the matter .
We look forward to Parliament 's final decision tomorrow , and it is obvious that the decision will be extremely important and an important contribution to the debate .
There is no reason to hide the fact that the ministers ' reactions to the mid-term review have been divergent from the start , with regard to both the timing and the framework , and of course also as regards the content .
Ladies and Gentlemen , I will now contribute some comments on the main elements of the Commission 's communication in the light of the discussions that we have had in the Council .
The Commission 's ideas in this area have been more wide-ranging than has been seen previously .
As far as decoupling is concerned , I can say that the delegations have expressed a great need for further information from the Commission in the form of impact assessments of the financial , social and regional effects of the proposal before a final position can be taken .
They believe that it will allow farmers to focus on products that give them the best return on sales without having to keep an eye on the size of the subsidies given to the various products .
Finally , the countries also point out the negotiating advantages in a WTO context of the transition to a decoupled system .
As far as dynamic modulation is concerned , a number of ministers have welcomed the proposal in principle .
They consider it to be a good way of securing the necessary funding to strengthen the priority objectives of food safety , quality , the environment and animal welfare and other important areas .
Other ministers have criticised dynamic modulation on the grounds that in reality it means a progressive reduction in subsidies in real terms and because the model - apart from franchising and capping - does not take sufficient account of existing regional differences .
I would like to comment on the more specific market sectors .
Various groups of delegations thus expressed strong arguments against a reduction in the intervention price for grain , removal of the monthly grain supplement , abolition of the intervention scheme as far as rye is concerned , the proposed changes to the arrangements for durum wheat and the proposed environmentally-friendly agricultural set-aside , as well as the Commission 's proposed adjustment of subsidies for energy crops .
The Council again had a full debate on these areas at its October meeting .
As far as rice is concerned ,
