, we would not have been able to write this report , at least not as thoroughly as we have done ; nor would it have been possible without the mutual collaboration that we have been able to establish with the Commission , or without the invaluable help provided by the services of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , my office and the services of my parliamentary group .
I would like to congratulate Parliament on its initiative to commemorate the 10th anniversary of our single currency here , in this Plenary Chamber of the European Parliament in Strasbourg .
The euro and Economic and Monetary Union have undeniably been a success .
The euro has provided a clear boost to trade and investment among its Member States .
The Stability and Growth Pact , reformed in 2005 , has encouraged governments to sort out their public accounts , leading in 2007 to the lowest budget deficit for 25 years , which is now enabling them to face the crisis in a better situation .
Mr President , I would like to conclude by paying tribute to the vision and ambition of the founding fathers of the euro , whose imagination and resolute action bequeathed to us a currency of which all Europeans can be proud .
For example , Mr Cappato , some of your suggestions have no legal basis as yet : until the Lisbon Treaty enters into force , it will be impossible to harmonise the rules of the different institutions .
If I want to disagree with my party and to maintain my opposition , I want to do so in private : that is not a lack of transparency .
Lastly - before the President signals to me , because I am already nearing the end of my time - some of your suggestions are unnecessary .
Mr President , 17 days of fighting in Gaza have quite simply left a heartbreaking situation .
Mr President , my political group supports and wants to recognise the efforts made by all the political groups in this House to support the motion for a resolution that we will adopt tomorrow .
As regards poverty , according to the figures given to our delegation , the Government of Ethiopia has acknowledged that six and a half million people are already affected by famine .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for some European countries , depending on their geographical location - as Mr Stevenson indicated - as well as their land area and the size of their trade flows , the transport of animals is a subject of particular importance .
Commissioner , I absolutely disagree with you .
I think that in matters of such importance and significance , we should all - Commission and Parliament - put our cards on the table .
With regard to the future management plan , of course we think that the Commission should become involved , by supporting or joining in with specific transnational actions that may be proposed .
The only practical thing that this Parliament can do is to seek the freezing of the association agreement with Israel ; anything else is just talk - positive and attractive - but just talk .
It does not recognise that it was the Israeli army that broke the truce of 4 November with its land incursion and various aerial attacks , but rather lays the blame on Hamas for the breakdown of the cease-fire .
I hope that in six months ' time , we will be able to provide it with an explanation .
This is an aberration because the European Union is based on the concept of non-discrimination , on the principle of equality , which today is being negated in that country : it is failing to recognise those people 's rights and is subjecting a group to historical discrimination purely on account of its ethnic origin .
That is an aberration .
This does not conform to the European Union , its principles or its values .
To that effect , our group expects the Commission to make concrete proposals on the questions that we raise in this debate .
Furthermore , police forces co-operate with each other .
As Europeans , they do not exist outside the European Union .
For that reason , the European Commission has the obligation , including before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into effect and obviously afterwards , to implement Article 20 , to make European citizens proud of their passport and to make sure that certain officials understand that the 19th century is over and Europe does exist whenever a European citizen is in trouble in New Delhi , Beirut or wherever else .
Proof of this is the welcome the compromise has received from all those involved .
The legislation will include , at the European Parliament 's request , a new annex comprising a list of raw materials for animal feed of which the placing on the market or use is prohibited or restricted .
However , I do believe that the current situation is such that Parliament should send out clear messages about certain issues .
I think that we should seriously consider opening an in-depth debate on the relevance of applying this preferential framework and , above all , on the consequences that it has for many groups , including workers .
It is quite understandable that people flee from this situation , as the Karen population has been doing for several years and , as we are today reporting in the resolution , the Rohingya people has also done , being intercepted in Thailand .
He has also been found guilty by the Italian courts of other acts such as belonging to an armed group , possession of firearms - a serious crime in most European countries - and acts of violence
