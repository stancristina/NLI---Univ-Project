therefore voting against the new Rules of Procedure , and we call upon the Member States to protest against Parliament 's attempt to transform the national parliaments into a kind of junior branch of local government .
Mr President , this report is a very important and interesting one .
It is very important that the quality of legislation is right .
On behalf of the Liberal Group , I would like to say that many of the amendments proposed by the Greens make the Commission 's proposal far more restrictive than is necessary .
If I may take the liberty of referring to my own country , Denmark , where the Anti-Cancer Association has carried out analyses of risks in this area , it has been found that there is no connection between electromagnetic fields and cancer .
With children there was a very small risk , and with power station workers there was no risk .
But I fail to see how studies from other countries would justify the requirements being proposed by Mr Tamino .
The Liberal Group is therefore opposed to the Greens ' amendments , and I would ask the Commission on behalf of the Liberal Group what it has to say about the scientific studies to which Mr Tamino refers .
I must say that on the basis of the national and international studies which have been carried out in this area , I have difficulty in recognising the assertions which have been made .
This means that the consumer should be given the benefit of any doubt , even if there is only a hint of risk in using modern techniques .
But today we are considering the short-term effects of exposure to radiation from electromagnetic fields .
We therefore think that the very restrictive advice which would result from supporting the amendments is untenable .
It is also clear that all scientists agree that the short-term effects of being exposed to radiation are very small , and to hinder or even prevent the supply and consumption of electricity would be like using cannons to shoot sparrows , as we say in Denmark .
One cannot of course rule out the possibility that the long-term effects might be different .
Mr President , when we talk about radiation damage , we must make distinctions .
First of all there is low-frequency radiation from high-tension cables and frequencies generated by them .
In Denmark , we have a cancer register in which all cancer cases are recorded , and the central register of persons shows where people live .
The claims that extensive studies have not been carried out are incorrect .
More or less everyone in this Parliament uses a mobile telephone , sometimes a great deal , although there are some who believe that mobile telephones are dangerous .
Considering how many children in their teens and younger use mobile telephones , it is important that such research is started , so that we can have some specific conclusions .
And of course no one stands in front of a radar beam or rays from a microwave source .
Many of the amendments , in other words Nos 14 to 24 , are only designed to create unease and are not based on the necessary scientific research .
I would like to ask Mrs Gradin whether she would reinstate Paul van Buitenen , who was suspended because he took the trouble to give an elected representative a document which he believed the elected representatives ought to read as part of the investigation into fraud at the Commission ?
I would like to thank you for your reply .
I fully understand it - in fact I think it is a sensible thing .
This means , amongst other things , that the company cannot give its employees the opportunity to buy shares because the new , very large merged company will be entitled to step in and acquire shares ahead of the employees .
We did not get as far as how ports should be included in the master plan .
The report on short-sea shipping demonstrated that .
We have discussed the green paper on ports , and we have in fact progressed a long way in our debate on ports .
There is a need for development all over Europe .
It is important for us to consider not only the functional aspect , but also the need for uniform conditions as far as bureaucracy is concerned .
There is one thing that is very inconvenient for ships when they arrive at ports , and that is the inconsistency in the way they are received and the way the ports operate .
Another point is that the selection of ports should be based on strategic considerations , and not just on regional and local factors .
Local desires for expansion should therefore be held in check when we talk about the development of trans-European networks .
Mr President , these changes to existing directives and the adoption of a new directive on the allocation of infrastructure and the levying of charges represent a final break with national monopolies and provide opportunities for competition .
As Mr Wibe has just been saying , there are problems .
It is a long way from decision to reality .
Consideration for public services and social obligations make the consequences difficult for many people .
We should bear that in mind .
That is our goal .
Like the ports , the railways are also part of the transport chain and are therefore under an obligation to develop sustainable transport .
This afternoon we discussed public services , competition and state aid with Commissioner Van Miert in a working group , and it is very interesting to see how things are developing in Europe .
We have to prompt them in one way or another .
