the price rise .
A heavier penalty will also mean that there will be fewer suppliers in this market .
Those who remain will be the Mafia .
I understand that there are Member States which are very worried about this proposal .
I would urge them very strongly to use their right of veto in the Council and put a stop to it .
Firstly , a distinction should be drawn between organisations which intervene for money and for profit , and organisations which do so for humanitarian and compassionate reasons .
Secondly , I think that it is important that we do not pass on our responsibility to just any old carriers .
It cannot be right for some employee of Sabena , Air France or SAS to be made responsible for assessing what should happen in an asylum case .
That is our own responsibility .
Mr President , I should also like to thank the rapporteur for his report and the Commission for the fact that this proposal has finally been presented and will hopefully soon be put into effect .
I thought it was a good word until I realised what he meant .
It is interesting that Mr Nassauer - and the PPE-DE Group , I assume - think that this proposal should primarily be about distributing the burden .
It is , of course , absurd , really .
That is how matters stand , however .
There are still a few problems with the proposal , I think , but , when all is said and done , my group will end up supporting the report and , thus , this initiative , because it is so patently necessary that we get it implemented quickly .
And I will , at any event , do everything I can to prevent the issue of burden sharing ' s being made into something which can turn victims of catastrophe into hostages in our own internal battles and our solidarity with ourselves .
There is a need for solidarity in this world , not with ourselves but with the world outside .
Mr President , this is probably one of the thinnest reports which this House has dealt with for a long time , but it is hopefully also the last time I am given such an assignment .
This report concerns a Portuguese initiative which tackles one of several problem areas in connection with visa policy .
Since , moreover , the situation is such that , in a very short time - in April , if I have understood correctly - the Commission is to come up with an initiative tackling all the problems surrounding the freedom to travel within the territory of the Member States , and since the Commission also shares my concern about the problems which the report will create , I very warmly recommend a vote in favour of my report and , thus , the rejection of the Portuguese initiative in favour of the later initiative to be produced by the Commission .
The proposals with which we are dealing today and those with which we dealt previously are largely about closing this area of freedom , democracy and justice , which might be said already to be in the process of becoming isolated .
We are well aware that several Member States are already facing the fact that we need a significant level of immigration if we wish to maintain a standard of living anything like that which we have at present and if , in addition , we aspire to a secure old age in which others work while we , hopefully , have time to ourselves .
This is amazingly difficult to understand .
My own country , Denmark , is among the worst .
Ministers in positions of responsibility talk about putting refugees on desert islands , and when they talk like that , then the level of debate is as might be expected and anything is suddenly permitted .
The liberals in my country think that all refugees should be assembled in camps in the world 's poorest countries .
When the Wall came down in 1989 , we all believed in a Europe without walls , but we are well on the way to putting walls up .
We should be asking how it is possible that we , the richest part of the world , so consistently choose repressive solutions .
This is something we can certainly all be satisfied with .
Do the new rules result in the same legal status for players under 23 years of age , as was applicable before the Bosman verdict , should a dispute arise between clubs about an amount by way of compensation ?
Might players be in danger of not being able to change clubs , even if the contract has expired ?
What legal protection do players have in such a situation ?
It is splendid to be able to see agendas for meetings in the various working parties .
I would also congratulate the presidency on the Futurum home page initiative .
Why are there not also interventions from people who are opposed to the Treaty of Nice and the centralisation of more administrative power in Brussels ?
According to Eurobarometer , only 18 % of EU citizens prefer decisions to be made in Brussels . 63 % prefer them to be made at local , regional or national levels .
The critics of the EU in my group and in the intergroup , SOS Democracy , are prepared to engage in debate both at the European School and in community centres .
We should like to explain why we wish to see an open , democratic and slimmed-down EU in which decisions are taken close to the people they affect , an EU which addresses far fewer cross-border issues , but then whose work is free from bureaucracy , waste and fraud .
