affects them directly , and we must not allow it to be systematically undermined as it is now .
I fear that the Netherlands will run into even more difficulties in the future because of its government 's attitude , which is like someone who has a pound to spend and expects to be able to buy a Rolls Royce .
Commissioner , there are two parts to my question .
And what has happened since then ?
Not only have these bans now spread to Poland , but in his reply Mr van den Broek said that he would contact the Hungarian authorities and that the Commission would try to take measures to combat the adverse effects of the long delays at borders .
Is the Commissioner aware that we now urgently need better financing for the whole trans-European network infrastructure project and even more urgently for the environmentally-friendly projects ?
The current situation in which such advertising is banned in some countries and not in others leads to a distortion of competition and handicaps advertisers and firms that wish to draw objective comparisons , as well as consumers , who are not given the opportunity to compare .
I can well imagine that it could cause problems for Coca-Cola or for some other kinds of trade marks , in that I think they are already protected under trade mark law , but I cannot see the link with agriculture .
We have therefore retabled a number of amendments from the first reading .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , comparative advertising is not a very easy subject for many Member States , some of which , including my own country , have banned it up to now .
In the pharmaceuticals sector , for instance , it is both customary and necessary to refer to comparative tests , so Amendment No 5 would impose a particular burden there .
There is a considerable demand for comparable health statistics at European level which will continue beyond the end of the action programme , and this is why a permanent system of health monitoring has been proposed .
Mr President , Commissioner Bjerregaard , let us be fair about this .
Once again , it is thanks to Parliament that we now have details in black and white of what the forthcoming framework directive is to contain .
As we have seen , Parliament has had to go to a great deal of trouble to ensure that we have an acceptable new European water policy , and Mr Florenz must take much of the credit for this .
Unfortunately , it must be said that the Union 's water policy has not produced the results expected over the last 20 years , to put it mildly .
If you are sitting here , there is no monitor on which you can follow the debate , so you cannot see when it is your turn .
When Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi 's party organized an eighth anniversary celebration on 26 September at her house , at which she was also to give a speech , almost 600 people were arrested , including many sitting members of parliament , that is to say members who were elected but have not been allowed to take their seats in parliament .
As was already mooted in June , the ASEAN countries suggested last month that they might give Burma a different , more positive status , but since three ASEAN countries last week refused to let Burma join the organization , it would seem that here too , protests are growing against the regime .
If this has happened , then none of these measures we have made so much fuss about will actually have put an ounce of pressure on the regime .
The reason for this was that the NLD had organized a party congress .
That could , potentially , have an adverse effect on cooperation between the EU and ASEAN.
The blockade on her house is supposed to have been lifted on 30 September , but the press cannot get through to her and she is not allowed to make her weekly speeches .
We basically feel that it is time for an economic boycott such as has been proposed in the United States .
I believe that the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council has cleared up that question and we can take it that the IGC will complete its work in June of next year .
If not the European Union will inevitably unravel and be diluted into an association of countries in which there remains scarcely any intergovernmental role at all .
Our fellow citizens feel insecure .
On the one hand the President-in-Office of the Council stated , and I quote : ' I think we have had a very successful summit to have been able to give the very strong unanimous impulse to the Intergovernmental Conference ' .
Secondly , it was not possible to resolve any real problem points due to the slow progress of the IGC negotiations .
I find this important .
In the area of policy , I believe that something must be done on the subject of employment .
And then there is Mr Prodi in Cairo who has also made a number of statements which are credited to the European Union .
It is true to say that Burma is in the same situation as Chile and South Africa were in the 1980s .
But we must do more .
Now , just 5 years later , the independent Slovenia has developed into a fully-fledged democracy with good guarantees for its minority groups - not yet good enough , but good for the time being given the circumstances .
It provides many instruments for more intensive cooperation which must be actively used .
This Europe Agreement is the first step in doing so .
