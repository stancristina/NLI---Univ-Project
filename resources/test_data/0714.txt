Commission text has been overtaken by events .
An alarm which will result not just in our imitating the United States , but in a model for incorporating these technologies which is based on the political principles of the European Union .
Three : although we agree that the European Union should be proactive in this area , we must not lose sight , in parallel to these efforts and as we coordinate the efforts of the Member States , of the individual identity of each country and of the cultural identities and diversity which exist in the European Union , especially its linguistic diversity .
There is a discrepancy between major and minor languages ; we do not want one or more languages to hold sway over the others and we need to consider the specific difficulties of the minor languages which do not use the Latin alphabet .
Six : we need a humane model which is not based on information overload and which can be combined with pupils ' need for free time , with cultivating the imagination , with creativity in all sectors and with developing social conduct in school .
Eight : not just processes emanating from above , but interaction with society owing to the wide range of circumstances and the complexity of the problems involved .
Finally , Mr President , I should like to say that several Members may perhaps have reservations on various points ; I personally have reservations about Paragraph 23 on the general acceptance of the Bologna agreements ; however , this report was adopted by a unanimous vote in committee and I hope that Parliament will do likewise .
In Greece , huge demonstrations by students , pupils and teachers against this reactionary policy to dumb down education have given rise to an explosive situation , rectors have resigned and universities have been occupied or even closed .
Educational establishments are called on to become more responsive to fast changes on the job market .
Mr President , the people of the European Union must fight and overturn this anti-educational policy , they must secure their basic right to a free , high-quality , universal state education which is sensitive both to the productive requirements of each country and to individual vocations and talents .
What we have overlooked is the enormous interest of the Committee on Culture and Education in these matters , which will be crucial over the next decade and which are crucial to the future of Europe .
We have seen a recurrence of monetary crisis in the developed countries , such as Argentina and Turkey .
The main questions for the European economy , for the European institutions and for the Member States remain the same , despite the change in the international environment .
How can we achieve a higher rate of growth ?
I should like to add here that , if and when this liberalisation comes about , the Member States must heed the lessons learned from the upheavals in the United States .
However , none of this alone will trigger a high rate of growth in the European economy .
Structural reforms are needed ; we must not neglect public investment , which has been neglected in the past , and we must do this by stimulating public investment , because we are lagging way behind .
Large companies have already applied this measure and made huge redundancies on the pretext of the slowdown in the rate of growth of the economy and have restructured production and staff , with the result that over 250 000 redundancies have been announced in recent weeks .
It also proposes speeding up the rate of privatisation , specifically quoting the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector as a good example , which should be pursued in the energy , post , airport , railway and sea transport sectors , as agreed .
The measures designed for the workers are tantamount to a guaranteed level of poverty .
Another worrying dimension is that younger and younger children , irrespective of sex or social class , are drinking more and more regularly .
Access by young people to places in which alcoholic beverages are easily obtainable must be specially regulated , together with any other measures to control supply .
What we need to do , within the framework of the European Union , is to organise proper information campaigns and special training seminars for people who come into contact with young consumers .
Mr President , the draft Council regulation and the parliamentary report are confined to the purely administrative aspects of the problem of BSE and make no provision for any substantial procedure for identifying and combating the causes .
If the European Union really wanted to deal with the problem , it would treat production in countries such as Greece differently by cancelling all quotas for the expenditure incurred and covering it by reducing support for livestock production in the countries which are responsible for these health problems .
( EL ) Mr President , I have a question to put to Commissioner Fischler .
We are in a period of crisis .
And a distinction should be made between the countries which are responsible for the crisis , which invented BSE , and the countries which protected and still protect the European Union , between importing countries and countries which saturate the market with exports and ruin the budget and between small and large companies , so that we can move towards a model of small , ecological livestock holdings .
I fail to understand this sort of discrimination .
Furthermore , I think that the way in which Members who ask to speak are noted is unacceptable .
We know that the European Commission operates action programmes with ideas and funding to protect the rights of children in third world countries .
