A fight geared primarily to the implementation of the principle of full and stable employment , with full , consolidated social rights for everyone .
Only such a framework will safeguard the rights of the particularly sensitive category of pregnant women and the rights and respect for life as something other than the raw material of profit , subject to the laws of costs , competition and inexorable market forces .
Of course , the basic sector is passenger transport , but the report under discussion focuses on freight transport in response to the Commission 's communication .
But we can still improve its image and turn it into a viable alternative solution for types of freight which can be transported by various methods .
The rapporteur has obviously approached the subject matter in this spirit and has taken her work very seriously ; as an islander I feel obliged to extend her my special thanks .
Mr President , today we are discussing Mr Galeote Quecedo ' s excellent report , on which there is a broad consensus .
In this sense , Mr Galeote Quecedo ' s report remains within the limits of procedural rationalisation ; it also remains within the framework of certain policies .
In this sense , moaning and groaning solves nothing in politics .
We need to move forward , we need to be guided by the logic of a positive dynamic balance , not a static balance which goes nowhere .
But I believe that the people of Europe and the large majority of parties and factions see Europe as a Europe with prospects , a Europe of peace , a Europe of cooperation , a Europe of social cohesion , a Europe of development .
Mr President , although the European Union barely has a legal basis or status as an international political entity , the report and proposal under discussion suggest creating mechanisms which are suited solely to that sort of entity .
This proposal is intended to take all foreign policy matters out of the jurisdiction of national governments , far from any possible democratic control , and away from national parliaments , and is therefore in violation of national constitutions .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , this is not the first time that the House has concluded that the situation in the Middle East is critical .
Let us not forget that the highly important UN Resolution 242 was devised mainly by Europe .
Madam President , despite significant scientific progress in treating Aids , the Aids epidemic is still ravaging more and more poor countries , thereby compounding problems in dealing with its multiple and serious consequences .
There is no doubt that preventive measures and treatment over recent years have considerably improved patients ' chances of survival in developed countries ; however , the same cannot be said of poor countries .
Similarly , the cost of treatment is so high that few patients receive this , their rudimentary right .
And where I think the minister needs to add to what he has told us is on whether the European Union , whether the Council will also demand at a practical level during the two days of contacts that the United States apply the provisions of the International Labour Organisation Convention and the United States convention on the Rights of the Child .
Or , taken the other way , how binding on a government are proposals decided jointly by the social partners , who know better than anyone what the problems of society and the causes of unemployment are and what problems need to be solved in order to deal with unemployment , or how binding should they be on any national government ?
And if so , when ?
I would like to thank the minister for his reply ; however , I note that , whereas I specifically asked if the Helsinki criteria would be defined within the partnership , he evaded the question .
What is the Council ' s reply to Mr Gem ?
Similarly , not only does Turkey continue to occupy 38 % of Cyprus following its barbaric invasion in 1974 , contrary to repeated UN resolutions which Turkey disregards in the most provocative manner , but Mr Ecevit states that the Cyprus question was resolved in 1974 and refuses to apply resolutions to pay ...
The Intergovernmental Conference is not a procedure which is foreign or bears no relation to the Council and it obviously takes account of all points of view and all types of need .
That was the meaning of my question ; I do not think we should just stand around and wait because it may be too late by then and an agreement may not be so easy to reach .
The attacks on the Greek minority were just one in a series of incidents which occur in Albania on a daily basis .
We seem to have promised the Balkans a great deal but are unwilling to put our promises into practice .
I should like answers to these questions , minister .
There can , in my opinion , be no doubt that the issues covered in the three amendments rejected by the Council are real issues and that the Council position , or the sub-text at least , indicates a hypocritical disposition to sweep them to one side or underestimate their importance .
Now the Council has proposed releasing EUR 135 million for the economic and social development of Turkey .
There were arrests recently during events for world peace day on 1 September , Cyprus continues to be occupied and , as we are preparing to release funds , Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit has said that the Cyprus question was resolved in 1974 , i .e . with the barbaric invasion and continuing occupation , demonstrating his disdain for UN
