We particularly mention this in order to put a stop to the eternal power struggle between Parliament and the Council .
I can well understand Parliament 's various wishes .
I consider them entirely legitimate .
Moreover , it would be a poor principle if the Ecofin Council had those powers .
What I am able to offer is the fact that we are taking these matters seriously and that we in the Ecofin Council are doing what we can but will also tell our Heads of State very clearly which attitudes prevail in the European Parliament , because the Ecofin Council does not have a vote in the Convention , but our Heads of State do , the countries do , and we should exploit this opportunity .
That means , moreover , that there must be a review in 2004 and that , if there is not then agreement on the Convention 's conclusions or on the governments ' conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference , then these directives will lapse .
I would simply call upon you to take account in your statement of what the Ecofin Council is able to do and deliver and refer to the responsibility that we have to get the capital markets to work effectively so that we each make a contribution to growth and employment in Europe .
I would like to express my thanks for the debate .
Thank you very much for your views , which I shall pass on .
Mr President , I should like firstly to commend the rapporteur , and also Mr Sj√∂stedt for his opinion on this report .
It is still a hard fight to obtain greater transparency and supervision where the EIB is concerned .
It is almost impossible for the Court of Auditors to obtain access to documents .
In March 1999 , the EIB , the Commission and the Court of Auditors signed an agreement concerning the Court of Auditors ' being able to supervise the EIB , but I firmly believe that the agreement must be altered so that it gives the Court of Auditors the same right to supervise the EIB as it has to supervise the ECB.
Why should the EIB have special status ?
I would compare the EIB with the goblins ' bank in the Harry Potter books , namely a totally closed institution in which no one must interfere .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner Monti , on the subject of the report concerning the scoreboard , I wish , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , to say that we are not satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the committee and have therefore , together with the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , tabled a number of amendments .
I would also thank the Commission for the work done on the scoreboard , which is a very useful tool for achieving the objective of a general reduction in state aid .
I am especially pleased with the support given by the committee to my proposal that consideration should be given to setting up a competition court , Article 225 A of the Treaty of Nice having paved the way for such a possibility .
A competition court would have to operate as a counterweight to , and supervisor of , the Commission 's experts on issues relating to competition policy .
It would make for greater transparency of the enterprises concerned .
On the contrary .
I want to support Commissioner Monti and all the other forces for good in their view that , in the future too , competition policy should remain precisely that , with no interference from other policy areas , such as industrial policy .
I am delighted that Mr Monti is well disposed towards a European competition court .
I would also take the liberty of looking forward and commenting on the Commission 's motion for a resolution for reforming EU competition law .
At the same time , we have maintained that this must not lead to a renationalisation of competition policy .
I am confident that this network would be effective .
It is about creating a special unit or task force in the Competition Directorate-General whose task it will be to ensure , and monitor the fact , that the competition rules are applied equally in all the Member States .
I shall go into this in more detail in a letter to the Commissioner .
Mr President , what would happen if a small Danish limited company with 100 employees were to draw up annual accounts about which a chartered accountant made a declaration emphasising that most of the reservations were due to the fact that they recurred from year to year ; and if it were confirmed that the weaknesses were to a large extent due to the failure of the company 's accounting system to provide adequate assurance that its balance sheet was complete and included all the elements of the company 's activities ; and if , in addition , the declaration stated that there were problems with the monitoring and security systems , and that the data in the system were not complete ; and it continued by saying that it was a matter of concern that the company did not give a high enough priority to remedying these defects , and that it had not given sufficient consideration to the area or allocated enough resources to finding a solution to the problems within a reasonable time frame ?
If all this happened , the board of directors would , firstly , refuse to give discharge to the management .
It would then get rid of the management .
After that , the taxation authorities would turn up and seize all the business 's accounts documentation for critical analysis
