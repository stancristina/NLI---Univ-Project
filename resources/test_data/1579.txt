is , maintenance of price stability ? regardless of growth and employment rates , defending the irrationality of the Stability Pact , calling for continued 'wage moderation ? and insisting on the old capitalist recipe that 'the workers should pay for the crisis ? when the gains of productivity transferred from salaries into profits have not contributed to more investment and more employment , but to the enriching of the usual small group .
Everything depends merely on the ideological cause that is being pursued .
This situation has arisen because there is no objective programme , because there are inadequate resources and because no appropriate guidelines or measures are in place , specifically with regard to access to land and water and ideally underpinned by a concept of sustainable development , of which the right to food sovereignty and support for family- and community-based agriculture must be essential elements .
Mr President , I wish first to express my gratitude for the warm words of the rapporteur , Manuel Medina Ortega , but I must say that the report has lost nothing with my replacement .
As a consequence , consumers now face a hotchpotch of laws , which afford greater protection in some States than in others .
The industry needs guarantees that fair practices will be encouraged and supported , through a reworded directive that eliminates the scandalous practices that we have been seeing .
The aim of the proposal is , as has been stressed by the speakers , to enhance legal certainty by clarifying the directive 's scope and meaning and by removing ambiguities that have led to different interpretations .
The European Union is the world 's largest exporter of machines and mechanical equipment , ahead of the USA and Japan .
Some could be included in a revised proposal as they stand , whilst others could be retained in part , or in principle .
We do not want to interfere in the general debate on commitology .
Therefore , for legal reasons , we cannot accept this amendment .
Europe can only protect itself through the law , using sanctions and prosecutions .
We must emphasise once again that racism and xenophobia constitute a clear violation of the principles of freedom , democracy , fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights as well as the Rule of Law - principles on which the European Union is founded and which are common to all Member States .
It can never be emphasised too much , however , that there must be an equitable balance between combating the scourge of racism and xenophobia and safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms , specifically the freedom of expression , the freedom of the press and freedom of association .
As the rapporteur points out , freedom of expression under the democratic Rule of Law has limits and , therefore , cannot be used as a justification for breaching the rights of third parties or for committing criminal acts .
The Commission is flexible with regard to other aggravating circumstances .
In other words , that their attention has been drawn to this fact by a judicial authority by means of criminal proceedings , if these providers have not , in the meantime , adopted measures to remove this material .
The proposal for a framework decision cannot be interpreted in a way that threatens fundamental rights , specifically the freedom of expression and the principles recognised in Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights , and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
There is also an urgent need to ensure the survival of human activities that will disappear if our waters are brutally exploited and depleted .
We agree with her and thank her for her work .
This report shows that profound inequalities exist in the interpretation and implementation of these measures , specifically : in inspection and surveillance equipment , in the training of inspectors , in the frequency of inspections and in sanction procedures .
We agree with this proposal , and this debate must now be incorporated into the debate on the CFP following 2002 .
It is worth repeating that the conservation of meagre resources , however renewable , is the vital issue .
Control and the concomitant sanctions , says the report , vary so much between Member States that the final result is biased towards the quite unfair treatment of the fishermen of various countries , which is damaging to the reliability and the acceptance of Community regulations as well as to respect for them .
The Commission has considerable political and legislative power over the CFP but its instruments are relatively weak , as the Commission itself must acknowledge .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , despite the positive steps taken in the legislative area to promote equality between men and women , many shortcomings , inequalities and forms of discrimination still remain in the differing practices of the States Members , which must be resolved .
Hence also the importance of the implementation of the Council recommendation of 31 March 1992 .
With regard to the new directive being prepared on gender equality in sectors other than employment opportunities and which the Commission promised to submit before June , this must not be subject to any further delay .
This initiative proposes developing local labour markets in order to achieve high levels of efficiency and quality with regard to job creation and to deal with aspects such as gender equality , the social dimension , economic development , innovation and the information society , as I have stated in the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities .
In order to achieve the objective of equal opportunities within the European Employment Strategy , we must strengthen the financial instruments of Community initiatives , such as EQUAL , the European Social Fund , the ERDF , and in local actions .
