as agriculture is concerned , the Council confirmed its support at its meeting on 8 April 2003 for the Community proposal on the details in the agricultural sector and urged the Commission to continue its efforts so that an agreement can be reached on this basis because , in its opinion , this is the most realistic means of completing the negotiations in accordance with the timetable laid down in the Doha ministerial declaration .
The question of nuclear safety generally concerns the Council , which fully supports achieving a high standard of nuclear safety throughout the European Union .
Directive 96/29/ ?uratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation sets out the basic obligations for radiation protection which must be honoured .
In addition , I should like to point out that the problem is not a technical one .
According to the latest information given to me on developments in the relevant Council , I might add that I am optimistic about progress with this work .
In addition , the Council and the Commission are aware of the fact that funding under the CAP must comply with the conclusions of the European Council in Berlin on financial ceilings and with the conclusions of the European Council in Brussels in October 2002 .
During this process , the competent ministers will obviously bring their experience and positions to bear and I hope that the final balance struck will safeguard precisely the positive elements of the model which prevails in the Union and which is important not only from an agricultural but also from a more general economic , social and , in the final analysis , political point of view .
The ? U is closely monitoring the situation as regards respect for the human rights of women in Afghanistan .
In its contacts with the Afghan Transitional Administration , the ? U constantly and incessantly stresses that the rights of Afghan women and the promotion of their full and equal participation in every aspect of public life are an important reference point for the evaluation of the performance of the Afghan Transitional Administration and for defining subsequent EU policy towards Afghanistan .
The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs , who met the EU ministers in April 2003 , subscribes to these conclusions .
One very positive step was the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women on 5 March .
The EU special representative , together with the representatives of the Commission and the Member States , regularly evaluate the achievement of the objectives of the policy of the European Union , including in the field of women 's rights and shall , if they deem necessary , submit recommendations on further action to be taken on the part of the ?U.
In its regular evaluation of the EU 's common position on Cuba , the Council always underlines its approach of open and constructive dialogue with Cuba on all matters of common interest .
In their bilateral contacts with the Cuban authorities , the Member States protested strongly about the arrests .
These latest developments , which mark a further deterioration in the human rights situation in Cuba , will affect the EU 's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation .
Consequently , the ? U demands that those persons , whom it considers prisoners of conscience , be released without delay and also calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners .
The ? U will monitor violations of personal and political rights , which continue to affect the Union 's relationship with Cuba , very closely .
The Council is particularly sensitive to this issue , and discussed it at its last meeting and decided to issue these declarations of condemnation .
Madam President , once again the workers are being called on to pay the price of the crisis plaguing the European and global economy in order to support the competitiveness of European big business within the framework of the struggle taking place for control of the raw materials markets and thanks to the unbridled pursuit of increased profitability .
For the first axis of the economic guidelines , boosting economic growth , there is a call for the faithful application of the Stability Pact , a reduction in wage and non-wage costs , a link between wages and productivity , measures to make part-time and temporary work the norm and the promotion of disincentives which will prevent workers from leaving productive activity , the aim being the mandatory extension of working life , and measures for training in early retirement .
It is , to say the least , unacceptable , under pressure from monopoly interests , to persist with such unsuccessful measures , which lead the workers into impoverishment and marginalisation , in order to support the unaccountable profiteering of big business .
The workers are reacting intensely to this policy and are taking to the streets en masse in all the countries which are trying to apply it .
.
We are opposed , however , to the provision which allows the European Commission to decide about vaccines or refer the matter to a Community body for a decision to be taken on its own , even without the assent of the Member State in question .
European countries have made a particularly important contribution along the way : to launching systems , to research , to applications .
The ? U also often cites the requirements of the space industry in order to justify the military use of space .
The Commission communication and the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation , despite the positive findings and proposals , are no more than a wish list .
