vote on the motion .
That does not mean that we are satisfied with the Commission ’s answer , but we are pleased about the undertakings given during the debate , and we shall pursue the matter in the Committee on Budgetary Control and go on fighting for complete openness about gifts ...     There are 90 of us who , as MEPs , have signed a motion of censure on the Commission , because it was the only way we had of getting the President of the Commission to come here to Parliament and explain the connection between a gift of a holiday worth between EUR 20 000 and EUR 25 000 and a subsequent decision to provide EUR 10 million in regional aid to his friend Spyros Latsis , 54th on the list of the world’s richest people .
We were given an explanation , but Parliament’s President has in the meantime decided that , contrary to our wishes , we must vote on the motion .
We are satisfied that , in future , motions of censure are to be accepted from the moment they are submitted with 74 signatures , whereupon they shall automatically be put to the vote .
The motion was submitted under the old rules , however .
That does not mean that we are satisfied with the Commission ’s answer , but we are pleased about the undertakings given during the debate , and we shall pursue the matter in the Committee on Budgetary Control and go on fighting for complete openness about gifts and about membership of the Commission ’s 3 000 secret working parties .     The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the resolution on an area of freedom , security and justice .
The result is sensible modernisation , which we can fully support .
The first is the Stability and Growth Pact , the second the Lisbon process and the third the broad economic guidelines .
Such an agenda also means our having to say that we have understood Europe’s need for the Stability and Growth Pact but that the pact does not , of course , in itself create new jobs .
Moreover , it is because of these efforts that the national governments need to concur with our line of thinking .
That , Commissioner Almunia , is why I hope that this pact , which is now almost in place – and which I am certain will be implemented – is the first step on the way to a new and genuine agenda which , in reality , is the prior condition for creating popular understanding in connection with that modernisation of the treaties that we have been debating so vigorously over the last few days .     The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Gaubert’s report on legal and illegal migration and integration of migrants .
We are , however , aware of the fact that parts of the report concern an area covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and do not therefore apply to Denmark , cf . the protocol on Denmark’s position .     I have often praised the Luxembourg Presidency .
You always do things well at a technical level , but today I must criticise you , Mr  Juncker , for the summit’s decision to continue the ratification process with a document rejected by the French in a binding referendum .
What contempt for the law !
What a retreat from reality , too !
The Constitution is dead .
With all respect , even you cannot breathe life into a corpse by threatening to withdraw as Prime Minister if the Luxembourgers also politely reject a Constitution that , on the basis of population figures and with no proper exercise of democracy , would shift power from the electorate to officials .
Let us , rather , start afresh .
We shall be able to discuss this and elect a new Convention able to represent the electorate’s attitude to Europe’s future .
We shall then be able to obtain a practical , brief and easily understandable cooperation agreement able to be adopted in referenda on the same two days in all the EU countries .
If we devise an agreement that is better than the Treaty of Nice , most Europeans will naturally vote in favour of it .
A new opinion poll shows that 80 % of Danes support the proposal to reverse the burden of proof in matters of transparency and that 79 % want each country to be able to elect its own Commissioner .
That is the type of support we should be seeking by means of a new treaty .
You are a terrific speaker , and you are very convincing .
I see your Presidency as an historic challenge .
It is up to you .
That is difficult and demands leadership , but it also requires will , and I hope that you have that will .
Above all , you should now , moreover , as one of the leaders of the enlargement process , show solidarity towards our new Member States .
I am pleased that you attach a lot of importance to the Services Directive and that you will do a lot of work on removing the administrative difficulties .
I look forward to seeing , in six months ’ time , that you have stood the test as Europe’s best leader .
Mr Blair , you are a very popular politician in Denmark , but we shall respect you even more if you arrange for the Constitution to be buried for , as you well know , it does not solve a single one of the problems that engage the attention of Europeans and that you described very precisely .
It is not the richest who pay most and the poorest who receive most
