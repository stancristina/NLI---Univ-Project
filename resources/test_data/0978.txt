the Council addressed the issue of closer cooperation and said that we are on the way to reaching consensus on this matter .
This is neither fair nor acceptable .
The President-in-Office of the Council spoke with sincerity , for which I thank him .
We therefore encourage and urge the Presidency once again to make every effort to ensure that there is at least one reference to the Treaties in Nice because this would be the best tribute we could pay to the work of the Members of the European Parliament , the Commission and even the representatives of the governments involved in the Convention on drafting the Charter .
In addition to the diversity of opinions , I feel that there is a prevailing awareness that Europe is at an historic moment which requires its role in the international system to be clarified .
The European Parliament , working together with the national parliaments , is , in my opinion , the most appropriate body for this task .
The Commission ' s problems in implementing various programmes are clear to see .
We hope to see a thorough reorganisation of structures and working methods , and clarification of the distribution of powers between Parliament , the Council and the Commission is essential .
I am sure of the success of this reform and therefore congratulate the four rapporteurs , especially Mrs GuyÂ­ Quint , whose work I have followed most closely .
Accidents are not just caused by the age and type of the vessel ; they also occur because of the unscrupulousness of ship owners and operators who make use of every possible method to cut costs .
Portugal supported the changes to Directive 94/54 but disagrees with the abolition of classification societies by smaller countries .
With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference and the subsequent reform of the European institutions , it is particularly serious that moves are being made towards strengthening the power of a small number of large countries to the detriment of the decision-making ability of the great majority of small and medium-sized countries .
( PT ) Parliament has just voted for a resolution on the Nice Summit in which : 1 - It does not deal clearly or in depth with any of the issues in which there were major divergences among the Member States in the work leading up to the IGC , leaving all the main Amsterdam left-overs without any prospects even now .
.
We can therefore only vote against this report .
The priority of this proposal for a framework decision is to promote the protection and effectiveness of victims ' rights in this process , specifically with regard to simplifying access to the law , to the courts and to legal information as well as to promote and protect victims ' rights in the field of compensation for loss and damages .
The necessary measures to ensure that the victims can re-establish their normal lives should also be provided , not only in financial terms , but also so that they may benefit , should it prove necessary , from legal , psychological or medical assistance or help from the social services .
Often , in services that wish to have a human face , the best experiences are provided by institutions of social solidarity and other non-governmental organisations .
This latter proposal is the subject of this report , which essentially warrants our approval , particularly as regards the simplification of access to rights , courts and legal information , and the promotion and protection of victims ' rights in matters of compensation for loss and damages through redress mechanisms .
The result was , in fact , that the most fundamental and important factor for introducing operational efficiency , decisiveness , flexibility and workability into institution operations was not dealt with at all .
Right now it is the duty of convinced pro-Europeans to counter the image that came out of Nice and say that solidarity for us has a meaning and that it is possible to build a Europe in which large and small countries can coexist peacefully ; in other words , there are no expendable countries in this European project and national egos are nonsense in this Europe .
As a result of intense negotiations and successive compromises among the various institutions , the chances of its approval are reasonable .
If the submission of such a report is not seen as just one more formality , the hopes that many of us have placed in this new step will be justified .
These facts can only concern us , and therefore the initial optimism that was so clear in the Commission ' s communication should be reconsidered and tempered to some extent .
The democratisation process in Indonesia deserves due recognition and therefore support .
It is unacceptable that they should escape justice because of a recently enacted law .
We can support the democratisation process , as we have been doing ; what we cannot do is take the place of the protagonists in this process .
In February this year , the Commission embarked on a new political initiative with regard to Indonesia , to which we also gave our approval here .
We must learn from this lesson by sending Indonesia clearer and unambiguous signals , not contradictory ones .
Mr President , I should like to add my words to those of my colleagues , regarding both the content of the report and in congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on her realistic approach to it , and especially for being true to the values and principles of our European Union .
Secondly , it is important that the Indonesian authorities allow non-governmental organisations free passage to get medical and humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of Indonesia and to the Timorese who are in a situation of such human misery that these organisations should not be denied access .
