The problem needs to be addressed urgently in my opinion , with demographic pressures in recent years already generating deficits in the pay-as-you-go schemes in France , Germany , Italy and Spain .
It is even predicted that if the current trend continues some countries will be facing costs of up to 20 % of their GDP in the next ten years for their pension liabilities .
There are , of course , many risks with equity investments , but there are even greater risks to Europe with stagnant economies .
Growing pension funds will dynamise our economies by providing large additional capital funds for investment not only in the EU , but also in developing markets , with greater prospects for future growth and returns on investment for our pensioners .
In the case of defined contribution schemes , which give the investor a direct stake in the overall health of the national economy , there will also be a sense of participation in the country of that individual .
The state scheme will of course remain the primary mechanism for basic provision in old age .
But personal responsibility and choice will become the watchwords of success if the demographic challenges of the coming century are to be met successfully .
That is why we should not be too prescriptive regarding the issues of biometric risks or investment strategies .
We need a light-touch regulatory framework , with bilateral tax agreements , which will ensure the portability for those EU nationals wishing to work abroad throughout the Union , achieve a genuine single market in financial services and provide maximum choice to the European investor .
Mr President , firstly can I say that the EMAC report is pretty good and I hope we do not amend it too much .
The key word is " supplementary " pensions .
We are not trying to relieve poverty or provide a basic income in retirement .
The second point is that it is important that we provide decent pensions to enable citizens to move around Europe .
So I welcome the emphasis on removing the restrictions on the investment of pension fund portfolios and support the objective of removing barriers to labour mobility .
The key is to keep it simple or it will not work , it will not remove the obstacles .
As Mr Tannock has said , there are demographic pressures upon us and it is in our interest to facilitate the development of supplementary pension schemes both around Europe and also in many countries within Europe .
On the issue of biometric risks , which we have heard a lot about , clearly a pension by definition has one biometric risk , which is longevity .
Once you start building on top of that , you are on dangerous ground if you make it a condition of a passport .
What we need is to have a very simple proposition , and then let the market sort the rest of it out because that is what the market is for .
The biometric risks problem means many different things to different people .
We must try and get a simple product which is marketable and can be moved around this market , because if we do not , we will end up with a product that does not work at all that the different Member States cannot make use of .
So the key is to keep it simple and make it work .
Mr President , on behalf of our Group I should like to warmly welcome Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s excellent report .
As she said in her introduction , she has made the very wise decision to focus on what are the most critical issues for the creation of the single market .
I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes .
The first one is the need to address , within the Union , the impact of legislation on business .
It is particularly important that we ask the Commission to reinforce its activities , to ensure proper compliance cost assessment and to assess the costs on businesses of the new legislation .
I say to the Commissioner that we do not expect this to be done as an after-thought , after all the departments in the Commission have developed legislation .
It needs to be an integral part of the policy and regulation process .
He must make sure that from now on that a central objective is to help the internal market to move forward .
We were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at Lisbon .
Our committee and , indeed , our Group has been emphasising , since this new Parliament started last year , the need to encourage the development of small - and medium-sized enterprises across the European Union .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s report emphasises a number of key points such as the need to make business formation cheaper and quicker and the need to remove some of the barriers preventing entrepreneurs from benefiting from the risks of putting capital into starting up new businesses .
I am disappointed to see that our Socialist colleagues are proposing that clause should be taken out of this resolution .
I can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow .
I invite colleagues to reject that proposal .
I conclude by confirming that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market will continue to press vigorously for the speedy completion of the internal market .
I give credit to all our colleagues , across all political groups , for the speed with which we have dealt with the electronic commerce directive this week .
I hope that is appreciated .
I hope it will demonstrate that we are prepared to work with speed .
I hope that , together , we can really make the internal market work as quickly
