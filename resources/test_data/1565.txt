It could damage and delay the adhesion process for some prospective members , causing rifts between them , and might create different opportunities at the outset - such as the opportunity to attract foreign investment - which would discriminate unfairly between them .
To down-value the redistributive aspect and function of the Community budget and underestimate the costs of enlargement for reasons connected with the present internal politics of one Member State or another would be not only a deplorable mistake but a near reductio ad absurdum of this process , which is decisive for the future of the European Union .
In the same way , it makes no allowance for the need to maintain and develop efforts to achieve the minimum acceptable levels for real internal cohesion , whether it be the level that the existing Member States are aiming at or the level that is increasingly imposing enlargement on countries which generally represent a third of the per capita gross domestic product of the fifteen-State European Union .
This plan may result in the least developed countries in the Union at present becoming the principal sources of finance for the new needs that will come with enlargement .
So I reject any internal institutional , financial or other strategy of the present Member States which involves taking applicant countries hostage .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is clear that such a great historic design requires more than weak-kneed accountants to deal with governments !
That objective is incompatible with divisions between the applicant countries or a reduction in social and economic cohesion funds , both of which could in themselves bring about the disintegration of the European Union .
The SDP places equal importance on the clarity of this report in making the acceptance of new Member States absolutely conditional upon their respect for democracy and individual freedom .
For these fundamental reasons we support Cyprus 's application to be admitted to the European Union and elect to deal with the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as sole negotiator at the forthcoming talks , which is the United Nations position .
In our view , there should be at least three criteria for enlargement .
Rather than presuming to lecture peoples who may perhaps have something they can teach us , or at least help us to learn , about how to overcome certain difficulties , we would do better to examine ourselves a little and , before we try to impose our will at all costs , make a determined effort to resolve the problems we say only other people have .
As the rapporteur says , the Commission 's proposals were based on extremely tenuous premises , for no-one can foresee the real effects of the introduction of the euro , the new round of negotiations within the World Trade Organization - especially in the agricultural sector - and , more generally , the combination of accelerating technological change and the globalization of the economy .
My group has made it clear in its declaration that it is voting in support of Mr Colom i Naval 's report , not accepting that the limit of 1.27 % of GDP for the Community budget is 'untouchable ' , when there is no reliable assessment of the needs we shall have to face at this historic time , nor that the funds to be distributed should only be drawn from Category 2 , that is to say , they should only be taken away from the present beneficiaries of structural funding ; from regions which , like Portugal , still have enormous deficits and whose per capita GDP is less than half the Community average .
This means that since the European Union is in many ways a heterogeneous area , a mosaic of different pieces , and since we have adopted policy dynamics that aggravate inequality , deepen differences and can deal unequal and ever greater blows , what we really need is to coordinate our internal economic policy , but that coordination must be founded on different responses and on appropriate instruments and structures .
Although the single currency is an instrument , however , an unequal instrument will not create equality , a retrograde instrument will not aid progress , and an instrument with no real objective capacity for competitiveness will not make anyone competitive .
Despite the fact that we do not share the predominant view , we are not intimidated , even when claims of unanimity are made when there are opposing votes and abstentions .
That question raised the matter of the disastrous agricultural policy to which the structural funds were applied in my country .
The number of the question is 3479/97 and it was submitted on 20 October .
It centres on the priorities and in defining them it takes the interaction between science and society into account .
But the widest gaps exist between those countries which favour research and want it concentrated on products for development , and those others , like Portugal , for whom the development and transfer of technology has to be their major preoccupation , together with mobility of research grants ; because that is the only way they can be sure of getting their share of the improvement in the efficiency of European research policy .
I will conclude , Mr President , while on the subject of my proposals concerning the ocean , by reminding the House that with the Union signing the United Nations Convention on the oceans , the work of the Independent Commission on the Oceans , and Expo 98 in Lisbon , I am sure that a climate is being created in which a full-blown European Oceans Agency will fall into our laps one of these days .
We must remember that in Portugal , for example , the liberalization of telecommunications and the privatization of their
