The Commission is also examining the proper procurement process and the problems that go along with it , from the viewpoint of the producer exclusively , and not the private sector .
The public procurement process should be improved so that the working conditions and job security of those employed in the procurement service can be taken into account in connection with competitive activity .
The Deputy Mayor of Helsinki has said publicly that he was assured by the Commission that the city of Helsinki could have built a gigantic harbour , although , as you well know and as you yourselves have publicly stated , the importance of bird-life in this area is very clearly grounded on the directive on birdlife .
Is it possible that the Deputy Mayor of Helsinki is telling the truth , or what is actually going on here ?
However , it is hoped the Union can promote useful projects to achieve that extra credibility for Europe , and increase crucial understanding and confidence .
The common attitude of the Council , the result of which the extra funding required by Parliament is rejected , is totally incomprehensible in the light of the issue .
The Socrates programme has already achieved much to improve quality in training in Europe , and it is very important that we carry on with the work to do with the development of further training for teachers and language learning .
Aside from current Member States , the Socrates programme has much to offer applicant countries in Central and eastern Europe .
We ca n't afford to allow such an excellent and vital programme to wither away into just a kind of elitist programme with dwindling aid and diminishing aided project numbers .
I sincerely hope that in future arbitration we will be successful in salvaging the EU training policy flag-ship , Socrates , and that in the future more young people will have the chance of an internationalised and interactive education , regardless of background or origin .
Mr President , it is sad to realise that the representatives of Rhone Poulenc have been lying about the Acryl amide content of this material .
I know many in this Parliament appear to believe in this latter , but surely this example once again shows that there is a need for legislation .
As a member of the Committee on Budgets , I can say that we are soon going to be voting fully consciously on the report on products used in the construction industry .
It is obviously clear that materials are always coming onto the market , whose effects are not sufficiently well-known , which is also especially true when it comes to how they behave when released into the natural environment .
The payment of the refund is based , for example , on the fact that exportation reduces beef intervention costs and the overproduction of beef , and fulfills the demand on the part of abattoirs in third world countries , which animals raised elsewhere would do if the EU were to put an end to exports .
Cruel handling of live animals , as was the case , for example , with the loading of animals on board ship in Marseilles , when countless animals were maltreated , only came out when TV documentaries were shown in various Member States .
Better care is taken now of livestock during loading on board ship .
There is still the problem of how the treatment of livestock can be monitored during transportation and during unloading in ports in third world countries .
In my report I have tried to construct a comprehensive and workable scheme , whereby the observation of animal protection regulations can actually be monitored .
Penalties will reflect the legislation obtaining in Member States ' legislation .
So that sample inspections may be possible , the route and timetable of the journey must be submitted beforehand to the relevant authorities in those Member States through which transportation is to take place .
The export refund must be reduced or entirely withdrawn if any regulations are broken during transportation .
The most difficult thing is to check what happens to livestock when it arrives outside the EU at ports in the third world .
The responsibility of the transportation company and the driver ends when the animals have arrived at the destination , and the driver cannot be held responsible for mistakes made at the port of destination outside the EU area .
I furthermore suggest , through the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party , that companies concerned with transportation should meet the costs of the checks .
The Commission 's resources are modest , and are not enough to warrant paying the costs of the checks .
These would work for the Commission without being a part of it .
I await rapid action on the part of the Commission regarding the necessary legislation .
Writing it was a very educational experience .
Before extending the common decision-making process , the logic of parliamentary decisions must be improved .
To improve matters , the Commission has now suggested an amendment to the decree on the export subsidy .
According to the motion for an amendment , it will be paid on condition that Community regulations are being obeyed .
On the contrary , it is astonishing that this condition was not imposed earlier , as the general conditions that pertain to agricultural subsidies have for a long time been that the rules are being observed .
Naturally , it might be claimed that the exporter is unable to supervise the transportation process .
This is clearly justifiable .
Examples of this are the caged rearing of calves for the production of white meat for gourmet restaurants , force-feeding of geese , where the bird has food forcibly pumped into its stomach to make
