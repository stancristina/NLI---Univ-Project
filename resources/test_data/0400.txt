In particular , within the framework of multiannual cooperation projects under the programme , a network could be created of important architectural communities in various Member States with a population of up to 1 000 inhabitants .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the man-made environment of Europe , which consists of sub-sets of various architectural forms and eras , is changing considerably due to unbridled overdevelopment and the existence of incompatible structures which are out of tune with the particular historical and architectural characteristics of their locality .
Commissioner , cultural heritage is an important element in the identity and historical development of the peoples of Europe .
Special attention must therefore be given to protecting and promoting the natural and architectural cultural heritage of island and other rural regions of Europe , given that these areas retain a great many of their characteristics unchanged .
Israel is guilty of a great many war crimes , as confirmed by the reports of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch .
We call for the creation in our region , including Israel , of a nuclear-free zone .
It approves Resolution 1701 , welcomes the despatch of European occupying forces and pushes for the disarmament of grassroots forces which heroically resisted the unfair , aggressive war .
In this way it consents to the implementation of the imperialist plans .
It welcomes the occupying presence of the ΕU in the Middle East , which does not guarantee peace for the benefit of the peoples , but will fuel an escalation in the situation in a bid to implement the ΝΑΤΟ plan to control the area .
The arrest of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah was the pretext to apply a prepared plan .
We need to condemn the policy of Israel towards Palestine outright and to decide to return immediately to the negotiating table with a view to quickly finding a final solution .     . – Unfortunately , Mr President , the motion only contains a limited reference to the possibility of not reforesting privately-owned areas which qualify as forested areas .
These criminal policies are being helped by inadequate resources and a lack of personnel , emphasising the political responsibilities of the EU and the governments and the inhumane and anti-environmental consequences of the policies they apply .
With the consent of Barcelona 's shareholders and the United Nations , UNICEF and its work will be promoted by the Spanish club for five years , with all the money collected over that period used for humanitarian aid for suffering nations , mainly in Africa .
Air pollution is and will remain one of the most important public health problems .
The strategy we propose defines the steps we need to make in this direction .
As far as the natural environment is concerned , we expect the size of ecosystems at risk of acidification to fall by over 50 % and the size of ecosystems at risk due to the presence of excessive nitrogen levels to fall by over 30 % .
This will also address the problem of cross-border pollution .
Other Euro VI proposals will also be tabled for lorries and buses and the directive on national upper emission limits will also be reviewed , setting new emission limits for the Member States .
The proposal maintains the current limit values for air quality .
Maximum permissible concentration limits are proposed for entry into force in 2010 .
The repercussions on health are extremely serious and the data are incontrovertible .
In the United States , PM2.5 targets have applied since 1995 .
Uncontrolled emissions from natural sources are not included in the figures .
With these arrangements , the Member States will clearly be in a position to comply with the directive .
The new amendment tabled before this plenary , Amendment 81 , is a move in the right direction , but again cannot be accepted because , if we accept four plus two years from the entry into force of the new directive , this will delay compliance until 2013 for the limit values for PM10 already agreed in 1999 .
The Commission cannot , therefore , accept any watering down of the daily limit value for PM10 .
By watering down the daily limit value or by taking measures to combat the problem of pollution ?
I think I must stop here .     – Mr President , Commissioner , although pollutants in the air are difficult to see , they do nonetheless jeopardise our health .
We should emphasise that reducing the upper limit for concentrations of PM2.5 will certainly benefit European citizens .
We owe you a debt of gratitude , Jonas , and I personally extend you my especial thanks , because you taught me a great deal as a new MEP here .
Before I continue , I should like to share with you the welcome news that the Commissioners approved the seventh and final thematic strategy on soil last Friday .
With the Sixth Environmental Action Programme , the Commission recognised the role which the urban environment plays in the lives of so many European citizens and undertook to take action in this sector .
Clearly urban areas promote economic growth and have high levels of supply of and access to public services , such as education , health and transport .
This mainly applies when the objective is to find solutions which can be tried and are viable and suitable for the plethora and variety of conditions and problems in the various cities of the European Union .
I wish that it were in fact possible for us to proceed in this manner .
Unfortunately , this is not useful or feasible and there are basic reasons why the strategy is not in favour of introducing new legislation .
We already have legislation which has a positive impact on
