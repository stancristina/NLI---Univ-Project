I have an excellent standard of living because I travel , I visit places .
And that is what I am saying .
I am glad to say that , today , the European Parliament is called upon to debate that which falls within its remit : not the issue of free , legal , prohibited drugs , therefore , but the evaluation and possible reform of the current policies .
We paid for the militarisation of our society .
I could continue but I have run out of time .
Now , in view of the Ministerial Conference due to take place next week in Vienna , the European Parliament is being called upon to present a proposal , to express its position .
The report also appears to be deficient in that it does not combine the proposals for measures in the current situation with pre-emptive initiatives to limit the phenomenon in the future .
That said , and I would like it to be recorded in the Minutes , at least , I would particularly like to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , especially Mr Deprez and Mr von Boetticher , for their hard work which has enabled us to achieve a common position .
The European Commission has already expressed itself on the issue of democratic control , proposing to establish a joint committee , consisting of members of both the Member States ' and European Parliament committees responsible for police matters .
In the face of all this , we in the committee - and , I hope , tomorrow , the House - noting that repeated requests and proposals for real , improved democratic control and powers on Europol have been ignored , can only condemn the fact that the proposed changes are mainly aesthetic and make a mockery of the European Parliament and the European citizens which elected it .
We welcome their return with joy and admiration , admiration for their endurance in the face of so much suffering , for the heroism they have shown during the long decades of communist dictatorship .
Of all the countries returning to Europe , Poland has a particular role and particular importance , not just because it is the largest country but because it is there , in Poland - as Commissioner Verheugen pointed out , and we would like to thank him for the immense amount of excellent work he has done - that the battle for freedom from tyranny started which subsequently served as an example and encouragement to other countries .
Parliament too has played an important part , giving powerful impetus to the accession process .
Mr President , new cultures will bring added value and more security to the individual States and the European family .
Thus , Slovenia 's situation was similar to but less complex than that of some of the other candidate countries .
Parliament is endorsing the work achieved by the candidate countries , on which the European Council will pass judgment .
This is not empty rhetoric : I am expressing my awareness of the responsibility we bear in saying 'yes ' or 'no ' in this matter .
The European Union will only survive and develop if , I reiterate , the Community method prevails in the Convention .
Therefore , while I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to them , I hope and pray that the future Parliament , including the Members from the Member States , will guarantee the citizens , starting with European Union employees , a peaceful future in which the elderly are duly respected .
Mr President , it was with great enthusiasm that I voted for the entry into the European Union of the Republic of Cyprus .
Moreover , I hope that a representative of the Lithuanian Pensioners ' Party will join the European Parliament to support me in upholding the rights of all the elderly throughout Europe .
Mr President , I hope that Poland too - and I voted for its accession - will send a representative of the Polish Pensioners ' Party to the next European Parliament , who will stand shoulder to shoulder with me in this House so that I have more power to protect all the elderly throughout Europe .
It is also of primary importance that we create a single European representative for these two policies .
Mr President , the Morillon report treats European defence as part of a realistic , responsible strategy of solidarity and complementarity with the United States , and it therefore represents a substantial undertaking , involving planning , economic sacrifices and military investment .
Before abandoning itself to developing the institutional system , the Union must define its political vision more clearly , it must ensure the security of its people , territory and borders - which it has failed to do in the Balkans - it must take note of the erosion of arms control and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of bloody dictatorships , and it must strive resolutely to combat terrorism and to bring about security for Israel and a democratic Palestinian state .
Never has the lack of an unambiguous , united voice been felt so much as in this tragic situation .
After the very serious Iraq crisis , even those who did not support these goals before must stop burying their heads in the sand .
A roadmap which is both practical and visionary must be proposed , as in the case of Monetary Union .
However , as General Morillon - a French general but a leading player in Europe - said , one cannot expect to take part in the decision-making process if one does not share the burdens too .
It is therefore undoubtedly of interest to research
