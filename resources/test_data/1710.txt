debt .
Keep the Lisbon strategy , but make sure the monetary policy applied by the Central Bank also helps .
This is a policy mix that combines prudence and growth but , if we are to achieve it , the Central Bank also has to cooperate .
I believe culture is the primary product in Europe , taking precedence over the economy , the army and diplomacy .
Come and let us make it the capital of culture , come and let us breathe life into a city which barbarity has deprived of life .
It is a good idea : for us to take decisions where diplomacy cannot , for us to take decisions where denial is particularly distressing .
Come and let us give real meaning to this initiative .
Mr President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , I fully endorse what Mrs Ries said at the end , that the links between the environment and health are a particularly important priority for the European Commission and Europe .
We should not forget that we are not starting from scratch .
The objective of the action plan is to further promote this work and , at the same time , to determine the agenda for the future .
It can indeed be an essential element in our policy for risk evaluation , as the report suggests .
We likewise agree on air inside buildings .
For the period up to 2007 , the Commission will finance the budgets of the four Directorates-General involved , of the programme in the public health sector and of the Sixth Research Framework Programme .
Of course , the Commission will report to the relevant parliamentary committee on progress with the action plan as regularly as possible .
As regards the ban on substances , an issue on which Mrs Ries spoke earlier , dangerous substances are an issue which particularly concerns the Commission .
The Commission is carefully examining the proposal in the report to increase the number of priorities in the action plan .
That is why I should like once again to thank Mrs Ries and the European Parliament for their important contribution in this sector .
I should also like to point out that this priority is shared by many of my colleagues in the Commission , who have agreed to adjust the Regional , Agricultural and other Funds in order to include Natura 2000 in financing .
If , therefore , it is found that management of these areas is not being adequately supported , the Commission is prepared to refer the Member State in question to the Court of Justice .
Consequently , there is no facility to determine a specific sum within any one fund .
For the time being also , we cannot know what sums it will be possible to make available each year for cofinancing of Natura 2000 areas during the period from 2007 to 2013 .
I shall come back to this point at the end of my intervention .
Natura 2000 is also included – and this is important – in the second land management axis in the new rural development regulation , which will account for 25 % of its total .
The new regulations contain mechanisms which allow the Commission , as I said earlier , to provide guidance and to control to some degree the content of the programmes submitted by the Member States .
Once the strategic guidelines have been issued , the Member States will need to prepare national strategic frameworks during the second half of 2005 or in early 2006 , together with operational programmes , which they will submit to the Commission .
If , of course , it is found that a national programme does not include adequate financial coverage for all this , the Commission services always have the right to reject it .
This is something that we oncologists know about and , unfortunately , frequently come up against .
I would like to emphasise here that smoking , against which Commissioner Kyprianou is campaigning , is the basic but not the only environmental factor which plays a huge part in the development of cancer .
There is an urgent need for certain specific dangerous substances referred to in the report to be withdrawn from the European market , especially as safer alternatives are available .
Nor does it stipulate where the money will come from .
I therefore consider that the adjustment needs to be made in this direction .
Of them , France , Germany , England , Sweden and Belgium criticised the Commission for failing to hold adequate consultations on the matter , for failing to investigate the consequences of application .
Legislation is becoming more accessible , more transparent and more efficient in sectors which are basic to our freedom of movement within a single European market .
The mutual recognition of sanctions will help this , thereby promoting an area of security and justice in the European Union .
This proposal for a directive also helps to strengthen road safety , which is the basic objective of the European policy .
The policy of the European Union aims to develop maritime transport and , at the same time , to protect the marine environment and this is an objective we all share .
In such a case , Community law will violate international law and , at the same time , will undermine the authority of the International Maritime Organisation , which is the only agency which can apply measures to protect the seas at international level because , we must not forget , shipping is a global activity which cannot have numerous standards .
Seamen already have a hard and dangerous life .
The large majority of citizens call for stricter measures to prevent pollution from ships , which affects not only the environment and public health but also fishing and tourism
