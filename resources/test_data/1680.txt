The European Union , therefore , has an obligation to promote these attempts at approximation with the aim of ensuring the interoperability of means both at intra-European and transatlantic levels , in order to avoid pointless and wasteful duplication and overlapping .
To bring my speech to a close , I shall take this opportunity to summarise the main conclusions of the report that we will be voting on tomorrow .
In its resolution of April 2002 , the European Parliament urged the Commission to address industry - and market-related issues in the context of the European defence industry .
In this context , I should like to emphasise that an impact assessment study is currently being conducted on the issue of simplifying intra-Community transfers of defence equipment .
Mr Queiró’s report broadly supports the Commission ’s approach of strengthening the European defence base in industrial and technological matters , by gradually establishing a European defence equipment market and by promoting research in the field of security .
In this spirit , the Commission plans to be involved in the Agency’s development and operations , to help it to achieve its objectives , as defined by the European Council .
The offensiveness of this claim does not deserve a response , but the slur on my good name that it represents forces me to protest .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk for his excellent report on the annual report on the stabilisation and association process produced by the Commission in March 2003 .
We are grateful for the support expressed in the Thessaloniki agenda for the Commission 's proposal to increase the CARDS budget by more than EUR 200 million for the period 2004-2006 , and welcome the fact that the Commission 's proposal for the 2004 budget has been approved at first reading .
As regards the Thessaloniki commitments , I believe that work is well under way on implementing our part of the commitments made in Thessaloniki .
The study points to both progress and continuing weaknesses .
The policy of the European Union is to support the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro for the period of the three years provided by the Belgrade agreement .
Like the Council , we welcome the intention of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General , Mr Harry Holkeri , to set out more concrete guidelines for progress , and to implement the 'standards before status ' policy on the basis of a work plan to be coordinated with the European Union 's monitoring of standards .
The proposal being examined by Parliament today , under which the Stability Pact would be included in the scope of Council Regulation (EC ) No 1080/2000 , will provide the Pact with a sound and solid basis on which to fulfil the crucial mandate given by the international community .
The Commission also agrees with the wider objective of closely associating Parliament in following the work of the Stability Pact .
The appointed special coordinator will appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs as necessary , and at least twice at year , to report on its activities .
In this context , the Schengen Information System ( SIS ) has played quite an important role , which we are attempting to extend even further by creating a second generation of the SIS that has been designed for SIS II .
This new system is being created in order to address three major issues .
The third and last issue – that of economy – is that , despite having more functions and more users , the system must be more homogeneous , more flexible , more secure and perform better .
Consequently , discussions are ongoing on proposals for the introduction of new functions , new users , a new architecture , new synergies , in particular with the visa information system , and new management .
As to the issue that the rapporteur raised , concerning the nature of the Schengen Information System , I should like to recall that , since the very beginning , police authorities have been authorised users of the System , in particular in the context of their monitoring activities within EU territory .
As regards SIS II , the Council has to date confined itself to accepting its existing functions and to providing broad guidelines on new functions .
Currently , the project to develop SIS I I is at the stage of publishing the call for tender .
Finally , Mr Coelho’s report refers specifically to the need to harmonise the principles of data protection .
As the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority states , the proposals to develop the SIS and the creation of SIS I I constitute a sea-change in the nature of the system itself : whereas the SIS only alerts the relevant authorities in the event that an individual , whose details are on file , crosses the Schengen border , SIS I I will probably become a multifunctional research tool .
The balance between privacy and security must not be altered by adopting information and communication technologies that have been created by governments as a response to the increased risks posed by new and dangerous criminal phenomena .
Consequently , if we wish to continue to guarantee the principle of abolishing our internal borders , we must be able to assume our responsibilities by better monitoring the external borders .
No, it is something else .
I understand people’s doubts and fears , but I do wish to say one thing : there is a considerable difference between the fact that I , as Commissioner , am talking to you here about the Schengen Information System I I and the fact that , in relation to the first system , there was no Commissioner to give an answer here , about what was being done .
The Commission attaches very great importance to this summit with Canada and is ready to
