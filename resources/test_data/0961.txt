help this directive to be adopted here .
I think article 4 is technically better in this proposal than last time .
For a directive with a shared burden of proof to work we need provisions , as Amendment No 9 says , on the right to receive information .
Documents which may contain sensitive information about someone 's state of health and so on should not be released .
It can therefore be accepted and approved , while the debate about Amendment No 3 also shows that the boundaries between the first and third pillars of the structure of our Union are very difficult to maintain .
In certain alloys the nickel can come out .
The interests of the nickel industry should not be set up against people 's health .
I entirely agree that nickel should obviously not be present in euro coins .
It is the issue of equality and class .
So it is young , defenceless women who are affected by nickel allergy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen and Mr Commissioner , it is extremely important that we have clear , tough rules on safety at sea .
In that context , the EU has an important complementary role to play in ensuring that the international conventions , in this case the SOLAS Convention , are implemented .
I think this formulation is far too superficial .
That bodes well for a better implementation .
Since accidents in recent years have been shown to occur because of inadequate supervision of the rules , it is particularly important that these rules are supervised .
On the contrary , sound government finance and a balanced budget are a long-term precondition for us to be able to maintain and develop our welfare systems .
The high level of unemployment costs our welfare systems a lot of money .
I think the rapporteur 's proposal for a staggered retirement age is an excellent one .
I personally prefer a pension system with founded on a basic element which can then be built on with an income-based element .
Of course it should be possible to dismiss a judge who commits a crime .
As a good liberal , I would like to distinguish between the judiciary and the political legislature .
Even if we do radically alter our policies today , we know that emissions are going to increase for decades to come .
Not least we support the proposals for monitoring and sanctions , which are very important .
That must also mean that the EU , regardless of the outcome of Kyoto , should go ahead and try to achieve the goals which have been set .
Mr President , the Kyoto conference on our future climate is , in my opinion , an extremely important event .
I am also deeply concerned about my own country 's efforts leading up to this conference .
The reason for this is the closure of two nuclear reactors in Barsebäck , both of which work very well and have a high safety standard .
I hope it will be possible to introduce a carbon tax at EU level .
In Europe we have a rapid development of vehicles driven by alternative methods , such as electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles .
Or is it the EU which has difficulty in keeping track of its money ?
The European Commission has 17 , 000 employees .
Mr President , like so many others I agree that the consequences of BSE are terrible and tragic .
I think that is good and I also welcome the measures the Commission has taken .
We must have a system for registering cattle and a control system which ensures that the legislation is complied with .
I can do nothing but agree with the committee 's and the rapporteur 's opinions on the report of the group of experts and even with the opinions which have been given on the Luxembourg compromise proposal which means that any statute for European companies would under no circumstances be allowed to result in it being possible to circumvent the workers ' right of co-determination in companies .
Nor shall it be possible to use European legal instruments to circumvent the right of co-determination .
This is a decentralized system which provides a lot of local influence , which is good .
Proposals for minimum rules could therefore be one way to gain influence and a good remedy when negotiations have failed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Commissioner , many of us have great hopes leading up to the forthcoming summit in Luxembourg .
Many people believe that growth is the only thing that can help us out of unemployment .
I believe there are very many solutions in which we must have faith .
Otherwise they will end up outside the labour market for a long time .
It is also absolutely essential to have an environmental tax reform linked to a reduction of tax on work .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Mr Hernández Mollar on his report and on a very good speech .
But I think that some of the wording in the Jöns report suggests a fear of leaving anything unregulated .
It can be seen that countries with a lower level of regulation have also succeeded best in the fight against unemployment .
The UK under a Conservative government is a prime example .
But the keyword is entrepreneurship .
For that we should not switch taxes , but reduce them .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , I believe our most important task in the eyes of the general public is to solve unemployment in Europe .
We need reduced tax on employment and increased tax on environmental and natural resources , as many have said .
We also need lots of local solutions
