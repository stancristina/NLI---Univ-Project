not therefore be looking to make savings with this regulation and from these small farms by excluding them .
Now to the individual proposed amendments .
You said we would need another hundred million .
Our objective is not to make so-called savings and no such insinuation should be made ; our objective is to make people 's lives easier here while guaranteeing budgetary neutrality .
This fragile structure is based on respect for other people 's culture .
We must also remember that it is hemmed in between Tibet , which now belongs to China , and India , with tensions threatening to come to a head between these two heavily populated countries .
King Birendra , whom I met once as Vice-Chairman of the SAARC delegation , was very popular and very well liked .
The honourable Member has just mentioned one which caused very serious damage in several Member States and neighbouring countries .
The references to the monitoring and information centre are a constructive contribution .
Another important point is the principle of regionalisation .
The financial contribution paid in return will be EUR 350 000 per annum .
.
Every time I protest , I am told that this is exceptional .
A majority of members of visual artists ' associations and representative bodies , with whom I have spoken during the last few years , now want to see European resale rights .
Finally , I should not like to brush aside one further argument , for that is not something I can do , but , rather , to qualify it somewhat .
I should also like to say , however , that the purpose of introducing resale rights is to enable practitioners of the visual arts to benefit from the subsequent financial success of their works .
Otherwise , there should be the threat of financial sanctions .
That was the theme in Trier this year at the Second European Road Traffic Law Conference : in other words , the accident victim ' s right to claim directly against his own insurer .
I consider it necessary to press very hard for a solution for the traffic sector in particular .
However , you have been successful , and we are also grateful that a broad majority of the Swedish people is in favour of enlargement .
( Applause ) Mr President-in-Office , let me make one more observation .
As an Austrian , I know that it is by no means an easy task .
Vandalism , a blind destructive frenzy and criminal violence , all of which should be condemned , and my Group most certainly does condemn them .
It is just as incomprehensible that important legislative initiatives like the creation of a single European sky are already blocked within the Commission .
We wanted to create a level playing field in Europe as regards company takeovers .
The result of this directive will be that in future protected companies will be able to take over unprotected companies .
I am a shareholder myself .
However , I can also tell you that we have never been treated so frostily in any of the Conciliation Committees in which I have been involved .
I firmly believe that , and I will continue to work towards that , and not just during this parliamentary term .
They see the resale right as being a major economic disadvantage , because it will inevitably lead to a drop in the initial sale price .
Rational authority depends on a reliable assessment of the facts .
Sixth , as an important partner in macroeconomic decision making , the ECB should make its contribution to improving the coordination of economic policies and the generation of an appropriate and balanced policy mix , just as other independent central banks do , without diminishing its independence in the process .
The euro has certainly not become a job machine or acted as a brake on inflation , which is precisely what was rashly promised to the public earlier on .
The euro is not " coming" , as you see on many posters , it already exists , and it is a success .
If anything , it is precisely in the current difficult situation that the European Central Bank should be measured by its own yardstick .
I am not giving away any secrets if I tell you that we have obtained all the position papers and proposals drafted by the finance industry , and in particular the investment sector .
We parliamentarians should not let ourselves be frightened off by technocrats who say that all this would not be possible and that it would not be compatible with the treaties .
The high costs in countries like Austria are partly attributable to the fact that we have virtually introduced a separate insurance system for each professional group .
So my question is whether the Commission could take an initiative in this area .
The Council - sometimes working in conjunction with the Commission - has recently adopted the image of a product counterfeiter .
Mr President , this morning Mr Karas said that there will be a large majority in favour .
I regret that we have not been able to set any binding national targets .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , but I also wish to make a couple of observations .
I regard it as progress that a certain element of labelling is associated with the " .EU" domain .
Therefore , particularly at a time when over 90 % of the most frequently visited web sites are in the USA and about 70 % of e-commerce is transacted in the USA , I can only urge you to vote for this proposal .
In formal terms , these amendments ultimately fitted very well into a compromise that was excepted by the committee with 49 out of 50 votes , with one abstention
