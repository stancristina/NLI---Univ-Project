, to overturn the current policy , expressions of it and foreign intervention .     – Mr President , when talking about the financing of the Union from 2007 to 2013 , I personally have two concerns : one relating to the amount of financing and the second relating to the timetable for taking decisions .
However , in all events , enlargement should not operate to the detriment of the current cohesion countries and should not operate to the detriment of the cohesion policies of the European Union .
I hope that is the case .
Alternative solutions to extend the budget would appear to me to be extremely difficult .
The proposals submitted by the previous European Commission are , in our view , a good and balanced basis for discussion .
This is deceiving the citizens of the European Union .
However , we wish to make clear that only a good and efficient agreement will be politically acceptable , an agreement which will efficiently safeguard development , employment , cohesion and solidarity for all citizens and all regions of the Union .     – Mr President , the European Parliament at the start of hard and difficult negotiations needs to send out three clear messages : first , that we categorically reject the coercive letter for the Six , because this will result in less of a Europe and greater internal inequalities , in a Europe which is unable to support the policies decided by the European Union itself .
Secondly , that we are seeking a multiannual financial framework which will allow prompt planning of policies and programmes and , of course , that we reject four- or five-year scenarios .
The Prodi package is simply a good starting point and we all need to agree that a bigger Europe with less money is out of the question .     – Mr President , I think that we should perhaps look at the problem from a different angle .
According to the Commission , spending on this sector in Europe up to 2013 will rise to EUR 23 billion .
However , Japan , for example , has 3 % and , precisely because it does not have these linkages , is now in recession and research and technology has not helped at all in getting it out of recession .
If the demand side is to work properly , there must be cooperation between what is now the single monetary policy and financial policy .
Today in particular , on 1 December , which has been designated ' World AIDS Day ' , I think it is important that we exchange views and a few thoughts as to how this scourge can be combated .
However , HIV/AIDS is causing very deep and constantly increasing concern here in Europe and our neighbouring countries .
This subject is exceptionally topical .
In the European Union , the number of cases of HIV increased by 75 % between 1996 and 2003 , with the largest increase in the Baltic States .
The European Commission is addressing the matter both inside and outside the European Union .
It also offers a compendium of best practices for combating the recent wave of the epidemic and highlights the Commission 's short-term proposals for addressing the situation .
We badly need an information campaign throughout Europe .
I should like to stress that the impression that the transmission of HIV is limited to these vulnerable groups is totally unfounded .
Generally speaking , access to antiretroviral treatment at affordable prices would appear to be fairly good within the European Union .
Nonetheless , certain Member States have expressed their concern about the future : if , or rather when , the number of cases of HIV spirals and the cost of treatment remains high .
The cost of antiretroviral treatment is just one aspect of these economic consequences .
In brief , the HIV/AIDS epidemic represents a very serious threat to global health , development and security .
If these aspects are disregarded , the effectiveness of the aforementioned efforts of prevention and medical care will be jeopardised .
Open discussion is an integral part of the information campaign which , in turn , will contribute most towards prevention .
I must say that it truly satisfies and heartens me to hear that the honourable Members not only share my acute concern on the subject of HIV/AIDS , but also my firm conviction that we need to make a full and effective contribution towards relieving the terrible hardship which is causing this epidemic , both in the rest of the world and in the European Union .
As the honourable Members have already mentioned , it is no longer an issue which only concerns vulnerable groups .
As far as the question of research is concerned , may I remind you that , for the vaccine in particular , research into an HIV vaccine is a priority under the sixth framework programme for research and development and we expect up to EUR 130 million to be earmarked for research into an HIV vaccine .
There is a huge need – and I repeat this – for the social stigma to be lifted .
Finally , I should like to assure you once again that the European Commission is truly dedicated to these efforts to combat this scourge .
At the same time , however , we need to contribute towards the relief of those who are already affected and to their treatment .
It is important that Europe should not get carried away and should fight for the good of nations and people .
The Council wrongly underestimated our role , the voice of the European citizens whom we represent …     – Mr President , Commissioner , there is a danger that the way in which sport is developing in the European Union will result in the weakening of its educational and social character .
