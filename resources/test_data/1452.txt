From this point of view , I welcome the fact that the Committee on Industry has recommended an increase in funding for the ITER reactor .
This means bold funding for research in all sectors , coordinating research at European level , in contrast to the current fragmentary approach , and disseminating it throughout the economic and social fabric .
The social agenda which we have adopted and are currently applying is the basis for this policy .
Finally , I should like to stress the need for public information and consultation on all our research objectives .
The generally-worded title of the Community directive before us conceals an important step towards the privatisation of ports , especially the services which they provide , such as pilotage , towing and docking ships , loading and unloading and storing goods and moving passengers .
The aim is not to improve the port services provided ; it is to sell off yet another publicly owned sector to big business and hand a complete infrastructure over to the private monopolies so that they can make use of and profit from it .
We refuse to be party to a line of thinking that accepts privatisation as inevitable and endeavours to rescue a few individual services .
This endeavour is more than infuriating or provocative .
The Communist Party of Greece is fighting , alongside the workers , for uniform , 100 % public-sector port services , so that they are able to operate , develop and connect with other sectors of the economy .
The United States sabotaged the protocol , do not ask me why .
We obviously need to withdraw what we say in the joint motion before you , honourable Members , about welcoming the change in the position of the United States .
Will discussion alone suffice , I wonder ?
I think that we should adopt it and that the European Union should include this issue in the debate .
This sorry state of affairs has been exacerbated by a dumping policy , especially in South Korea .
Yet again we see the European Union 's devotion to the interests of big business .
As the Prime Minister of Greece , Mr Simitis , has said , we are working on an assumption of 260 000 illegal immigrants this year .
Is it in a position to design a joined-up policy to ensure that this matter is resolved satisfactorily and that borders and illegal immigration are safely controlled ?
On the one hand , it allows huge numbers of migrants to pass through it and , on the other , a stream of political refugees from Turkey itself or from other countries but who are open to prosecution in Turkey , such as Iraqi Kurds who might be prosecuted for their activities in Turkey , is turning up in Greece .
How can these two things be reconciled ?
Madam President-in-Office of the Council , my question touched on two issues .
But I asked you a second question , Madam President-in-Office of the Council .
Will it include biometric information other than a fingerprint and will it also include the person 's religion ?
Should we not be making it easier for European police forces to locate European terrorists ?
Having said which , I should like to ask if , in cases such as that in Greece , where 700 people , mostly from Afghanistan and Iraqi Kurdistan , turned up in Zakynthos , Greece could apply the provisions of the directive , including making use of funds from the European Refugee Fund ?
I am sorry , but I must recommend that the Commission proposal be rejected .
The argument is that , instead of converging , taxation diverges from one country to another in the Union .
Why does the Commission feel that taxes should converge ?
The Commission has admitted that we do not know if tax convergence will bring about price convergence .
How can taxation be harmonised unless value added tax on cigarettes is harmonised at the same time ?
The public health argument , that is , that higher prices reduce smoking , has also been wheeled out .
The increase in the price of cigarettes does indeed reduce legal smoking , but it encourages illegal smoking and in England the mafia is having a field day and has put the cigarette market completely out of kilter for precisely this reason .
Furthermore , Commissioner , I must say that the Council has not demonstrated the necessary respect or tact vis-Ã -vis Parliament , because a week before we submitted our opinion , it presented us with a political agreement in which it attempts to force our opinion .
This makes we wonder how you can come along and support a measure from which , in the economic sector , only large monopolies stand to gain for reasons which , unfortunately , I cannot go into now , but you know full well that I am right , while , in the political sector , you come along with something which looks to me very much like totalitarianism .
I am sorry , but common sense is nowhere to be seen in this proposal for a directive , which we , too , propose should be rejected in its entirety .
If we increase tax , then we shall increase tax evasion .
Again , the Council tells us that one of its aims is to protect public health and that this aim will be achieved by people giving up smoking because cigarettes are more expensive .
Is that what we want to achieve ?
Secondly , the cost of living will rise in these five countries , four of which are southern countries , without any increase in wages , thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures .
Finally , I should like to express my disappointment
