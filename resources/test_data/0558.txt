having had most recently discussions even with Israel on this , we should not perhaps , here and there , insist on withdrawing from similar agreements if the undertakings given are not met .
Our main point of criticism is that the rapporteur has laden down what is meant to be an annual report on human rights with an unacceptable amount of ideological ballast , and made her own hobbyhorses , not to say obsessions , its central point .
This is where you and I are often not that far removed from each other ; I too am against this Mexico City policy .
We in the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , though , endorse the Commissioner’s proposal for two Capitals of Culture , simply because the 10 new Member States cannot do anything about the shameless conduct of the old 15 .
Now that enlargement is imminent and it has dawned on some people that it cannot be right and proper to put these countries off until 2020 or even later , the Commission has now come up with this tandem solution – and a solution it is , although I have to tell you , Commissioner , that it does of course leave a disagreeable aftertaste .
The unfortunate reality is , however , that we have found , and are still finding , that Europe’s citizens are not yet as mobile as we would like them to be .
This confidence must now be moderated somewhat , since I have heard , Madam Commissioner , that you do not agree with several of the amendments , including those proposed by me .
We should also , as you have suggested , take into account young people’s voluntary service , for that is a competence acquired by a young person in the course of his or her life , and it should be more recognised than it has been so far , including by employers .
To make one thing clear , that assessment is transnational , it applies to several countries and not just to one .
Mr Bonde , we are not proposing to get you out of the mess in which you have buried yourself .
In many ways , it was easy from the start because the policy ideas were similar and ran in parallel , whereas in other aspects it was slightly more difficult , but if one is used to debating from different standpoints and if one is prepared for a compromise , then one will indeed find a good compromise .
It is not yet the optimum solution , but there has been some progress .
On April 21 – today – we have found in the trialogue that we agree on this draft legislation , so that , from the first proposal to the entry into force of this important decision for small and medium-size firms , only four months have elapsed .
We would like the Stability Pact , which we have accepted for our Europe , also to be shaped to fit our small businesses , and then they too would be looking at a secure future .     Mr President , I would like to say just for the record that Mr Hans-Peter Martin , who is always excited about people signing in without being present , is himself conspicuous by his absence from this night-time session .     – Mr President , Commissioner Nielson , ladies and gentlemen , we are deeply disappointed by the decision in the case of Leyla Zana .
That does not , however , mean that we do not have to take a very practical and critical look at these guidelines and at the need to adapt to changes in growth and employment .
Moreover , the whole must be formulated in such a way that all the partners really are compelled to make the connection in the interests of sustainable growth , full employment and social cohesion .     Madam President , Commissioner Dimas , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we need a public debate on our economic and employment policy objectives and the reform measures they call for , and one that is much more in-depth than that currently going on in the Member States and at European level .
We have them in enlargement , in the concept of the internal market , in small and medium-sized businesses , in the skills of our workers , in the Lisbon strategy , in the euro and in the social dialogue .
That is something that our group , at any rate , stands for , and such language should not be used to anyone .
I also ask that the following be deleted : ‘aimed at achieving the free movement of goods , capital , service and persons’ .
That , though , is not where the eyes of the world are focused .
We should call them in front of the curtain and congratulate them on maintaining standards .
That , as has been said , is why our task is to get actively involved in the peace process , but to do so with precise knowledge of the realities of these countries , on which we can draw in our deliberations .     Mr President , may I make a request ?
More now than ever , am I convinced that this great enlargement , which has now been completed , is a shining example of the attractiveness , dynamism and youth of the European ideal , an ideal that has not grown old , and whose attractiveness is demonstrated by the nations that have had to walk a hard road in search of freedom , democracy and the rule of law .
We can only do it together .
It was our House that did that
