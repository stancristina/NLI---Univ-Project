untried administrations .
I agree with Mr Mulder’s observation that it is unsatisfactory that the Member States are not prepared to issue statements concerning the supervision of the resources they have received .
It is , of course , also the case that responsibility for the administration cannot lie with the Commission alone but that the Council and the Member States also bear some responsibility .
In some areas we are taking on tasks that , in reality , we cannot carry out .
Yesterday we were certain that everything was in order and we were ready to grant discharge , but in the course of the night we knew better .
It is of course quite odd that , for 25 years , both Parliament’s administration and our audit department have overlooked – at least they say they have done so – an extremely dubious payment to the city of Strasbourg .
What is more , it has to be asked whether it really is possible to enter into such financial agreements without carefully evaluating the various options and offers .
No, of course it is not .
Someone has helped someone else obtain an illicit dollop of taxpayers ’ money , and , if I know the system , no one will be held liable because , of course , no one knew anything .
Do not , then , read through the contracts .
As I say , we could have got away with granting discharge , but we are not going to grant it .
As for the other areas , our attitude is described in the report .     .Mr President , in my home country of Denmark , as in so many other places in the Community , eel fishing has a long history , and in many places eel is an important foodstuff .
The European eel is now so overfished that the stock is only around 1 % of what it was in the past .
In the end , one may add , it is also the last chance .
These plans are intended to make it highly probable that a high percentage of the biomass of adult eels will be able to escape back to sea .
Under the Commission ’s original proposal , there was to be a sea-return rate of around 40 % .
This , in my opinion , was a positive feature and , in fact , I would also have preferred us to have retained it .
It is absolutely critical that we have fry , because , if we do not , then we have no possibility of rebuilding our stocks .
I believe that we now have before us something that can be made use of and that has great significance for all of us , and I hope that both Parliament’s contribution and the debate to take place amongst the fisheries ministers in the Council will result in the development of an action plan that will lead to the rebuilding of the eel stock .
We have an obligation to safeguard the stock of eels .     Mr President , as Western Sahara is not a sovereign state , it is international law that applies to its population .
This means that if an agreement is to be entered into , the population of Western Sahara must be involved and their economic interest must be taken into consideration .
However , nowhere in the agreement does it state that compensation is to be provided .
I do not believe that it is the job of the Committee on Fisheries to solve conflicts between Morocco and Western Sahara , but I do think it is important that international law is obeyed and that the population of Western Sahara does not end up as the loser in this agreement .
I therefore also believe it to be important that we vote in favour of those amendments that exclude territory belonging to Western Sahara .
If these amendments are adopted , I believe that we could end up with a positive agreement .
Let us elect , by direct means , a convention to be given the task of producing a democratic constitution and a cooperation agreement between democracies .
In this way we can attain the ground rules that our people want .
Create new rules of procedure in the Council and the Commission so that , from now on , all meetings are open and all documents public unless there are good arguments for sitting behind closed doors or otherwise dealing with a matter in secret .
Resolve that we will never vote in favour of an EU law that has not obtained a majority in either the national parliament or the European Parliament .
The European Parliament was involved in just 57 of them .
Mr Barroso and Mrs Wallström will be visiting Copenhagen on Friday .
The official programme provides for not a single speaker representing the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes .
You listen largely to yourselves , while the Commission pays for events , think-tanks and movements in favour of the failed Constitution .
In Parliament , we have done some thorough work , analysing what is needed and developing common political priorities .
The EU Heads of State or Government lapsed , however , into unseemly bartering about income and expenditure , with refrains such as ‘We will not pay’ , ‘Maximum of 1 % ’ and ‘We want our money back’ .
It is not a particularly attractive one , and no one is fully satisfied with it .
The optimist in us will , however , emphasise that it is constructive that there is now a framework to facilitate the legislative work on the programmes for the Structural Funds , research and education .
I therefore recommend voting in favour of the agreement .
We have ensured that responsibility for administering EU resources has been placed squarely with the Member States
