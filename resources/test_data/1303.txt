Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mr Menrad for his thorough work in drawing up this report , including the hearings he organised together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in order to examine closely the incorporation of the directive into national legal systems .
Well then , if this is the case , it is necessary , absolutely essential for the directive to be more precise , for it to lay down timeframes which ensure that information is provided and consultation carried out before any decision is taken , to provide a real opportunity for negotiation , otherwise it will serve no purpose at all !
Secondly , I am sure the Members will agree with me when I say that there are no rules in a legal system which , if disregarded , lose their effect .
But if I understood Mr Kinnock correctly , in his opinion the only way to respect the ceiling of the Financial Perspective is to abolish the other ten languages and just keep the language that I am speaking now .
I am sure you are not unaware of the fact that the European officials are not too happy with the way things are going .
It was , of course , a joke , as the Commissioner said .
Mr Sharon speaks and acts clearly , and he says when he speaks in parliament that his intention is to bomb and kill , targeting , in particular , the Palestinian leaders , and to raise houses to the ground , not just in order to destroy the houses but as part of a clear plan .
We are asking for international law to be respected .
Without a doubt , Europe must act .
If Europe does not take a firm stand against the statements made at Durban equating Zionism to racism , it will be dealing another mortal blow to the survival of the West as a culture which embodies the right of nations and peoples and it will fall back into the abyss which engulfed us at the time of the Nazi concentration camps and communist persecutions .
Mr President , Commissioner , this morning ' s debate on enlargement has revealed considerable convergence of approaches and methods as well .
What , then , is the project on which we should initially focus the debate of Parliament ' s , the only genuinely democratic institution and maybe the only institution which is capable of involving the public as well ?
What is missing is politics , political decisions , political action such as , for example with regard to the Middle East , the accession of Israel to the European Union as proposed so often by our radical friends and others .
Mr President , Mr Mayer ' s document is the first stage in the adoption of the directives on the European company , the European limited-liability company .
I call for not just the workers but the ex-workers , the pensioners of such companies to be consulted as well .
Mr President , this is certainly not an easy time for the majority of the countries who are preparing to enter the European Union , especially Poland .
There is no doubt that the left is committed to taking this path because all the Polish parties - both right and left - signed an explicit agreement a few days ago committing themselves to working together to this end .
To sum up , we are sure that Poland will enter Europe as soon as possible , in 2004 , and we are pleased to note that the Belgian Presidency - as we heard this morning - wants to give fresh impetus and new dynamism to the negotiations .
Poland - the President-in-Office said - will enter , although it is more appropriate to say 'will return to ' Europe , for it has occupied its rightful place in Europe for centuries and only a perverse dictatorship was able to deny it its true place in history and geography for many decades .
As usually happens in the last stage of the entry of a country into Europe , the sceptics come out of the woodwork , but it is often a matter of internal political tactics .
There are psychological reserves in this field : " We have not yet set foot in Europe " reflect some observers , " and already international capital is threatening to restrict our sovereignty " .
These are the major events which have taken place in the area of cross-border cooperation .
Like everything new , enlargement is causing uncertainty among the public .
Lastly , I feel that , for the European Union , the economic element of globalisation is not about maximising profit and its social element is not about standardising societies , but globalisation is about the readiness to harmonise existing differences .
I shall be delighted to begin discussing your proposals in detail at Parliament ' s next part-session , two weeks from now in Brussels .
Europe has at last begun the great debate on how to achieve a more complete democracy .
They can see that no individual Member State can , on its own , withstand the powerful external forces that threaten to break up our societies .
During the second stage , the Commission will state its position on the Laeken process .
We therefore decided that we have to put our own house in order before discussing how to rebuild the city .
First and foremost , we need to get the citizens more closely involved in defining EU policies .
We must encourage the emergence of a European network , where all levels of government are involved in shaping , implementing and monitoring EU policies .
Parliament will thus be able to monitor both the quality and the impartiality of the consultation process when taking its decisions in the course of the legislative process .
Let me
