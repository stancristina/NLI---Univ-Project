investment .
Given this background and the position adopted a while ago by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , we are on the way to adopting a constructive long-term position in the European Parliament and one characterised by the goal of sustainable development .
In this , the European Parliament calls upon the Commission and the Council to ensure that changes to the measures taken to conserve cod stocks are made in such a way as not to lead to a further reduction in cod stocks but , rather , to maximise their chances of recovery .
New test trawls on Sweden 's west coast also show that cod stocks are at their lowest level for 23 years and that the number of one year-old fish of this species amounts to only a tenth of the number a year ago .
We have our hands tied , which is enormously frustrating .
I really want to question the way in which the Commission is acting in this matter .
Restricting , as now , self-handling to apply only to personnel on board a vessel and not to land-based personnel such as employees at a factory near the port , means that the legislation ignores how the business operates .
We believe that there is no good reason for such a division .
The report also points out that the rules governing the EU 's own resources must be reviewed .
Advocates of the one view wanted to make life easier for small businesses by means of tax relief , lower wage costs , less red tape , what are known as mini-jobs and such services as cannot be provided without government aid and public subsidies , for example household services .
What we have here , then , are two different approaches , but not varieties of right - or left-wing policies , for I know that many people in industry prefer good , strong small businesses and that it is precisely to these businesses that they wish to provide capital , opportunities for growth and support in terms of knowledge .
We have a large number of businesses that can scarcely support one family .
We could unite all the political groups in this Parliament around a progressive policy in this area , a policy that would take our overarching objectives and the Lisbon strategy 's objectives seriously , that is to say 'good jobs for all ' .
I would particularly draw the Commission 's attention to item 37 , which emphasises the importance of making it easier to combine family and professional life by creating greater opportunity for parents to spend more time with their children , by extending childcare facilities , by enabling parents to take parental leave and by providing tax concessions for childminders and foster parents and care and assistance facilities for the elderly .
This item is also about allocating greater resources to programmes for combating female unemployment .
Item 37 indicates the value of combining working life and family life and of giving more time to children .
Mr President , Commissioner , we all know that , in a larger EU , the ECB must be reformed , but the proposal presented by the ECB has not been sufficiently worked out .
It is a requirement of democracy that voting rules be fairly simple and comprehensible .
Commissioner , we must prevent an unduly divided Europe .
Finally , we must in fact also strengthen Parliament 's role .
The present rules must be reformed .
That means that , in the extremely near future , not all Member States ' voices will be heard .
Mr Friedrich 's report , considerably compromised by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , proposes fundamental principles : the principle of one member one vote and principles concerning representativeness , transparency and accountability and about taking the lead in devising a new decision-making model that will be more efficient but also designed in such a way that all members still participate .
Their fears have nonetheless proved groundless .
Certainly , there have been complaints about price rises , but the general price level has not increased .
Further investigations may , however , be needed , something that we are now also requesting in this report .
I believe that , as I hope you already know , Sweden ought already to have been a fully fledged member of EMU.
Fortunately enough , events have taken on their own momentum , independently of both the report and myself .
ERM membership must be viewed as a requirement , but the period of membership may be relatively short .
Because quite a few of them are well on the way towards adjusting to EMU, I would certainly advocate a degree of flexibility .
The issue has also been taken up in an exchange of letters between the President of the ECB and the Swedish Finance Minister .
One of the most important principles of the Union 's legal system is , of course , that EU law takes precedence over national law .
That is something I am able to say , even though I am a member of the opposition in my country .
What would have become of European integration if Robert Schuman 's natural inclination had been to hesitate , or if , when the Berlin Wall was torn down , Helmut Kohl had been governed by short-term economic interests , or if Jacques Delors ' distinguishing characteristic had been anxiety ?
In conclusion , I want to say that there is a certain confusion where the amendments are concerned .
Mr President , I want to keep my speech on the Convergence Report 2002 - Sweden fairly short and , first of all , thank the rapporteur , Mr Olle Schmidt , on a sterling piece of work .
