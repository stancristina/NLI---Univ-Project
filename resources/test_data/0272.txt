, as a single instrument , they may be too blunt .
We have a duty to justify every single cent that has been spent .
We know the current agreement will be revised for May of this year .
We call on the Commission to put consumer interests over vested interests .
This own-initiative report rightly recognises the crucial role of consumer organisations , which are the ideal organisations for alerting public authorities to the problems consumers experience in their daily lives .
The report we adopted today clearly describes the benefits of this instrument .
In the last few centuries , discrimination has been possibly the least of the ills that have befallen them .
Ultimately , those Member States in which Roma live , and have often lived for many generations , will have to assume a leading role in taking up the issue of Roma integration in their own countries .
My question is : when can we expect this revision , and what does the Commissioner see as the main objective to be achieved by this means ? on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , when preparing for this debate about copyright , intellectual property rights and how we want to protect the creative and intellectual efforts of our fellow citizens , I had to think back to the theft a couple of years ago of a truck containing the new Harry Potter books , just days before their release .
The EU should , in future , insist that European standards of transparency apply .
The democratic legitimacy of these negotiations is weak .
Mr President , High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen .
Both you and we knew that you were taking on a well-nigh impossible task .
However , I support the Committee on Economic Affairs ' request that the impact of the meaning of any exemption granted to micro-entities be thoroughly assessed and placed in the framework of an overall review of the fourth and seventh directives .
In our view , GDP must include a set of welfare indicators , as well as indicators which will take into account broad external economic factors and environmental pressures .
The absence of a genuine penalty mechanism if the objectives are not met , or even if insufficient efforts are made to that end , means that this '2020 strategy ' is flawed in the same way as its predecessor .
I find it regrettable that the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) have not thrown any weight behind this text .
We must protect the development cooperation budget , however hard that may be .
The only things that matter to our citizens are the results .
In this regard , our group sets store by a tightening of the budget guidelines in the Stability and Growth Pact and the strengthening of their preventive effect .
This will be crucial to resolving the crisis .
A second aspect here is helping passengers avoid aeroplanes , airlines and countries which have been placed on the blacklist .
Thank you , therefore , and thanks to those who have contributed to it .
However , one thing we certainly do want is to organise a consultation on this issue , to reach agreements and then to stick to those agreements .
Passengers have been stranded , airlines , the travel industry and companies which depend on air travel have all been hit hard , and all this comes on top of the economic crisis .
The good thing is that the first steps towards that were taken yesterday and we have to build on that quickly .
To give you an example : the costs incurred by the airlines , based on our European directive on passenger rights , and what disaster assistance is payable .
I also think that we were justified in doing this and that it was something that we were able to do , because the test flights have shown us that we can fly , although obviously only as long as we continue to enjoy the good visibility conditions that we have at present .
However , we cannot allow major and reputable companies which put safety first to collapse .
European NGOs could be of particular service here , thanks to their good local contacts , and I was pleased to hear from both members of the Commission that they are also thinking along these lines .
Keep working towards that goal .
Recently , the Stephen Roth Institute published a report which highlights several somewhat unpleasant aspects of this issue .
We are talking about a parliamentary budget of EUR 1.4 billion for 2008 ; the budget for 2011 is likely to be EUR 1.7 billion .
We have managed to reduce , compost or reuse 50 % of our waste streams .
My report also introduces a new concept : that of 'reputational damage ' to Parliament .
Nevertheless , my report is critical .
I strove for positive cooperation with my shadow rapporteurs , and some very constructive amendments have been tabled .
This is already enough to bring this metaphorical volcano to a head , so we can do without poor financial accountability and public distrust causing the volcano to erupt.
Mr Staes has rightly drawn up a very critical report and , after the many improvements seen in recent years , it is now time to throw open the windows once and for all and show the European public by means of this transparency that we are able to handle their money responsibly , as that is what this is all about .
I should like to raise a few issues .
Some Member States are federal states with mutual entities , such as Belgium with Wallonia , Brussels and Flanders , so how is the Belgian federal minister supposed to come up with a national management declaration
