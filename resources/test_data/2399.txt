that the total cost of enlargement will be one tenth of the cost of German reunification .
This must not be allowed to compromise the historic task which awaits us .
Warm thanks to the rapporteurs , the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen .
Thank you to Parliament for today reaffirming that there is a momentum in this historic process . - ( DA ) Mr President , when I was asked to make a statement on this topic , we did not know how tragically topical it would become .
It was a completely incomprehensible catastrophe , and has also underlined the fact that the terrorist threat must still be taken very seriously .
The last time I had the honour to speak to Parliament about terrorism was on 11 September this year , when together we remembered the anniversary of the terrorist attack on the USA .
The terrorist attack in Bali , coming as it did out of the blue , has shown that no one is immune .
The fight against terrorism is a global one , in which close cooperation between the EU and the USA is an essential prerequisite for success .
We must let this thought guide us all in future .
What , therefore , has the EU been doing since 11 September 2001 , and how effective has it been ?
The EU 's political reaction to last year 's catastrophe was very rapid and dynamic .
The EU also stressed that the US Government and people could count on the full solidarity and cooperation of the EU in the continuing fight against terrorism .
The EU did not stop at words .
The list of results makes impressive reading .
Particular examples are the introduction of a European arrest warrant , the establishment of a common definition of acts of terror , and joint investigation teams .
In addition , agreement has been reached on a decision on the freezing of assets and evidence .
It will also make things harder for terrorists in the Member States .
In addition , negotiations have been initiated with the USA on a cooperation agreement on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters , and it is expected that an agreement between Europol and the USA on the exchange of personal data will be finalised by the end of the year .
All things considered , it can be said that the EU has delivered all that could be expected of it - and more .
The necessary legal acts for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1373 were adopted as early as December 2001 .
In addition , a number of important initiatives have been taken with regard to aviation safety .
It has become harder to exist as a terrorist and perpetrate acts of terror in Member States and has made it safer and more secure for our citizens .
No, we cannot , but for this very reason we must continue the fight with renewed energy .
Have we put legal certainty for our citizens on the line ?
Are our efforts to protect our freedom and safety resulting in the creation of a Big Brother society ?
Where do we draw the line ?
I believe that the famous liberal philosopher Karl Popper gave us some guidance when he said : ' If we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant , then the tolerant will be destroyed , and tolerance with them . '
The Presidency is fully in agreement with the emphasis which the motion for a resolution places on the principle that there must be no rewards for terror .
At the same time , the Presidency does not deem it necessary for there to be any further substantial anti-terrorism initiatives within the EU at the present time .
The handling of the fight against terrorism has been mainly oriented towards the EU 's external role .
It is the objective of the Danish Presidency to achieve progress in integrating the fight against terrorism into all aspects of the EU 's foreign policy .
Maintaining the international anti-terrorism coalition and cooperation with the USA are essential aspects .
The Council Conclusions of 22 July 2002 on the EU 's external action against terrorism opened a new chapter in the fight against terrorism .
In its future agreements with third countries , the EU will take more account of the contribution of these countries to the fight against terrorism and conduct a more targeted and if necessary tougher political dialogue with third countries .
It was also decided to identify specific measures with a view to helping third countries to fulfil their obligations under Security Council Resolution 1373 and to concentrate on a smaller number of countries with a view to initiating a pilot project in cooperation with the UN 's Counter-Terrorism Committee .
In the latter areas , in particular , it is hoped that concrete results will have been attained by the end of the Danish Presidency in the form of the launch of one or two pilot projects .
It has therefore also been a high priority of the Presidency 's to prepare the necessary analysis of individual countries and regions .
We must send the message to our discussion partners in third countries that the way in which they handle the fight against terror will have a considerable influence on their relations with the EU.
The EU can certainly be proud of its efforts in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attack .
Now it is important to turn our gaze outwards and play the international role which is expected of us .
I therefore hope for the continuing support of Parliament for the line taken here and I would thank the two Commissioners for their cooperation in this field .
Mr President , there are many fine words in the report on combating terrorism .
