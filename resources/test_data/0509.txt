with EU guidelines and common attitudes regarding the death penalty and torture .
It would be naïve to play down the importance of human rights .
It is high time we put principles into practice and we took determined , pragmatic action to create an integrated human rights strategy for the EU as a whole .
Mr President , I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Wuori , for his excellent report .
The violent trade in human organs focuses on the poor .
We therefore face the sort of problem that results from greed .
The international sex trade has acquired an excellent tool in the Internet .
Legislation lags behind because many people think the freedom of the Internet should not be restricted .
The notion of human rights will not work where they are being violated both mentally and physically .
So that we might remember what we are dealing with , I will reiterate a few facts about climatic warming .
It just is .
In terms of average temperatures this is a very great change .
Glaciers are melting ; 85 % of them are receding at a very fast rate , as much as several tens of metres a year at their worst .
The polar icecaps have shrunk by 25 % in the last three years .
If we allow global warming to continue , the dreaded , worst-case scenario in northwestern Europe may well take place .
This could result in the whole of northwestern Europe becoming colder , which palaeo-oceanographic studies show could happen suddenly , with catastrophic results .
Unless we act quickly and , furthermore , put pressure on others also to act quickly , these new phenomena will increase exponentially .
Bonn needs to be a success .
Mr President , the package under discussion concerns the EU' s accounts for last year , own resources and next year ' s budget .
This is because revenue was EUR 3.3 billion more than was estimated and expenditure EUR 8.5 billion less than forecast .
A good 20 % of payments were not taken up , amounting to EUR 6.5 billion .
Only half of the EU Objective 1 programmes came to be approved in 2000 , almost two years after the Agenda 2000 decision taken in Berlin .
Just 8 % of the Objective 2 programmes were approved .
Administrative payments are in a pitiful state .
The present omissions will be reflected as backlogs in budgets in the years to come .
Why were these amendments not made at the time ?
Parliament must strongly insist on its demand that a separate plan showing a structure of the posts involved in the administration of this policy should be put forward .
This expenditure is not part of a gentleman' s agreement between Parliament and the Council according to which the institutions do not interfere in one another ' s budgets .
Mr President , I have no intention of joining the regulars who give an explanation of vote ; yesterday my timetable simply overran , and , unfortunately , I was too late for the deliberation on Mr Wuori' s report .
It is important that the EU' s internal problems are reported at least as effectively and transparently as those of non-member countries .
It was with an equal feeling of sorrow that I read not only about the injuries but also the fairly uncritical attitude of the journalists as they reported the events .
I am very satisfied that the amendments connected with the recognition of relationships between people of the same sex were added to Mr Cornillet ' s otherwise excellent report .
Human rights problems that affect sexual minorities are still regrettably common today in the Member States .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner , first of all I would like to say on behalf of my group that we are extremely pleased that during the year now ended negotiations have truly made rapid progress and it has been possible to close one chapter after another .
Mr Hänsch did a fine job of explaining how the enlargement process is one in which both the current and the future Member States of the European Union will benefit : everyone can benefit from this .
We need to emphasise that the applicant countries must take very seriously any Community legislation which aims to strengthen these sustainable characteristics .
It goes without saying that children 's rights and the principle of non-discrimination are the sort of principles to which we , as Europeans , must hold fast .
Here we refer to the fact that the Community 's funding framework for the years 2000-2006 contains some resources which could possibly be freed , since quite obviously no new Member States will be joining in 2002 .
Finally , Mr President , one very important shortcoming in this process is that the involvement of citizens has , up to now , been particularly poor .
The position of women and the fight against poverty must be taken into account , and our group would like to emphasise these matters .
Freedom and independence incite nations into action .
This should also be the case with people , and the control of individuals over their own lives needs , of course , to improve .
Europe 's boom phase of economic growth has now ended .
The popularity of the Union has , however , declined in many applicant countries such as Estonia to less than half of what it was , even before this economic standstill which has now taken place in Europe .
For this reason then I ask , and urge as a priority , that we energetically seize the challenge of narrowing social differences and the social and economic gulf , since this is the base upon which we will be able to get the large majority of people in these countries to support membership .
