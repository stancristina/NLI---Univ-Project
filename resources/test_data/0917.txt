I see two signs , one good and one bad .
The bad development in the future which many colleagues have spoken about - including my friend , Mr Andrews - is the remorseless growth in organised crime which we are seeing across Europe .
The opening of frontiers for the single market was a thoroughly good idea but it has also helped the Mafia , and criminals from Eastern Europe to spread their tentacles across our Union .
When we get enlargement , which is the good aspect of the future that I see , we are going to find it more and more difficult to counter organised crime .
The criminals can move freely across frontiers but our police forces cannot .
Already today there are about 120 different police forces in the European Union , most of them , I may say , in my own Member State , because in the United Kingdom we have a police force in every single county and they only work up to their county borders .
We have far too many police forces already and we are going to have even more once we have completed enlargement , our ability to deal with organised crime is going to be very much less than it should be .
What we need is for Europol to be given operational capability across frontiers .
At public meetings , when I talk about the growth in organised crime , the response invariably from the public is , " Well , what are you doing about it ?
Get on with it .
Take the necessary powers .
Organise the police forces so we can deal with the growth in crime . "
The public is in favour and - as very often happens - is ahead of us and the Council of Ministers .
I should very much like to hear the Commissioner ' s reaction to the idea that when we hopefully get the concept of enhanced cooperation accepted at the Nice Summit next month that we create a European FBI .
We do not have to call it a European FBI , but that is the logical next step .
It would have full public support and it is necessary for the future .
Mr President , I welcome this report by Mrs Langenhagen , the contents of which I am very happy to endorse .
The Court of Auditors ' report on the FAIR Programme , from which the rapporteur ' s report arises , was only published in March this year even though the sector letters regarding the audit were first sent to the Commission in December 1998 and February 1999 .
As the rapporteur suggested , this is simply unacceptable .
It is too long a delay and undermines the relevance of Parliament ' s work in considering such reports .
This delay results from the contradictory procedure between the Court and the Commission which precedes the publication of every Court of Auditors ' report , whereby the Commission has the right to have its reply published at the same time as the report .
As a result of the delay in this case the rapporteur quite rightly questions the continuation of the contradictory procedure in its current form .
This is something I will certainly be exploring in the report I will be bringing to Parliament in December .
It is sufficient to suggest that we need to look at the whole procedure again , not just in terms of the Court ' s annual report which will be published tomorrow , but also in terms of special reports such as this one .
The Court of Auditors ' report found a number of significant problems with the management of the FAIR Programme during 1994 to 1998 , including a lack of quantified objectives for the programme , making it difficult to fully measure the results , insufficient transparency in selection and evaluation procedures and the management of measures under the programme by three DGs .
This meant that the management of the programme lacked clarity and homogeneity .
We hope that as a result of the reform of the Commission currently taking place we will see a huge correction of this in future .
That we do not have clear targets , that we cannot measure output , is really unacceptable and would not happen in any other institution .
This is very old hat .
We know the change is coming , but we want to see it very quickly .
One problem which remains is the EUR 3.4 million still to be recovered , 92 % of which is accounted for by three files which have been under examination by the Commission ' s legal services since July 1996 and August 1997 and whose due dates have expired .
It is vital that the Commission follows that and gets its money back .
We will be following this report ' s recommendations in future so we encourage the Commission to put things right as soon as possible , otherwise you will see reference to this and other special reports within discharge procedure reports .
Madam President , whatever one felt about the mandate from the Cologne European Council , it was fairly surprising that the convention set up to draft the Charter fully succeeded in achieving the mandate .
We faced an extraordinarily complex task for the inscription of fundamental rights and freedoms found inside the constitutional traditions of Member States and also within the general principles of Union law .
In my opinion the convention managed to strike a sound balance between self-restraint and aspiration .
We refrained from superseding the Treaties but maximised their impact by making the relationship between the citizen and the Union for the first time clear and visible .
Some people will be disappointed that the Charter was unable to go further but it
