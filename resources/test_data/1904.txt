interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system .
There is no doubt that the closure of large parts of the European network would lead to significant job losses .
I therefore feel that the proposals on transparency that you are putting forward cannot be applied to that sector under the same conditions .
I think it would be rather difficult in such a sector to implement the notion of separate accounting systems making it possible to draw a distinction between competitive activities and public service activities in the broadcasting sector , especially as , I might mention in passing , there is no single harmonised European accounting system .
Fourthly and finally , there is one amendment , Amendment No 3 , which is explicitly intended to exclude the broadcasting sector from the scope of the proposed directive .
But , for that , Europe would have to have an authority legitimate and clear-sighted enough to get out of the trap of all-out liberalism and , of course , it has no such authority worthy of the name .
How does the Commission plan to ensure that the appropriations made available by cancelling the debt are properly invested in eradicating poverty and in sustainable development ?
We do not , however , know today what measures have been taken by successive Councils in order to attempt to establish relations between both these countries , given that today Turkey is still imposing an economic blockade on Armenia .
The objective is admirable , but we must avoid certain errors and must , therefore , discuss the matter very thoroughly with the national authorities .
It will ensure that Europe makes a substantial contribution to the establishment of a worldwide satellite navigation system .
I therefore welcome the debate which has just taken place , which , as I said before , lends political support to the Commission ' s analysis .
You have stressed , extremely vigorously I would say , all the elements which facilitate this transition : benchmarking , aid to private investment , tax exemption and a certain amount of support for enterprise and SMEs with high technological added value , all of which is important and necessary .
Both fundamental and applied research must , above all , retain public support and a public dimension .
Let us begin , however , in a spirit of constructive criticism , by welcoming the fact that this contribution towards achieving better integration of the European scientific community seeks to safeguard the balance between fundamental and applied research in order to combat the brain drain , to prioritise the problem of unemployment among young researchers within a European policy which is aware of the reality of the situation , and to recognise the leading role played by businesses in research and development .
The second observation is that approximately two thirds of research is undertaken by private companies and that the European Union must take this situation into consideration when focusing its resources .
It is therefore necessary , as a matter of urgency , to adopt an overall strategy at European level in order to make up for lost time .
In this respect , I think that this Parliament resolution is going to provide strong democratic support for the text ratified by the Lisbon Council which , moreover , set practical goals and deadlines .
Mr Bolkestein , who is responsible for the internal market , is well aware of this .
I think that the Member States accept this methodology , with the establishment of a high level group of representatives .
Madam President , this matter has been very badly handled from the start .
There was political confusion but no legal confusion .
They are attracted by promises of employment and some even come in the hope of getting married .
Inequalities and relationships of dependency between privileged and disadvantaged countries mean that it is still always the weakest in society , particularly the women , who pay the price .
Yet it is actually a denial of freedom .
Our aim is to ensure that trafficking in human beings is regarded as a criminal offence to be severely punished in all Member States .
We have absolutely no doubt that this would eventually favour the alliances , associations and groupings of European political parties with an essentially federalist and integrationist aim .
This is simply a way of acknowledging that , in this 'growth ' which the Katiforis report asks Parliament to congratulate , there is no room for employees or pensioners .
Whether or not the pessimists like this , all the economic lights are on green .
Two points have particularly shaken us .
It is also not interested in the damage to the environment and to the safety and working conditions of employees caused by the race for maximum profits .
We might have more faith in the sincerity of the authors of this motion in 'deploring the recent murders , beatings and intimidation associated with the ...occupation ' if they at least deigned to recall the past massacres in which a handful of colonists dispossessed the indigenous population of its land and the decades of colonial violence and apartheid used to preserve this situation .
The exclusion of some citizens from the new information technology society cannot be tolerated .
Such an approach ensures that the people concerned have a better understanding of these broad international texts .
The UEN Group , although attached to the whole European tradition of human rights , cannot accept the individualisation of these rights where they represent only specific needs to which suitable responses must be provided .
For example , what credibility does Belgium have in this area when it is expelling large numbers of gypsy asylum-seekers to Slovakia and Bulgaria , despite Parliament ' s recommendations and the express request of the European Court of Human Rights
