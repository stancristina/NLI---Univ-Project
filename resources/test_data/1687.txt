Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for coming here today to give us his statement for the meeting which is going to take place next Monday .
He has rightly said that the transatlantic relationship is one which has expanded greatly in the last ten years - mostly , it is true , on the American side thanks to President Clinton ; but I think that history will relate that there has also been a European contribution to this new relationship , which has been a fundamental key to the way in which it has worked , through the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990 and through the new Transatlantic Agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995 .
I think it would be very helpful , as the Commission prepares this new document on transatlantic relations , if we in Parliament could be given a document which analyses the progress which has been made so far in this relationship in looking at , for example , the success of the EU educational centres , success in terms of policy cooperation on such matters as AIDS , immigration , aid development issues and even on foreign policy questions such as work on transatlantic houses in Ukraine .
Equally it would be very helpful to know , because we are financing these in the budget of the European Union , how the dialogues have been developing .
The TABD , the Business Dialogue was very successful in its last meeting in Cincinatti , but we note that since then the Environment Dialogue has closed down in the last couple of weeks .
Therefore , I think an analysis of what has happened would be very helpful .
To conclude , what next ?
I believe that where we in this House are , as the Commissioner rightly pointed out , building up relationships , through the Legislators ' Dialogue between the European Parliament and Congress , we would hope , in the longer term , to see that turn into a form of transatlantic assembly .
Equally , we would like to see how the different dialogues of the business dialogue can be put into a broader partnership framework .
I would ask the Commissioner , in the run-up to the release of this document in April , under a new US Administration , apparently , it was decided today , under a new US President , hopefully George W. Bush , to see how to deepen this partnership in the future , based on the new Treaty of Nice which extends the activities of the European Union so as to enable it to be a real partner with the United States in the decade ahead .
Mr President , there seem to be many issues which this summit should address on its agenda , and one that I would like to see there is follow-up to the disappointing breakdown of the climate change talks in The Hague and how to get the US to take its responsibilities more seriously .
But the area that I want to focus on is world trade , the whole idea of a new trade round one year after Seattle .
This would seem an opportune time to take stock .
I think it is clear that before any new round is considered we need to address the perception of many developing countries that nothing has changed since Seattle in spite of the many promises that were made at the time .
I know the Commission is now talking about reviving elements of its position for a new round , making it more flexible , and I look forward to knowing what that really means in practice .
I also know and welcome the Everything but Arms Initiative and would urge the Commission to use the occasion of the summit to press the US again to join in with this initiative .
But we need to go further in building confidence with poorer countries .
Research from the development agency OXFAM has shown that when they have discussed what has changed since Seattle with the developing country delegations , the perceptions are that nothing has changed at all .
Bangladesh , for example , says and I quote : " Sufficient and sustained efforts have not been made by the developed countries to build our confidence in the WTO . "
Lesotho has said : " What has the WTO market liberalisation brought to Lesotho ? "
There are very many quotes that I hear from developing country delegations , all of which are saying that nothing much has happened .
I will conclude with the Dominican Republic , which says : " The WTO was supposed to have been an impartial referee of common rules where countries could learn to play the game .
It has not turned out that way .
The rules are biased against the weak and nothing has changed since Seattle . "
The forthcoming summit is the crucial opportunity to address those issues , to change the rules , and to make world trade work for the poor .
Mr President , the first point the committee would like to make is that current arrangements disadvantage EU providers of these services : software , data processing , and computer services , web hosting , web design and information .
We would like to add educational services to that .
They disadvantage people inside the EU because they currently pay VAT for the supply of these services whereas those outside the European Union do not .
This is why we believe that this directive needs to come into force with some urgency , particularly those of us who believe that there will be a rapid rise in e-commerce .
The Industry Committee adopted a number of proposals by thirty-nine votes to three .
We asked for registration in a single Member State .
We called for the European Commission to monitor
