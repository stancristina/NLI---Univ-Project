This Parliament is sending you a very clear political message , unanimously from the committee responsible in this area , and I hope that this House will support it by a majority .
Madam President , I would like firstly to point out that the rapporteur has not mentioned what is laid down in Rule 161( 1 ) which - and I quote the French version - says explicitly : " ... l ' exposé des motifs doit être conforme au texte de la proposition de résolution .. . " [the explanatory statement must accord with the text of the motion for a resolution] .

Mr President , I have voted against this report .
For my part , I would refer to the procedure which seems to me in this case to be important .

Mr President , the recent Euro-African Summit in Cairo has made poverty one of our central concerns .
We believe that there is an objective need for Taiwan to have a greater presence in the international institutions ; this Parliament can promote that .

These are Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 4 .
Lastly , Amendment No 4 refers to the protection of producers against pressures applied by the distributor to force them to extend the contract .
I would ask you , Mr President , to remember this and not to allow any MEP to leave the chamber while a count of those Members present is taking place .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to thank you for your interest and dedication to the European Union ' s information activities .
This goes hand in hand with efficiency .
We should also work towards the reduction and disappearance of night flights and the promotion of the railway .
Madam President , I am going to raise a point of order in the literal and true sense of the word .
Madam President , I want to mention the publication of a very important report a fortnight ago from the European Committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment .
The sister of one of the victims told reporters that it was shameful that they were not convicted of torture .
