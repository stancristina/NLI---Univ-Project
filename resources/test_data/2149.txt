This requires a number of things to be done .
If we are not prepared to make every effort to preserve a viable maritime transport industry in the Community , both the big main ports and the peripheral regions will suffer .
This needs to be vigorously opposed .
Will the Commissioner investigate and if necessary raise this with the US Government ?
Moreover , the Commission 's proposal offers few guarantees that European money will be responsibly spent .
Mr President , about two months ago we held a debate in Strasbourg with the Council President and the Council President said that the Commission should put forward an amended proposal on the banning of drift nets , because the current situation was deadlocked .
Nuclear matters are of direct relevance to Europe 's citizens , likewise now and in the future .
It only remains for me to compliment the rapporteur , Mrs Ahern , on her excellent report .
My Group will be supporting eleven of her eighteen amendments .
This agreement is consistent with the development of our relations with Latin America which allow for diversity between the various countries but nevertheless form a single whole .
An important section of the agreement is the accommodations reached on the future liberalization of trade .
Mr President , forgive me for interrupting this sitting on a point of order .
Mr President , the European Parliament , this House , has announced that calls for tender are to be invited for furnishings for the bars and restaurant of the Leopold building in Brussels .
The company was thus obliged to make do with documentation in French only .
Will that tour be conducted only in French as well ?
I gather from my colleagues that we have a broad base of support in the House for urging Belgian railways to preserve their present standard of service .
Mr President , it is true that Parliament as a whole originally asked for a debate this week on progress at the Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , as you pointed out , there was , I believe , unanimity in the Conference of Presidents that this item would not be debated this week but at the Brussels plenary following the special European Council on 23 May .
A well-regulated and liberalized market of the kind we want must benefit the user , so that everyone is able to obtain information , even if they have to pay for it , because the right to information must not remain a privilege of the elite .
The number of legislative proposals is significantly down on previous years .
Those in favour of a United Europe see the application of this principle as part of this political objective .
Mrs Palacio rightly makes that point in her report .
Those people are very worried about what they perceive as ever-increasing meddling by Europe .
That is the nub of the matter .
On the other hand , we need to agree that we cannot do our jobs unless we are given detailed information , from all manner of interest groups , on the situation in the various Member States .
We thus find it most important that the Ephremidis amendment , also one of ours , we put it down together in the plenary , that this amendment should be adopted , so that we have a clear understanding of which gifts , of whatever kind , lobbyists can give to MEPs or their assistants .
I think it is a very good thing , and I am very pleased , that I can cooperate with Mr Donnelly to the extent that if my report on the review of the plenary is put on the agenda , we can perhaps take up this amendment about scrapping split voting again , because it is in fact an amendment about scrapping split voting , albeit in disguise .
We have to lay down rules which can be applied throughout the European Union as uniformly as possible .
I hope to be publishing an own-initiative report on this later in the year .
I think a separate vote should have been held .
Firstly on gifts and then on officials .
The European Commission has a major responsibility for seeing that European law is incorporated into national law , but obviously it is ultimately up to Member States to implement it .
And the position varies with the environmental issue concerned .
I would thus like to see the European Commission looking at inspection services in the Member States and primarily checking their independent status .
There is room for another bookcaseful , but the question is whether that makes sense at the moment .
Despite the ability of the Commission to draw on Article 155 of the Treaty , compliance is largely a matter for the Member States .
Even if we decided tomorrow that we would all revert to being nation states and forget about Europe , the environment would still continue as a transboundary issue .
Ladies and gentlemen , Member States and hospitals should remember that when they are hard-pressed by current cuts in health spending .
I thought we had an agreement here in the House that we would never have more than five .
We now wish to focus the debate on security policy in the broader sense , which for the Union means Petersberg missions .
Of the several amendments which my group has tabled , I should like to draw your attention to two which we feel are particularly important .
I think that his words and everything that has been said in this debate , and in the Titley report , show that we are gradually moving towards agreement on a common security and defence policy to support our common foreign policy .
It is also true , as many people here know - though I entirely agree that
