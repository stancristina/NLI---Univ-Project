in the area of PVC , because that will have a bearing on the way we vote tomorrow .
Mr President , our group can also endorse the report and would like to see it implemented as soon as possible .
Israel was , of course , largely created by immigrants , refugees and individuals with a very strong character , who have been able to endure dictatorships and oppression and who in many cases have an extremely high standard of education to contribute .
What is being made available here for the cooperation between the European Union and the State of Israel is therefore a considerable mass of talent with high levels of education , competence and diligence .
And I mean this quite sincerely .
We have witnessed many ships that have spilt oil in our waters .
This directive imposes obligations on the ships .
We are moving from a convention - an IMO convention - which was a recommendation , to legislation , whereby we oblige the vessel and its master to give an account of any oily waste that may be on board .
In my opinion , it is essential that this directive should be made as functional as possible .
I hope that in the final version , the Commission and the Council find a model that makes this directive workable and attractive for the ships and the ports .
The rapporteur has touched on one of them .
Of course it must be paid for .
I hope that these costs will not become yet another restriction on shipping .
So the small coaster - or the large coaster for that matter - will certainly incur a charge here , and I consider this to be a problem .
If one were to regard this as infrastructure , it would be possible to make it free of charge .
It is also possible to look at it from the point of view of the waste oil that is brought ashore .
If one were to exempt it from oil taxes , VAT and so on , then it could actually finance this system .
Ships in transit in international waters that do not call at European ports are a different matter .
I feel that we should think back to what happened with the Pallas Athene .
The first ones to make a move lose the game , since it is they who pick up the bill .
We allowed the bill to be passed on to the place where the ship ended up .
I am well aware that this is not covered by this directive .
Mr President , we are all familiar with pictures of birds and fish fighting that final , impossible battle against oil spills and other waste from our ships along our coastlines , because the international conventions which prohibit dumping at sea are not being enforced .
Like the rapporteur , we in the June Movement normally uphold the principle that the polluter pays .
Control is the cornerstone of this directive .
Turkey is oppressing the Kurdish people , and I have no confidence that Mr Ã–calan will get proper justice .
I have never known of anything else in the course of my work with political prisoners in Turkey .
We were to be their shield .
As soon as we arrived at the airport , they were arrested and sent directly for interrogation and torture .
We tried to visit them in prison but were not allowed in .
How can adult human beings treat children as criminals before they have even reached puberty ?
In that way I was able to get through the barrier and talk to them .
The worst was not the cigarette burns or electric shocks .
The European countries must tell Turkey once and for all that torture is a crime against humanity .
May I propose that we send members of our Turkey delegation to take turns in attending the trial as observers ?
Madam President , harmonisation of social legislation in transport policy has been the focus of much attention from our committee and the Commission , and I am sure that everyone in this Chamber can see the problems .
I also think that we can agree on certain solutions , but when it comes to decisions in the Council , that is when things slow down .
Should good conditions give way to inferior ones ?
How do we harmonise ?
Transport is a cross-border process and is therefore a suitable area for drawing up common rules .
On the other hand , we have very large national transport industries .
We have the employees on one side and the transport customers on the other .
In my view , there should be European rules where they are needed , but to a certain extent we need to take account of national agreements and traditions .
I think that we have an excellent document here , but if we are to achieve a reasonable result , we must see what the possibilities are in the Council of Ministers , and we must see at what level we need to harmonise .
I repeat my question : must good conditions give way to inferior ones ?
That is what we should be discussing .
Mr President , in the past fishermen themselves could run fisheries , but technical possibilities have changed the fishing industry .
I am in broad agreement with the rapporteur , in that we must be sure not to lapse into romanticism , because fishing has changed and that is what we should be addressing .
I would therefore also like to comment on the 24 nautical miles question .
If we start to be restrictive towards one another , we do not have a common fisheries policy , because what is the use of fish spawning in our area if we are not allowed to catch them ourselves ?
