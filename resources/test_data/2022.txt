However , I can see that the Commission , although it recognises that Romania is working adequately towards the objective of 2007 , prefers to wait , for the sake of rigour and prudence , until autumn to confirm whether accession will actually take place in January 2007 , as I hope it will .
Finally , I would also like to encourage those Parliaments who have not done so to speed up the process as soon as possible for the ratification of the accession treaty .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , twenty years ago , like the Bulgarians and Romanians are doing now , we were finishing negotiations for Spain’s integration into the Community .
Our role is above all to understand that in Bulgaria and Romania there are two peoples with deep Europeanist convictions , much more so than the majority of the Member States , whom we therefore really need in order to move forward with the European Union project culminating in the Constitution .
I must begin my brief speech with two comments that set my position apart from the statements contained in Mr Rosati’s report , probably because some time has passed and has brought some positive results .
The report notes that the situation worsened in 2005 and attributes that to the incorrect application of the Stability and Growth Pact .
We have a unique opportunity in our hands to use Europe’s institutions and the European dimension to meet the people’s demands and aspirations .     – Madam President , Commissioner , first of all , I should like to congratulate Mr Rosati , because I think he has produced an excellent report , which takes on board contributions from the other political groups .
It has the ability to do so , but its problem is that its growth potential is so terribly low , incomparably low .
Part of the success may be due to the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact , because it has introduced some rationality .
All the indicators point to that .
I can also tell you , however , that the Council and the Eurogroup are willing to improve their coordination and to improve the involvement of all sectors and all the institutions – including this Parliament , of course – in the dialogue needed for this coordination to set the right objectives and priorities and to be effective .
We cannot ignore the fact that there have been reductions compared to the initial proposal , and the funds available will therefore have to be used extremely efficiently .
Neither do we want to add a budgetary crisis to the current political crisis in the Union , which has not just been created by the 'no ' votes on the Constitution , but also by the negative campaigns against the integration process , which are having so much success in certain countries .
There are no net contributors ; that hackneyed notion is merely a fallacy dreamt up by bad accountants .
On that basis , the European Parliament and our rapporteur embarked upon an impossible battle : to raise the figures to acceptable levels in order to maintain a positive impetus within the Union and its programmes .
As we pointed out in our opinion attached to the report , we believe that the international legislation supporting and protecting women 's rights should systematically become the cornerstone of all bilateral relations , particularly in the case of third countries with which the European Union has signed association and cooperation agreements .
Such double standards are unsustainable since they greatly harm the credibility of our democracy .
Mr President , I welcome this neighbourhood instrument that we will soon approve and which we are debating today and , in particular , I am pleased with all of the amendments that have increased the role played by civil society in the neighbourhood policy .
Firstly , it did not appear reasonable to have a single instrument for development cooperation and cooperation with the developed world .
It is not the hierarchy of the Committee on Development that is at stake , but rather the competence of Parliament , and in that regard we cannot take a single step backwards .
You have referred to the specific case of the person who has been released and not to the cases in which people have not been released .
I am referring to a very specific case , not to a general defence of human rights in Iran , since we are in fact doing that fairly effectively .
There are fewer resources and each committee is therefore going to have to face its own responsibilities .     Mr President , for me , the most important piece of news this evening is that Barça have won .
Internal security is one of these areas .
We also accept its call for the sustainable use of natural resources , particularly water , and the development of sustainable energy sources combined with savings and efficiency .
I am not sure .
We have also seen the dissatisfaction of the population in broad sectors of society , in NGOs and amongst representatives of civil society .
We must provide resources aimed at the victims of these disasters .
This instrument must respond quickly and effectively , with financial aid , to extreme situations of drought , fire and floods , without forgetting the victims of these disasters who need immediate help and assistance , and who Europe must not turn its back on .
Ladies and gentlemen , the victims of these disasters deserve their own chapter .
That amendment urges the Commission to provide the resources necessary to alleviate the suffering and meet the material needs of all of the victims of natural disasters and their immediate families , by means of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund and other Community instruments .
I have no doubt that our citizens will be able to identify the culprits .
Our hope is that what is
