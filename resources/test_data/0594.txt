the Baltic region in which Russia will become isolated .
There is thus a serious contradiction between the Union 's declared and de facto objectives .
In principle this could be done either by accepting Russia too as an EU Member State or by turning the Council of Europe into a strong pan-European cooperation umbrella .
Finally , when we speak of the development of the Baltic region , we must remember that this is a part of the EU 's wider northern policy which also includes the Arctic regions .
This being so , the Union too must start developing its own arctic regions policy , including objectives relating to the exploitation of the natural resources of these areas and also the Union 's responsibility to protect the sensitive environment of these regions and take account of the privileges and rights of indigenous peoples .
Finland and Sweden have joined the European Union following the breakdown of Europe 's ideological and military division .
A cooperation and partnership agreement has been negotiated between the EU and Russia which should hopefully enter into force this year .
The main objective of the Visby conference will naturally enough be strengthening democratic and economic development in the area .
On behalf of the Finnish Social Democrats , I should like to place particular stress on the importance of implementing and reconciling the TACIS , PHARE and INTERREG programmes so that the region will benefit from them in practice .
We also support the inclusion on the list of Europe-wide gas networks the one linking Russia 's and Norway 's gas resources .
In the Baltic region there is a need for cooperation based on respect for the independence of all the countries in the areas .
It needs to be stated plainly that the legitimate security interests of these countries must be taken seriously .
There are many problems involved with the chemical industry , particularly as regards the environment .
Consequently clear legislation is needed to protect both the consumer and the environment .
The most important thing is that the products on the market should be those with the least environmental impact and that lower quality products should be removed from the market or that the 'reassessment procedure ' should be used .
This report gives the national authorities 60 days in which they are supposed to find time to carry out research , on the basis of information they have obtained themselves , as to whether biocide products should be released for sale .
For example , in the cold weather area where the ground remains frozen almost all the year round , the disappearance of residues released into the water and the soil takes considerably longer than under any other conditions .
Mr President , this proposal for a directive on a common EU-approved list and approval procedure concerning biocidal products , i .e products used for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health , has come up for debate in Parliament at what I believe is a most appropriate time , for alarming medical research has recently been coming from various parts of Europe on the number of growth-inhibiting agents and their residues which are harmful to human hormone activity and consequently tend among other things to weaken human fertility .
Some countries ' environmental conditions differ from those in other countries .
Foodstuffs , however , cross borders and the consumer cannot always know nowadays in which country and how the food he is eating has been produced and where it originates .
It is important to remember that man is part of nature and is always just as sensitive to environmental pollution as the rest of nature .
Mr President , the rapporteur seems to be relying too much on the assumption that the movement of capital functions best under the current international funding systems .
Nor am I sure about the Social Democrats ' proposal that it would be sufficient to set up an international economic council to monitor speculation .
At present the sum of money changing hands throughout the world is equivalent to three times the foreign currency reserves of many industrialized countries .
This , indeed , was proposed last year at the Halifax Summit and this is what the rapporteur is now proposing , but it is really not enough .
This was proposed as long ago as 1978 by James Tobin , who later won the Nobel Prize .
Mr President , in my opinion Parliament acted responsibly when it gave the Committee on Economic Affairs the opportunity to draw up this report .
The exchange of raw materials and product information has fostered development .
Only the excessive use of energy and its various forms are causing us problems .
Our new technology makes it possible to carry out transactions at the speed of light and when speculations are added to this problem , we are really endangering the conditions for international free trade .
There is frequent talk of the confidence of the citizen .
This is also an essential condition for all democracy and market economy .
There is no time to waste ; regulation is needed above all to protect ordinary citizens and their jobs .
They do not have the resources or the opportunity to protect themselves .
It would reduce the need for these reserves and yet at the same time could increase creditability .
Capital cannot be given a free ride .
It must bear the social responsibility of paying tax .
Only in this way will it be possible to move forward in this area .
For example , the President of Finland is currently in China with an 80-member trade delegation .
The genocide which has been going on for 40 years is still in full swing and it is the European Parliament 's responsibility to remind the Member States , the Council and the Commission continually of this terrible tragedy .
