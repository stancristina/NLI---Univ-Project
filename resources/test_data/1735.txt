I would take the liberty of providing a short résumé .
The outcome of the conciliation is quite clearly better than the Commission ’s original proposal and the old rules , but I think that we have unfortunately missed a unique opportunity to be as progressive as the pledges and the talk of sustainable development would seem to require .
The criteria said to be of an environmental character are among those that , according to the agreed wording , must be set by the procuring entity .
What , therefore , is meant by criteria of an environmental character ?
I believe that many members of the Greens/ALE Group will in any case vote in favour of the proposal .
That is what I myself am going to do .
I think it is important for us to use public procurement in order also to affect the development of society .
If we want to see gender equality in working life , we must favour workplaces where this is promoted .
That is a question that negotiators always ask themselves .
Parliament’s position on public procurement shows that decisions at Community level can be important for achieving a more humane society .
We draw the same conclusion as the ELDR Group : no discharge should be granted .
These assertions are also well corroborated in OLAF’s report .
We shall vote against granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions .
Mr Casaca’s report is not bad .
A systematic and organised misuse of EU funds has taken place , and there has been a failure to intervene in time .
That proud watchword , issued at the beginning of the term of office , proved to have little substance when it came to the Eurostat affair .     Mr President , following the Second World War , there were high hopes that a worldwide organisation would give the world lasting peace and provide people with freedom and democracy .
In spite of this , the UN has not been especially successful in getting its member countries to comply with the human freedoms and rights laid down in its Charter .
In this area , the UN has been too passive .
In such circumstances , it is only natural that civic commitment is instead channelled through , for example , organisations such as Amnesty International .
I shall concentrate on four points .
If we have a common foreign and security policy , it cannot be devised solely by the major powers : Germany , France and perhaps also Great Britain .
Regarding paragraph 19 , I would , secondly , emphasise the value of depriving countries that systematically infringe human rights of their right to vote in the UN Commission on Human Rights until such breaches cease .
We must not therefore weaken the EU’s current 40 % representation in the UN Security Council .
We instead recommend that companies operate in accordance with responsibly designed voluntary codes of conduct .     We have voted in favour of the proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC ) No 1734/94 on financial and technical cooperation with the Occupied Territories ( West Bank and Gaza ) , but we believe that matters must be carefully followed up with a view to making it clear that appropriated EU funds will not be used for purposes other than those intended , for example for propaganda activities not designed to promote peace .     We believe that what is termed the Eurostat affair has revealed that reforms are required within the Commission regarding the control and monitoring of the EU authorities ’ activities .
The reason for this is that these amendments are keenly critical of the serious irregularities at Eurostat .
The report was adopted by 467 votes in favour , with 11 votes against and 9 abstentions .     We have today voted in favour of the present resolution on EU space policy , just as we previously supported the own-initiative report on the Commission ’s Green Paper on European space policy on 9 October 2003 and the report on Europe and space on 17 January 2002 .
Eight hours ’ work , eight hours ’ leisure time and eight hours ’ sleep were what were then demanded .
It also meant that workers were protected and that society was given a fixed framework for work , schooling , leisure and other activities .
That is a retrograde step that is incomprehensible .
I do not understand how people can argue in that way or put forward a proposal along those lines .
Call it voluntary or involuntary , but the fact is that , in a labour market exposed to competition , people may expect to have a pre-determined market value .
Parents are forced to work hours that make it difficult to combine work and family life and take care of their children .
It would be much better for all parties if we could agree to put an end to these opt-outs obtained by the United Kingdom at the time when the directive was adopted .
We must therefore call a halt and instead go down the opposite route .
They say that , in view of the fact that certain jobs have such low wages , we must allow employees to work longer hours so as to compensate for these low wages .
These principles , about which we have expressed our opinions , are directly contrary to flexibility of that kind .
Is that the kind of Europe we want : one in which we compete in terms of social legislation ?
Think how dependent the individual employees are on their companies when they are to agree upon wages and working time .
I therefore recommend collective agreements through which this flexibility can be achieved .
Let us comply with this model , in which case we must remove the individual opt-out
