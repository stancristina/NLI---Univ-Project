party association must have obtained at least five per cent of the vote in at least a third of the Member States or be represented in the European Parliament or national or regional parliaments in a third of the Member States .
The wording in Article 3 concerning the approach to European political associations and national parties bears witness to a view of the future which I cannot in any way share : 'the party or its national components ' .
It is time for sanctions against Israel , Mrs Lindh .
The EU has for a long time been the biggest provider of economic and administrative aid and the most important supporter of the Palestinian Authority .
If , now , it really is the case that the EU' s new rapid reaction force does not exist at all to protect the EU' s interests as a superpower but , in fact - and as Mrs Lindh usually maintains - is there simply to be unselfish about making peace in the world , why not propose that it be deployed in the Middle East along the only lawful dividing line between Israel and Palestine , namely the 1967 frontier ?
The work of the former Foreign Minister , Mr Andersson , is being carried on not by Mrs Lindh but by her Danish colleague , Mr Lycketoft , who now talks in no uncertain terms about Israel ' s violation of human rights and of international law .
, Council .
So far , we have been able to help prevent full-scale conflicts in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in southern Serbia .
The responsibility and future of the EU also encompass a global responsibility .
Cooperation is now being deepened in a number of areas in Europe .
The Union ' s ways of working are now being developed with the legislation on public access to documents and with the reform work within the institutions .
Through the Treaty of Nice we prepared the Union for new members joining and , at the same time , made clear our commitment to continued deeper cooperation .
These were important decisions , and we succeeded in getting further than just the three matters that were selected in Amsterdam .
The common website that the Commission is running went live back in early March .
In addition , there are all the national initiatives that have been started , both in Member States and in applicant countries .
I believe that the debate on the future is primarily about policy , and secondarily about institutions .
It may be tempting to simplify the debate by looking too much at the terms themselves and too little at what the terms actually represent .
The same applies to the debate concerning a 'constitution ' .
Similarly , a contradiction is often painted between those who believe that democratic legitimacy emanates from representatives elected by the populace in their own country and those who believe that it must be sought in a new political model of European cooperation .
When the interaction between the European and the national level develops , then democracy is the winner and the influence of citizens is strengthened .
The requirements for grassroots support and the extensive agenda will make special demands of the preparations for the next Intergovernmental Conference , and many people have said that we must find a more open way than previously .
Some think that a small group of so-called wise men should table proposals .
However , quite a few countries have stressed that an open forum , a convention , must not restrict or forestall the debate with the citizens .
At the same time , it is important that the broad debate continues and that we also take on board what is happening in the national debates .
We need a combination .
This will naturally also form an important basis for the presidency when we present a report in Gothenburg .
Mr President , the Treaty of Nice tends to be marketed as an enlargement treaty .
As pointed out in the report , the seats in the European Parliament must be redistributed since there is direct discrimination against Hungary and the Czech Republic .
All the candidate countries except Poland are therefore also losers , because they will be small countries in the European Union .
The real significance of the Treaty of Nice is thus that an enlarged Union will be dominated by the same large countries as dominate today ' s European Union and that the march towards the formation of a federal state in the EU is continuing , even if this development is not progressing as quickly as some in this assembly would like .
It would have been reasonable for such a decision to have been taken in Nice , that is , to open up the legislative assembly to inspection .
However , if in the end we are to have a convention then we believe that it must be a convention for those who decide on the treaty , namely the national parliaments .
Now we are instead seeing the social democrat governments starting to fall around the EU.
There has been no actual change in the foundation of the EU during the time that we have had a 'red-green' dominance in the EU.
Mr President , the Treaty of Nice is obviously open to a wide range of interpretations .
It also leaves much to be desired in democratic respects .
During that time nobody knows what is happening .
After all , it is no secret that the majority in this chamber advocate that in any case .
A talking shop , an alibi that the ministers then ride roughshod over ?
Some Heads of Government are also doing so .
Federalism - with the different interpretations that it may be given - is , however , a vision of a more democratic Europe
