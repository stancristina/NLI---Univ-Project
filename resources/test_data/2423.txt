up EU embassies in the future .
Paragraph 12 - in which I think the embassies of the Member States are being told that they are to issue joint statements of their views .
Let us continue along these lines .
It was therefore good that the Council ' s representatives made it clear that the EU backs all current UN decisions .
That is what no-one now questions but , when it comes to all the important questions in the peace negotiations - that is to say , Jerusalem , the refugees and territorial considerations - the Palestinians in fact have international law on their side .
They are not demanding west Jerusalem .
It is therefore important that the EU should stick by the Berlin decision to recognise a Palestinian State without conditions as soon as the Palestinians see fit to declare such a State , to which they are entitled .
Let the EU act as a sponsor for the Palestinian State , that is to say the democratic Palestinian State .
On the one hand , it contains a large number of proposals for improving operations in the EU' s present offices abroad .
Because we are in favour of practical improvements to the existing foreign operation , but absolutely opposed to the EU' s beginning to behave like a superstate in the world around , especially by stealth , we have no option but to abstain from voting .
I cannot therefore vote in favour of Mr Galeote Quecedo ' s report .
The priorities established deserve all our support .
My own experience when , in a responsible post within the UN' s development programme , I sought cooperation with the Union at national level with a view to assembling and coordinating forces in different areas was that , as a rule , it did not work , either because almost every decision in the EU' s case needed to be taken in Brussels and also because of the lack of qualified staff within the area concerned .
" Brussels " , with all its administrative levels , must relinquish a large degree of control .
If there are no rapid improvements , I fear that the Commission ' s support for development cooperation will gradually disappear .
As we know , there is an old saying , prevention is better than cure .
It obviously has to do with poverty , with lack of information and education , with patterns of sexual behaviour and , specifically , with young girls ' lack of education of a kind which would better enable them to resist sexual advances .
Instead , we must ensure that the Commission obtains a sufficient number of qualified staff so that it is not isolated employees who are trying to push ahead with these issues .
When , finally , we talk about partnership , it is , as Commissioner Nielson said , extremely important to seek out whatever proves to have worked and to support it .
I welcome Commissioner Nielson ' s conference on 28 September 2000 and hope that it will lead to something of a crash programme for tackling these problems still more vigorously in the future .
The Council has now explained that it cannot comment "in its capacity as the Council of Ministers " , but the French Government may perhaps comment in its own capacity .
Is this matter not thought to be serious and to need to be included in the assessment being made in the Wise Men' s report ?
I should like to ask a follow-up question : What conditions are being laid down for in fact providing this aid ?
In an ordinary democracy it is , of course , the rule that all decisions concerning new laws are made publicly in a parliament and that the debates too are held in public .
It may no longer be possible to watch Swedish television as easily in Finland .
I would therefore urge the Commissioner to bear this in mind .
Not all languages are in fact equal in the EU in this respect .
This may apply to students who have to prove that they have a proper place at university or to pensioners who have to prove that they will be taking their pensions or own capital with them if they move .
They are to be given better opportunities to move and an extended right to take up residence in other countries .
Freedom of movement for labour is protected by the legislation of the internal market .
The assessments are to be carried out at as early a stage as possible in the planning process , partly so that alternative solutions might be found before the decision-making process is taken any further .
Environmental reports are to be written and made available to the environmental authorities , the public and environmental organisations , which are also to be given sufficient time within which to respond to the reports .
What often happens nowadays is that attempts are made to identify and repair damage once it has occurred .
It was not possible to achieve this in the Council , but the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy considered that policy areas too must be included in the review to be carried out in five years ' time .
At first reading , the European Parliament had quite a lot of points of view .
In the common position , the Council has now made the text worse in a number of areas , specifically when it comes , for example , to the scope of the directive and the definition of what it is to cover .
Nor can we accept that financial plans and the whole of the defence sector are exempt from strategic environmental assessments .
This possibility was not mentioned at all in the Committee ' s discussion .
