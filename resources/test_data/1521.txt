the partsession which was discussed this week , and it was especially the case with your own report on the voting system .
The current GNSS system will be given additional capabilities for geographical positioning with satellites , integrity and wide-area information for its users .
That is why the Committee on Budgets requested that the Langenhagen report should not be adopted until the financial situation had been thoroughly investigated .
Extremely complex interests are at stake , and for that reason it is crucial that we keep our finger on the pulse .
But on the other hand , I believe Ukraine is not addressing certain issues sufficiently - energy conservation , for instance .
But because we in this Parliament wish to see a strict and strong advisory group , I would like to argue for the remit to be not too broad , but in fact as specific as possible .
I think it is Parliament rather than the European Council which does the pioneering work .
Such a position could even strengthen the legitimacy of this Parliament , because Parliament might be better at this than the Council .
I would like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur on his report .
It is these two countries - and I am talking about France and Italy - which will be the problem children of EMU.
At present we are faced with the dilemma that calling off EMU leads to economic chaos , whilst proceeding with EMU is a big step full of political and economic risks .
This means that it is not only in the big countries that the emphasis in economic policy can shift from making basic cutbacks to promoting growth and employment .
Where there is a will there is a way .
Mr President , this is in fact the first annual report since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Luxembourg Summit .
The argument often used is that this leaves more room to do something about unemployment in future .
A monetary policy requires a coordinated and intelligent economic policy .
The global guidelines for economic policy covering the policy mix at European level and within the Member States will thus be given overriding importance .
A time schedule must be set for the cutbacks , or the monetary policy or wage restraints must be relaxed .
However , it must be on condition that the proposed measures can be established in reasonable time and with sufficient financial support in policy action .
The third issue is the protection of intellectual property by strengthening the fight against fake products .
Nonetheless , in his written contribution Mr Ettl has pointed to problems , such as double taxation and in some countries the long qualifying periods for pensions , which should be consigned to the past .
Partly through the efforts of this Parliament , the committee and the working programme got off the ground , and was laid down in the Marrakesh Agreement .
The work of the CTE must be taken up forcefully , and before the end of this century it must be in a position to fulfil the mandate set in Marrakesh .
This is undoubtedly the best known cultural programme in Europe .
That is already much better , as this will establish it at least as a Community initiative .
As a Belgian , a Flemish citizen , I should be very satisfied , because the Council of Ministers has said that in the year 2002 Bruges will be the European City of Culture , but I am not satisfied with this .
Commissioner , this is my argument in a nutshell , because the rapporteur has explained the proposals in detail .
An important point regarding the participation of smaller cities in the programme is that Europe provides sufficient resources .
Promises have already been made to cities , and to countries at intergovernmental level .
I only wanted to issue a warning about some demarches happening at the moment .
I really did not want to teach anyone a lesson .
It is sometimes also possible to infringe copyright with legal and seemingly harmless software .
They have to bear that in mind in their policy .
The European Union Member States are becoming increasingly dependent on gas for heat and electricity .
In the Netherlands combined heat and power , as well as CO2 from combined heat and power stations , is used in market gardening , a totally closed circuit which is efficient and environmentally friendly .
On principle , our group will persevere with this as well .
Parliament is taking part in a decision which will radically change the course of European integration .
In implementing and operating monetary union , we want to allow our Parliament to play the role which is its due under the Treaty .
We can create long-term jobs .
I would also like to express the hope , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that all Member States , including - under your influence - your own country , will within a reasonable period join the dynamic , integration-promoting euro area which we are creating today .
( Applause ) That is the significance of the decision we are about to take .
In mentioning Helmut Kohl , I am also paying tribute to the other leading German politicians who have worked so hard for a European Germany .
It is not worth committing such a wrong to keep Paris happy .
Few subjects evoke as much feeling among Europeans as the risk that they will get a smaller pension than they are entitled to .
To create jobs , labour costs must be reduced for employers , the unemployed must be given more education and training , and the unemployed must be given more incentives to work .
These political decisions are too important to be taken without serious democratic control .
