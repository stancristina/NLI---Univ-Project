have safety as a major part of it leaving out the issue of duty time for cockpit crews .
In this area , the social partners have been trying to reach an agreement for ten years .
Ten years and no agreement must be a failure by any measurement you wish to adopt .
However , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism recognise that the best people to deal with this problem are indeed the trade unions and the airline operators and , in a spirit of compromise , have agreed to give all sides until 1 May 2001 to reach an agreement that will form the text of a new Subpart Q . However , should they fail in their endeavours then , at the second reading stage , Parliament , through the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , will act and legislate in this area .
I am hopeful that the relevant social partners will reach an agreement .
I am grateful to them for their current efforts .
Amendments have been proposed that also look at the problem of cabin baggage .
Sadly , airlines at present do not strictly enforce cabin baggage regulations , which has led to passengers bringing more and more bags into airline cabins .
Amendment No 16 addresses this problem , which was highlighted to me by the cabin crew themselves and even some airlines .
I find it totally amazing that groups in Parliament will vote against this amendment .
This is a safety issue , and as their rapporteur I would ask them to seriously reconsider their opinion .
This amendment is totally acceptable to all airlines and cabin crew and it in no way stops passengers having cabin baggage .
What it does is stop the excessive cabin baggage which has led to passengers being injured from luggage falling out of overhead bins ; to passengers having restricted access in case of emergency evacuation procedures and , which I know from my own experience , to aircraft toilets being used to carry bags .
Whilst I appreciate that MEPs are amongst the worst culprits for excessive cabin baggage , I would hope their sense of responsibility would enable them to recognise that a problem exists , that this problem compromises safety and that Amendment No 16 should be supported .
I believe that the report before us is worth supporting .
However , in conclusion , I feel I must reiterate the warning I made earlier that we need an agreement on flight time limitation before 1 May from our social partners .
If they can deliver that agreement for us , then I believe we will have a document that we can rightly be proud of .
I have to say that if they fail in their endeavours , I am sure Parliament will feel obliged to act on their behalf .
Mr President , as mentioned in 1989 , the Council and the Commission agreed that they had to address the harmonisation of the regulatory framework applicable to civil aviation in order to maintain a high level of safety and to ensure fair competition in the internal market .
Hence , the Community adopted Council Regulation 3922/91 .
This regulation listed a number of technical requirements - JARs - produced by the Joint Aviation Authority .
It was not the purpose of this regulation to re-open a debate on the substance of JAR : the purpose was to ensure harmonisation .
In addition , it should be recognised that JAR-OPS has been implemented on a national basis and is applicable to European countries outside the EU.
Therefore changes must be kept to a minimum as there cannot be two different sets of operational regulations in force across Europe .
The Commission 's original proposal highlighted four areas which were found to be incompatible in EU law : exemptions , leasing , registration and cabin crew training .
Unfortunately , the debate so far has centred on cabin baggage and flight time limitations for flight crew .
On the first point - cabin baggage - the amendments are anti-competitive and cannot apply to third-country carriers .
Sufficient regulation is already in place , which does not allow on board hand baggage which cannot be safely stowed - I can vouch for that as a cabin crew member for 26 years .
On my second point - flight time limitations , which are already highly regulated and agreed through national governments - civil aviation is now included in working time regulation .
Irrespective of the decision taken on 1 May , this issue would have to be referred back to national governments for further discussion .
It is not for Parliament to legislate on flight time limitations .
Finally , I believe that in future safety and highly technical reports such as this should be subject to a simplified procedure in order to process necessary changes more speedily .
Mr President , first of all I thank the rapporteur for her splendid work on behalf of us all and also thank Mr Vatanen for his contribution , speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group .
I fully endorse many of the points he made , not least in respect of blood-alcohol limits .
In fact there are only two points that I wish to make this evening .
They relate to safer car fronts and the very important issue of blood alcohol .
On safer car fronts , I think it is worth pointing out how clearly the rapporteur has made the case for the Commissioner to come forward with a directive .
In fact this Commissioner pledged to this House in January last year , a year ago , that we would have a directive on safer car fronts .
A year on there is no directive .
What we have in February is a hearing .
More talk .
No action
