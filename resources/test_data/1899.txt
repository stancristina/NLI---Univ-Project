an effective European Union could have a considerable impact , one that is conducive to a fair , safe and multilateral world .
From this , the impression is created that the process is currently going hand in hand with less stringent criteria .
The western Balkans and Kosovo are also being mentioned in the same breath .
It would be unfortunate if the Council and the Commission were susceptible to Turkey 's criticism that they are not reacting quickly enough and that surely , Turkey has now waited long enough , while it is we who have waited for the changes in Turkey to take place .
This calls for staying power and caution .
I do not think we could have imagined a more beautiful spot and a more beautiful image .
During the Iraq crisis , we saw what became of Europe if everything is to be decided unanimously .
Much has been achieved in many areas , but the Presidency of the Council will , of course , be best remembered for the kick-off of the final decision on the constitutional treaty .
I hope that this will result in an Intergovernmental Conference that will decide to sign a treaty that is actually based on the Convention 's conclusions .
I am really happy today to be a Christian Democrat ; not because we are celebrating our fiftieth anniversary , but mainly because our ideology takes as its starting point the need to believe in people .
Not only is it their right , it is also their duty to place their electorate 's problems and complaints on the political agenda .
A consumer who wants GMO-free products does not want less than 0.9 % or 0.5 % GMOs in them .
This is what matters most ; it means that Europe 's lack of knowledge compared to the United States is only growing .
Consumers must be able to choose , and labelling is crucial to this .
If we are to move ahead , we have to support all the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Despite this , I can agree to this legislation , because I think it is about time the ban was lifted , and I should therefore like to hear from the Commission what steps it intends to take to bring this about .
As one of the previous speakers already remarked , patients in developing countries are still faced with a shortage of medicines .
In accordance with the directive , Member States are obliged to ensure that fair compensation is in place for three of the exceptions to the reproduction right listed in the directive .
At the same time , it must be stressed that the directive does not require Member States to abolish copyright , or to take a stand for or against copyright in comparison to digital rights management systems .
That has fortunately been retained in the compromise .
We can also see packaging in a positive light by looking at it in conjunction with the product .
Some even maintain that really the packaging directive is first and foremost a recycling directive .
The discussion was indeed more of a discussion between countries than between political groups .
It is very important to set ambitious but achievable targets for the new Member States as well .
The responsibility of producers here is not just financial .
This approach fits in perfectly with the sixth environmental action programme .
The second point that I would like to make concerns ceramics .
Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur , Mrs Corbey , on her approach .
I am less happy with the fact that the discussion of mechanical recycling is again being deferred , so that we continue to be faced with a lack of clarity .
Finally , Mr President , I really do think that gift wrap should be covered by the definition of packaging .
That does however mean that you must not distort the market in achieving those targets .
He has gone about his business with energy and tenacity .
It is particularly disappointing for the PSE Group that the amendment on closures for instance failed to reach the finish line .
The PSE Group is entirely satisfied on other points .
No one is served by an auction for 5 % and in this way we would also tend to stimulate overallocation .
And that is most sorely needed .
There has been much weighing up of the pros and cons in many a European boardroom , in many Member States and therefore within the political groups as well .
The path to the compromise , which I otherwise support , was not an easy one .
Mr President , I have asked the Commission in Dutch and in English whether it will include aeroplanes in this .
It is possible to add 30 % , 40 % , 55 % water to these chickens .
What are the financial consequences of this rate ?
Something has to be done about that .
We shall be examining it closely .
We are therefore expecting good cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London and with the European Investment Fund in Luxembourg .
First of all the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy seeks further clarification from the European Commission on the financial framework for the southeastern Europe region for the period 2004-2006 .
( NL ) Mr President , I should like to echo the compliments for Mr Mulder 's report and input .
This means that in the event of future outbreaks the Commission might spend far less money on slaughter .
I want to ensure that the expenditure on administrative management is kept to the minimum possible .
Peace in the regions in Europe is also important
