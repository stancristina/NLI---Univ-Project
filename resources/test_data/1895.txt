this is not only of significance to health workers but also to hospital patients and their families .
A few days ago in this House , the Bilbao Agency spoke to us about some of the campaigns it is carrying out to promote health and safety and it even revealed economic studies which demonstrate that in Australia , for example , accidents and illnesses account for more than 6 % of GDP in the national economy .
Without them this framework agreement would certainly not exist and neither would there be any kind of prevention .
However , this is not the right place .
Why do we always have this problem and yet in a case like today 's , which is merely an administrative issue , we get this kind of presence and support ?
Therefore , there is not even a case .
However , it concerns me to hear that President Ch√°vez equates the new social networking sites with State terrorism and to see how the Internet is under serious threat .
Let me signal as well that , after this fact , there are some specific and local situations that are worrying in terms of the government issuing a decree legalising the export of unprocessed and endangered wood threatening the biodiversity of the country .
Whilst there we also met up with some of the opposition groups , among them the National League for Democracy whose leader , as also already mentioned , is the Sakharov Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi .
In this regard , I must make an explicit appeal to the Commission .
It has taken the challenges that the European Union has to tackle during these sessions of the Human Rights Council very seriously .
Finally , I would like to discuss the problem of the Council Review .
In this respect , we believe that participation in the United Nations Human Rights Council , including support for the existence of the Council , is a position that must be upheld by the European Union .
There are other cases in which the objectives have not been achieved , but the positives always outweigh the negatives .
In short , Mr President , we consider the Human Rights Council to be a place where we must defend the European Union 's position , and we think it is the right place to do so .
It should provoke a reaction in those of us who , as is the case in the European Union and Parliament , believe in the existence of human rights and in defending them .
In her statement on 16 February , last month , Mrs Ashton , the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , also expressed her concern regarding the situation of the Polish minority in Belarus , and regarding the detention by the police of some members of that minority .
At the same time , I think that it is important for Belarus to be working in the right direction , and all of the dimensions of the Eastern Partnership are an opportunity to influence Belarus in the right direction , including the multilateral aspect .
All of this is important , and it is , of course , equally important , as many of you have said , to constantly , clearly and directly convey to the Belarusian authorities our entirely critical and condemning attitude to the human rights violations .
The Council of the European Union has always approved and has always been behind the Union and the United Nations in the area of gender equality .
I am talking very specifically about the Europe 2020 strategy .
I must say that these speeches by female Members are an expression of a new phase that is beginning in the European Union , also in the area of gender equality .
Only yesterday , we had a meeting with the Commission in Madrid .
The Council is also going to examine carefully all of Parliament 's opinions to enable it to subsequently examine and adopt the legislative proposals under the ordinary legislative procedure .
The European Fisheries Fund and the future financial perspective will be dealt with in April , followed by the external dimension in May , and waste and selectivity in June .
I , too , am speaking here for the first time on the topic of fisheries , and indeed we are facing a significant challenge in this area .
This is important and it is something that the entire sector wants .
The reform of the fisheries policies is more than simply drawing up legislation .
To date , the debates have revealed differing positions on the following aspects : relative stability ; the current system of TACs and quotas and the use of transferable quotas ; limiting effort as a management tool ; the methods to reduce discards , overcapacity and overfishing ; global financing and its allocation ; and the increase in support for small-scale fishing and coastal communities .
I have voted in favour of this important report because in doing so , we are supporting the Commission proposal on the extension of the transitional regime as regards rabies , meaning that the end of the regime coincides better with the period when the European Commission expects to terminate EU funding of vaccination programmes to eradicate sylvatic rabies in some Member States , which is the main rabies problem in the EU.
The second question concerns the action to be taken by local authorities .
In the long term , we also want to see a horizontal , mainstreaming approach to Roma issues in all areas of European Union policy , and this will have to be carried out within the context of the open method of coordination and in areas such as fundamental rights , combating discrimination , regional development , education , and access to public employment and public services .
