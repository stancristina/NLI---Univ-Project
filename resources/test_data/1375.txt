Can we have your assurance that your senior team is going to be open-minded and looking at these new solutions ?
Finally , your White Paper quite rightly notes that action is going to have to be taken when managers are not performing to the expected standard .
It would not be surprising , given the changes , that there are some people who feel uncomfortable with this .
Can you confirm that probationary periods , as set out in your White Paper , have been included in the contracts for the new appointments , how long those periods are and that systematic assessments of performance are included in those appointments ?
Mr President , first of all Mr Dell ' Alba is certainly right with the first part of his question .
The tone of the question when it was put seems very different from the tone that we are hearing now in the Chamber .
First of all , we have to say that the White Paper reforms are progressing .
They are progressing slowly but Rome was not built in a day and we must remember that .
We all know that there is a timetable - one that we have all agreed to and must be kept .
What I would like to address , before I look at the substance , is the question behind this question , - that is what we really have to look at here .
It strikes me - and I will not be quite as subtle as Mr van den Berg - that the tone of this question seems to be the same tone as the Stauner report , the original Stauner report that was comprehensively rejected within the Budget Control Committee - the same tone that was set in the explanatory statement which was rejected by Parliament as a whole .
We are all desperate to see reform but it will take time .
The new Commission has been in office for only seven months .
It was approved by the European Parliament by a huge majority .
The question we really have to ask here is not to the Commission but to the PPE Group as to the motivation behind the question .
It strikes me as being clearly politically motivated , trying to undermine the work done on reform , trying to shoot this new bird down before it has taken flight .
This is because there is an element within the PPE Group , and I do not include Mr Pomés Ruiz in this , interested in wrecking the tactics of the Commission , wrecking Commission reform and wrecking the EU.
And the PPE Group is being hijacked by that element within the group .
I believe that this Commission is very open to taking on board some - I hope all - of Parliament ' s concerns and criticisms , because we have criticisms too .
But there is a time and place for that and this will be when we look at Mr Pomés Ruiz ' response to the White Paper .
The PSE Group want to engage in a constructive debate because we are interested in the outcome of reform , not in scoring short-term political points that do nothing but damage the European Union .
Turning very quickly to the substance of the questions : in the Commission hearings the European Parliament asked for rotation of A1 and A2 posts and to end national flags on senior jobs .
The Commission has taken positive steps since they came into power , ensuring that appointments are made on the basis of merit .
Of course , in a multinational institution , we must be sensitive to national considerations but these must be seen within the medium and long term .
As the Commissioner said , you cannot take a snapshot halfway through .
We should be interested in checking systems and not checking individuals .
The role of the European Parliament is to keep the Commission on its toes .
We want to see appointments on merit but that does not mean interfering and questioning every single senior appointment .
I would like to make a quick point on improving the equal opportunities aspect of the Commission ' s reform proposals .
Mrs Hautala' s question was very well put and we also would like an answer to that .
We do not currently think that the proposals go far enough in terms of gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities .
On parts 3 and 4 of this oral question I understand that the Conference of Presidents agreed on April 6 that these two questions should be removed .
That being the case , I would like to ask you , Mr President , to look into why the services had still not removed those parts today .
That is a serious problem .
The fact is that Commission reform is going ahead .
Mr Prodi has made some announcements today as the head of the organisation .
Again , most of it looks at mobility but I would like to ask the Commissioner why the role of the new post , Director of the Economic and Political Council , was not advertised .
That is a post that we would like to have seen advertised .
Finally , I would like to ask the PPE Group to refrain from such politically motivated and unconstructive questions as we have here .
I am confident that Mr Pomés Ruiz will not take that attitude when he responds to the White Paper , but please do not let your group be hijacked by a minority .
Mr President , could I thank the honourable Members in all parts of the House for the constructive contributions they have made in the course of this debate .
Perhaps I could risk some superficiality , because of the time , by trying to answer the specific
