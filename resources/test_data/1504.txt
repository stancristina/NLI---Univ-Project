as these by big business ; on the contrary , they are encouraged and funded from national and Community resources .
I also think it is obvious that there needs to be full and fundamental cover for all categories , so that the citizens of the European Union feel that the Union is a body that cares about each and every one of them , does not take a narrow , short-sighted view of certain business interests and is concerned that everyone who has an insurance claim following an aviation accident should be compensated .
However , we must not go beyond that , because there needs to be a sense of security among our citizens .
We shall not accept the other amendments , because we believe that the text approved by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism is exceptionally well balanced .
Consequently , we are talking about the objective liability of polluters and about a set of arrangements to influence the behaviour of operators .
Thirdly , oil pollution and nuclear damage are not covered with the argument that they are covered by international conventions .
The directive must therefore be clear and must expressly state what the current liability regime is .
I think that these exceptions undermine the reliability of the objectives of the directive , limit the scope of the liability regime and undermine the polluter pays principle .
However , this may risk putting the burden on the taxpayer .
The proposal does not foresee the possibility of citizens ' taking direct recourse to justice .
However , if there is not , it may be distorted and , moreover , the prevention system will be weak and I think we shall not see the beneficial impact on the economy that we hope for .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the ecosystem and the flow of matter and energy follow a predictable , quantifiable course to which human activity must be adapted .
I trust that the outcome of our vote will send a clear political message to the whole of Europe : that we are determined to lay down a substantial policy which will guarantee better environmental protection , in keeping with the economic and social objectives of the Union .
Our vote will not bring about immediate change .
Mr President , the objectives of the proposal for a directive are very ambitious and are designed to minimise environmental damage using both preventive means and means of apportioning the cost of restoring the damage .
However , it calls for the introduction of new concepts and innovative institutions which , however much we want them , are difficult to introduce at once .
Account must be taken of the fact that insurance companies need a certain amount of time to prepare .
The exercise of activities for which permits are granted and which are not considered harmful at the time they are exercised must not preclude the operator 's responsibility ; however , the fact that there is a permit or that the harmful consequences of the activity at issue were not recognised in time could function as a mitigating circumstance when apportioning the cost of restoring ecological damage to the operator , provided that the operator was in full compliance with the terms imposed under current legislation or the permit during the exercise of its activity .

The ship repair industry could , with another policy , have become an important sector of the economy rather than all but disappearing .
Those working in this sector are beginning to realise that they cannot wait for answers from the ?U , its policies and the international imperialist agreements being proposed , which is why they are joining forces and fighting for a different , anti-monopolistic , and anti-imperialist policy .
Before telling you about the results of the Council , allow me to make a preliminary comment .
I am convinced that Europe is the best way to promote ambitious policies in the public health sector in each of our countries , especially with regard to disease prevention and control .
As for the scientific , epidemiological side of the problem , according to the experts at the international organisations , we know in brief that a coronavirus which was unrecognised until its recent emergence is the cause of the syndrome .
There is no evidence that goods arriving in the European Union from SARS-infected areas pose a threat to public health .
At Community level , a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases is already operating and is responsible for coordinating measures .
These measures must be applied in all the Member States .
As far as future action is concerned , the Council decided that Community action and efforts being made via the communicable diseases surveillance network and the new programme in the public health sector should continue .
The Council also urged the Member States and the acceding countries to implement fully all the guidelines of the surveillance network , to contribute actively to setting up a specific expert group on severe acute respiratory syndrome under the Network Committee and to provide by 15 May all relevant information to the Commission on measures taken to address SARS .
Similarly , it supports the Commission 's intention to submit an initial draft proposal to create a European Centre for disease prevention and control .
What is important , as the Minister said , are the immediate measures that need to be taken to protect the public .
Thirty new infectious diseases or variations on old diseases due to mutating viruses have been reported over the last twenty years .
The Minister quite rightly stressed that there is the network set up under Decision 2119 in 1998 , for the surveillance of communicable diseases but unfortunately , Minister , this network is inadequate for an organised and coordinated response to these health threats .
