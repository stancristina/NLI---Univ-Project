We feel that that most important thing is for Europeans to be united , and that this should take precedence over all other political agendas .
( PT ) The problem of the border regions is doubtless one that will become apparent with the forthcoming enlargement .
( PT ) I wish to congratulate Mr Turco on the report he has presented , which makes a positive contribution to the debate on the importance of cohesion policy and of maintaining and strengthening this policy .
The consequences of this inaction are proving to be serious .
In this extremely sensitive area , which is so often overlooked and whose importance is so often underestimated - basically , a structured form of pedestrian protection - we endorse the drawing up of a framework-directive clearly establishing a timetable and procedures for an agreement negotiated with the automobile industry , specifically with regard to the monitoring assessments that are laid down .
( PT ) We welcome this Commission communication and the superb report by Mr Belder , which are both committed to formalising and developing a fundamental approach , launched at the Feira Summit and again affirmed at the Nice Summit , to the fight against all forms of exclusion , specifically those related to disability and old age .
Since such occurrences constitute a flagrant breach of fundamental rights , freedoms and guarantees , not least the right to demonstrate and the right of assembly , it must be clarified who was responsible for these actions and what were the reasons for them so that such practices are not repeated in future .
We must condemn these incidents and draw the necessary conclusions from them .
The territory of the European Union now constitutes a single area without frontiers as regards roads , and the forthcoming enlargement will mean increased tensions in the absence of minimum harmonisation .
It is equally important to have more precise information on the appropriations earmarked for international fisheries agreements , given the importance of those that were signed last year and the development of new international relations .
Mr President , your few months in the Presidency have been long enough to make a caricature of what was agreed under previous presidencies on immigration and asylum , education and women 's employment and sustainable development .
You have been obsessed with the desire to reduce your position to that of head of Europe 's police and all you have to show for your efforts is the sad link you have made between immigration and crime .
The proposal suggests further needs of EUR 150 million for the financial perspectives for the 2000-2006 period .
( PT ) This report commits three cardinal sins .
In accordance with the case law of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights , the concept of a reasonable period of time before the trial cannot be translated into an exact number of days , weeks , months or years , or into a variety of terms set according to the seriousness of the offence .
People travelling abroad should be confident that the existing standards offer equivalent protection whatever the Member State so as not to impede their free movement for fear of encountering a system operating lower standards .
The blame , the pain , the physical and mental violence that abortion entails are borne predominantly by women .
In Portugal , a referendum on decriminalising abortion , which was not binding because less than one-third of the population voted , was won by the 'no ' campaign .
As recently became clear in Portugal when 17 women were subjected to the shame of court proceedings , with the investigation of their private lives and with the accusation of having had an illegal abortion - which was not proved , except in one case - in which the young woman was unacceptably convicted , this is not the way to combat illegal abortion .
The report , however , confuses these issues with others that either correspond exactly to the opposite doctrine or which lead , as has been proved , to the opposite result .
This is what divides us , not the body of the person who chooses but the life of those who have no choice .
And it is our right to do so , provided that this is allowed by law and that this is what our citizens want .
It is widely known and quite clear that this report addresses issues that do not fall within the scope of the European Union 's competences , and interferes particularly in policies of health and justice .
Deepening the European spirit must involve respect for differences and for strengthening the principle that decisions must be taken at the closest possible level to the citizens of the Union .
I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report , to which I give my full support .
In my proposal for an amendment , I nevertheless called for us to go further , so as to follow up the heading I have just mentioned , because I think that in programmes concerning an outermost region , greater weight must be accorded to the criterion of Community added value .
Hence the importance of reducing or even eliminating the 1 % ceiling proposed by the Commission for labelling not to be required , bearing in mind that the proposed threshold will leave a considerable range of products that are processed and produced with GMOs without labelling .
.
Furthermore , the proposal for a Directive contains provisions which , through an excess of zeal , could open the way to fraud and deception , to the misleading of consumers and to the distortion of competition .
I wish to congratulate Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl on her excellent report , which I fully support .
We are bound to vote against this report given the assertions it makes , specifically reaffirming the 'overriding importance of the primary objective , that
