by thanking Mrs Ayala Sender for the commitment she has lavished on this work , which she has truly carried out with passion , tenacity and great objectivity .
I would remind you that more than 40 000 people die on Europe 's roads every year ; in 2007 the figure was 42 500 .
While the Commission and Parliament share the same views on the first pillar , many Member States are still talking about the need to regulate the issue under the third pillar .
We must look to the future , we must look to the Treaty of Lisbon .
This is a good thing , but in at least some cases further improvements are required .
It will not be easy , but I believe that together we will get there in the end .
For the sake of clarity , let me turn to the Council , to those representing the Council , the General Secretariat of the Council , and repeat what I said a few days ago at the Council of Transport Ministers : it is not the Commission 's intention to reduce Member States ' powers ; we are interested only in reducing the number of deaths on the roads in the European Union .
This directive is a fundamental opportunity for the future of the European Union , as it represents the way into the third Industrial Revolution and a chance to create millions of jobs , making environmental protection a reality and , at the same time , promoting economic growth and competitiveness .
What we need are decisions that will have a positive impact on our manufacturing sector and , above all , Europe must ready itself for the new , difficult challenges for competition that are appearing on the horizon .
I agree with the basic idea of creating a European framework for regulations on the organisation of working time .
There is not time to go into detail about the entire report the Council presented on human rights .
With the frankness that is called for in international relations , I believe that we must remind the Vatican State that the decriminalisation of homosexuality is important to us , it is a question of human rights , and that the challenge they are mounting should be decisively rejected . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have listened carefully to the Commissioner 's statement .
That is what we routinely do with all states that have diplomatic representation in the European Union .
Effective protection and promotion of fundamental rights ought to be the cornerstone of democracy in Europe .
To corroborate this statement , one only has to look at the conditions of displaced persons , national minorities , the Roma , stateless persons , refugees , asylum-seekers and economic migrants .
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , Mrs Gál , Mrs Roure , Mr Guardans and Mrs Ždanoka , for the active contributions they have made to the report and its composition .
We are talking about a culture of continuous quality improvement .
I should like to thank both Mr Andersson and Mr Mann for their reports . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that we should try to draw up a balance sheet of Frontex 's failures over the past three years .
A little while ago , I was in splendid isolation when I stated that it was necessary to change the mandate of Frontex , by placing the priority on rescue at sea , but tomorrow this may finally become the general view of this Parliament .
By violating trademark rights , patent rights and intellectual property rights , counterfeiting therefore represents an obstacle to the strong points of our industry , our capacity for innovation and our capacity for creativity .
This would be a major international agreement within a multilateral framework , which would not negate the validity of a bilateral framework between the United States , Japan and Europe , with room too for Brazil , India , China and the other major trading regions of the world .
These are issues which did not meet with agreement from the majority .
I therefore welcome Commissioner Barrot 's earlier announcement that the portal will be operational by the end of 2009 .
In fact we do agree with the vast majority of the text : integrating conflict analysis into cooperation , support for civil and local society , combating the proliferation of light arms , the need for a code of conduct for soldiers and the police , references to reproductive health , transparency in the use of natural resources and support for refugees .
Cooperation resources are too few to eliminate poverty , injustice and to build peace ; therefore the military cannot be included .
Written explanations of vote Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have voted in favour of the report by Mrs Iacob-Ridzi on the European Job Mobility Action Plan ( 2007-2010 ) .
Moreover , in times of conflict , very often hospitals and schools are subject to attacks by troops .
It is a costly model for everyone , a harmful model also , because of the impact it has on the greenhouse effect .
We did want the regulation to abandon the idea of three rigid zones , but the Council did not agree , and so it has been retained .
Can you reassure me , Commissioner , that the action plan is ready ?
Between cities , in standards of protection for the urban environment ?
If you want to try and defend the failure to keep this commitment , before you do so , ask yourself - are these genuine reasons and not banal excuses ?
