, those who are able to look deeply into and to analyse matters can see that , behind the errors highlighted , there are even graver issues , as the judicial experiences of several countries in recent years demonstrate .
However , together with these positive aspects , it is important to evaluate the problematic issues it contains too .
The European Commission has launched a European project , which to date has had less of an impact than Google Books is expected to have .
This is the work we have done , increasing the budget and improving local activities and EU-wide activities for the benefit of the associations .
Therefore , it requires due recognition and support from the European institutions , the Member States , local and regional authorities and various members of civil society , each according to their individual expertise .
The European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) will enable the activities organised in this field to take on a European dimension , and therefore the hope is that this will have a major impact on civil society .
We cannot think that we can solve the problems relating to minorities and to the death penalty in China without giving any thought to the Chinese Government .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I , together with Mr Sassoli and all the members of the Democratic Party within the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , would like to echo your words of solidarity towards the Italian Prime Minister , Silvio Berlusconi , and stress that this was an abominable , unacceptable and unjustifiable act .
What happened really could take us almost to the edge of the abyss , the precipice , and so the unanimous call that came from Parliament is the only one that can guide us at this difficult time .
I therefore ask you , ladies and gentlemen , that the situation in the Philippines replace the 'Azerbaijan' issue as the third item on Thursday .
These are symptomatic of a pressing and alarming situation and of widespread concern for the future of the sector as a whole .
We welcome the work undertaken by the mission and its contribution to the stabilisation of the region , to the functioning of the incident prevention and response mechanism and to the arduous process of rebuilding of trust between the parties .
I believe , however , that we should never forget that these actions must be carried out within a framework of simultaneous actions for other weak countries in Europe too .
I will start with a general remark : obviously nobody - let us look first at the substance of this ruling - could consider the removal of someone and something which was already there to be an act of democracy and freedom , as some have claimed , but rather an action of the thought police , an anti-democratic act .
This is something that runs counter to the true spirit of the European Union , and this is what is astonishing .
Well , I would like to say that it is precisely the ruling of the Strasbourg Court that is riding roughshod over the fundamental right to religious freedom , and which wants to prevent a people such as the Italians from keeping the symbol of the cross in classrooms as an indispensable reminder of their Christian roots .
The EU institutions are champions of the prerogatives of freedom .
Let us therefore leave it to the Member States to judge , on a case by case basis , the suitability of solutions in line with the sensitivities of their peoples , in keeping with their religious freedom and the secular nature of the institutions .
The Presidency has not been active in opposing illegal immigration even with regard to integration projects and dealing with the problem of refugees .
Since this type of crime can operate too freely , it has taken advantage of our freedoms , moving as it pleases between financial marketplaces , tax havens and markets dealing in property and other assets .
Should it really be us , the slaves of a bureaucracy elected by nobody , teaching the Swiss people about democracy ?
Should we be the ones to deny them the right to hold a referendum on an important question , on which everyone is entitled to their own opinion ?
The new military strategy announced by President Obama , and even more clearly set out in the subsequent statement made by the foreign ministers of ISAF countries , has linked the sending of new troops to the primary aim of protecting the population and strengthening the capabilities of the security forces and the Afghan institutions .
From this point of view , the action plan constitutes an important step forward , and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports it and demands its firm implementation .
The European Union is therefore faced with the choice of encouraging reform through dialogue within the Eastern Partnership and within Euronest and , at the same time , maintaining a policy of vigilance over the results achieved and steps taken .
The allocation of EUR 300 million to overcome the crisis in the milk sector is also very effective .
I feel that it is also contradictory that in the same session , two resolutions are being put to the vote , one on Belarus and the other on Azerbaijan , both very different in tone , when these two countries are part of the same Eastern Partnership .
In situations like this , with the large-scale destruction of buildings and infrastructure and with thousands of deaths , it is almost impossible to deliver aid effectively without having minimum conditions of public order and security
