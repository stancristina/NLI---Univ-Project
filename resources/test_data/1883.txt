in which the human rights situation has developed in Malaysia , particularly since the events of 11 September .
It is therefore obvious - and I hope , by saying this , to reassure Mr Sacr√©deus - that we are not giving up the battle for the abolition of the death penalty in dictatorships .
The statute of the International Criminal Court is based on the principle of complementarity , which does not therefore apply to American troops .
In my view , this legislation is valid from all viewpoints .
Lastly , I agree with Mrs Peijs that some amendments distort the text and that we must not therefore venture down that path .
The Commission Green Paper on the security of energy supply recommends that substitute fuels should represent 20 % of our total consumption by 2020 .
Member States may apply an additional reduction to bio- or agrofuels used by certain hauliers , including local public transport suppliers .
The quality of biofuel production will primarily be determined by the way in which agriculture will be managed and this is what we must bear in mind , above all else , in dealing with this subject .
Dear Luckas , we shall miss you and we shall miss your work to promote the circulation of films in Europe .
I believe that the Commission is open to the idea of creating an international instrument that works in parallel with the WTO and is dedicated to cultural issues .
This date simply means that , until then , the criteria that the Commission presented will not change and that , were they to change at a later date , then this would be due to new information that had come to light showing that such and such a problem had occurred .
As for the idea , Mrs Fraisse - and I will finish with this point - of an international instrument establishing the principles of cultural diversity and the associates objectives relating to international agreements , to be honest , this idea has been up in the air for some time now .
Our aim is very clear therefore : to allow Community financial support to fulfil its role as a catalyst , including in the project development phase , and to make investments in cross-border transport and energy infrastructures more attractive to private funding .
As far as Amendment No 13 is concerned , as with Amendment No 8 , the Commission is able to accept the part which seeks to promote safety , but not the rest of the amendment .
It is not acceptable to choose one or two working languages because Parliament is not an international organisation .
Bravo , Mr Aznar , well done !
I , in turn , can only tell this House that I welcome the progress made in all these areas , and congratulate you on it , Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
My second point concerns growth and competitiveness with a view to full employment .
In Spain and elsewhere , terrorism thrives when politics turns a blind eye .
This sort of harmonisation requires more social measures and greater consideration to be given to the environment .
It seems absurd to discuss the use of biofuels without discussing the control of all energy resources , from oil to white energy , and nuclear energy as well .
But this is not the aim of the report , which advocates financing research and development into e-cinema , fitting cinemas with expensive equipment , recommending that we let the market take care of the rest .
For the time being , what we are seeing is not investor enthusiasm for the euro , but rather investors adopting a cooler approach to the dollar , related to the bursting of the technological bubble , financial scandals and , above all , we must not forget , the significant difference in interest rates which does not work in favour of the US currency .
During the financial crisis in Asia , many commentators condemned 'crony capitalism' , capitalism marked by the complicity within these countries .
Are you going to make use of this power conferred by the Treaty ?
On the other hand , we must ensure that food and feed does not present any risk to human health , animal welfare or the environment and that the use of genetically modified organisms does not present these types of risks .
What will we do if both reports deviate from a common guideline ?
Scientists are now telling us that they can detect food containing 0.01 % of GMOs .
At this stage , therefore , we cannot give any more statistics .
This difference can be compared to a safety net , created by the American protectionist measures , which leads to a more comfortable situation for American manufacturers in terms of their prices , profitability and finances .
The question is concerned with intellectual property rights and access to medicines .
In fact , we believe that adding a provision to this agreement on intellectual property would provide a clear , legally reliable and permanent solution that would not disrupt the current regulatory framework , i .e . that of Article 31 .
On the contrary , I believe that it is precisely by making use of Article 30 that we would multiply the imperatives involved , which would make access to the medicines more difficult .
First of all there are the products themselves , then there are the sites , their structure and their geographical location , and finally there are the people , and that means all the employees themselves and also the people living or working close to industrial sites .
That is why our group tabled an amendment along these lines .
