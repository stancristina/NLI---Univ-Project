It is clear that if sheep-rearing is to continue in Finland urgent special measures are needed .
Normal support for production is unfair in northern regions because the harvest level is always lower there .
Mr President , I therefore look to the Agriculture Committee to treat the Member States logically , since there are particularly serious difficulties affecting their agriculture , as has now happened in Ireland and similarly also in Finland .
In spring 1994 the European Parliament ratified the accession treaty between the European Union and the Finnish Republic .
I look to the Agriculture Committee to support the Finnish smallholders as energetically as it is now supporting the Irish sheep rearers .
The Treaty specifies in particular that the Community should seek to eliminate differences in the level of development of different regions .
The proportion of national regional policy accounted for by EU programmes of Community initiatives could be further increased , for example by linking the implementation of the Interreg 2 programme and local cooperation and by improving the exploitation of other programmes in urban and rural policy .
It would be perfectly possible to improve the interaction between the various programmes , for example within the framework of the Urban and Leader programmes .
In practice this means that the EU 's Baltic policy should support regions ' spontaneous interaction .
I believe that the proposal put forward in the Committee of the Regions that the Commission should draw up a separate programme of principles and activities for the Union 's northern regions deserves every support .
Although enlargement is of course the Union 's response to the new challenges facing Europe , it is quite possible that the EU 's regional and agricultural policies will have to be reformed before enlargement .
Mr President , Commissioner : unemployment is the biggest problem throughout the EU.
In nearly every Member State unemployment and particularly the growth of long-term unemployment has assumed unacceptable proportions .
The appropriations for the Structural Funds represent about a third of the final annual budget .
It is important to analyse past structural policy programmes , but - as has already been pointed out here - it is equally important that we should be able to learn from them and create new and better programmes .
Projects carried out with European funding should not only promote employment but , above all , assist social progress and promote development .
Madam President , the gradual elimination of the mass unemployment which exists in the EU Member States calls for a great many different measures .
It is important to promote innovative ideas such as , precisely , employment agreements among the various parties at local level .
The parties to the agreement are the town authorities , the employment exchange and the labour district .
The means of preventing exclusion is to offer permanent or temporary work , vocational training and/or apprenticeships , traineeships and specialized training as an employment measure .
The vertical organization of society and the sectorization of public administration have also impeded the development of local employment initiatives .
Partnership particularly requires horizontal cooperation , cutting across administrative fields .
The Commission 's new measures to support local employment initiatives are welcome , and I hope that all towns will receive assistance from them soon .
Given that we are fighting massive unemployment in my country , we study with interest all ideas which can improve employment .
Our country does not have a long tradition of small enterprise and private service provision .
Privatization does not create new jobs : on the contrary .
It is true that private services are needed as a supplement to public ones .
When trying to identify such measures , frequent reference has been made to cooperation among the various parties , and this should be secured locally , including by means of the famous tripartite model .
Part of unemployment benefit should be used for this purpose .
We could find ways of working close to the unemployed .
Madam President , I should like to thank our colleague Mr Herman for his very broad approach , which has paved the way for what I consider to be the first genuinely broad debate on the information society in this House .
Clearly , this topic concerns a development which is nothing short of a global revolution .
I myself am among those who wish to stress the fact that these opportunities which are provided by the information society require clear political guidance .
I myself wish to stress education , to which attention is laudably devoted in this report .
I should like to hear what members of the Commission think about this .
In Finland we used to have a tax on data transmission , but we abandoned it very quickly because in reality it was hampering the development of the information society .
It was levied from users of data communications , not from producers .
Mr President , Friday this week - 20 September 1996 - will be the 90th anniversary of the day when Tsar Nicholas II signed the declaration guaranteeing Finns - both men and women - general and equal suffrage .
This was a step towards greater equality in the Nordic countries and Finland .
Is it not high time to implement these proposals ?
The EU should now lead the way and eliminate such practices .
The point of departure of the proposals for a directive of 1987 is the individualization of social security .
A social security system based on the individual is the only humane option and the only one which promotes equality .
Social security systems based on the family detract from the status , freedom and human dignity of the lower earning spouse , irrespective of the sex of the partner in question .
Many Member States ought to review their social legislation with a
