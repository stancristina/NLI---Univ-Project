, the Commission has duly presented three proposals which are currently being discussed in the Working Group on Social Issues .
Furthermore , the fight against discrimination on the grounds of disability is covered by the first proposal for a directive , which seeks to implement the principle of equal treatment in the field of employment and in carrying out professional activities .
Regardless of your real reason for asking a question of this nature , we must recognise that , in recent years , and particularly since the Treaty of Amsterdam , very specific measures have been adopted in the European Union to ensure that these issues are addressed in a far more appropriate way , taking into consideration the interests of the various parts of society that are affected .
Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , I cannot add much more to what I have already said .
More recently , at its meeting in April , the Council adopted three additional sanctions against the Burmese regime .
The Council has furthermore decided to ask the Commission to study the possibilities of increasing humanitarian aid for Burma-Myanmar , with the aim of directly helping the people , and in particular of distinguishing development aid from direct aid to the people , in particular through non-governmental organisations .
It is obvious , however , that EU action in such a far-off place cannot always have an immediate impact on changing the political conditions that mark the current regime , specifically human rights violations and the lack of respect for these countries ' most basic democratic rights .
By that I mean that Euro 11 is an informal setting , and Ecofin is the formal setting .
This coordination does not , of course , mean that there is any transfer of power to the specific framework in which these discussions are held .
I must say one more very simple thing , Mrs Sandbæk .
This is a positive step .
- ( PT ) The Pomés Ruiz report rigorously defends the principles of the Solidarity Pact , particularly as regards fiscal consolidation as a means of ensuring the sole objective of price stability .
Goebbels report ( A5-0135/2000 )
This was the reasoning behind our amendment , which was unfortunately rejected .
As regards the workforce , thousands of jobs have been cut , stricter working conditions have been introduced , and in many cases workers are poorly paid and have few rights .
This being the case , how can the Heads of Government of the 15 Member States of the European Union pledge to achieve a new strategic objective for the next decade , that is to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge­based economy in the world , capable of sustainable economic growth , with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion , unless they significantly change their research policy , and particularly the budgets earmarked for this ?
We also think that the 2000 review process should in no way lead to a renegotiation of the commitments entered into in Beijing .
On behalf of my colleague Mogens Camre , I wish to categorically repudiate this categorisation and in particular the misleading nature of the text , given that the report refers to a leader of a neo-Nazi party in Denmark , which has nothing to do with the Danish People ' s Party .
I wish to emphasise that the leaders of the Danish People ' s Party were involved in the resistance against the Nazi invasion , which cannot unfortunately be said about certain former leaders of other political groupings in Denmark .
However , in key areas , the amendments that we are debating could potentially wreck everything .
Secondly , there is the issue of nationality .
But it is important not to confuse separate issues .
We wish to make it clear that freedom of religious organisation is a fundamental civil right , which cannot be undermined , curbed or jeopardised , which would be the effect of some of the amendments before us .
I take the opportunity of paying my respects to my predecessor , Mrs Gradin , who was the author of that communication .
I noted that the resolution that you are going to vote on tomorrow and the report that we are discussing today contain a large number of requests to the Commission .
Therefore , we do not need to wait for any change in the Treaties : we have a clear legal basis to address this issue of making trafficking in women a criminal offence .
This was one of the Commission ' s suggestions in its second communication .
Talking about significant developments in the field of trafficking in women at European level , we also need to take a look at the various activities that are , and have been , supported by the STOP programme .
We also intend to offer the possibility of running multiannual projects which will improve the efficiency of the programmes .
We share with these candidate countries a serious common problem , since there is a clear trend involving the Central and Eastern European countries as the most important region of origin of both victims of trafficking and perpetrators .
Last but not least , I wish to clearly underline the importance of the Union being involved in wider forms of international cooperation .
Honourable Members have an opportunity of adapting what I consider a piece of good work that not only confirms a coherent and multidisciplinary European policy on trafficking but also adds new impetus for further actions which are undoubtedly necessary at European level .
I recognise that this initiative has drawn the attention of the Council to the necessity of drafting a coherent and consistent approach to immigration policy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the first warning call about the reduction in the ozone layer was sounded in 1970
