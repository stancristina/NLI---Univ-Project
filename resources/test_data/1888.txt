in the Commission are fundamentally persuaded that , while prices must reflect the market , the adjustment of market prices , among other things , in Ukraine must happen gradually rather than overnight , and that no pressure must be brought to bear .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what we are discussing today is something that has to do with our future , and it is the Lisbon Agenda that clearly defines what that future is to be .
The directive to be revised – 82/714/EEC – also has other defects , among them the fact that it does not apply to passenger ships and floating plant such as construction vessels , and the safety requirements are , of course , as they were in the 1970s .
A happy outcome is worth waiting for , and our group , the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , thanks Mrs Sommer , the rapporteur , for the valuable work she has done .
The laying down of safety standards – ranging from construction to the rules on the transport of hazardous goods , by way of regulations on instruments – takes up nearly 500 pages .
Nor must we try to interfere in collective agreements between unions and employers , which are subject to labour law ; such collective agreements cannot be the subject of action on the part of the state , not even action by the European Union .
I believe it to be a simple fact that there is a difference between the living circumstances of pilots of passenger aircraft and those of freight aircraft .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for its willingness to withdraw the first proposal and to take account in its second one of what was said in the debate in this House , as a consequence of which we have met each other halfway .
It is not Russia that is responsible for our nuclear waste , but rather our own countries themselves .     – Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the world is going crazy about football , but Europe has already won .
Our group proposes that work on preparing the substance of this statement and the organisational aspects of it should begin under the Finnish Presidency , and we propose that a working group be set up to deal with the preparations at the political level .
One problem to which both you and the President of the Commission alluded is the issue of Turkey .
We say ‘yes ’ to strengthening the Common Foreign and Security Policy , including raising the profile of security policy .
For this reason , I would also ask the President of the Commission to clarify his comment on the preconditions for enlargement , which may be technically correct but , politically , has caused confusion .
My second point is that the Finnish Presidency , in cooperation with the Commission , must make at least the first attempts to achieve a new balance between enlargement and the European Union’s capacity to cope with this .
On the other hand , however , there have been occurrences that further detract from the credibility of President Abbas , and so it is increasingly difficult for us to find points of contact .
In any case , we must also ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the protection of personal data .     .
We also find ourselves facing the question that the governments in the EU must answer , namely that as to precisely what a secret service – which is what the CIA is , albeit one from a friendly state – is permitted to do on our soil , and in what manner it may act .
The Chicago Convention allows private flights throughout European airspace without the need for further permission ; the CIA exploited this by deliberately declaring its flights to be private , while many states – among them Member States of the European Union – acted on the basis of the Chicago Convention in letting the CIA do whatever they wanted .
It is unfortunate that its interim report , which we now have before us , is as yet neither even-handed nor complete .
One cannot avoid the conclusion that what it has come up with is quite negligible , and rightly too , for that only goes to show either that no offences were committed , or that those that were were isolated occurrences .
The elucidation of the circumstances under which , in various European states , suspects were alleged to have been seized and their rendition organised , is still patchy , and that may well be because there is in fact less to bring to light than some particularly zealous persons who are critical of America or hostile to it had hoped .
There is something else I would like to ask .
How are businesses supposed to move in if local workers cannot travel to the company headquarters – in France or England , say – except subject to very difficult conditions ?
Experience of such things is out of the reach of most people in South-Eastern Europe or involves considerable obstacles , and that is where there must be changes ; on that point I am in full agreement with my fellow Members .
For example , the committees – and here I am talking about my own – received the first consultative draft from the Commission as late as just before the summer break ; after the summer break , the eight-week deadline had expired , and we were then told that our decision was expected in three months ’ time .
