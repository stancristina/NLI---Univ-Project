on the way to achieving the European national market , one market characterized by common external borders and open internal borders .
Above all , I believe it is necessary to achieve a better balance between the taxation of labour and the tax burden on capital , energy and consumption .
Another basic requirement for a national market is a common currency but that is outside the scope of this report .
Having a particularly wide scope , this directive covers every product that can be distributed and marketed for permanent incorporation in building works for structural and civil engineering projects .
Now three levels are required , as mentioned in the report .
Mr Commissioner , I only wanted to repeat the question : is a reorganization of the standards system in Europe being considered ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I can only agree with the rapporteur .
They must have got communications and commerce mixed up .
Despite this , it would be possible to make an exception for the Ukraine on financial grounds , but as a tranche of ECU 100 million was to be made available , we do not believe that it was not capable of rejection on financial grounds alone .
Then she proposes a multilingual glossary of various legal terms .
In my view we need a courageous decision which says that , if we detect that there are criminal areas that cannot be controlled at national level , either by police or penal measures , then these tasks must be delegated to the European Union within the competency of a Commissioner with the legislative authority of the European Parliament .
For that reason the main emphasis now being placed on integration of training and qualifications is one of the most important steps taken in recent years .
As elected representatives of the people we are responsible for seeing that all possible measures are taken , because our citizens do not like criminals to be enjoying freedom of action , when Europe 's freedoms do not lead to more security for the citizen himself .
Democracy and basic rights are fundamental and are not available for disposal , not even in the fight against crime .
Here we are talking about organized crime , and the difference must be noted .
No one is concerned about where these machines go .
The proposed joint action for construction of a European judicial network points to this and we support it .
Foreign legislation is opposed because it is foreign and not one 's own .
Taken together with Amsterdam , we will have a substantial increase in legislation .
Development work on the next stage of Europol must not then be delayed .
It is exceptionally unfortunate that according to the Amsterdam Treaty on this subject of cooperation within the civil law the Intergovernmental Conference only allows Parliament a joint right of decision where visa policy is concerned , and then only in five years time .
Or that is how I interpret it .
That is an asylum policy which we will not support .
Firstly , is it your opinion , Mr Commissioner , that the necessary unified European position in this crisis could have been established quickly enough ?
I do not want to repair errors in the inadequate American strategy , but my question to you , Mr Commissioner , is this : does the Commission have a strategic plan concerning Iraq which might prevent the constant repetition of such crises ?
Naturally he is right in saying that one or the other problem will arise .
Our business rules for cooperation with Togo are in article 5 of the Lom√© Convention .
The Slovak Parliament has resolved largely to reject these measures or so to rephrase them , that we have the impression that a real battle for press freedom in Slovakia has been won here .
I am very pleased that the matter has taken this turn .
In most cases those will be settlers who arrive later .
Major effort and the will to find a common solution are necessary in order to fulfill the ambitious aims of the Treaty of Amsterdam , which provides in the medium term for the so-called communalization of the subjects involved .
I would expressly ask Member States to use this opportunity .
It also bears great international responsibility for refugees ' rights .
I have had an opportunity of observing the Italian External Border Security Service , which is very keen and highly qualified .
This is why Mrs Zimmermann 's point , about harmonization being unavoidable as a sort of follow-up to training , is one of the central messages that Parliament must communicate in this declaration .
And so I believe that Odysseus could be a first step in the right direction , and I should like to join in the proposal by Mr Schulz that we must come to the next phase of European , Community measures .
Subsidies of 70 % or even 90 % must remain the exception , or we shall be unable to increase the funds substantially .
It has happened .
Since the agreement came into being , about 100 specific provisions have been adopted , encompassing all items of equipment and parts used in motor vehicles .
We are giving our assent to an agreement which is necessary and worthwhile for Europe .
In fact , what it is all about is the development of an industry which is of great significance for the future and constitutes in its variety and diversity what distinguishes the European Union from the other large blocks that exist in the world : its diversity , its variety and its creativity .
Madam President , first allow me to say a few words to Mr Ripa di Meana who has told us that he takes a very environmentally-sound position in response to this type of question .
