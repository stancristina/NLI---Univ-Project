This should naturally lead to a better budget process and to simplification .
This applies to statements on the importance of ensuring that the budget is followed , as well as to decisions of the European Parliament or budgetary authority .
Naturally , it is worrying when , year after year , the budget produces large surpluses which have to be paid back to the Member States because important work is not carried out .
This surplus arose primarily because the Structural Funds did not manage to implement their programmes .
We are attempting to bring the committees on board in a quite different way than before , for example by means of hearings involving Commissioners and through each committee 's checking its part of the budget and seeing how it is implemented .
In the Committee on Budgets we had a great many amendments , 129 to be precise .
Here in the plenary sitting , the number has been considerably reduced , and the reason for this is of course that we have been able to compromise on a consensus approach towards the most important priorities .
Enlargement itself creates no problems for the 2003 budget , but we are still affected in various ways .
We must also set in motion a debate on the principles of how we are to prepare for accession .
We are therefore attempting to put pressure on the Secretaries-General of our institutions so that they really come up with practical proposals for co-operation and savings .
Great emphasis will also be placed on the Union 's role in terms of foreign policy and aid policy .
I would also like to mention a couple of different areas where we are adopting a very aggressive approach .
To conclude , I would like to thank my co-rapporteur , Mr Stenmarck .
I hope we are able to take these words to heart .
The first is enlargement .
We must respect these limits and manage the EU 's budget within them .
This is also the most important message I have the opportunity to convey at all my meetings and in all my contacts with the various institutions of the EU.
We had an informal trialogue in Madrid just under a week ago .
There is no doubt that , at least in terms of putting it into words , there is a broad understanding of the size of the problem in both the Commission and the Council .
For all of us who do not work within an anonymous Commission but instead have to meet our voters on a daily basis , it would in actual fact be impossible to look these voters in the eye and , at the same time , explain that the EU needs more money to employ more bureaucrats in Brussels .
When it comes to enlargement , a number of issues are particularly important .
If I , as a Swede , have the right to speak Swedish and a Portuguese Member has the right to speak Portuguese , then a Hungarian Member must be allowed to speak Hungarian and a Lithuanian to speak Lithuanian .
All of this is particularly difficult as we are unaware of what the scope of enlargement will be .
This means we might only have just under a year .
Mr President , it has taken a long time to bring this report before the plenary sitting as religion and sexuality are without doubt two very sensitive issues to address , even in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities .
I cannot help but mention last week 's scandal , one of many scandals over the years .
In this case , I am thinking of the current cases in Nigeria , where women are sentenced to be stoned to death for having sexual relations outside marriage .
In a few weeks or at least in a month or two , we should be able to decide on the next step .
We must have control of where these substances occur .
This question has been brought up on several occasions and has been discussed in the Environment Council .
My question concerns what the plans look like for the years ahead .
Biodiversity is a central issue in terms of sustainable development and the integration of environmental considerations into other policy areas .
I have sad news tonight .
Both the EU 's strategy for sustainable development and the seventh Environment Action Programme state that one of their central goals is that of halting the decline in biodiversity by 2010 .
If we really want to stop this loss of biodiversity , we have to look at the entire territory of the EU and not just the protected areas .
The action plan for the conservation of natural resources clearly shows our firm intention to fully implement the birds directive and the habitats directive and to support the work on Natura 2000 .
The action plan covers all of our countryside , including the Natura 2000 areas .
We have a responsibility for helping developing countries so that the natural resources which are crucial to their well-being can be protected .
These plans will primarily contribute to the discussion of the reform of the common fisheries policy , common agriculture policy and the regulations on the Structural Funds .
I hope that these reforms will have the scope and provide the controls that are required if we are to completely meet the goals of the biodiversity action plans .
There is no major public health problem from people overdosing on vitamins and minerals .
This is clearly stated by the Treaties .
In my view , sometimes other considerations must be more important than a free market .
We have witnessed a furious and quite unpleasant lobbying campaign .
On the whole , there are ,
