I shall briefly mention the other four priority axes .
With regard to the financing of SMEs , I would remind you that we finance small and medium-sized enterprises in two ways : on the one hand , through global loans , as half of our global loans go to small enterprises , and , on the other , through the provision of risk capital from the European Investment Fund .
We are entirely open to the idea , and even keen to be subject to a form of banking supervision .
The report therefore emphasises the need to strengthen international cooperation in the field of competition .
In this context , the opportunity for recourse to state aid in order to achieve these horizontal objectives should be reiterated .
Mr President , I would like to thank all my colleagues who have supported me and in particular those who share the view of this report , which I believe to be balanced and concerned with real situations .
If the private sector will not fund the modernisation of the steel industry in Poland and the Czech Republic , in a global context of excess capacity , should we nevertheless ask those countries to give up developing that sector ?
Experts already believe that its potential for growth in terms of production and productivity has slowed down , while we wish to speed it up .
An example of this is when it analyses market shares country by country and product by product , while taking advantage of the frivolity or even absence of the French authorities when it comes to safeguarding French industrial interests .
We withdraw the first part of the amendment , which deleted three words , therefore we retain the terms in the report 'financing the economy ' .
In my region and in several departments in the South of France , violent storms and torrential floods hit around 400 municipalities on 8 and 9 September , causing the deaths of 24 people and causing very considerable damage .
The Commission is proposing to make the regulations on additives in animal feed more coherent , and we approve of that approach .
Now , the salary of a temporary worker would have to be assessed according to the scale of salaries in the temporary employment agency .
Also , this field is the sovereign responsibility of the Member States , which are undoubtedly in a better position to assess the situation of their labour market .
We could have voted in favour of this joint resolution , as it contains a number of sound recitals regarding General Musharraf 's military regime in Pakistan .
This is because it is the means to provide the material basis for the progress of humanity and the intellectual basis for its emancipation from all types of prejudices , starting with the obscurantism that is used by religions and various reactionary ideologies , some of which are very fashionable at present , and which periodically bring back the kind of society in which men are not in control of their destiny but are crushed by an unjust , harmful and abhorrent social structure .
The effects of constant announcements regarding the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets that are not followed up with genuine results are a considerable handicap to European credibility with citizens .
We hope that this case law will be confirmed .
I am therefore speaking on my own behalf but also on behalf of other Members and , Mr President , I would like our written statements , which were issued within the required time , to be annexed to the debate .
I think that this decision , the quite reasonable position of the European Parliament , should be used to help discussions on matters that will arise in the future or that we know are already being considered by the Council .
However , Commissioner , you are right in saying that the European Union has done a great deal , that it has done its duty in a quite remarkable timescale in terms of legislation .
That is enough !
It thus leaves the way open to certain maritime transport mafias that operate in an area without law ...And everything is perhaps done for that .
Mr President , I have a request to put to the Presidency .
First of all , with regard to the timetable , I would like to say one very simple thing : the Commission , the Council and Parliament must come to an agreement together .
How about that ?
Mr President , the Copenhagen European Council which is being held next week will have one major , important task : to conclude accession negotiations with ten candidate countries .
It is in Europe 's own interests to put things right as soon as possible .
Let us be honest therefore .
Mr President , the provisions which will be put to the vote on Thursday will form the principal CFP regulation for the next ten years and will represent the arrangements for fishing subsidies and the creation of an emergency fund designed to resolve the problem of overcapacity of the Union 's fleets .
These are some proposals , therefore , that we can make to encourage small-scale fishing .
Fine .
Madam President , no coordination , no procedure can be effective if there is a lack of political will .
First of all , the Treaties provide no solid basis for communitarisation of the economic policy .
The report by Mrs SÃ¶rensen , whom I would like to thank in particular , makes reference to the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
That , however , is a biased approach .
If I may say so , I think that your proposal sounds rather like a swan song of federal institutions that are on their knees and devoid of inspiration at the dawn of the
