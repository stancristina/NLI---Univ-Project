twenty-first century .
Mr President , I thank you for calling our fellow Members to order .
By voting against this report , we are therefore reaffirming our rejection of your capitalist system .
An approach based on sustainable development should not only seek to preserve fish stocks , but should also seek to ensure , if possible , the survival of the fishing industry .
In other words , a genuine fisheries policy is not just about adopting rules on fish stocks .
Having said that , we did not vote in favour of everything , because for us there are two principles which should prevail here but which have not been set out in any resolution .
Organised crime very quickly achieved the huge profits that could be made from taking advantage of the distress of would-be immigrants .
He launched into an extravagant eulogy on immigration , in which he declared , among other things , that complete integration is a major objective of an open society , while showing absolute respect for all cultures , so as to achieve non-conflict societies .
We made a fully informed choice to use animals to further the progress of science and to create modern medicine , which has invented antibiotics and vaccines .
Mr President , my comments relate to CÃ´te d'Ivoire .
There is , therefore , a justifiable complexity and we shall never have a wholly simple system .
We therefore propose to arrange this into three main blocs : the constitutional bloc , which will be divided into - I think that this is the opinion of the Convention as well - two parts : Part A , which includes everything that is strictly constitutional , namely the values , principles , objectives , institutions and procedures which enable the Union to operate , and then Part B , which will include the main political principles currently contained in the Treaty .
These , therefore , are the main points .
More broadly speaking , the report uses simplification as a pretext for making proposals in favour of supranational unification .
I believe that when Europeans try to explain to Europeans what the European Parliament does , it is best to use simple words .
On the one hand , I would like to say to Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Kaufmann that they must not misunderstand this report : Article 308 , as referred to in this report , would result in decisions being made by codecision and qualified majority ; we would therefore leave behind Council unanimity in favour of codecision , just as we have for own resources .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as it happens that I am the last to speak , by the same token I shall be the last to compliment Mr Bourlanges on his report , but I am not alone in doing so .
The time has come to call a spade , a spade , as you say yourself , and therefore to talk about European laws .
This point is currently the subject - although some of the details may be different - of a reasoned discussion within the context of the preparation of the draft interinstitutional agreement on improving legislation , and my colleague , Mrs de Palacio , will discuss it here tomorrow .
On the other hand , since ionisation has proved to be extremely useful for destroying micro-organisms or insects present in certain types of foods , I believe it is reasonable not to close the door to this kind of treatment .
This is , in particular , the case as regards relationships with national agencies in managing the decentralised parts of the programmes , or its intention to make progress , as soon as possible , in the direction indicated by the Court , in other words dismantling the temporary Technical Assistance Office as soon as the Commission is able to use an implementing agency for the educational programme .
This was very much the aim of our work : understand what happened , analyse events from every angle - economic , social and psychological - in order to learn lessons from this and minimise the risks and the effects of this type of disease in the future .
Vigilance within Europe 's borders is essential , but we must also increase our controls on imports , both at land borders and at ports and airports .
With emergency vaccination , a pen will be set up near the source of the epidemic where the animals will be vaccinated , animals which could then potentially be destroyed and used for consumption without the pressure of an emergency situation .
Mr President , I am very glad to say that the health crisis is behind us , but its side effects are unresolved .
Unless , of course , foot and mouth disease was merely a pretext for getting rid of surplus meat and avoiding storage costs .
We condemn this absolutely stupid and inhumane 'streamlining ' , which will mean some of the existing businesses will close , that their workers will be made redundant and unemployment will get worse , and the only purpose of this streamlining is so that surviving factories make a profit for their owners .
We think otherwise , however .
In fact , we get the feeling that this is less a report than the framework for a Bourlanges Constitution .
The foot and mouth epidemic that affected Europe in 2001 was a great disaster , and not only for the United Kingdom , where mass slaughter of livestock was necessary .
Today , this meat that could carry a risk of foot and mouth disease can be taken to these warehouses within the Union itself .
The only point of contention , which I shall mention briefly , is the matter of medical examination prior to donation , which has already been raised .
