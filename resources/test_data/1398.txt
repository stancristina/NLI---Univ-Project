We cannot support the general attempt to increase the Budget expenditure to the levels proposed by the Commission .
Furthermore , a new budget item of EUR 10 million is being established for vaccinations against children’s diseases etc .
( 3 ) Savings should be made in a number of areas .
( 5 ) Last but not least , a reduction in the EU’s Budget ceiling must not be the result of enlargement and of new initiatives within the foreign policy area , for example in Afghanistan and Iraq , or of work on global environmental issues , the HIV epidemic etc .     We do not believe that the EU should grant economic resources to Bosnia and Herzegovina to ease the transition to market economies .
Our view is that the EU should have limited competence and that this is not an issue for the EU.
Our view is that the EU should have limited competence and that this is not an issue for the EU.
We have voted against Amendment No 1 for two reasons .
Iran leads the international rogues ’ gallery when it comes to executions .
Execution is completely unacceptable and contravenes all the international conventions .
The so-called human rights dialogue that we have been conducting with Iran for quite a few years has failed , and we must recognise the fact .
We owe the Iranian people a strong EU commitment in Iran to democracy and human rights .
Since then , the world has changed .
The country leads the world in terms of executions ; human rights are infringed every day ; freedom of expression is severely restricted , and all opposition is in principle banned .
We cannot betray all the thousands , indeed hundreds of thousands , of democracy activists , political prisoners and young people who secretly surf the Net to find out what is really happening .
No, we must be consistent .
It is especially important for us to enter into discussions with the big developing countries , such as India and China , about the fact that they too must make binding commitments to reduce their emissions in the future , emissions that are now increasing extremely quickly .
If this is to be possible , I think that it is important to talk in terms of the fair and sustainable use of resources in the long term and that the only fair long-term distribution of the right to release emissions is one that is calculated for each of the world’s citizens .
We do not have time to wait for the Americans , but we know that the day will come when , for both economic and ecological reasons , they will be forced to commit themselves to this work .
I am certain that there are opponents both outside and , sometimes perhaps , also within the European Commission , but I am convinced that you have done this work as well as it was humanly possible to , and for that you deserve sincere thanks .     We are now already seeing the effects .
We are stealing oil supplies not only from future generations , but also from the world’s poor .
Exactly two years ago , we awarded the Cuban democracy activist , Oswaldo Payá our Sakharov Prize .
It was not easy getting Oswaldo Payá here .
About eighty democracy activists have been arrested and sentenced , following farcical trials , to very long prison sentences .
Many of them are ill .
That is why they had to be silenced .
No progress has been made since the Council toughened its so-called common position .
Several Members of the European Parliament , including Swedish MEPs , have been denied entry to the country .
For once , the EU has a consistent position on a dictatorship .
Why , then , should we change it ?
We honoured Oswaldo Payá and the other Cuban democracy activists here in this House , and that was a long-term commitment .
The June List supports the idea of cofinancing surveillance of the external borders , especially when enlargement eastwards has meant that financially weak Member States are hit by high costs for such surveillance .
We are thus voting against the proposal .     There are reasons for questioning the setting up of new EU bodies for supporting regional economic development .
There must therefore be an overall solution bringing about peaceful and stable development in Cyprus before the EU contributes funds , through the European Agency for Reconstruction , to support Turkish-Cypriot population groups .
We believe it is an issue for each of the national parliaments , such as Sweden’s , to decide upon .
We also believe that the issue of a special tax on the arms trade ( paragraph 40 ) does not belong in this report .
That the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports should be binding and that the Council and the Member States are being urged to maintain the arms embargo against China are important signals in the report .
Moreover , a tax on arms exports should be seen in the context of other possible global taxes .
We do wish , as the committee proposes , to regret this military operation’s being financed from outside the EU’s normal Budget ( paragraph 2 ) .
The resolution should emphasise that the premature phasing out of the safe nuclear power that quite a few Member States go in for indisputably leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions .
In our view , the individual Member States should determine independently their respective national positions prior to this conference .
Over and above this basic position , we question paragraph five of the resolution , to the effect that the European Parliament should call on those countries that have still not ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so .
We believe that Member States must each be allowed to decide their national
