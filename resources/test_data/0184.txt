to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
The regulation before us establishes rules to protect and to provide assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility travelling by air .
I particularly welcome all of the amendments aimed at introducing an integrated service to facilitate access to air transport for disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility , at no extra cost to those passengers .
This report aims to improve upon some of the Commission ’s proposals for the signatories to the Sugar Protocol , yet falls a long way short of what is required , because it does not even question , let alone reject , its basic premise , namely its liberalising approach .
I welcome the fact that this agreement is an instrument that will protect fisheries activities and jobs in fishing fleets , and the fact that it upholds the general principles for preserving fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy .     .
It should be highlighted that there is a proposal to increase the cost of licences to EUR 1 000 for surface longliners over 150 grt and to EUR 750 for surface longliners less than 150 grt .     .
We are very pleased , on the other hand , that our proposal aimed at funding measures to promote or set up small-scale coastal fishing representative associations , and to ensure their involvement in the decision-making process of the common fisheries policy was adopted .
There are key aspects of the resolution that are tantamount to an attack on fundamental democratic rights and the Treaty on European Union .
We therefore feel it is only right that the new Member States should fully enjoy the same support for their activities and that high levels of consumer protection should be promoted in all EU Member States .
As regards the former , the report does not put forward one single practical proposal , and the latter is not even mentioned .
I wish to congratulate Mr Koterec on his outstanding report on the role of state aid as a tool of regional development .
The negotiations on the 2007-2013 financial perspective are a telling example of the way in which the United Kingdom has conducted its Presidency .
More and more facts are coming to light about the US security services and agencies , such as the CIA , illegally kidnapping people , flying them to Europe , detaining them and then subjecting them to isolation and torture .
Every year Parliament introduces a ‘set of recommendations ’ in one of its own-initiative reports on EU candidate countries , whereas there is no mention of any ‘set of recommendations ’ that the Bulgarian people might have for the EU.
The country is also reminded ‘that it needs to make increased efforts in all areas of the internal market   … so as to guarantee its effective functioning’ .
The aim is more to appease the interests of the economic and financial groups in the most powerful countries than to improve the well-being of the Romanian people .
Women play a similar role in the fisheries sector and fishing communities as they do in farming communities , which is to support activities relating to catching .
The port workers are fighting for , among other things , job protection , job security , vocational qualifications , collective work contracts and union rights .
The biggest problems that have come to light have primarily been down to incorrect implementation and practice , and not to non-compliance with national laws .
The act of promoting a shared heritage based on a series of fundamental traditions and values should go hand in hand with respect for national identity .
Steps must also be taken to combat money laundering , and to shut down tax have ns .
Despite the US Administration once again causing a great deal of trouble up until the last moment , common sense eventually prevailed .
We must , as a matter of urgent priority , go further , and do more to honour the Kyoto Protocol .
This proposal for a directive forms part of the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy ’ aimed at speeding up liberalisations , leading to a ferocious onslaught against the public sector and on public services .
That said , the two committees called upon to give their opinions both declared their opposition to the proposal for a directive , thereby further securing its political fate .
Does it violate the principle of subsidiarity ?
What is needed is a political strategy which genuinely stimulates the development of Europe’s ports , as the rapporteur himself points out and amends , which takes account of the current state of affairs in the market and which involves all interested parties , naturally including Parliament .
Firstly , it fails to guarantee compatibility with the ongoing proposed review of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1191 of the Council concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service .
I should like to point out , however , that it does not fall within Parliament’s scope – or that of any other European institution , for that matter – to hold this debate in the first place .
It is not enough to be firm in protest , however ; we must also be resolute and proactive in deed .
In view of the new realities facing the global market and in the context of the various initiatives implemented by the Commission and the Committee on Transport and Tourism , this report is worthy of my support .     .
I voted in favour of this report , which forms part of the broader question of the development of the EU’s external relations concerning aviation policy .     – Mr President , as we stated in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , we are very concerned about this sugar reform and about the positions that the Council unfortunately adopted ahead of this debate .
