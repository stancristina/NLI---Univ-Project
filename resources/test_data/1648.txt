Union , Russia and the United Nations will , at last , be able to focus their efforts in the direction - it is to be hoped - of immediately sending an international peacekeeping force to the region which will be able to enforce the ceasefire and put an end to all the violations of rights .
Friends have to be frank with one another if they want to be true friends , and this is the time for plain speaking .
That is why I feel that , while the European Parliament must call for peace and make every effort to bring peace to the region , it must also state clearly that a government which we respect , a country for which we have sincere affection and which we want to protect has a responsibility to change , and that it is precisely because we want to protect it that we are asking it to do so .
The sad conclusion we must draw is that there is currently no possibility of stopping the war in the Middle East .
Mr President , three days ago I was in Ramallah , and I am therefore one of those Members whom Mr Santini inappropriately accused of war tourism .
For reasons of economy , it would have been preferable to use just one language , English .
In other words , in our opinion , the solution adopted is not completely satisfactory , but it does mean that this complex issue is closed .
In my opinion , we too make mistakes every now and again .
It all depends , then , on goodwill , on the willingness of the Putin Government to accept what are essentially implicit criticisms of the current situation in Chechnya - for otherwise it would not be necessary to send so many delegations .
After enlargement , that is our political priority .
Otherwise , we will be throwing our money away .
The plan for funding this process , through specialised sections of the EIB now and a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank in the future , must be welcomed with open arms .
Mr President , I will do my best to be serious in today 's explanations of vote .
I fully support this directive too , both on my own behalf and as representative of the Pensioners ' Party , and I am thinking not just of the citizens who could be harmed by these hazardous substances but also and above all of the workers in the companies that produce electrical and electronic equipment containing these harmful substances .
Mr President , this report - which I voted for - is on the subject of the European Coal and Steel Community .
Mr President , pensioners and elderly people fought in the last war and their wives and daughters suffered the consequences of this .
I therefore voted against the resolution .
I do not know why he is here ; China would not appear to be part of his remit .
We feel that Europe will only become great when it succeeds in adopting an unambiguous attitude towards human rights , the rights of individuals and the rights of minorities , and so we will not vote for a text which has been described as hypocritical , a view I share .
I am stressing this because , when pensioners and elderly people stop working , I regret to say that they are considered by governments , particularly the Ministers for the Budget , no longer to exist , to be citizens of which there should be as few as possible in a country , to be people who are a burden on the public purse , whereas , clearly , we are all agreed that being old means having worked for a lifetime , having suffered for a lifetime and having built up everything around us .
I must also say , moreover , that I am totally against this decision ; two amendments have been tabled by a group on the other side of the House , opposing this decision , and I personally cannot do anything but vote for these amendments , for I feel that citizens should be able to continue working on two conditions .
As long as rigid labour markets prevail in Europe , as long as employment rates , particularly among the youngest and oldest members of the active population , are prevented by corporate and protectionist policies from rising above their current low levels , as long as the labour market is organised in this way , it will be difficult or even impossible to guarantee to today 's and tomorrow 's pensioners conditions which are both dignified and sustainable in the medium and long term .
The labour market and pension reforms were intended to avoid the explosion of this intergenerational dispute .
The problem is now also responding to the shift of asbestos-related risks from one sector to another : from the traditional risks in the production sector - which , although significant , are controllable - to the risks in the sectors in which asbestos has to be handled because removal , maintenance , repair , or demolition work is carried out .
( The President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , it has now become clear that an international training market does exist ; the fact that the European Union 's involvement in the evolution of the international market in education is very slight and not in keeping with its cultural traditions is something of which the Union itself is aware , and the Commission was right to raise the matter in its communication .
In this regard , I wonder whether we should not start to extend the Union 's responsibilities beyond the limits of harmonising rules and do more than just develop cooperation tools
