quite different perspective to the rapporteur when it comes to our approach to the EU’s fisheries agreements with third countries .     We Swedish Social Democrats should ideally have liked to have seen Parliament support the stronger proposals in both the Commission ’s original proposal and the Council’s common position .
We therefore supported the compromise and voted in favour of all aspects of it .     Explanation of vote in relation to the report by Mrs Poli Bortone on a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods .
There is no absolute truth about what is harmful or beneficial .
Products based on new discoveries must be given a chance to establish themselves in the market so that they might compete successfully with existing products .
We believe that the fisheries agreement should not extend to include Western Saharan territory because Morocco has been occupying Western Sahara since 1975 .
What is more , the EU’s fishing fleet is partly responsible for depleting fish stocks , something pointed out by both Swedish authorities and environmental organisations .
Moreover , these agreements are expensive for taxpayers in the EU Member States .
The International Court of Justice in The Hague has pointed this out .
There are certainly positive aspects to the report , for example its call for the Council to become more open , but it otherwise focuses too much on growth and reduced costs when it should instead highlight sustainable development and greater cost effectiveness .
This means that , in our view too , the Council of Ministers should have the right to put forward legislative proposals , just as the Commission has .
There are two reasons why the June List welcomes enlargement to include new Member States .
We are , in that sense , adherents of what is usually called the EU’s soft power .
For the same reason , we can see that it was a mistake to begin membership negotiations with Turkey right now .
With the future in mind , we should in that way be sending the correct signal to Europe , including Croatia , Serbia , Turkey , Ukraine and Belarus .     Pressure has been exerted from many quarters in today’s debate , and there has been much speculation about the observations to be made and , naturally , a good deal of nervousness in the countries concerned .
These countries ’ politicians and people have made enormous efforts and sacrifices with the clear aim of reforming and democratising their countries and leading them into the European Community .
We are also relying on you wholeheartedly to support and help Bulgaria and Romania tackle these difficulties so that we might make progress towards their becoming Members at the beginning of next year .
EU integration is like a tango .
We must also dare to proclaim the significance of enlargement and explain to our people why it is so important for Romania and Bulgaria now to get together with us and for Romanians and Bulgarians to sit in this House and be allowed to speak from the benches instead of sitting in the public gallery and merely listening .     Romania and Bulgaria have been promised EU membership as from 1 January 2007 .
They have signed the accession agreement , and we have sent signals to Romania and Bulgaria to the effect that they are doing a good job and that , if they continue to work hard , they will also become members in accordance with the timetable .
The fact that these fears are unjustified and the fact that current political leaders did not manage to explain this and give people a sense of optimism are clear signs that there is a serious lack of leadership in today’s Europe .
In such a situation , it would not be sensible to postpone Romania’s and Bulgaria’s entry into the EU , particularly because it would most certainly divert both attention and energy from much more complicated issues in the region such as the status of Kosovo , the referendum in Montenegro and the status of that country and the constitutional changes under way right now in Bosnia .
However large the deficits run by Member States as part of their overall debt , their ratings are not affected appreciably .
It is important that people be made fully aware of the real implications of changing their currency .
This rule has not so far been applied stringently enough .
The report states that the Interinstitutional Agreement that the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission have managed to reach is compatible with primary European law and the Treaties .
More of the EU’s resources should be spent in areas such as research and fighting crime , poverty and climate change , as well as on work to make the EU the most competitive economy in the world .
It is our opinion that it must continue to be the Member States that decide what resources the EU has at its disposal .     We have today voted in favour of Mr Böge’s report on the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline .
Furthermore , we reject the proposal in the report that the EU should have its own resources instead of relying on the contributions of the Member States .
The report approves the budgetary and financial consequences of the agreement which the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission have managed to reach .
More of the EU’s resources should be spent in areas such as research and fighting crime , poverty and climate change , as well as on work to make the EU the most competitive economy in the world .
The reform of the budget must be kept to the fore when the agreed overhaul is due to take place in 2008/2009
