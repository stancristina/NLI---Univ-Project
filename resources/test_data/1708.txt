One particular problem is the agricultural budget .
The idea of savings in the agricultural budget , which was discussed at Berlin , would not appear to be the solution at present .
Farmers are the only section of the population in Europe whose income levels are determined directly by the EU.
We must remember that our fiercest competitor , the United States , subsidises agriculture on a scale that is clearly greater than in the EU.
The Council is developing its own military crisis management organisation and has asked , among others , for 51 new posts in the second supplementary budget in the middle of the budgetary year .
Crisis management is clearly a matter of operational expenditure .
As this is clearly a case of non-compulsory expenditure , Parliament cannot endorse these plans .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
In Member States where there are large ports revenue from customs duty is considerable and , for that reason , the amount of duty paid in contributions is substantial .
The increase in portage from 10 % to 25 % was a clear concession to the countries with large ports .
The resulting gap in the EU budget is to be bridged by increasing the GNP share .
This is leading to a situation where EU contributions are becoming tied more than ever to budget transfers from individual Member States and gross national earnings , which must now probably be considered only fair .
There are a hundred million inhabitants in the new Member States , representing only 4 % of GNP , however .
As my fellow Member , Mrs Schleicher , criticised this report for perhaps not focussing adequately on the essentials and featuring too many good intentions , I might first of all say that the final result could have been a lot more cluttered .
It could have expressed a lot more in the way of hopes for the future .
As for Mrs Schleicher ' s own group , it added a totally new area of focus .
Mr President , public health is a major area of activity for the European Union as the Treaty of Amsterdam does indeed oblige the Union to take account of the health issue in all areas of its work .
Let us just think about the food we eat , for example .
It will also mean that the food industry will have to accept that tighter regulations will have to be adopted , for example , with regard to the salt content of food .
There are many conflicts to come , and we can only hope that the Commission will work on these proposals and then the Council of Ministers and Parliament will clarify this situation further in the second reading .
Mr President , Prime Minister , Mr Prodi , on the front page of yesterday ' s Financial Times , Horst KÃ¶hler , the head of the International Monetary Fund , was lashing out at European political leaders , albeit in a very civilised way .
We have thus already fallen below the 3 % growth target that was set for the mid term as a basis for sustaining and improving employment and social security in Europe .
That is what happened , despite what was certainly an enormous effort to achieve results on the part of the country to hold the presidency .
In the wake of the Stockholm meeting , there is going to be a grain of truth in that joke .
We have to remember that the decisions that are now required concerning European patents , the liberalisation of competition among the gas and electricity boards and in the Post Office , making air traffic more flexible , Galileo , and other matters , will not result in any real changes until four to ten years have gone by after the political decision is taken .
At last a nugget of something concrete has been found for a policy on the northern dimension .
The conclusions of Stockholm state that the sound economic situation that has lasted quite a long time now in the European Union would not have been possible without monetary and economic union : has the Swedish government started preparations to fulfil their Community obligations by joining the third phase of monetary and economic union ?
Mr President , conflicts connected with religion seem to be a significant cause of human rights violations in the world .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Finnish racing drivers are known as the Flying Finns , which is quite a different thing from the Flying Dutchman , but we who all fly a lot can also speak about flying from our own experience .
Although every air passenger can take out private insurance , it is nevertheless only reasonable that a certain basic level of compensation should be guaranteed to all in the event of an accident .
This is a good thing .
Legislation that is suitably broad in scope must be used to safeguard the business opportunities of both the cheap carriers and those airlines that offer a greater range of services .
The important question for airlines is that of a special declaration being made at the time of check-in .
In my opinion , the requirement by airlines for the declaration to be made prior to take-off is only reasonable .
The regulation lacks clarity inasmuch as the points in the Montreal Convention referred to in it are not , however , to be found in the regulation itself .
However , the regulation is a leap forward in terms of its content , and there is reason to rejoice that the outdated Warsaw Convention is receding from view .
Breakfast in Rome , lunch in Paris , dinner in Helsinki , and luggage in Moscow .
