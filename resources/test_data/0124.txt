today is that we will give particular attention to this issue during the preparation of the next annual report on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy , with particular reference to those countries whose insolvency laws still amount to an obstacle to growth and employment .     Although I have to say that the connection between the honourable Member’s question and the problem of insolvency law , which we are discussing , is not one I find easy to perceive , I am nevertheless able to answer it .
Modern industrial policy in Europe is a quite essential and indispensable contribution to the improvement of employment opportunities .     .
We have brought about a real paradigm shift .
Honourable Members will notice this here in Parliament when they discuss the proposals presented by the Commission .
First of all , we have of course reinforced legal protection .
As a matter of principle , we of course endeavour to work at multilateral level .
By giving this definition and through his stance , he made it clear that counterfeiting can affect both patented and generic medicines .
We also know that highly gifted children and young people , for example , often wrongly end up receiving psychiatric treatment owing to a failure to recognise them as such .
We need to ask ourselves questions and seek answers , however .
Action by the Commission and the whole of Europe on mental health is even more vital , however .
Nevertheless , I believe that the added value of European action is extremely important .
This call does not mean we are interfering in subsidiarity , but that we want to suggest action points and demonstrate a pan-European approach for enhancing human dignity and reducing discrimination , for example healthy families within which children can grow up and equal opportunities throughout the Union , both within Europe and within the Member States .
This will , of course , depend primarily on the quality of this frame of reference .
As Mr Lehne has already mentioned , there is a very broad consensus here on the fundamental issues , particularly on the development of Community acquis in the field of consumer protection having now begun , and on attempts being made at some degree of harmonisation .
Is an independent Kosovo needed to live like this ?
The European Union will have to play a major role in the legal system , in the sphere of security , especially that of the police , but naturally also as far as military security is concerned .
The tasks facing us are much more extensive .
The problem is that we now have a situation there which is not up to the new challenges because people were not accustomed to taking responsibility themselves .
In other words , they are attempting to make themselves out to be the victims .
Mr President , I get the impression that this was exactly the right time to put this parliamentary question in relation to what emerged from the delegation’s visit , for the fact is that there really is much more left to be done if we are actually to be prepared for the tasks we shall have to carry out .
This will also involve resolving the issue of which military forces are to perform the function of keeping Kosovo secure once it is independent , and I could well imagine a similar solution being arrived at to that found for Bosnia and Herzegovina , with the KFOR being replaced by European armed services .
It is for this reason that it is so heartening that the political forces have come to an agreement on the tiresome subject of electoral rolls .
I am not talking here only about the state , but about the infrastructure as well ; this is a country that needs massive support from us in building roads , in establishing cross-border links with Kosovo , and in connecting up to energy supplies .
Many Albanians live from subsistence farming and only a few products are exported .
I would like to say , Mr President , how grateful I am to you for calling the group presidents to two meetings over the holiday period , and I would like to thank you , Mr Tuomioja , and you , Commission Ferrero-Waldner , for what you have done , as well as the High Representative Mr Solana for his own .
I was deeply moved by that .
What I can say , on behalf of us Social Democrats , is that dialogue with all the forces in Palestine can no longer be evaded ; it is necessary and indispensable .
Such terrorism , such blind destructive rage , is no more and no less than the outward face of a contempt for humanity that is always destructive in its effects .
I am very pleased that you , Mr Schulz , brought up the FDP’s idea for a CSCME ( Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Middle East ) , as Kurt Beck has also already done .
If we want to arrive at a fair assessment of the situation , we must be clear in our own minds that this is how it started .
Israel must recognise that its own existence depends upon there being peace now that new weapons with a longer range are available .
If we want to prevent Hizbollah from rearming , if we want to prevent Rumsfeld’s threat from becoming a reality after the expiry of the deadline – he thought that there could be a new war – if we want to prevent this , then we Europeans have to recommence negotiations with Iran on solutions to the nuclear conflict and also on ending its support of Hizbollah .
I would also say : we now have a chance to become not just financial donors , but also political actors in the Middle East
