you have in the French Government has been more than shown to be , at the very least , debatable .
However , I believe that as pro-Europeans , we know that in order to achieve the economic governance that we need to build , there will probably need to be reforms , which will have to be agreed reforms .
I cannot be in favour of the proposed budgets for this type of service with its militaristic tendencies .
Before the vote , we were aware of the resistance among Members from the various groups to adopting the extension of maternity leave to 20 weeks , the need to pay people in that situation 100 % of their salary , extending the measures in the case of disabled children , and the inclusion of paternity leave .
It is my understanding that the increase to a continuous period of maternity leave of at least 20 weeks allocated before and/or after confinement , with a compulsory minimum of six weeks after childbirth , is a step forward in terms of a woman 's right to reconcile family and professional life .
Unemployment has risen and , under these circumstances , the situation of the most vulnerable people , such as women , children , young people and the elderly , is more precarious .
To that end , it demands that Member States and the European institutions establish concrete measures to promote reintegration into the labour market worthy of those people who are living in poverty .
The current economic crisis has demonstrated that coordination of economic policy has not worked in the Union , nor have the frameworks for governance , for economic supervision or for regulating financial services .
We must continue to view our coasts and seas as an opportunity .
More specifically , we should state that we are alarmed at the prosecution and sentencing to a total of 12 years in prison of the opposition leader , Sam Rainsy , on account of a gesture which it considers to be of a symbolic and clearly political nature .
Mr President , I have already given you the reasons why the Council should make a statement about the bombardment of Lebanon .
Here there is an implied attitude which is debatable from the point of view of a broad vision of the process of developing the networks and providing services .
And , Mr President , I should not like to end my remarks without congratulating Mr Castricum for his excellent work .
The best protection of the interests of patients as consumers is the availability of high quality , safe and effective medicines .
In that report it is stated that the G7 financial group considers that in Europe and the United States 120 000 million dollars are in circulation bound up with the sale of drugs .
In my country 60 % of prisoners are behind bars because of drug dependence , and 40 % of that 60 % have the AIDS virus .
This Parliament has voted and will continue to vote for austerity in expenditure , particularly as regards the appointment of new staff , but we must bear in mind that without a Court of Auditors with sufficient resources we shall find it very difficult to comply with one of the principal mandates of our electors , namely to ensure that Community funds are used correctly and that European taxpayers ' interests are protected when we are faced with the certain fact , stressed by the Wynn report , that 80 % of the Community budget is spent within the Member States .
Clear expression should also be given to the importance which this Assembly attaches to keeping the Court of Auditors responsible for controlling 100 % of Community resources , with the Court retaining full autonomy and independence from Parliament in addition to observing and fulfilling the conditions laid down in the Treaties .
I also view favourably the fact that for the first time , although belatedly , it has been submitted for the assent of Parliament as we had requested .
Mr President , with regard to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco , we ought not to lose sight of overall relations between the two countries and the way they have been developing .
Personally I understand Mrs Bonino 's difficulties during the whole period of negotiations and congratulate her on her performance .
I agree therefore with the political proposal of the Committee on Fisheries to make the assent conditional upon an official undertaking on the part of the Commission to inform the European Parliament every year of the state of budgetary and financial implementation of the agreement , and following on from my motion I would add that it would be appropriate for the Commission to present an assessment of its socio-economic impact on the Community regions affected , particularly the peripheral regions .
Previously he was saying that agreement was impossible , that only a miracle performed by the Virgin could make it possible and was making rather cruder comments about our dropping our trousers before Rabat , for instance .
We must also congratulate the Commission on having sent Parliament a copy of the agreement as soon as it was signed .
As the Commissioner is present I should like to make a brief remark which may only touch on this debate , but is important in these times .
As Mr Poggiolini has said , this programme is extremely important .
It is a matter of a co-decision procedure enriched , moreover , by contributions from the Commission , the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Budgets .
Secondly the difficulty of a health information network working well throughout Europe when we are seeing a re-privatization of medicine and the resultant difficulties that brings for gathering information through the public system .
