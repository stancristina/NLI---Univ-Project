We Greens also seek the support of Parliament for our amendment calling for the national and international federations to agree to comply with Directive 337/85 and its subsequent amendments concerning environmental impact assessments for major sporting events .
Sport , and in particular participatory sport , can be made accessible to our citizens and enabled to contribute to their well-being through an overall initiative covering all the measures to be carried out , with a single body being identified which groups together all the organizations currently devoted to sport : this would overcome the present fragmentation at European level .
Mr Commissioner , I think our debate should concentrate on the role to be played by the group of advisers on biotechnology ethics at European Union level .
On the other hand it is true - as I have said - that there are risks : risks of disturbance to the human species and to biological balances .
I think there is a duty to remove this ambiguity : do we want to create an ethics committee or extend the role and responsibilities of the group of advisers ?
In February I put a question to the Office of the Presidency on the building work in Strasbourg .
I now want to ask you two questions .
So , on behalf of my group , I support the request for reference back to committee .
The directive contains a number of points like this , which I shall not go through , but the Member States are left very wide opportunities to legislate in different ways .
The great majority of changes introduced are important because they are linked to the assessment of preparations as a function of the dangers they represent for the environment , harmonizing with the seventh updating , in line with technical progress , of Directive No 67/548 on dangerous substances which is closely linked to the directive we are now discussing in this Chamber .
However , in cases of non-dangerous preparations containing a substance with a health risk , where information on certain properties is not relevant to the protection of consumer health , simplified safety data sheets need to be introduced for preparations not classified as dangerous , because drawing up and updating full data sheets involve major cost , time and difficulty for small and medium-sized firms which often do not have the necessary human and technical resources .
In practice we are now largely forced to restrict certain functions that are important for Parliament - I am thinking , for example , of the whole interpretation service - to pay for the excessive cost of misconceived operations , operations full of irregularities , operations which are largely superfluous .
Transparency is essential , but we must take care that we do not end up spending just as much and at the same time increasing the bureaucracy to do the checking .
Linking schools to the Internet , introducing a wide band multimedia network for teaching and for the new applications , expanding the ' Citizens of Europe ' initiative with additional programmes - these are all excellent ideas which the United States has already implemented , in its own way .
The 1997 budget procedure envisages a reduction of the payment appropriations for the structural funds just because of the underspend .
There were great expectations of this reform , and there has been great progress , but there is also great disappointment .
Furthermore the slow progress in extending majority voting in the Council undermines the core of the process of integration of the Union , and represents a serious threat to the actual decision-making capacity of the European Union .
Mr President , following after Mr Perry 's report on the activity of the Committee on Petitions , which we had at the June part-session , and Mr Papakyriazis ' report on the activity of the Ombudsman , I too wish to endorse Mr Newman 's invitation to all honourable Members to read Mr Söndermann 's excellent report .
That gives rises to crises of rejection , failure to act , the problems national communities experience in assimilating Community directives : in other words , the Union may fail because citizens do not perceive themselves as subjects but as the objects of decisions of the Community Institutions or even , in some respects , the victims of what is decided at a Community level .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall not reiterate the main points of the fisheries agreement , which your rapporteur , Mrs Pery , has in any case explained to you quite admirably .
Secondly , I wish to raise the subject of poverty .
Personally , I wish the local fishermen would observe the principles of control and good management that are being imposed on European vessels .
The agreement states that at least 10 000 tonnes of tuna must be landed to supply local fish processing industries , which otherwise would have no work to do as , apparently , the non-industrial fishing boats do not fish for tuna .
We can do that together if the State wants it , but ultimately it is for them to decide .
Frankly I find it quite astonishing that anyone should insist on a mid-term review , which does not form part of the agreement , when no-one else , not even the Senegalese , has asked for it .
It is djaboï that feeds the Senegalese - the only fish they eat - and it is fished by fishermen in their dugout canoes , at the rate of 400 000 tonnes , with no management of stocks .
I did not want to create a discussion about integrity .
The procedure is as follows : normally Member States are informed of the new possibilities and then they inform their own sector .
There is substantial demand
