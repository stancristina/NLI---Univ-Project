What guarantees and timetables is the Commission offering at the end of this difficult and belated debate ?
We therefore hope that Parliament will throw its full weight behind the initiatives that the Commission provides and we also hope that the commitments made a few weeks ago will be fully honoured , even if this procedure cannot be wound up by Christmas but under the new procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon .
We have reason to be very pleased with the result achieved today on the telecommunications package since it reinforces the rights of internet users and encourages competition between telephone companies .
This network was set up in 2001 by Council Decision 2001/427/JHA .
In March 2009 , an external evaluation was published concerning the functioning of the network .
At this point , I must stress how embarrassed I am to see these empty seats , given that these proposals were made by the Swedish Presidency itself .
Speaking as rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and is incapable of tackling crime prevention for several reasons .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the Members who have taken part in this debate .
In the few months that I have been in Parliament , I have noted that Parliament and the European Union have accorded an extraordinary degree of importance to the fight against terrorism , while sadly there is a lack of will to address not only the fight against crime , but the organised crime that is at the root of it .
Europol cannot be strengthened unless Parliament is able to express itself properly on regulations relating to measures that are not purely technical but political , such as the transfer of personal data .
Allow me to add a thought concerning the European Union 's increasingly outward-looking stance and the increased synergy between internal security and defence .
Europe should act like Italy , which is setting an example for the whole of Europe in attacking Mafia assets , thanks to Minister Maroni .
This is because , from the outset , we wished to send a very clear message : we intend to work with great rigour to ensure transparency , accuracy and legality in the management of public funds and , therefore , in auditing the budgets .
The European Union has concluded bilateral association agreements with all of our Mediterranean partners apart from Syria , and these focus essentially on trade in goods .
The Commission is ready to work closely with you on the future negotiations which I have just mentioned .
It also contains a series of practical short-term proposals , one of which is the Euro-Mediterranean trade and investment facilitation mechanism .
The deal was sealed in December 2008 .
During this process , the Commission will pay particular attention to capacity-building in trade and related issues within the Libyan administration .
Therefore , we do not have much time .
This commitment is part of the European Commission 's political project .
Even during a trip to Libya as Commissioner for Transport , I noticed the desire to reverse a trend which had always existed in the past .
Indeed , the report on the current first rail package , adopted by the Commission in 2006 , and the latest statistics indicate that the opening up of the market to competition has not had any negative impact on the overall level of rail safety which , on the contrary , continues to improve .
It is important , however , that these measures are not adopted in isolation at national level , but that they are coordinated at European level in order to obtain results accepted in all Member States .
In order to eliminate these barriers , in 2008 , the Railway Agency began work on the cross-acceptance of rolling stock .
It is true that the original specifications had ambiguities which gave rise to different interpretations , but these ambiguities were eliminated in 2007 .
I share the position of Mr Milana , because during the conference itself , I proposed that greater powers be given to the European Railway Agency .
I am therefore in full agreement .
With regard to the social aspects that have been raised , there is the social dialogue committee which , in 2005 , discussed an agreement on working time for international traffic .
This makes it possible to safeguard transparency and makes consumers more aware of their buying options with the support of brochures , flyers and web marketing .
We cannot fool ourselves that it will be possible to achieve agreement on so-called common values .
There is no condemnation of the illegal activities ( thefts , bag-snatching , tiresome begging and underage prostitution ) that are increasingly connected with illegal Roma settlements in the outskirts of major cities in Italy and elsewhere .
The implementation of a free trade area requires the determined , ongoing and synergetic contribution of all parties .
The market is free only when rules are clear , mutual and applied .
The debate in committee and also within the groups themselves was not lacking in disagreements , sometimes lively , which are typical of an across-the-board confrontation that transcends the respective political positions .
Madam President , Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome with great satisfaction the extension of the Atalanta mission .
At the same time , we intend to express our concern regarding the dramatic nature of the situation within Somalia , which reinforces the need for and urgency of an action to promote stability in the country in order to tackle the root causes of the phenomenon of piracy .
Likewise , we ask the Court to put Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control in a position to carry out their own work as productively as possible .
