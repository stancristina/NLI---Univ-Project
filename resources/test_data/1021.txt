produced .
It is good that categories have been removed .
The Council ' s common position , together with Parliament ' s six amendments , constitute legislation of benefit to agriculture and consumers in the EU.
European film production is an important part of the EU' s cultural and media policy , and the Liberal Group considers that it is important to support the European film industry which is exposed to a very great deal of competition , especially from the American film industry .
On one important point , however , we shall be voting against the rapporteur ' s recommendation , and that is the budget for the programme .
It is the European Parliament ' s and the EU' s task to establish the correct framework and conditions for a cultural policy of this kind , but it is not a proper part of our remit to spend an exorbitant amount of taxpayers ' money on cultural policy .
It is similarly with certain reservations that we shall be voting tomorrow in favour of the proposals to set up a European Guarantee Fund and to broaden the financing options through cooperation with the European Investment Bank .
Unlike previous media programmes , the MEDIA Plus programme also involves the radio industry and , because we really cannot find any good , sensible reason for this , we have a reservation regarding this area , too .
The rapporteur wishes to change the status of the Media Committee from that of an advisory to that of a competent body , but this is something for which we have never obtained a really good explanation .
I fear that this change will make it still a little more difficult to administer the MEDIA Plus programme , so it is also with a reservation that we shall be voting in favour of the proposals tomorrow .
In spite of all these reservations , I think we have an extremely good program before us to enable us to strengthen the European film industry .
We have a directive from 1992 which establishes minimum rights for maternity leave and women ' s entitlements to financial compensation when they are absent from the labour market due to childbirth .
She does not , therefore , think that the Commission ' s report provides an adequate basis for carrying out a review of the directive .
I am , therefore , also opposed to our requesting a review of the directive now .
The existing rules make for great flexibility , and most countries guarantee women better conditions than the common regulations require .
In any case , maternity leave and financial aid ought to be given priority in the individual countries .
However , I think it would be a good idea to obtain a better overview of what the circumstances are in the different countries so that governments can learn from each other ' s good and bad experiences and inspire each other .
We have a good example of this here .
I am not so sure .
Great efficiency is demanded , and women are supposed to work as if they were not pregnant , even if they are .
We know this , because investigations have proven this to be the case .
I think we have an example here of the Commission ' s doing all too little in this area .
It needs to be re-done .
We must know whether the legislation is working .
The Commission ' s purely legal analyses now already show that there is a need for further protection .
The Commission must go back to the drawing board , set to work again and table the necessary proposals .
This should be an area - and this remark is aimed at the Liberal Group which has adopted a very different view - in which the EU should have a big influence .
Women' s participation in the labour market is a prerequisite of our achieving the ambitious goals we have set ourselves regarding employment and the modernisation of the European social model .
They cannot be left to the Member States .
The reason for this is that the present Commission , which has undertaken to implement an extensive administrative reform , is not showing sufficient willingness to implement this reform .
The many cases of foot-dragging , delay and refusal to hand over documents to the Committee on Budgetary Control , together with the extraordinary fact that crucial reports and minutes are disappearing from the record offices where they belong , are an uncomfortable indication that a form of administration is being maintained which is more suited to the age of absolute monarchy .
Clearly , the purpose of the secrecy is to protect the Commission ' s members and officials from the penalties which are used in every democratic national administration and without which the European Union ' s administration will never operate properly .
One year after coming into office , the Commission has still not presented any proposal for fundamentally changing the provisions in the regulations for public officials which provide the kind of legal protection for incompetence and dishonesty that is completely absurd in an administration which purports to be democratic .
Unacceptable pressure has been placed upon a number of rapporteurs , and the shady operators who have an interest in preventing the serious examples of fraud and deception in the Commission ' s administration from coming to light have not held back from making physical threats .
I do not believe that a great many of these MEPs are satisfied with the Commission ' s economic administration , but we have reached a point where the majority prefer to close their eyes to what is going on than to run the risk of their electors and fellow citizens becoming fully aware of the scandalous states of affairs which make themselves felt year after year
