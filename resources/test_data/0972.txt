inevitable .
After all the Internet is a reflection of what is happening in our society .
In the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Partythis encourages freedom of expression and therefore democracy .
Opposite that is the problem of media concentration ; in my view this has to be resolved quickly by legislation , which we are awaiting .
It is an issue which requires special attention .
With electronic information there are no longer any frontiers .
There is growing scientific evidence that scenes depicting sex and violence are harmful to the development of young people .
I think that is a task for the national governments rather than the European Commission .
On this point the Green Paper is disappointing .
All those undesirable intimacies , the sexual abuse of women and children , the growth of sex tourism and the demand for child pornography - are these vile practices not encouraged by audiovisual material that is to some extent perverted ?
Secondly I naturally appreciate the concern of the rapporteur and the Commission at the use of new communication methods by people with sick minds .
Really it is a very small part of the total cattle trade in Europe and it is completely ludicrous that we , this Parliament included , should continue paying export refunds .
We should stop immediately .
The Commission has based its proposal on objective and relevant criteria .
Besides that the age requirements for trees are difficult to check .
In the Minutes it does not say Luanda but Rwanda .
The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs is not there .
My question is this : has the Commissioner obtained any view of the prospects for the Commission proposal to hold an Intergovernmental Conference prior to the next accession ?
This report has already caused a great deal of controversy in various countries , and particularly in Belgium even before being voted on .
For example , it is most regrettable that a point that Martin Schulz just mentioned , that is , the possession of child pornography for personal use , was not considered by the Council .
We are convinced that Melchior Wathelet does not have the moral authority that a European judge must possess .
We also feel with regard to internal measures for the European Union that it is important to focus adequate attention and support on the NGOs working to trace children and prevent sexual abuse of children .
That is the main problem .
I believe it would be far better to speak of political responsibility and only that .
A top European post apparently in order to be rid of the man , perhaps even a sign of contempt for the Court of Justice which is thus regarded as some kind of political recycling machine .
The murders , abductions and the sadistic rapes that were carried out by Diedres and his accomplices could have been prevented if the current European judge Mr Wathelet had done his duty .
The least that one can say about Wathelet is that he was incompetent , negligent and irresponsible .
Understand that if you can !
Fourthly , a request to the Member States to ratify the Europol Convention quickly is gaining support both from politicians and from NGOs .
I would also ask those responsible for this excellent report : what are we actually dealing with today ?
He has said that he refuses to take part in what he himself considers to be a kangaroo court or lynch mob and opposes a ban on Wathelet pursuing his profession .
Because , quite honestly , the Council is surely removing the core of this directive and what is more , legal precedent has moved on and the Commission 's first proposal and Parliament 's amendments are much closer to it than what the Council eventually cobbled together up at first reading .
Is it true , Commissioner , that the Commission is still sticking to including the position of self-employed women in this directive ?
One more point , and I can deal with it very quickly , is Amendment No 8.
These matters are outside the scope of this report and the competence of the Committee on External Economic Relations .
The second reason why my group has problems with this report concerns its basic assumptions .
Tomorrow , before the vote , my group will submit a request for the report to be referred back to the Committee on External Economic Relations so that a more balanced report can be achieved within that Committee .
Although we appreciate his work , we do not wish to take the route the rapporteur indicates .
Mr President , this report on the specification of euro coins has become extremely dubious because of action by the Socialist and Green Groups .
Secondly , national symbols on the coins would be undesirable , because they would create confusion and facilitate fraud .
You do not have to melt coins down so often and mint new ones .
First , on the number of coins .
The third decision is the national face of the euro .
So it is all rubbish .
It is a practical proposal that is being obstructed by Brussels .
This means there are also many differences between the various systems .
The other systems try to include everyone .
It is odd that the further north you go , the more social protection comes to the fore and the further south you go , the more prominent is the income-related social security system .
I therefore support Mrs Weiler 's proposal to update Regulation 148/71 which removes the disadvantages for crossborder workers .
I have already gathered that our suggestion that combatting youth unemployment be included has not been taken up .
But we would prefer them to come through convergence agreements rather than through binding agreements at European level
