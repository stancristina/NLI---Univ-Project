Yet Europe and our European culture are also characterised by a unique capacity to rise up again , to recover and both to rediscover and redefine their values and aims .
Two terrible world wars tore our Continent apart .
For almost half a century we lived with an artificial division of Europe .
These values were drowned out by the thunder of guns in August 1914 and trampled to death in the trenches of the World War .
We have never really recovered the optimism and faith in the future that characterised the first years of the twentieth century .
Enlargement of the EU marks the beginning of a new epoch in European history .
Enlargement is the key to the future of Europe .
That is an inspiring task , and a responsibility that puts us under an obligation .
This support was most recently expressed during the negotiations at the plenary session on 23 October and was expressed in strong terms by the President of the European Parliament to the European Council at the Brussels Summit .
It is also in view of this that I am pleased to be able to report to you all here today that at the Brussels Summit the European Council confirmed the Member States ' full support of enlargement .
These mean that the first round of enlargement negotiations can be concluded in Copenhagen in December .
We still have a huge task ahead of us and limited time available .
We are negotiating with 27 countries in total and we have 37 days in which to achieve a result - nothing can be taken for granted .
We now have a road for our further negotiations to follow , however : the Presidency and the Commission have a solid foundation on which to negotiate at the Copenhagen Summit , and that creates clarity .
They will not be faced with a fait accompli .
There must be no doubt that we in the Presidency will approach this task with all our energy and with an untiring will to achieve results .
In other words , decisions on the choice of countries , decisions on the outstanding financial issues and decisions on the final remaining institutional issues .
Finally , and thirdly , the Presidency attached great importance to the Brussels Summit taking place in accordance with the decisions made at the Seville Summit .
I am pleased to report that we achieved our objectives in all three areas .
It was a brief Council lasting just over 24 hours with a concentrated agenda which was thoroughly prepared , an agenda which was devised with the greatest possible degree of openness .
I may mention that the annotated agenda for the summit could be found on the Presidency 's web site in the weeks leading up to Brussels , allowing everyone to follow the preparations .
I personally attached great importance to the Brussels Summit being as focused and results-oriented as possible , and I am very pleased with the result .
With regard to Kaliningrad , too , the Presidency achieved its aims in Brussels .
A basis has thus been secured for further negotiations with Russia .
We want to find a solution that takes into account Russia 's problems , but at the same time respects the sovereignty of Lithuania and the rules of the Schengen cooperation .
Obviously , enlargement was the main topic in Brussels .
We made it very clear to everybody that it was now - and not in December - that the decisions were to be taken and we focused the agenda on the central issues .
I will not go through the conclusions of the summit in detail here .
The conclusions are brief and clear and speak for themselves , but I would like to highlight the major decisions .
The European Council approved the Commission 's recommendations on the choice of countries .
Where Bulgaria and Romania are concerned , we decided to support these two countries in their efforts to achieve their aim of accession in 2007 .
The message to Bulgaria and Romania is clear : enlargement will continue and the EU is open to European countries wishing to join which meet the requirements for membership .
The European Council is pleased with the progress that Turkey has made towards meeting the political Copenhagen criterion .
We will make new decisions on Turkey at the Copenhagen Summit .
In this area too , the European Council supported the Commission 's proposal , with one simple adjustment : we extended the period for which the special provisions will apply from two to three years .
The Heads of State and Government accepted the compromise already achieved by the Presidency at the meeting of Foreign Ministers on 22 October .
This established a clear negotiating basis for the Presidency in relation to the candidate countries in this area as well .
The most difficult issue on the agenda of the Brussels Summit was the outstanding financial issues .
We made three crucial decisions .
The phasing in will take place within a framework of financial stability .
This expenditure must not exceed the level for 2006 plus 1 % per year , which means that if inflation exceeds 1 % there will be a real fall in agricultural expenditure .
The figure is EUR 23 000 million in the period 2004 to 2006 , which is slightly lower than the Commission 's proposal of just over EUR 25 000 million .
I consider it of great importance that we succeeded in establishing that no new Member State must find itself in a worse position during the period from 2004 to 2006 than was the case in 2003 .
These were the main points of the European Council and , in conclusion , I would just like to mention that the European Council also met with the president of the Convention on
