This new directive must prevent new barriers from being raised and stipulate that the existing barriers that people with disabilities have to face must be eliminated throughout the European Union .
Since 2000 , new priorities have arisen out of the need for reconstruction after illegal and unjust wars in the Kosovo region , Serbia and Afghanistan .
In any case , funding generated by the invading forces in Iraq is unacceptable , so long as this illegal occupation is maintained by the Anglo-American forces .     .
There are two elements that characterise this budget for 2004 : - it is going to be the budget for enlargement of the EU to ten new countries with per capita incomes of roughly 40 % of the Community average .
This report has the virtue of recognising that funding under heading 4 ( External Action ) in the current financial perspective has proved insufficient .
The proposal tabled aims at reducing the negative environmental impact resulting from the transit of heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria , because of the particular geographical and environmental situation of this region .
Under the rules thus clearly established , carriers will always be obliged to provide immediate assistance for passengers in the event of any delay or flight cancellation , and it will therefore be easier for citizens to assert their rights .     .
In this context , this proposal suggests that in cases of overbooking , significant delays and flight cancellations , users should be reimbursed or compensated for any damage caused , depending on the situation .
I believe this debate should be encouraged with a view , specifically , to conducting a thorough assessment of this energy solution , taking account of its positive environmental effects .
They are an appeal to the United States for a commitment to a ‘balanced ’ partnership , seeking joint action and the use of all possible means , including military means , and they show the EU’s determination to consolidate its capacities with the intention of sharing the ambition of world domination with the US.
In the meantime , as it is still too early to judge how and when the process will be resumed , the blackmail around the forthcoming financial perspective is gaining strength , with six countries demanding an unacceptable annual ceiling of 1 % of the Community GNI.
In fact , I still believe that the European Union is a Union of States and that it is with them that responsibility for the final decision to be taken on this matter rests .
The Convention method demonstrated its limits and its fundamental untruth : the much-flaunted ‘consensus ’ never existed .
I do , however , support the paragraph that tries to clarify the points of agreement     .
The Commission , however , is trying to impose a system which has yet to be tried out .
Streamlining toll charges throughout the European Union will certainly make life easier for European citizens , in particular for transport professionals and also represents a substantial step towards deepening the internal market .
These are what we call society’s ‘lifeblood ’ and they must consequently be the main architects of the development process in their countries , regions , towns and villages .
The broad objective stated in the European Union’s development cooperation policy is to combat poverty and ultimately eradicate it .
This serves as the legal base for budget item B7-6220 ( 21.02.06 ) – ‘Promoting equality of men and women in the framework of development cooperation’ .
I am wholeheartedly in favour of adopting measures that could help achieve these aims of helping the poorest members of society and , because I believe that the rapporteur’s suggestions could contribute to achieving these objectives , I supported this report .
The fifth fisheries protocol between the European Community and Côte d’Ivoire expired on 30 June .
Furthermore , the agreement has contributed to local development .
I also call on the Commission henceforth to be punctual in presenting the proposals it wishes Parliament to adopt .     .
It was a success , a double success in fact : no agreement was reached on the rash constitutional fantasy ; it also introduced the Growth Initiative .
This attitude ignores all current developments , damages Europe and tears it apart .
I also received a disappointing answer from the European Commission on the sensitive issue of health , when I asked about the possibility of introducing a European charter for children in hospital .
What is even worse , this need is felt most powerfully in childhood , in sickness and in old age .
We convinced ourselves that this was the end of history , that we were facing a new dawn .
The trial continues at Aveiro Criminal Court tomorrow .
Illegal dumping and emptying of tanks , either on the high seas or close to shore , must be subject to sanction .
Creating an EU coastguard will not solve this problem , and nor will it solve the problem of the lack of adequate resources for ship-sourced waste or the requirement for ships to use such resources .
In line with the positions of the Commission directive and with the traditional positions of the European Parliament , the proposal has enabled the European Parliament to fine-tune the initial text with two unanimously approved amendments that I consider to be highly relevant .
In this debate on the Herzog report on ‘the Green Paper on services of general interest’ , which was watered down by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , we reiterate the need to adopt proposals that acknowledge the importance of high-quality public services , which guarantee all citizens the right of access to these services whilst respecting the specific characteristics of each country .
I wish first of all , Commissioner , to congratulate you on this initiative and also on the broad criteria it contains .
It is
