are not ready .
Nonetheless , the von Boetticher report eventually rejects this initiative .
Further , it takes advantage of the opportunity to place financial aid to Turkey in the 'pre-accession ' heading .
I was unable to vote in favour , however , because the enlargement decided on at Copenhagen will not be implemented in an open and systematic manner .
Sadly also , the Convention has failed to make progress during that period .
For example , it will lose representation and its contributions will be increased .
There is a danger that the Europe we are committing ourselves to will be an enlarged Europe but not a strengthened one .
Mr President , I voted in favour of assent but abstained on the Brok report .
They will join us in the struggle for a political Europe able to speak with one strong voice in the world .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
The Union 's structures have not been adjusted to allow for smooth functioning with 25 Member States in the near future .
It will prove a catalyst for peace and stability and help raise the standard of living for Europeans .
It threatens the success of the whole enterprise , notably that of the CAP.
From now on we must demonstrate solidarity as we respond to continental challenges of this kind .
At the same time it prevents the free movement of people .
The new Member States understand solidarity quite differently .
All this was achieved in a few short years .
.
This is the strong political message the House is sending out to the Member States .
( FR ) I voted in favour of all the reports concerning the accession of the 10 new Member States .
I am voting against , but not against the Czech Republic itself .
Consequently any future increase in structural aid to the new countries would have to be at the expense of current Union policies .
( FR ) Legally , the Republic of Cyprus is in an impossible situation .
Mr President , I will now proceed with the fifth instalment of my speech .
In an interview with the Times , Peter Hain clearly stated that he is building an alliance with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe against any moves towards the creation of a European superstate .
The institutions of the European Union however prefer to subsidise their capitalist agricultural systems to ensure profits , rather than helping the poor people of Eastern Europe who work the land to make a living from their work .
In theory however , these should not be scheduled unless the agendas of the 12 normal sessions to be held in Strasbourg are full .
At the same time however , it is unbelievable that the number of extraordinary sessions remains unchanged .
It will allow a further spouse to enter and reside in a Member State if ' ?the best interests of a minor child so dictate ' .
The first is that we have a responsibility towards our electorate .
President-in-Office of the Council , a great deal of upset and confusion has built up recently within the European Union .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , two years after I had the honour of presenting a report on the same subject to Parliament , I am pleased to offer the Morillon report my whole-hearted support .
Over the last few weeks , the European Convention , chaired by Mr Giscard d'Estaing , has not arrived at a decision on the issue nor made its response known .
President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , let us forge ahead with this !
Lastly , this defence policy is nothing but a pipe dream because we cannot establish a defence policy without a common foreign policy .
This is of course the objective relentlessly pursued by all those who , for various different reasons , think that the concept of a ' Europe as a Power ' can be used to re-start the process of European integration that is in such a sorry state .
Following the war in Kosovo , yet another war is being waged , this time against Iraq , in violation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations .
Having two seats allows both to be expressed .
I have to say that if Europe does not wish to reinforce this monopoly , and if we in Europe want to be able to settle conflicts through effective and strong European diplomacy , we must establish a European defence architecture .
Previous speakers have also highlighted its comprehensive nature .
There are , in fact , two opposing visions of Europe .
In my last written question , I expressed great concern over the fact that the Council had not followed up this point .
We must be clear about this : all these people awaiting treatment will either not be treated or will be badly treated if tomorrow the European Parliament adopts a moralistic stance and prohibits , directly or indirectly , research into stem cells , embryos and germ gene therapy .
The first principle is that we must not take advantage of a draft directive , the need for which nobody would deny , in order to broaden its scope so as to include sectors which will have to have special regulations , or which have such regulations already .
In particular we support the amendments which seek to exclude from the scope of this directive tissues and cells originating from human embryos or genetic engineering , insofar as there is no European legislation defining the use of gene therapy .
It would be wrong to say that prohibiting the use of embryonic cells would prevent lives from being saved
