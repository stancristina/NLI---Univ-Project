Most important of all is the notion that in allocating these emission allowances we should adhere to the criteria whereby companies that have already attended to the matter of reducing their emissions are encouraged and rewarded .
We on the committee and in Parliament as a whole have enjoyed some quite excellent levels of cooperation .
I wish to thank both the rapporteur and the Commission in particular very much for this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are voting on the directive on emissions trading in Europe .
It will set cap-and-trade values for our energy-dominated industry that are to be reduced annually in accordance with the Kyoto targets .
The emissions market would , with all the natural efficiency of the free market , channel the reductions into those areas where the emissions are cheapest to cut .
Owing to the costs of making reductions in emissions , industrial competitiveness in EU countries will suffer in comparison with those countries that are outside the Kyoto agreement .
There is a very clear danger that instead of actual cuts in emissions we will end up with emission leakage on a global scale , when European installations move their operations to countries that have not submitted to the burden sharing agreement that is Kyoto .
The initial allocation must definitely be free of charge .
For example , in my country , Finland , there have already been voluntary cuts in carbon dioxide emissions for more than a decade . 85 % of industry and power plants have already concluded a voluntary energy saving agreement with the government .
Coal is not used in the steel industry to produce energy but as part of the production process .
The Commission 's proposal for a directive is more problematic for Finland than for many other countries .
The sectors of industry it covers account for a large proportion of emissions in Finland , larger than in other countries .
In other words the total allowance will be small .
In theory emissions trading is most advantageous for those whose own measures to reduce emissions are more expensive than buying emissions allowances from others .
Furthermore , it treats different Member States unfairly , depending on such matters as industrial structure and the structure of energy production as well as how much has already been done to reduce emissions .
We all agree about what our aim should be .
There has been a lot of criticism of the emissions trading scheme .
I hope that when we vote we will be able to improve the proposal by approving changes to it that will allow a less rigid opt-out practice and exclude carbon dioxide from raw materials from the calculation of allowances .
The problems associated with emissions trading apply to many industrial sectors throughout Europe .
Mr President , this is a report that is certainly of great importance .
Then it will be a question of real companies and real people 's jobs , real families ' livelihoods and genuine climatic change .
The Commission proposal , among other things , failed to answer the following questions .
Then , too , there are the issues of the massive transfers of income arising from cooperative action between different operators and states , enlargement , the EU shielding itself from attacks from third country operators or Soros-type speculators , and matters to do with legal protection , and access to justice .
In confusing these it serves its purpose poorly and needlessly puts a burden on the objective itself , which is to reduce emissions , regarding which European operators have until now been unanimous .
Uncommonly burdensome levels of bureaucracy accompanying the emissions trading scheme , bureaucracy that Parliament , regrettably , has not been willing to bear the responsibility for breaking down , promise additional difficulties .
Without my amendment the directive would not distinguish between carbon dioxide emissions that result from the use of coal for energy and its use as part of an industrial process .
Mr President , I want to express my reservations regarding the vote on the Moreira Da Silva report .
These amendments were only adopted with a very narrow margin , with a majority of only three votes in favour of auctioning .
I really regret this decision .
On Amendment No 99 , concerning the emissions of process-related coal products such as those used in the steel industry , I very much regret that this failed .
I do not really understand why you are now saying that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid .
We agreed this Pact for situations just like these : to make the work of politicians easier when there is a recession and it is difficult to balance public sector finances .
It is certainly no surprise for any Minister of Finance , and it cannot be a surprise for the Commission .
Booms are followed by recession .
These four Member States which are now in difficulties and which have promised their citizens something they cannot do are paying the price of not doing what they should have done when we had an economic boom .
When Commissioner Lamy , for example , condemned the Pact as being medieval he was evidently representing more the French Socialist Party rather than the Commission 's view on trade policy .
Mr President , Commissioner Vitorino , data processing and information transfer , and the assurance that these activities can be free from interference , are vitally important in today 's information society .
Examples might include data altered or destroyed by a virus in air traffic control systems or in files held by healthcare units such as the intensive care department of a hospital .
This could have fateful consequences for both individuals and large numbers of people .
That is why , ladies and gentlemen , our efforts
