Mr President , Commissioner , the harmonisation of social security systems would require harmonisation of the financing of social security , or , in practice , the harmonisation of taxation , not just with regard to its technical framework , but also its levels of taxation .
We all know that consensus has still not been reached on this as far as policy is concerned , and that that is not going to come about quickly .
The directive was supposed to have come from the Commission for a reading in the European Parliament in July , and now we have heard that it is probably being postponed until September .
In my opinion , it should be as clear as day that when we know a substance is dangerous , in no case should it be able to get into groundwater , as water , apart from anything else , is a very important resource for people in terms of health .
In many areas , for example , the community and industry have played their part relatively well .
Agriculture and forestry , however , are still problems , with their diffuse discharges .
Regarding consumers it is naturally important how consumption is controlled , and here charges and taxation are of prime importance .
Mr President , we know that traffic emissions are one of the greatest environmental problems we have and they have also proved to be one of the hardest to get rid of .
On the other hand , we have heard that the Kyoto Protocol does not contain provisions concerning air traffic emissions .
This is a regrettably slow process , but we have to be able to set objectives that are sufficiently ambitious in scope and create negotiating mandates to be able to make progress accordingly .
In my opinion it would not be a bad idea if the developed , industrialised countries , including the European Union , were to set an example in this matter .
We will have to have recourse to different acts , environmental taxes , charges and administrative measures , for example regulation of departure and arrival times , taking account of the fact that rail traffic exists alongside air traffic in areas where long distances are not a hindrance , and that must be developed .
For example , high speed trains , and , in some cases , short sea crossings offer a more environment-friendly alternative to short flights .
In Parliament we discussed several reports before the summer recess that aimed at improving the competitiveness of railways and sea transport .
It should be introduced in such a way that the charge would be less for the unavoidable long haul journeys than it would for short flights for which there is a more environment-friendly alternative .
I mean her original version .
The report gained the support of everyone in the committee .
For example , the time span for noise reduction is very long .
The citizens and companies of the Community must be able to have confidence in legislation , as continual shifting of the goalposts undermines long-term plans .
The resultant costs weaken the area ' s air transport competitiveness as compared with airlines outside the EU , and , at the same time , in fact , makes it harder to adopt environment-friendly technology in the airlines based within the EU.
On the contrary , this sort of action will constitute a burden on the environment , as materials will have to be produced and aircraft built before the economic lifetime of existent equipment is up .
Finally , I would like to remind everyone that increasing fuel tax in the air transport industry would bring with it an added burden for those who live in sparsely populated countries .
Mr President , Commissioner , my thanks go to Mr de Roo for the work he has done .
I am by no means acting as spokesman here for the tyre industry , but , having watched that industry very closely , I nevertheless wish to express my concern about the effect the amendments will have .
The tyre industry is a very fiercely competitive industry , and one that is competitive on a global scale .
The situation will become untenable , however , if there is an attempt to bring in changes too fast , as would seem to be the case on this occasion .
An adequate transition period , however , will guarantee that the new requirements are taken account of at the development stage .
It is not really just black and round , as the layman thinks .
On the other hand , a narrow tyre works well on snow .
If a tyre ' s noise properties were to be essentially improved it would above all impair its ability to hold the road in wet conditions .
I wish the tyre industry and the EU legislators would get together and draw up a realistic timetable for the excellent objectives outlined in this report .
It is a source of inspiration for millions and huge sums of money are involved in it .
Exercise is educationally important and vital for health .
To prevent these we need joint action on the part of the Union and a legal base for sport .
As we shape sports policy we have to take account of sport ' s various structures .
Finally , I would like to turn your attention to the need to improve levels of gender equality in sport and exercise .
There are two points of view , with no real great difference between them .
In either case it is being used as a tool , as something to use , and not as a living being with intrinsic value .
