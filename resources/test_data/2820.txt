the trans-European networks , consumer and health policy , research and education are suffering from drastic cutbacks in resources ?
The recommendation and report by Mr Takkula are astounding , but what does our proposal with the two amendments add ?
Its ideological arsenal rests on two pillars : on sanctifying capitalist barbarity , as the only way forward for the peoples , and on anti-communism , by reintroducing through the back door the 'memorandum ' equating fascism with communism .
As far as the amendment referring to the condemnation of Nazism and the dictatorships of Europe are concerned , we abstained from the vote , because it does not refer to the dictatorships of Spain , Portugal and Greece by name and is formulated such that socialist regimes could be interpreted as dictatorships .     – The restructuring of the institution of the European Capital of Culture comes within more general efforts to integrate and homogenise the cultural fabric of each country , in the aim of creating a single support for ' European culture ' which will contain a mixture of subculture , a folkloric presentation of national cultures and modern commercial constructs .
That is the ' European cultural model ' , which also operates as a source of massive profit for various companies .
The proposed amendment maintains the same character , transferring the cost to the Member States , strengthening supervision and control by the ΕU and calling on the people to pay at national level the businessmen and the cost of the EU policy to impose the European subculture and the 'values ' of capitalist barbarity .
Security , on the other hand , is linked to a unilateral determination of the final status of the borders , with maintaining the occupation of East Jerusalem , with the settlements on the West Bank and with the Wall of Shame .
The European Union is right to lay down terms and conditions for Hamas .
However , the telephone tapping scandal which has shaken my country is a scandal which concerns the tapping of the telephones of the prime minister , ministers and senior officers in the armed forces .
On the other hand , we are saying that the application of the Protocol is a condition for the commencement of negotiations on the relevant chapters on customs union .
This is a political criterion and we can see today that the army continues to play a leading role in the Turkish political system .     – Madam President , I should like to ask you how the Presidency is dealing with the grievances being expressed by Turkey and efforts to negotiate the completion of customs union in relation to the Cyprus problem .
It is not merely a question of the application of UN Security Council resolutions to Syria .
Second question , to which I would like you to reply clearly , because you replied to me indirectly : do you now agree that the Guantanamo base should be closed and , if you do agree , what measures will you take , as the Council , against the United States of America in order to persuade it to close the Guantanamo base ?     – Mr President , thank you very much for the information which you have given us , both today and in the Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament .
As you see , I have been waiting here for one and a half hours but , unfortunately , we are going for a written answer .     – Mr President , I shall focus on three points , because a great deal has been said with which I agree .
Second point : I should like us to focus our attention on those who have given us innovative treatments , innovative medication , inoculations and , in general , the knowledge to combat diseases and those who work with the sick – doctors , nurses and all health workers – and we must apply ourselves in this sector , to see where the gaps are , so that we can have adequacy in this sector .
With these three points , and agreeing with everything said by my honourable friends , I too should like to pay homage to the people who work with the sick and offer these excellent services .     – Mr President , I should like to start by emphasising that the way in which the Commission dealt with bird 'flu was methodical , controlled and efficient .
The intervention measures by the Commission and the national governments must be immediate and the market crisis must be addressed with the most effective economic and social measures for poultry farms and incubators .
I would highlight in particular the Commission 's point that permissible state aid also needed and needs to be given , at national level , to domestic poultry farmers and to poultry farms as small and medium-sized enterprises .
Mr President , Commissioner , if I may make a joke , if governments and the Commission delay in taking effective measures and interventions , bird 'flu will turn into worker 'flu .     – Mr President , the fight against corruption is indeed a fight for peace and democracy , a fight against poverty and a fight to consolidate civil society in developing countries ; relations between democracy and economic development in the developing countries have proven this and Amartya Sen, an important intellectual and winner of the Nobel prize in economic sciences , has confirmed it in his work better than anyone else .
It is truly amazing that , often both in the international community and in the European Union , the question of combating corruption has been a taboo .
However , no one spoke about what the role of corruption was in that failure
