to promote electronic commerce , for example , by creating the necessary legislative frameworks , will be in vain if these systems are not dependable .
According to the experts macro viruses already account for 80 % of all viruses .
The Commission proposal to prevent attacks against information systems and for the approximation of criminal law measures taken by Member States is thus a step in the right direction .
The European Parliament on many an occasion has called for such rules to be drawn up , and I would urge the Commission to commence drafting them immediately .
These are areas which , from the outset , medicinal products were intended to safeguard .
I genuinely hope that spirit will remain in this directive up until we have finally achieved a result .
Patients ' contributions also go down when they are put on medicines that are similar to , but cheaper than , the original ones .
These medicinal products are patent protected and in general expensive .
Experience in my country , Finland , and in many others has shown that practice with regard to prescribing medicines does not move sufficiently in the direction of cheaper alternative medicinal products or alternative imported products unless there is guidance in the shape of government action , in other words , legislation .
In addition , I should like to thank those of my colleagues responsible for tabling Amendment Nos 95 , which obliges manufacturers to guarantee an adequate supply of medicinal products to wholesalers .
Mr President , firstly I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the budget , Göran Färm and Per Stenmarck , for their thorough and constructive work .
The draft budget meets most of the demands of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
The draft budget now before us is also available in the form of an activity-based budget .
This has to do with the Commission 's administrative reform .
This entails a revision of the staff regulations , which Parliament is now debating .
The undoubted focus of the budget is enlargement .
The Committee on Budgets is proposing an extra EUR 699 million in pre-accession aid for the candidate countries to make it easier for them to face the challenges of membership .
For example , Parliament intends to lend the Commission EUR 43 million and the Council EUR 18 million .
In other words , levels of cooperation have been exemplary , and my sincerest thanks for that go especially to the rapporteur for the budget , Per Stenmarck .
Outstanding commitments now amount to around EUR 107 billion , or more than the EU 's total budget for one year .
Last year EUR 18 billion in payment appropriations remained unspent and the figure for the previous year was EUR 11 billion .
Despite this , though , the Council reduced the amount in payment appropriations that was proposed by the Commission .
With these comments we are prepared to give the draft budget our support .
That is the reason why someone in a very authoritative position said the Stability and Growth Pact was stupid .
That was the last job of the previous Parliament carried out for the present one .
Mr Prodi said of the Growth and Stability Pact that the reality that lies behind it is multi-layered and that the institutions should take this into consideration and act flexibly .
We all know , everyone in this House knows , that the budget is in that respect 'quasi-rigid ' . A ceiling was fixed in the Interinstitutional Agreement , regarding which the Council is unwilling to be flexible .
Parliament has had the onerous task of trying to fit new priorities that both Parliament and the Council think important under the 1999 ceiling .
Thus , there is money in this heading which everybody knows is not being spent .
I call the Interinstitutional Agreement stupid because of its inflexibility , and the same goes for the Council that is perpetuating this inflexibility .
The Swedish rapporteurs have done an excellent job .
He also said that either party could propose that this agreement should be reviewed after two years .
Nevertheless , on behalf of my own group , I should like to draw attention to the weaknesses of the arrangement right from the start .
This must mean that the European Parliament would be guaranteed an absolute right to inspect secret documents on security and defence policy , but I wish to raise the question as to whether this will in fact be the case .
In many respects it seems that the wishes and requirements of NATO have dictated the content of this agreement to a considerable degree .
Sometimes I feel that when this agreement was negotiated it was thought that these matters were no business of the public , but that Parliament 's small , handpicked team would assume full responsibility for them .
Neither can the right of the Members of the European Parliament to obtain information concerning foreign and security policy , a right that is already guaranteed to them by virtue of Article 21 of the Treaty , be weakened by this agreement .
Finally , it is extremely important to stress that , should confidential information contain any reference to some sort of criminal activity , nothing must be allowed to prevent a Member of the European Parliament from contacting the authorities .
I would like to know why there has been no mention of these security rules on our agenda .
Parliament cannot therefore grant discharge without justification .
Granting discharge means that the information received and obtained by Parliament indicates that the Commission has functioned properly .
The report proposes that a deadline be given for discharge .
One problem is refusal to grant discharge .
