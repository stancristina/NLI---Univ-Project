to describe the possible results of the incorporation of Schengen into the EU.
This means that it is not necessary to show one&#x02BC ;s passport when crossing between the Scandinavian countries .
This will mean tougher asylum policies for many Member States .
We have been able to maintain control over narcotics and we have been able to conduct different refugee policies and that is what we wanted .
It is perfectly possible .
The discussion is concerned with whether the introduction of a common currency , according to the Statutes of the Maastricht Treaty , will mean a fundamental change in the EU from a cooperation organisation to an organisation with State-like features .
I would just like this said so that we do not believe that he has poor judgement .
On the issue of the fight against narcotics , I consider what has been said to be positive as are the actions to be taken against synthetic drugs .
But this is only part of it .
Let us also work towards this within the Council .
My fellow committee members have already explained the technical details .
This feeling is hanging in the air the whole time .
It is research which is needed to renew energy sources and for the development of IT.
What we do not support , on the other hand , is research concerning fusion .
Madam President , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a very good piece of work .
One way of facilitating movement and strengthening rail transport in Europe is the directive which the Commission has put forward and which is aimed at strengthening rail transport .
It has resulted in greater effectiveness .
It is important that we have strong railway operators in Europe if , as the rapporteur said earlier , they are to be able to compete with other means of transport .
This is one of the most common misconceptions about the internal market .
In the first place the different tax rates are not discriminatory , i .e . they affect domestic and foreign production equally .
In Sweden we have high taxes .
I have often asked myself what is the reason behind this "fetish for harmonisation ' .
They do not want a Commission to interfere in this for the sake of an abstract principle .
Whether it is also a matter of urgency is a question I have not involved myself with in any way .
It is therefore reasonable to introduce this kind of tax .
I must , however , also add that there is very little about this in the various programmes , particularly in the fourth framework programme .
If the Commission were to take this seriously , the costs of medical care could likewise be reduced in the future .
We have fought on behalf of the EU by pointing out the circumstances to the President of Belarus , but the President goes on as before , just the same .
Because , quite clearly , more vigorous measures are needed than simply talking to the President .
It is , of course , surprising - to say the least - that a real right-wing politician from Turkey has been able to mislead experienced politicians without bringing in any real changes or reliable guarantees on human rights , and that these experienced politicians , without waiting for the Turkish elections , agreed to a customs union .
My second question is : Would we have been just as keen to enter into a customs union if the Commissioner had known then what we know today about human rights ?
I interpreted the very last part of the answer as meaning that Sweden must accept the agreement which it signed , which is self-evident , since we have no derogation , but also , on the basis of the answer , that it means in reality that more decisions are being slowly transferred from unanimous to qualified majority vote .
Seventy per cent of the Swedish people insist that this neutrality be preserved .
There are thus very considerable human and financial resources at stake for us .
Does this mean that we will be able to retain the present restrictions or is it a matter of a gradual reduction of these restrictions , and - if so - over how long a period ?
At the same time we know that there is a clear and unambiguous connection between alcohol consumption and a number of illnesses such as liver disorders , stroke , certain forms of cancer , etc .
Is not the question of alcohol one of human health which , in all respects , affects people&#x02BC ;s lives and health ?
Two questions to Commissioner Monti : Does Commissioner Monti acknowledge that the attack which is now being made on the actual working of Swedish alcohol policy has its roots in the fact that alcohol consumption has fallen in several large EU countries and that the alcohol producers have an interest in gaining access to the low alcohol consumption market which Sweden represents ?
My question , too , concerns the importation of alcohol .
Does the Commissioner share this understanding ?
Another reason is the greenhouse effect which can affect arable land .
By the year 2000 chemical agents will continue to exceed the limit value in 65 % of the subsoil water in the EU , and the emission of carbon dioxide will be 5-10 % higher than in 1990 .
What , then , does the highest authority , the Commissioner , do ?
This leads inevitably to a sensitive question .
It is just that we are disappointed , very disappointed .
If you are not prepared today to accept our amendments and those of the Environment Committee and wish to change your tactics , we must ask that you leave this position and that Denmark sends us one of its many good environmental politicians as a new environmental Commissioner
