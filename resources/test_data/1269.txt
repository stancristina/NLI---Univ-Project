It is necessary and urgent to adopt this regulation without excessively extending the time limits .
Ivory Coast is a country at civil war which we must help so that it can achieve peace and economic progress .
I hope it will also be approved unanimously in this House .
It is an absolute priority to dedicate funds to research programmes aimed at finding a solution to this disease , in all the Member States .
I would say simply , in summary , that this World Summit has served to promote much more intensive action within the European institutions and also , obviously , to stimulate debate before the next World Summit takes place and to assess the issues raised here .     Mr President , the situation which has inspired this Resolution today demonstrates that human rights and respect for life , as higher values , are never entirely enjoyed and we democrats throughout the world must be alert at all times .
Today my group will vote in favour of this Resolution .     Mr President , I would also like to express my gratitude for the countless expressions of friendship and solidarity I have received from practically every part of the world , from all the institutions – and I note that the Vice-President of the Commission , Mrs de Palacio , is here – and from many many Members of this House , from all the political groups without exception , following the delivery of the package from Bologna .
He can check all the records of this House and if he finds even one word praising terrorists in my speeches , he should say so .
But first of all I would like to point out that once again we must wait for the conclusions of the investigation in order to know exactly under what circumstances it took place .
Nevertheless , the States retain the possibility of checking that third-country aircraft arriving in their territory respect these rules .
The Commission is aware of the shortcomings in the current organisation of the inspection system for aircraft .
Nevertheless , the British initiative to publish a list of companies which may not enter British air space demonstrates that , in any event , transparency is not only possible but that it is going to happen .
This dramatic issue , Mr President , however , is not the only element which is going to lead to controversy and concern with regard to safety issues amongst the public in the civil aviation sector , since over Christmas we have all been aware of issues relating to suspensions of flights from European countries to the United States , with the corresponding problems and difficulties faced by all those passengers who had planned to take those flights .
Although the justification for the cancellation of , for example , Air France and British Airways flights is not demonstrated , however , we must always be cautious in the face of terrorist threats and it is better to be overcautious than to be faced with an attack .
I would like to say finally that safety issues for preventing problems relating to terrorism in the civil aviation sector must be dealt with from the point of view of seeking the greatest possible safeguards and security for passengers and citizens .
When we adopt this legislation on third-country aircraft , we will be taking an extremely important step forward .
The next point which has arisen is the transfer of passenger data to the United States .
We have reached an agreement – amongst other things , thanks to this Parliament , let us make this very clear – which in the end includes a series of guarantees which the European Union was demanding – a reduction in the amount of data , the type of data , a restriction in terms of the objective for which they will be used , a restriction of the time for which they can be used , in other words , all the elements which the honourable Members are perfectly aware of – which means that we can say that , by means of this agreement , the fundamental rights which our legislation affords our citizens are guaranteed , also in terms of the way the United States uses the information , while at the same time we are helping and cooperating in the improvement of safety in the air sector and the fight against international terrorism .
I would like to remind the honourable Members that , in December 1999 , we faced the accident , a tragedy which you are all well aware of ; then we had the accident .
Secondly , to guarantee that the people responsible for illegal dumping – not just captains and ship owners , but also charterers and classification societies , which in some cases be responsible for these actions – may be prosecuted and also be subject to penalties in certain circumstances .
The Council has not yet laid out its position in this regard , but I have heard the doubts of the majority of ministers , who are not convinced that we should continue along this route .
Twelve years after the adoption of the current regulation , it is urgent – in accordance with our experiences and within the context of the imminent enlargement of our Community fleet – to update the oldest text of our acquis in the field of maritime safety .
Mr President , with these two packages of measures , we are taking a final step in improving and strengthening maritime safety within the European Union , an area in which I believe we have made considerable progress during this legislature .
But I am concerned that it may become generally accepted that by resolving the issue of illegal discharges we are
