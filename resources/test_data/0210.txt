Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary matters .
It is crucial , however , at least at this final stage of the process , to ensure a minimum of objectivity , transparency , and respect for the candidate countries and that an end is put to the tight-fisted policy of providing limited means , which has dogged the enlargement process from the very beginning .
Firstly , we believe it to be technically wrong and politically surprising that the same legislative text covers both unquestionably dangerous products and cement .
Mr President , it is with indignation and sorrow that I rise to speak on the proclaimed death of an industry - the fishing industry - which has been and should continue to be of economic importance to my country .
These people have been denied the right to fish and to work , and although they have been compensated with support measures for fleet conversion and for individual premiums , they have come up against Community legislation that is quite inflexible , inappropriate and whose implementation involves difficulties that are almost impossible to resolve .
This is an erroneous assumption , however , because although in some cases shipowners do actually manage to send their vessels to fish in other fishing grounds , they are only able to make a partial profit , or to provide a partial alternative to what they had previously in the Moroccan fishing grounds .
This refit of the vessels entailed increased costs , which were borne by the shipowners .
I must also say that before I came to this debate today I looked at the latest data on the utilisation of this budget line , with which the Commission regularly provides us , and I discovered that , apart from initial advance payments , no interim payments have yet been recorded .
We would find it extremely regrettable if we were to face yet another blatant case of budgetary underutilisation , of the inability of the European institutions to respond to a real need .
Nevertheless , and with all the friendship , consideration and respect that I have for them , I must highlight two aspects of this matter that I believe are crucial .
One only has to bear in mind the disappointing results achieved in my country in this field to understand the need not to make the same mistakes .
We can therefore only praise the Commission 's efforts intended to improve the criminal-law protection of the Community 's financial interests and particularly to create a European Prosecutor .
( PT ) I have welcomed and supported this outcome of the conciliation process .
.
My fear is that this will also happen with this regulation .
My reservations centred on the second amendment to the Directive , on the use of hexavalent chromium ( or chromium VI ) in cement and in cement preparations .
( PT ) Our commitment to combating transmissible diseases , with particular focus on poverty-related diseases , such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , and on improving vaccination and healthcare levels by the more developed countries funding health programmes , by removing barriers of access ( licences and patents ) to pharmaceutical products faced by developing countries and the barriers faced by international partnerships in developing new generations of products is crucial .

( PT ) I have voted in favour of this report .
( PT ) This Resolution assumes the need to refocus the Lisbon Strategy in order to ensure that the Member States and candidate countries attain their objectives by 2010 and I support this assumption .
Fourth : to guarantee environmental protection associated with job creation , by investing in clean technologies and by launching environmental actions .
I therefore feel that both the European Commission and the Member States must ensure that , before the 2004 Spring Summit , three objectives are fulfilled : first of all , extending the list of structural indicators that serves as a basis for evaluating the performance of Member States , including new environmental indicators that evaluate the European situation in areas such as water resources , biodiversity , soil degradation , chemical pollution and food safety .
Mr President , the positions I have adopted on today 's votes on the crisis over Iraq have all been underpinned by an undeniable principle of solidarity .
To those who , albeit entirely legitimately , are solely concerned with the humanitarian consequences of an armed conflict - and we are all concerned - I would say that we are opposing the harsh reality of the Iraqi people , who for decades have been subjected to a continual and silent ethnic cleansing and to the devastating consequences of a despotic , cruel and unpredictable dictatorship .
Consequently , so little remained that it would be preferable to maintain the position adopted on 30 January , in which the majority of Members of the European Parliament affirmed their commitment to the United Nations ' remaining at the centre of the world order and roundly condemned a unilateral war .
The problem is extremely serious and complex and cannot be resolved either through demagogy , or through Member States passing the buck to one another .
.
Although we understand the importance of these substances in controlling pests , the fact is that alternatives do exist , particularly in organic farming .
I also disagree with the references made to including GMOs in this provision , whereas , due to their special nature , they should instead be addressed separately .
The attempt to absorb the functions of the Member States put forward in the report , invoking the needs for effectiveness and on the pretext of combating financial crime , is , in my opinion , yet another obstinate federalist assault , which rejects other accessible and effective solutions and discounts the crucial and irreplaceable role of the States as conduits for European integration and privileged implementers of the law .
