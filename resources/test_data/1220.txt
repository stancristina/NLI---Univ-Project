, as well as job-seekers , students on placement and other students , experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement .
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists , I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection .
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter .
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are , as such , a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome .
In this context , Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society , which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999 .
Ever since the early nineties , the European Parliament , the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired , especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies .
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy .
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me : If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union , we would not need your development aid at all .
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes .
This is also at the request of the citizens .
Article 177 specifies these objectives as " sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries , and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them " , the " smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries " .
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner , without any backhandedness .
The general interest of policy coherence is , therefore , a responsibility of the Commission as a whole , of the Council , and of the European Parliament .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if our neighbour ' s roof is leaking , we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water , but it is , of course , more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof .
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally ?
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission , and not by the Commission on its own .
In most countries where the Commission is active , development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves .
Every year , I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund , that they are far behind in spending the funds .
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields .
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report .
In fact , does the European Union have a human rights policy ?
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter , but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists .
For the sake of our credibility , we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world .
It seems contradictory .
First of all , the policy comes too late .
The impression that Africans get , namely that they are inferior world citizens , is not unfounded .
There is a need for more coordination , more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided .
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President .
Surely thousands of people killed , thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough .
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch , even by Europe .
This is an extremely risky strategy .
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars .
The former President , Mr Gligorov , can take special credit for this , and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens , so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans .
The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia , which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia ' s neighbouring states all the more .
Mr President , the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it .
This applies to them and us .
Against this background of extremely high expectations , I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step , namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia , is vitally important .
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Balkans are not purely a dark cave , politically speaking .
In brief , the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia : to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans .
