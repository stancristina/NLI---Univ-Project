I have never shared the opinion that workers should be content with their leaders when these call themselves Socialists or Communists .
No, this time round , it is about the protection of invested capital .
The way in which we are going about this , though , with this plethora of amendments and technical appendices , is not an approach that appeals to me , nor do I believe that we will thereby achieve better regulation .
We do not care how this is done .
Commissioner McCreevy said a moment ago that he ‘intends to launch a study in the near future’ , but we agreed that a report will be on the table before the end of 2006 , and I also hope to have his word that that will be done ; we would like to exchange views on this matter in this House too .
In actual fact , it referred to the executive committees where legislation of all kinds drafted in this House is implemented behind closed doors .
Mr President , I would like to thank both rapporteurs , whose report I have read with much interest .
I am therefore a little surprised at Mrs Fraga’s disapproval of the fishermen’s and the EU’s contributions increasing .
I have a few questions .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to thank the rapporteur , who has done an excellent job .
This afternoon , this House will be voting on the proposal for a directive concerning minimum standards in the Member States for granting or withdrawing refugee status .
There is one area that remains difficult for us , namely the concept of the supersafe countries , but I would be very surprised if a majority were to be found for that this afternoon .
I fear that Lampedusa is no exception .
Moreover , there are insufficient guarantees in the directive to accompany the accelerated procedure .
This reception must , contrary to what has been repeated here , be done in closed and very strictly controlled centres ; only those who , following a strict and proper examination , are recognised as refugees can then be received in third countries , possibly also within the European Union .
This report has , in fact , one goal and one goal only , and that is to undermine the very principle of the list of safe countries .
This draft directive is disturbing and is the ultimate proof that the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers are playing their own games and refusing to consult with the European Parliament .
They went against the spirit of the Treaties in concluding what I believe to be an ill-considered political agreement without consulting the European Parliament .
As Commissioner Hübner has already said , territorial cohesion is under pressure , and she was actually asking for this Parliament’s support .
On a final note , there are , fortunately , regions developing that often take on cross-border tasks in a new context .
So turkeys may be able to vote for Christmas after all .
The same applies to legislation .
Commissioner Kallas stated very clearly in two speeches , one in Nottingham and one in Berlin , that money that is allocated via agriculture , among others , is the taxpayers ’ money and that citizens ought to know where it ends up .
The Commission has opted for a small area of application , namely international rail traffic , and a strict package of requirements , while Parliament has slightly altered this balance , in that it opted for a large area of application , that is to say rights for all rail passengers , as is the case in aviation in fact , and has adapted the strict basic requirements to allow more room for manoeuvre for railway undertakings , regional authorities or local authorities .
The same applies to tickets , except that in this case , a distinction needs to be drawn – and we make this quite clear – between a public service , where tickets have to be made available to a wide public , and commercial , specialist services , where , to my mind , far fewer resources can be used , such as the Internet only , which has happened in some cases , and which could bring the cost down .
One difficult chapter that attracted amendments by a very large number of Members was the chapter on people with reduced mobility .
There is an enormous legacy from the past , shall I say , resting on the shoulders of the railway undertakings , but they must slowly but surely be encouraged to make improvements .
On a final note , I would like to say to the Council , as did the two previous speakers , that this is a package .
Only in Germany are European ticket sales and the provision of information top-notch , and only the cross-border high-speed line between Brussels and Paris is busy .
This proposal is a missed opportunity for improving conditions for international passengers and for putting a stop to worsening trends .
Secondly , the training of rail staff should also give attention to that aspect of the job .
I would give you the example of Belgium , where the number of passengers in 2003 rose by 7 % and in 2004 by 6 % , and the latest figures are also promising .
The certification of train drivers is desperately needed and the abandonment of the quality requirements for freight transport will not create any problems , since that sector is quite capable of organising these things for itself .
When should Turkey recognise all Member States ?
It stipulates that the recognition of Cyprus is not negotiable .
We should at the very least press the UN to send someone out there to talk to both parties .
That is
