In the Conference of Presidents , I saw fit to argue that there should be no resolution , my justification for this being that we should wait to see what comes back from the delegation before drafting one .
Mr President , although I think the process of bringing the resolution on human rights in the Western Sahara into being was such a difficult one that everyone involved in it must be rather exhaustedI am glad that this House has resisted Moroccan pressure , and that the plenary has , today , resolved almost unanimously that this item should remain on the order of business rather than being deleted from it , which is what the Conference of Presidents decided yesterday .
It is monstrous that the threat should be made that it might not be allowed to do so .
So let it be said loud and clear that , in this area , there are two opposites : human rights and open and fair partnership on the one hand , and colonialism in whatever shape or form on the other .     .
At a time like this and in a context such as this , we owe it to ourselves to defend our values .
Madam President , this report touches on many issues of social policy , and it is to be hoped that the business sector will take these fine principles on board far more than it has previously and will actually put them into practice .
If we want to look forwards and compete – as we must – then there must be reforms , but we must , at the same time , find innovative ways of responding to social challenges .
The Commission communication that we are discussing today sets out the things that the Community can do to make the globalisation process fairer for everyone , and , with that in mind , I would like to draw the House’s attention to a negotiating mandate for the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle , which expressed the EU’s desire for a conference at ministerial level on the subjects of trade , employment and core labour standards .
I also recall the problems to which Mr Belet has just referred .
The resolution is a very good basis on which to do that , and I urge the Commission to take it seriously if it really does want to accomplish the changeover in the next few years .
I am sure this issue will be with us for many more years to come and even if this is resolved , another one will come up .
That is most particularly the case where the use of quotas is concerned .     .
Unless I am misinformed , there were meetings of the Member States and the Commission in October 2004 and April 2005 , at which it became evident that its provisions relating to social security and labour law were the source of the most problems .
I will also be ascertaining , in an hour’s time , whether taxis are again being allowed to drive in .
The Court is able to report , and for the first time , that the efforts by the Commission and the Member States in connection with the introduction of the Integrated Administration and Control System – abbreviated to ‘IACS’ – which covers 59 % of agricultural expenditure , have had a positive effect .
The Court did , however , uncover weaknesses at national level in the systems of the implementing organisations in Bulgaria , Romania , Turkey and other Sapard countries .
The Court welcomes this initiative on the part of the Commission for a roadmap .
Do that , and you really will be doing Europe a service .
Speaking , among other things , as a Member of the Committee on Budgets , let me say quite plainly that we need to denounce the attitude they adopt , of not wanting to pay anything into the EU , of wanting their own countries to get as much back as possible out of it , while not wanting to let anyone in Brussels see what is going on .
International comparisons show us in a very good light .
Something else you referred to , Mr President of the Commission , was the energy issue .
What I would like to see is for you , on behalf of the Commission , to produce a report next year on progress with enlargement – which is a topic to which I should like to return , although I would perhaps attach another meaning to it .
On the contrary , the big issue for the politics of united Europe must always be about how we can get Europe to the top .
Great though this is , if we are to remain successful , it must point us all in one single direction , and , as the question is what that will be , we , as Europe’s legislators , are under an obligation to come up with comprehensible , reliable and prompt answers .
At the same time , though , we cannot fail to note that you are withdrawing proposals for legislation that matter a great deal to us , although we have to admit that there are problems with them , for example the statute on companies established on a mutual basis , and European law on voluntary associations .
Do we really need a European Green Paper on the rights of married and unmarried couples , such as the one that is planned ?
I voted in favour of it .
I also wish to thank Mr Nassauer , the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and an advocate of competitiveness and innovation as goals for policy , who was equally open to reasonable compromise , and Mrs
