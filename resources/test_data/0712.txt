Otherwise , even with the planned 10 % increase on the upper limit , the draft regulation would , in those cases , essentially serve the purpose of - covertly and only partially - remedying the errors made .
The situation in Afghanistan is tragic and we must continue to help the country in the knowledge that there is a universal need for sovereignty and that there must be an end to war in the region .
We call for guarantees of fair trials for all accused persons , whatever the offence they are being charged with .
We call for respect for international conventions .
However , as Commissioner Patten said , the path is still very tortuous .
However , as he is quite aware , it is very often the case that Parliament produces good resolutions but there is a problem afterwards , and that problem is the Council .
It is we who have a problem , and the problem is that a number of countries are at war : in Vietnam , there is currently a Vietnam war against democracy and freedom , there is currently a war being waged in China against democracy and freedom , there is currently a war being waged in Laos against democracy and freedom .
This would eliminate all the European bureaucracy and , therefore , fraud as well , all the disgraceful wastage of our and taxpayers ' money .
It should come as no surprise that there are differences of opinion regarding a European agency which manages financial aid for south-east Europe , and so the calls for promotion of adequate investigation of any suspicion of mismanagement and/or corruption , in particular those related to investments in the energy sector , are understandable .
The Commission had promised Parliament that it would produce a report , although this is not yet available .
However , there is more to citizenship than that : in a way , it confirms the citizens ' place in this European dimension , which they must feel both contributors to and responsible for at this time of great impetus and dynamism .
If we do not succeed in doing this , however many conventions we produce we will never manage to build Europe , especially when one country - I am referring to Ireland but there may be many others , including my own - has refused to recognise , to sign and to ratify the Nice Treaty and when three Member States have refused to share our experience with the single currency .
As regards these areas of cooperation , innovative proposals are also included relating to the involvement of the different groups of long-term legal immigrants .
Just recently , we read in the press that some Member States appear to be claiming regulation in this field as part of their own national competence .
As regards the need to ensure that the Member States have the possibility of exemption from the directive in the event of an emergency , there is a specific amendment providing this loophole with due regard for subsidiarity and for specific environmental conditions or crises .
This is to make it possible for the citizens to defend any grounds they may have for dissent throughout the judgment process and uphold an opinion which is different from that of the competent authority .
We are certainly following the approach called for at Feira , but I have heard some speakers , including a colleague from my group , mention illiteracy .
If we want high-quality teaching , we must take steps to establish a common basic curriculum and review all the European education systems .
As regards training , then , the individual States must strengthen these national agreements on training , working together with local communities , businesses , firms and all those who invest in the training of the young and not so young .
Madam President , Mrs Guti√©rrez-Cortines ' excellent report is a milestone , for this is the first report tabled before Parliament to be so comprehensive and well-structured .
I am afraid I must point out , on the basis of this analysis , that much of the research funded was then subcontracted precisely to university researchers for its implementation .
In the eighteenth century , the whole of Europe flocked to Prussia , not because Prussia had an efficient state capable of running universities but , above all , because there was a great teacher named Immanuel Kant .
This is a very serious issue , which requires a more general response .
We are dealing with a so-called moderate regime , Egypt , as a way of hiding all our shame and cowardice .
There have been hundreds of victims in recent months already , and they represent a small , silent , tragic holocaust .
Mr President , it is thanks to the reform of the Rules of Procedure that we are here today discussing a text which - as has happened on many , too many occasions in Parliament - will be adopted by the Council in a different form from that in which it was submitted , while we are denied the chance to debate the European Union 's proposals on terrorism , which are much more important in terms of the rights and freedoms of the European citizens than the document we are now compelled to debate .
Such aspects , relating to investigations and criminal procedure , are in many cases codified in detail at national level as part of the Member States ' legal codes or even their constitutions so as to be able to determine the rights and duties of the parties involved .
Mr President , my impression - derived from item 1 as a whole - is that this report makes the serious mistake of confusing the sacrosanct principle of the right of asylum , which has been
