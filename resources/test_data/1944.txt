Malmstr√∂m , had prevailed , we should not have had the SWIFT Agreement .
Mr Zapatero , I am grateful that , as President-in-Office of the Council , you have clearly said here that you support the Commission .
This was absolutely the correct approach in the crisis .
A jobs and growth strategy aiming for success must be based on the Community method .
I shall only say it is a pity that Ghana has been eliminated .
Where today is Europe speaking about investment ?
You , too , should say something about that , and not just praise it to the skies , since that is simply not the truth .
It was impossible to demand concessions from the United States , let alone for the European Parliament to have any influence over the Council .
I believe that , with reference to the changes that the Treaty of Lisbon has set out , we have shown what form they can take , and that , together with the Commission and the Council , we have been aware of our responsibility to present a sensible solution .
Both the European Court of Human Rights and the national constitutional courts , as well as the Data Protection Officers , have ruled that the fundamental mechanisms provided for in the agreement are in breach of the law .
Many questions remain open and in need of answers .
We must carry on further along this road .
With this agreement , it will now also be possible for Switzerland and Liechtenstein to secure closer coordination of controls and supervision at the external borders between the relevant domestic agencies and those of the EU.
The regions on the Baltic Sea that are already cooperating with one another but , in particular , the Member States , are now being urged to put this strategy into practice .
This is an unsustainable situation .
I am therefore in favour of promoting the status of internships .
I therefore support Mrs Gruny 's report .
However , in light of this , the report fails to mention the political steps required to grant the relevant employees rights in their position , such as pension rights or rights to representation .
It also specifically mentions imbalances .
Mr President , in the wake of the measures proposed by the Commission in recent weeks for averting imminent crises , involving the euro rescue package and the Europe 2020 strategy , which entail rescuing the banks , on the one hand , and cuts in social security , salaries and pensions , on the other , we now have proposals on the table for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact .
I am aware that the Council is currently attending the swearing-in ceremony , giving it a good excuse for its absence .
The key point remains : if a real financial crisis breaks out , who declares the emergency ?
If there are power games being played at national level merely as to who decides what , this is of little interest to citizens .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have the responsibility in this European Parliament to regulate the financial markets firmly .
It is a pity therefore that my fellow Members are no longer present .
The financial stabilisation mechanism illustrates the urgency of financial market reforms .
We support this compromise as it takes us further in the right direction .
Today , we have the opportunity to bring in a law which will improve this situation from which we are starting .
It is certainly worth noting .
We have enough transitional periods , but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is false .
( Applause ) Europe is in a state of social imbalance .
Exactly the opposite is the case .
I see this also as a signal to the citizens of Belgium to place much greater value on multilingualism , which forms the foundation on which their country can develop in strength and in harmony .
We are facing a very wide variety of divides and challenges and I believe that we should not deceive ourselves about the seriousness of the situation .
There is only one thing which I would like to say .
The measure to pay out only part of the bonuses should create an incentive to sustainable economic activity and prevent irresponsible risky transactions .
With this second draft of the novel foods regulation , uniform rules on placing novel foods on the market in the EU will now finally be adopted .
I have made some subsequent changes to my vote because Mrs Ayuso , the rapporteur , included her own opinion in the voting list and not the majority opinion of the group , as agreed .
However , this must not lead to salary levels being set by politicians .
Long before the financial crisis , warnings were given that the vision of unrestricted liberalism in the financial sector was highly risky .
I am opposed to this , which is why I have voted against this resolution .
We have also succeeded in the course of these difficult negotiations in guaranteeing that the powers and assignments will not be changed in such a way that what is represented by established Community law and comes under the control and the decision-making authority of the community of Europe turns into intergovernmentalism and renationalisation .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality put the emphasis on the question of equality of the sexes among the staff of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) .
They should get rid of their red lines , because this is not what it is all about .
