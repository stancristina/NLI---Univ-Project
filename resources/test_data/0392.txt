President , many Europeans were awaiting this report to see when the hard core , the driving force which the Commission is supposed to be , will finally begin to function at a certain amount of speed .
The current legal framework is incoherent and incomplete .
We want a Commission which is strong and independent .
I have noticed that , amongst the 90 recommendations of the Independent Experts , some describe an Anglo-Saxon style administration , where more responsibility falls to managers .
Mr President , we are debating a report of around 200 pages which contains an exhaustive analysis of the structural operation of the Commission ' s departments , and yet we have had only 48 hours in which to read it and give it our consideration .
As spokesperson for the Socialist Group on the Committee on Development and Cooperation , I would like to make a few observations regarding the idea put forward in this report on the future functioning of the Commission .
Both Joan Colom and Mrs Theato mentioned this .
I am sure that you will all agree with me in confirming the importance of this Community framework for cooperation with which we are trying to back up and finalise the work of the Member States in the field of accidental marine contamination , in order to make it more efficient .
Amendment No 22 , in the Commission ' s opinion , does not conform to the recent decision on the amount of time spent in committee .
Why has the Commission considered that in this specific case , it was better to present a recommendation rather than a directive ?
Thirdly , because in this case , it concerns a measure within a programme which does not exclude the possibility of presenting it as a directive in the future if the recommendation proves insufficient .
The other Member States are against it .
Try it .
We have never asked to see Mr Prodi' s party membership card in order to vote him into such a high post .
By offering him our trust , we are establishing an umbilical cord which completes the legitimacy of the Commission as the responsible executive in democratic terms .
Meanwhile , we have to negotiate a framework agreement which forms a solid basis for the improvement of our institutional relationships , with measures relating to transparency and information , such as obtaining the working documents of the Council , the Minutes of the meetings of the College of Commissioners , except when confidentiality has been agreed , or an information system on the work of OLAF which would take into account the necessary discretion .
With a good framework agreement , the question of individual condemnation of Commissioners will be put on the correct footing : that of the public political commitment of President Prodi and all the candidates to this Parliament .
We await the Commission ' s proposal for reform which you have announced and which Vice-President Kinnock is due to present in February .
And as the coda to these hearings , in my judgement , Mr Prodi has shown signs of political good sense and courage in the speech which he has just made .
State here that the Committee of Inquiry on flax of the Congress of Deputies has already approved its conclusions .
You have even spoken of religions .
I appreciate your active sensitivity with regard to East Timor and also with regard to the Mediterranean area .
The fishing policy , Mr Prodi , is also an effective tool with regard to the organisation of European territory and the correction of the disparities which still exist in Europe today .
( ES ) We have not organised a debate on this matter .
In this respect , for example , we must respect the Commission ' s right to initiative .
We have not heard you speak about fishing and , nevertheless , you must be aware that thousands and thousands of fishermen depend on it , thousands and thousands of families , thousands of secondary businesses and businesses involved in the processing of products which are necessary in the European Union , employment which is furthermore located in European regions and territories which are highly dependent on fishing .
Secondly , I would like to remind you that Mr Fischler granted us the written mandate for the negotiation of the crucial fishing agreement with Morocco , which is a matter of extreme urgency , so that this Parliament can continue to maintain the budgetary reserve of the item agreed by the Council and that your Commission , Mr Prodi , will not be responsible for the fact that there is no finance for this agreement in the future .
But I believe that we must go further .
Are you , Mr Prodi , ready to include those measures which will be dealt with in Helsinki ?
Well , because I believe that what Europe needs are three things that in my language begin with "i " : ideas ( ideas ) , ilusi√≥n ( aspiration ) and impulso ( motivation ) .
What was it that you said today : " the Commission and Parliament will co-operate " ?
I said that we have decided to support the investiture of the new Commission despite the reservations which we have in relation to Mrs de Palacio , whose innocence we accept , but whose idea of political responsibility in a matter which concerns the Community budget we do not share .
I would like this to be recorded in the Minutes .
The Commission , for its part , totally shares this approach , and will firmly commit itself to the process of drawing up the Charter and , of course , Mrs Halonen , we will communicate to the next Commission your invitation to the Commission to make specific proposals in this regard .
