We have in our own group two ethnic Members of the Conservative delegation who are extremely active and proud to be British Conservatives , in spite of what the other groups were saying earlier , and they will be voting against these measures .
The shift of the burden of proof , as called for by this draft directive , is both frightening and extreme .
Already in the UK, Mr Straw is planning that in rape cases the accused man will become guilty until proven innocent , on the basis of the testimony of one person - the woman in question .
This is a very dangerous precedent against all forms of natural justice .
Of course , we all condemn violent racist crimes and attacks .
I was not present , but I believe a number of allegations were made and cases cited by other groups earlier in the debate .
Criminal justice must remain the prerogative of the Member States .
Unlike previous speakers who have cited such cases , I oppose any erosion of national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice .
This must remain the prerogative of the Member States who will retain control of their own justice systems .
The EU has no competence in this area whatsoever .
The more the word 'racist ' is bandied about , the more it will become meaningless , devalued and ignored by the public at large .
I call on all those with any sense to oppose these measures .
Mr President , we must not forget that the RUF is a vicious and brutal grouping .
We should congratulate the British Government on taking effective action in a peace-keeping capacity .
This is exactly the rapid reaction we are asking for within the European Union .
I find Mr Markov' s remarks , in particular , slightly bizarre because we constantly need rapid-reaction forces to move in to preserve peace and prevent humanitarian disaster - exactly what has happened here .
Clearly , we also realise that peace keeping can only be carried out by the operation of effective force .
That is a lesson we have to learn if we are to have a rapid-reaction force within the European Union .
The other thing we should learn from this is that the Lom√© peace agreement was imposed from outside by outsiders and was totally unworkable .
We should consider that lesson when we try to impose peace agreements in the future .
Mr President , the resolution initiated by my colleagues , Mr Van Orden and Mr Deva , concerns a matter that is highly topical and most urgent even though this is the first occasion on which Parliament has devoted time to the tragic conflict in Sri Lanka which has been going on for over 17 years .
The resolution sends out a powerful message .
The fighting has to stop .
The parties have to get round the table and reach a reasonable solution that will last .
In this regard , it can only be helpful for the international community , whether it is the UN , the Commonwealth or the European Union , to maintain a strong and current interest in developments .
This legitimate interest should not interfere with the work that has already been carried out by the Indian and Norwegian governments whose representatives have been engaged for some time now in the difficult and sensitive task of brokering negotiations .
I know that in spite of the dreadful atrocities that have been committed against the civil population and against members of successive administrations , the Sri Lankan government at the highest levels is willing to enter into negotiations and is setting no conditions .
We must all recognise the overriding importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka .
Beyond that there are many political options that can fruitfully be pursued .
The international community , including the EU , should be ready to provide substantial material support in due course for whatever solution is worked out and to assist the economic and social reconstruction of the country after so many years of conflict .
Above all , Parliament ' s resolution is unequivocal in its condemnation of terrorism .
This is a scourge which affects us all .
There is no excuse for the indiscriminate acts of murder and mayhem carried out by the so-called Tamil Tigers against children and ordinary civilians going about their daily business and against democratically elected politicians .
This is an attack on civilised society and the democratic institutions which we all value so highly .
Inevitably , the people most effected and most helpless in these situations are the nationals of the target country who have fled the conflict and are trying to lead new lives in Europe .
These people are most vulnerable to threats and intimidation from organisations acting on behalf of terrorists such as the Tamil Tigers .
Of course , there are many other terrorist groups whose activities are sustained in a similar way .
They cleverly avoid breaking the laws of the host country and so can continue their ghastly activities with impunity .
This situation must change .
I commend the resolution on Sri Lanka to this House .
The issue of the place of the Tamils in Sri Lanka is a long-standing problem dating back to at least the year of independence in 1948 .
We have had agreements since then to grant autonomy to the Northeast Tamil region , which have been abrogated by the government .
In this conflict , far too many people have died .
There has been a growing catalogue of violence and human rights abuses on both sides - by the Tamil Tigers and , sadly , the government security forces .
These are well documented by organisations such as Amnesty and the US Department of State in its
