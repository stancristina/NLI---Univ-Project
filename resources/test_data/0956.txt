and it is also very worrying that OLAF does not take whistle-blowers seriously .
It is absolutely crucial that we are able to rely on OLAF’s objectivity , and that people work quickly and effectively in the future , but I should also say that OLAF is not known for being the sharpest tool in the box .     Mr President , first of all , I should like to thank Mr Bösch for a splendid , extremely thorough report , the conclusions of which we can support , on the whole .
It is we who must be answerable to citizens in the last instance for the way in which their money is managed .
Then OLAF came along , and obviously we are now seeing that that has not improved matters as desired .
In the late seventies , there was a joke in my country stemming from the fact that there was a main post office that did not function properly .
There was a problem with the waste , and the joke was that the solution was to package the waste up and send it to the main post office , where it would go round and round in an eternal cycle until the radiation had diminished .
The Commission has actually used OLAF in a similar way .
Things have gone on far too long , have lain unattended for too long , and it is incomprehensible to us , especially in relation to the Eurostat case , that OLAF’s management was able to say to the Committee on Budgetary Control , in deadly earnest , that cases have been kept secret from the Commission so as not to burden the Commission with the unpleasant knowledge of what has happened .
In fact , it could of course be life-threatening to the Commission not to be informed .
Indeed , what is important is to bring about a sea change in our approach towards dealing with the EU’s economy as a whole .     Mr President , the message for Mrs Schreyer this evening is crystal clear : she should say to Mr Prodi that we have no need of his action plans .
We cannot tolerate this .     Mr President , I too should like to extend my thanks to the Court of Auditors for a brilliant report and , at the same time , thank them for the many excellent items of information we receive from the Court of Auditors throughout the year .
I shall be content to state that we are faced with two problems .
As Mr Sjöstedt said in this House , it is of course entirely true that the repeated signing of contracts with companies that have behaved quite unacceptably is inadmissible and that the Commission should simply have avoided having anything to do with such companies .
When , time after time , I listen to the Commissioners in the Committee on Budgetary Control , I think of a man armed only with a driving licence , sitting alone six miles above the ground in the cockpit of a Boeing 767 with no idea of how to land it .
When we look at the problems we confront now that the EU has existed for 46 years , we cannot but observe that the whole problem lies in the attempt to solve problems that simply should not be solved .
Agricultural policy in the 15 countries is quite harmful , as well as being superfluous .
The same applies to structural fund policy and , as the Swedish Prime Minister recently said , it is in fact meaningless for highly taxed countries to deduct tax from the ordinary man in the street when there are countries that will not tax their citizens , even the richest of them , and that subsequently redistribute these funds via the EU.
That is of course a completely absurd policy , and one we can completely revise .
At the same time , it is a good thing that , for the first time , the Court of Auditors has not discovered material errors in connection with implementing the pre-accession aid for the candidate countries .
I wish to emphasise that we in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party fully support the Court of Auditors ’ proposal that the European Development Fund be integrated into the general budget .
In this area , we must be aware of the fact that administration and control of these budget items is , to a large degree , taken care of by the Member States themselves .
This year , total under-use amounted to EUR 7.4 billion , or EUR 7 400 million , and that is extremely unsatisfactory .
That is money that should and could have been used to fulfil the political objectives , and , had it not been used for those purposes , it could have been used in other of the EU’s budget areas , for example research and development .
I think these problems should lead to reflection upon the structures for exercising control in the area of the budget , with competence shared between the Commission and the Member States .
A working party could be set up , consisting of representatives from the Member States’ respective control bodies .
In the longer term , it should be considered whether the incentive for the efficient control of EU funds is simply too weak in the Member States .
In conclusion , I have a practical question for Mr Fabra Vallés .
I should like to ask what considerations form the basis of this statement , for I have noticed that the Court of Auditors has not evaluated the accounting reforms in the report .     Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I want to begin by thanking you very much for the cooperation we have enjoyed concerning the European Health Insurance Card , because what you say is correct , Commissioner .
