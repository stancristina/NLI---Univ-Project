What I would like to know is this : is this what the Commission understands by genuine support for small and medium-sized enterprises , which we call the backbone of the European Union ?
- ( EL ) Once more , the hypocrisy of the European Union is evident both in the state of , and respect for , human rights within the Union and in its international policy on these matters .
Elsewhere , the particularly sensitive issue of human rights is being used as an excuse for intervention , even military intervention , so as to impose specific policies and particular courses of action .
The report on combating racism does not demonstrate that the necessary conclusions have been reached .
For these reasons , the three Members of the European Parliament of the Greek Communist Party will abstain from voting .
Naturally , I imagine , he must mean any country that does not belong to the European Union ....
However , I would like to dwell on the point of transparency because , like yourself , I too Commissioner think that transparency is directly and mainly related to the public ' s confidence in food safety .
As is clear , the regulation was adopted in order to protect the environment and the public .
As we know , Mrs de Palacio was authorised by the Council of Ministers to negotiate with the US.
We do not want a trade war , we want no problems in our relations , and we regard them as allies and friends .
Meanwhile , however , there is no reason to suspend the regulation for third-country aircraft , for the very simple reason that the regulation concerning such aircraft only enters into force in 2002 .
The first is this : it must be made clear who is negotiating on the US side .
The second observation is this : the US must understand that the European Parliament is no longer the body it used to be , in previous decades .
It is now a powerful body .
With these thoughts , therefore , I would like to ask the Commissioner and the Council what their positions are .
In the minute I have , let me say that the European Union ' s Mediterranean policy lacks strategy , and it lacks a timetable and clear objectives in contrast , if you will , to its policy on Eastern Europe .
It could , on the other hand , be adopting direct , specific and effective measures on issues such as debt or technology transfer , where we see hesitancy and a lack of effectiveness .
Mr President , my thoughts go automatically to the debate we held here about five years ago , when the Commission at the time bombastically announced the EU' s new Mediterranean policy .
Democracy in the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean because that will help us to understand one another , and development because , apart from anything else , development will reduce the flood of immigrants we have and will continue to have in years to come .
I would also like to dwell on another issue which may not seem important to you , but which is important to me personally .
Mr President , the matter addressed by Mrs Klamt ' s truly excellent report is one of the most burning and ever growing issues of our time , to which a solution must urgently be found .
For that reason , it is vital to include the rights of children , exactly as they are laid down by the UN Convention of 20 November 1989 , in the European Union ' s Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up .
Finally , we must also act to protect and support children who are victims of sexual exploitation , and young refugees and immigrants who are a particularly vulnerable group .
Madam President , although I was not the speaker , it was Mr Katiforis , I see that in the Minutes , he is reported as having said that the Turkish authorities had also drawn up a list of Greek people living in Turkey .
It is a strategy which is radically innovative .
The most basic example is employment .
Europe currently has 16 million unemployed whom it cannot absorb .
If Europe does not learn its electronic lessons fast , these unfilled jobs will multiply and the economy will slump .
And as all the other sectors become more productive , thanks to the impact of the new economy , they too will create more jobs .
All these years , Europe has been convinced that investing taxpayers ' money into the old-style economy was a waste of time .
We need to build information highways , on which private enterprises can of course then create and run their own vehicles .
Commissioner , thank you for your answer , which I find partially satisfactory as I am well aware of your personal interest in the matter and of the initiatives you have undertaken to combat prostitution rings .
Are you aware , Commissioner , that concentration camps still exist where women are raped before being forced into prostitution ?
I should like to point out that in Helsinki , Greece withdrew its reservations and Turkey became a candidate country .
I just wonder who have they been trying to liberate for the last 25 years , and from whom ?
Akin Birdal , who held talks with Mr Bar√≥n Crespo , was taken into prison while he was standing outside .
Today , Mr Cem dismissed the list as media hype ; but , at the end of the day , Turkey does in fact reserve the right to publish lists of persona non grata .
I would like to add two or three minor points .
Secondly ,
