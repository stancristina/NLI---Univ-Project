essentially discourage workers from delaying their retirement .
The third is improving the quality of work .
As you yourself said , we have set specific targets .
At the moment , we are examining , together with the social protection and employment committees , how social systems obstruct or favour easy retirement .
As far as your third question on the results of the Wim Kok committee is concerned , we consider that they are extremely important , mainly because they go into detailed recommendations for each Member State .
Without doubt progress has been made under the difficult conditions which the different cultures and approaches of the Member States created in the Council .
As far as asylum is concerned , I should like , Mr McDowell , Commissioner , to send my condolences to the Council for failing to adopt the two directives on the definition of refugees and the procedures for granting and revoking refugee status , which were also issues which the Greek Presidency advanced .
In the meantime , it is a well-known fact that the Geneva Convention on refugees has been torn to shreds from one side of the European Union to the other .
Similarly , efforts by the Irish Presidency to bring to a close the matter of creating a personal database on immigrants with biometric elements , such as fingerprints and a digital photograph , will , I believe , create serious discrepancies in the matter of respect and control of the management of personal data .
As far as engineers , for example , are concerned , apart from the question of unequal treatment at the expense of qualified engineers who have completed a five-year course at an institute of higher education , whom it equates with graduates of three-year courses , the downgrading of the profession implied by the Directive gives rise to the serious matter of public interest and urgent social and grass-roots requirements in sensitive sectors , such as earthquake protection , construction and upgrading the natural and man-made environment .
They were sentenced as criminals because they tried to prevent criminal terrorist organisations paid by the USA to work against Cuba and the murder of its leaders , including Fidel Castro himself .
Mr President , the European Commission has proposed extending the remit of the Agency so that it can support the existing Community framework and mechanism in the areas of involuntary or voluntary pollution of the sea and the policy of protection .
Perhaps it helped that , in the rapporteur 's language , the Greek language , safety and security are translated by the same word .
I should like to take this opportunity to call once again for a stop to the unacceptable treatment of the master of the , Apostolos Magouras , who is being treated as a criminal .
This needs to be done and I think that the shipwreck of the demonstrated that clearly .
I am glad that here today , before this House , I am repeating on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats our support for the report by Mr Mastorakis , who has made an effort to reach an agreement with the Council , so that we can finish with this issue quickly at first reading without delays .
The system of liability under the two international conventions is a multiple system .
This liability would also be supplementary because the obligation to pay compensation would apply if there was no compensation from the funds .
Given that no Community rules have been adopted to regulate the question of compensation for damage from oil spills , the Council decision to accede to the protocol must be seen by all of us as a particularly positive action .
It is clarified that this is not accession by the European Union itself , but authorisation to the Member States to ratify the protocol .
Unfortunately , in the proposed motion , all this is passed over in silence .
Not a word is said about the criminal responsibility of the Americans and , in essence , support is given to the foreign-born Karzai government , the credentials of which , as we know , are non-existent .
It welcomes the new constitution approved by the Loya Jirga , while at the same time highlighting its negative aspects , which make it unacceptable .
The Afghan people , victims of the new order , will be able to find their way if they resist the forces propelling it , either in the form of religious fanaticism or under the cloak of a poor copy of a western-type bourgeois democracy , the military interventions and the occupation .
The linking of European financial aid with compliance with absolute respect for the above rights is also uniform for everyone , everywhere .
The exchange of information , knowledge and experience by all the partners , as the motion comments , helps to further serve the desired approach on the basis of principles and rules which are common to and respected by everyone .
Let us hope that those developments in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute , which are still obstructing an unimpeded approach , come to an end as quickly as possible , without walls and divisions , for the good of the entire area and its inhabitants .     Mr President , it is a fact that the countries of the south-eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East as a whole are an important field of action for the foreign relations of the European Union and the present Commission communication confirms this .
Worst of all , however , is that women are the main victims of religious and political fundamentalism , ultra-conservatism and autocratic regimes which base their power to a large degree on controlling the sexual conduct of women , their way of life , their reproductive functions and even the way they dress
