must be an undertaking to include issues of equality in all future programmes and documents concerning the country strategies , as well as in strategies for reducing poverty .
I therefore also support the proposal in paragraph 26 to the effect that , in a meeting with the joint parliamentary ACP-EU Assembly , the important issue be addressed of ensuring that the Cotonou Agreement is also complied with in this area .
Mr van den Bos has just pointed out that conditions for women in the developing countries are appalling for a variety of reasons .
At the same time , I remembered that Mrs Martens ' report states that women in developing countries are often discriminated against in terms of access to food , health care , education , training , decision-making , participation in regional programmes and economic activities , as well as property rights .
The report also makes it clear that remedying a lack of equality and strengthening the role and rights of women are crucial to social justice and development .
Where Mrs Thorning-Schmidt 's report was concerned , there was a hard fight at the conciliation stage .
With regard to Mrs Jensen 's report , I want to point out that it is incredibly important that the Commission and the European Employment Strategy should now begin to pay attention to the local levels .
Later in the year , I shall return with a report that will take the work further in the same direction .
Mr President , a shadow is passing over Europe , in whose darkness is hidden a mixture of stale chauvinism , racism , xenophobia , anti-Semitism and classic European nationalism .
This has a very great deal of bearing upon Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar 's report .
The refugee policy conducted at present by the Member States is inhumane .
Of particular importance is the committee 's proposing that the scope of the directive be extended beyond the requirements of the Geneva Convention .
I had hoped that he might have been able to support the report in its entirety today .
- ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats abstained in the vote on Mr Oostlander 's report on illicit drug trafficking .
We believe that the framework decision should apply to all drug trafficking and not only to serious and international trafficking .
The fight against drugs and their misuse must be conducted at all levels : prevention , rehabilitation and the fight against crime .
One condition of an effective drugs policy is , therefore , that efforts are made to eliminate all types of drugs .
As Swedish liberals , we view European integration as an opportunity to achieve solutions to cross-border problems affecting , for example , the environment , trade , movement across borders , human rights and conflict management .
We do not believe that this decision is rooted in the discussion held earlier in the committee .
That would entail very high expenditure for the Member States in anticipation of 2003 and 2004 when the budgeting requirements will increase prior to enlargement .
We are , on the other hand , opposed to the wordings stating that globalisation creates economic and social suffering .
We should like to see a clearer general recommendation concerning the abolition of the death penalty .
- ( SV ) We welcome and support the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy which has bearing upon many aspects of the work designed to promote human rights in countries outside the EU.
- ( SV ) Parliament has today adopted a report on the multi-annual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets .
The European fishing fleet , which is estimated to have an over-capacity of 40 % , naturally contributes to this depletion .
Since we were unable to support Parliament 's position in this area , we have chosen to vote against the report .
It may be observed that Parliament takes the lead when it comes to efforts to open up our institutions .
Through methods such as these , transparency can be achieved .
The register is therefore an important tool for ensuring that people know what applies and how they can appeal .
I hope that Parliament 's employees in general will interpret all applications generously and that we shall soon have reports on how many applications are rejected .
.
I believe that we shall benefit greatly from the spirit of cooperation we have enjoyed during the year , for there are a number of problems which need to be solved .
First of all , there are a number of positive features I think there is good reason for looking at .
The second positive feature is that we have succeeded in achieving a better political dialogue .
I also hope that we shall be able to renew Parliament 's own budget debate by holding a wider debate in July in which we do not only focus upon next year 's budget but also upon the implementation of the current year 's budget , as well as linking the processes together , which is something I believe is very important for the future .
If the Commission 's basic priorities are compared with the guidelines adopted by Parliament , it can be seen that we are agreed on a range of points .
We are also agreed that we must tackle the issues of security and safety in the broad senses of those words , partly by having a full discussion of how we are to manage security in Europe following the terrorist attacks of last September and partly through adopting a broader perspective on the safety issues - such as food safety and transport safety - on which a range of initiatives need to be taken no later than in next year 's budget .
