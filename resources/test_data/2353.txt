international politics , abhors a vacuum .
In the Burmese State 's budget for 1997-98 , defence costs officially amount to 43 % of the total .
The opinion the citizens of Europe and those of the rest of the world will have on the European structure also depends on the firm and responsible way in which we manage to deal with the Burmese question and the other democratic emergencies throughout the world .
The second question relates to Burma .
It is true that in Albania , compared with a year ago when there was a kind of civil war , there is now a parliament and a government and constant efforts are being made to put things back in their places .
Nevertheless , there was no specific or material follow-up to the declarations made immediately after our visit and , since our return , there has still been no follow-up within parliament and the Committee on Institutional Affairs as regards working together on the new constitution .
To use an image , there is still fire smouldering under the ashes !
I would like to tell the President-in-Office of Council that we can also help a return to normality with a more complex , more fundamental policy .
Mr President , there is no doubt that , as the Members have shown , the state of emergency is , unfortunately , not yet over in Albania .
Without this , there is a further risk that civil war will break out again .
Liberalization has not completely shattered the security and social guarantee mechanisms .
However , there are contradictions and problems , particularly as regards working hours , the relocation of companies - which can have a negative effect on human resources from third countries -, and the management of services with agencies outside the EU which we naturally have to monitor carefully .
However , I would like to deal with another aspect that needs to be highlighted .
We will still have a complete violation of air space available .
Madam President , I wish to remind you that , two days ago , on 17 February , the German writer Ernst Jünger died at the age of 102 .
A positive view is not an idyllic and illuminist view that ignores the problems .
The third aspect is the development of biomass , as sources of renewable energy .
Madam President , Mr Vice President of the Commission , I am very pleased that , every so often , our group is the first to be able to talk about the situation in Afghanistan .
We have passed from a critical over-assessment of the western civilizations and their values to just as critical an acceptance of everything that takes place outside Europe , owing to a misunderstood sense of respect for other cultures .
We are faced with a basic problem , which is that of the meaning of the bases of a foreign power in the territory of an EU Member State .
Madam President , I would like to tell Mr Pettinari that , just a few minutes ago , I heard from a news agency that this morning the Italian judiciary formally asked for the file , in a certain sense asking the Americans for release from the London Convention .
What is puzzling is that , despite the fact that exercises of this type have been reported as dangerous for a long time , no solution has been found .
Madam President , the tragedy of the Cermis cableway has firstly affected the families of the victims and their grief will certainly not find solace in our words .
It was on 6 December 1990 , Mrs Fontaine .
We wonder , however , how the Trentino and Alto Adige valleys can have become a exhibition theatre for the supersonic military aircraft flying at very low altitude , without our authorities intervening , with the authorization of the Ministry of Defence , despite the protests of the populations and the local authorities .
We are certainly asking the American authorities to cooperate with the Italian judiciary to establish responsibility and penalize non-observance of the safety regulations that would otherwise have averted the tragedy .
Stoning is not just a death sentence , but something more , a barbarous and unacceptable method for any civilian society .
Commissioner Marín , do you not think that the critical dialogue the Commission rightly undertook should at least be subject to this minimum level of civility and should now be reviewed ?
From this point of view , the position of the Mauritanian authorities therefore seemed surprising and unacceptable to us , for they have begun a campaign of repression against the exponents of associations committed to the defence of human rights .
Mr President , it is with much regret that the whole world has heard the news that in March the Chilean dictator , Pinochet , will be able to become a senator for life .
The restoration of the rule of law and the real commencement of a process of genuine democratization are the minimum conditions for maintaining EU aid .
I firmly believe in cooperating towards the development of the EU and , for me , this is a positive and useful provocation and an act of political and institutional responsibility on the part of the European Parliament .
Obviously , those more concerned with the outcome of the cooperation policies and the institutional and managerial correctness of the measures taken by the Community institutions .
This refusal can be interpreted as indirect encouragement of the impunity and immunity of the terrorists of yesterday , today and tomorrow .
Women 's rights are human rights and I believe that , based on this statement , the Commission should follow the Beijing Conference with a whole series of initiatives I would like to mention .
