There is no link between depleted uranium and the illnesses .
If we look at the study of Gulf War veterans that was done in the United States and compare that with the study of the control group , there is no difference in the death rates , or illness rates , or the rates of cancer between the two groups .
We must ensure that we are working on the basis of scientific fact and that is why it is not appropriate to call for a moratorium at the moment , when there is no scientific link between the two .
There are a lot of other issues to do with the Balkan War which we should be investigating , like unexploded cluster bombs and the environmental damage which the Commission has outlined , but let us stick to the facts .
Mr President , on a point of order .
Perhaps we could just settle that point of order now .
Lord Bethell is , and remains , firmly a member of the British Conservative Group .
Mr President , this proposal is about money for an instant , non-military response by the Union to crises .
It is first pillar - for those who understand Union jargon - and is driven by the Commission .
It is not a military , rapid reaction force , which is , of course , second pillar , and driven by the Council of Ministers .
However , I have been invited , lobbied and asked how I am going to deploy the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy 's soldiers , tanks and planes .
I have been asked whether we are going to use naval bases in Cyprus and to address a conference of Canadian soldiers .
I want to make it absolutely clear that this is nothing to do with the military rapid reaction force : this is a financial facility for the Commission to respond to crises very rapidly .
Although the Commission will deploy the money as fast as is necessary , Parliament retains control as one half of the budgetary authority .
We shall vote the money and we shall look forward to the reports from the Commission on how it has spent the money .
We expect the Commission to spend the money on responding to crises by buying medicines , hiring doctors or nurses , chartering aircraft to carry the medicines , nurses or policemen - whatever is required - to the crisis , wherever it is - not necessarily within Europe .
In the past the Union has been rightly criticised for being slow in responding to crises .
We have failed to send an immediate response when it was most obviously required , and this proposal is part of Commissioner Patten 's praiseworthy efforts to improve the Union 's aid programme , which is in a bit of a mess , to say the least .
I hope very much that Parliament will support it , and I will come back to that .
We would be very interested to know whether , when the Commissioner responds to this debate , he would be able to outline the types of situations that he envisages this may be used for - although , of course , we have some ideas ourselves .
I have been asked by a number of colleagues who have read the report why , if it is such a good idea , there are so many amendments in it .
The original Commission proposal was dated April last year , but after that nothing happened .
It was blocked , it appears , by the French Presidency , with no explanation of what was happening .
So I tabled a question at Question Time asking for an explanation and miraculously - but maybe there was no connection - the French Presidency and the Commission got together to negotiate to remove the blockage .
They came up with an alternative text but , I am sorry to say , the Council has never had the courtesy to inform Parliament of the new version of the text .
So the many amendments in my report are an attempt to amend the original proposal and for us to comment on the new compromise text which we happened to obtain , even though it was never given to us officially .
Parliament has only one reading on this , which is another reflection which was not corrected at the Nice Summit of the democratic deficit .
It should , of course , be codecision , but it is not .
However , we were able to threaten to use our single reading to withhold it - like the famous isoglucose case some years ago - and if we withhold an opinion , nothing further can happen .
So we have an effective veto .
But , happily , the committee in Parliament has looked at this proposal in great detail and is in favour of it .
Hence the many amendments proposed by the committee .
Finally - I am not going to go into the details of the amendments - I am happy to say that the committee adopted the amendments almost unanimously , with the single exception of the British Conservatives .
They will no doubt explain why that was so .
That was the party which I felt obliged to abandon because it had become totally negative about Europe .
I very much hope that when we vote on this proposal they will at last feel positive and give it their wholehearted support .
Mr President , I hope I have the Commissioner 's attention , as he is in conversation with Mr Brok at the moment .
Throughout this Parliament we have been calling for the Commission to introduce more efficient financial management and administrative procedures so that it can deliver external assistance and
