to repel any opportunity to abuse this tool .
My solution is unusual in that it would have simultaneously benefited both those citizens who were genuinely keen to participate and the authorities , and the parties responsible for the relevant projects .
Firstly the work of the authorities would be easier as they would not need to specify beforehand the parties concerned and , at the same time , the likelihood of omission when the parties were being heard would be removed .
Above all , however , it would mean the quality of participation would be highlighted and the importance attached to hearing Mr and Mrs Nimby would decline .
Unfortunately , the Commission has not been able , despite its promises , to put forward a clear timetable and course of action in respect of the measures that need to be taken for ratification .
At least I was not aware of anyone mentioning the fact that the right to participate in decision-making is an absolutely essential aspect of citizenship .
She said that the public would have far fewer complaints about non-compliance with Community legislation if they had the right to participate in decision-making relating to it right from the early stages , and this is precisely what this report is about .
It is absolutely essential that this right to participate should be applied widely to the parties concerned .
I have no doubt that it will , but it does state that non-governmental organisations shall also be deemed to meet the definition of what constitutes a party concerned .
Now we will discuss the second part of the Convention which deals with the right to participate in decision-making .
In fact when the public actually start to exercise the rights they have , those who could not care less about their opinions all too readily claim those rights are being abused .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , since the Lisbon Summit , education and training have become a more and more important part of EU strategy .
This description is also true in a negative sense .
Now that Kathleen Van Brempt has produced her excellent report , we have a good opportunity to talk about lifelong learning here in plenary .
Lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important with regard to citizens ' participation , boosting employment and regeneration of the workforce .
It must also be a social right for everyone , irrespective of their age , sex or social background .
Equality of education is , for many reasons , very difficult to bring about .
For that reason I wish to emphasise the need for setting special targets so that the provision of lifelong learning can be made to include people who failed to finish their secondary education , are untrained , have special needs and learning difficulties , or who are socially underprivileged .
Although it is the responsibility of Member States to organise education , we need practical European targets and measures .
It is easier to achieve aims if we know what we are aiming at .
European Union budgetary policy is overshadowed by the unsatisfactory way in which the budget itself has been implemented .
As Mr Elles stated in his speech just now , a good EUR 15 billion in budget commitments remained unspent last year , which is an inconceivably huge amount of money .
We must ask what the Commission intends to do in the area of legislation to eliminate this defect in the system .
Such meagre sums will not help to reduce the arrears : they will , instead , pile up when the eastward enlargement of the EU has taken place and a lot of other problems lie ahead .
For this reason , the administrative process must be reformed and made more flexible , so that human resources may be deployed more swiftly and appropriately than is the case at present .
Mr President , Commissioner , as many speakers have stated here already , the latest budget monitoring figures also show that the implementation of the Structural Fund programmes and payments made with regard to the programmes have progressed far too slowly .
It is therefore very clear that regional aid will be needed in the future too , as Mr Puerta suggested .
These are also causing problems in countries that have kept to the timetable .
There should be compliance , however , with the N+2 rule , as it will help shore up implementation of the Structural Funds .
This is a very tough question too because enlargement is just around the corner and we need to find remedies for these problems , with more in the way of results and less bureaucracy .
The language of communication is also often cumbersome and not enough attention is paid to cultural differences .
That is how it should be too .
The Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , which supports Commissioner Vitorino 's information policy , has unanimously proposed there should be additional resources for the budget headings concerned with information .
Mr President , Commissioners . ladies and gentlemen , enlargement is just around the corner and we continually speak of finance and various programmes for the new Member States , but we forget that action is also needed in the border areas of our new neighbours and for these new neighbours themselves .
That could be done , for example , by strengthening cross-border cooperation under the TACIS programme .
For this more money is needed right away .
This has had the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
We all understand why .
I have a question for the Commission .
You must agree that it will be an important project for years to come
