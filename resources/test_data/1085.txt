too much detail .
The draft , however , calls for ongoing , expensive , to some extent impossible , and environmentally unnecessary monitoring of plants that are engaged in harmless coincineration .
I think the matter should either go back to the Committee or the Council ' s common position , at least its main features , should be adhered to .
Drafting environmental legislation for the whole of Europe is a demanding task , as circumstances in Member States differ enormously .
Therefore , it is tiresome to see that the same mechanisms that are needed to guide those countries that have been lax in their attention to the matter of waste disposal , are forcing the more advanced countries to take a step backwards .
If more stringent requirements regarding emissions are being illogically imposed on the use of waste as fuel than for other fuels , fuels classified as waste will cease to be used .
This holds true especially for the incineration of harmless sludge produced by the paper and cellulose industry .
It is important that Parliament amends the proposal for the directive in this respect in accordance with the Committee ' s amendment .
For example , the limit values for emissions for fuel that is not waste in coincineration are required to be the same as for waste as fuel , even though the same material may be incinerated and give off higher levels of emissions , under EU legislation .
Investments that do not bring a value added element with regard to the environment mean less investments that are of benefit to the environment .
These programmes stated as their aim the protection of people and nature from the adverse effects of air pollution , meaning that critical ceilings in respect of nature and people would not be exceeded .
We are still not even aware of all the technical potential for ridding ourselves of sources of emissions entirely .
For this reason , it is reasonable to proceed in stages , as the Commission has proposed .
We cannot be satisfied with just this , however , as , after this target has been met , there will still be too many areas where pollution counts exceed levels that are dangerous to people and nature .
In this connection I would like to draw your attention to my amendment , in which , owing to a translation error , there is a wrong word in your copy of the document .
How , then , do we achieve a situation in which air pollution does not exceed tolerance levels for humans and for nature ?
The biggest disagreements in the implementation of the directive relate to the limit values , i .e . , the emission ceiling set for each country .
The UN Economic Commission for Europe has also examined the objectives for reductions in the same sources of emissions as in the proposal for a directive now under discussion , and , as a result of these talks , the so-called Gothenburg Protocol was signed .
If we were to accept the ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol , we would never reach the targets that the Union has set itself regarding air pollution .
It has to be said , however , that there is very considerable exaggeration with regard to the costs involved .
But , in any case , it is important that the European Parliament should now defend at least that policy which the Commission has chosen .
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposes that even stricter goals should be set for 2010 than the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has recommended .
We have to remember that , in any case , we have the implementation of the Kyoto commitments ahead of us , which will mean insisting on more efficient use of energy and simply using less of it .
However , I also understand those views that advocate electing the ceilings proposed under the Gothenburg Protocol .
Air quality in Europe has improved considerably in recent years .
Emission levels have decreased significantly , at least in the energy sector , in transport and in industry .
I think it is something of a problem that the targets are repeatedly changed before any proper assessment has been made of the effects , in practice , on the environment and the costs to industry of the legislative measures that have been adopted .
Finally , I believe there should be international agreements on ceilings for emissions for shipping and aircraft , and , at this stage , they should not fall within the scope of the directive .
Mr President , I am in sincere agreement with what was said in the previous speech .
What this moral obligation actually entails and the extent of our efforts and commitment will , however , come to light in the context of that wretched reality represented by wars and armed conflicts .
Over the last century , these have totally changed in nature .
Today we are hearing the case of Albin Kurti , of Kosovo .
We cannot breathe unless we are motivated from outside , from grassroots level .
They are : the need to act when independent journalists are attacked , the need to protect conscientious objectors and deserters , and the need to develop smart sanctions , which do not make conditions wretched for vast sections of the population , but which are targeted at the political tyrants that have amassed riches .
This is a precision weapon , which must be utilised more .
It must be a dynamic one and one that can penetrate the reality of the situation at all levels .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you said that there is a party in power in Austria which has made racist comments in public
