have not today concealed the fact that Europe is to be governed not by the countries ’ governments but by a strong Commission whose parliamentary legality lies in the directly elected European Parliament .
This Constitution removes countries ’ independence in favour of a non-transparent regime pursuing objectives that , in all too many cases , do not have grass-roots support .
It may be said of the Constitution that we are debating in this House today that it is not honest about the intentions behind it .
It is not tolerable for the majority of Europeans , for it only corresponds to the customs of a few countries .
This draft Constitution must be rejected .
I recommend the minority ’s amendment .
The whole of today’s debate has shown this quite clearly .
What was it that drove the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken Summit ?
It was , in reality , two things .
Whenever we have altered the methods of European cooperation , this has normally happened as a sealed-off process behind closed doors , following which the population of Europe has woken up one morning to find that leading politicians have once more changed the conditions of cooperation .
A Convention was set up , in which I myself had the pleasure of participating .
In future , changes are to be made as part of an open process .
That being said , the following are crucial points I should like to emphasise .
Secondly , the new Constitutional Treaty provides us with an assurance that the principles of openness and democracy , which a modern-day form of cooperation can be expected to respect , are also applied in European cooperation .
Now , we are acquiring a modern , and open , Constitutional Treaty .
Finally , we are ensuring that , via the European Parliament , the elected representatives of the people are given greater influence .
All in all , it is a good product that we have debated today and that we are to recommend to the population of Europe .     My dear Mr  Juncker , Luxembourg’s presidencies of the EU are usually among the best , perhaps because a small country knows that it cannot monopolise the agenda but that it must be of service to everyone .
Our buildings here are full of expressions of commitment to a ‘yes ’ vote : ‘yes ’ signs , badges and balloons , their presence decided upon – and paid for out of our common budget – before Parliament has voted .
Those in favour cannot steal taxpayers ’ contributions to promote a definite view .
On Monday evening , Parliament’s Sessional Services decided to send some millions of euros to the supranational EU parties , which are all in favour of the EU Constitution .
That is contrary to the principle of equality and thus illegal .
How will you guarantee that EU resources used by the campaigners for a ‘yes ’ vote can be used equally well by the campaigners for a ‘no’ vote ?
Now that the European Council has , however , decided to reduce the number of Commissioners from 2014 , it is important that we stick to the principle of fair rotation between the Member States .     – I want to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his answers to the questions put by Mr  Hughes on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
The matter has been discussed several times in that committee , but it has in actual fact also been discussed in the Committee on Budgets in which we perhaps had to approach it at a rather more difficult angle , given that we also , of course , wanted to see administration that was as efficient and inexpensive as possible .
When , as justification for this dismissal of the 43 teachers , the Commission refers to considerations of sound financial management and the need to ensure both that the costs do not get badly out of hand and that the language courses are obtainable at a third or fourth of the former price , it is difficult for people involved with the budget not to say that the decision is apparently a sensible one .
The administration must of course be efficient and inexpensive and , in recent years , we in Parliament have exerted considerable pressure to ensure that the Commission implements reforms and that , through these reforms , a more open and transparent system is obtained , which also means a system that is perhaps better in tune with the world around us .
That is an important point of departure .
We have been assured that the Belgian rules have been complied with .
That no doubt also reflects the fact that matters have not proceeded properly in this case .
The Commission too must demonstrate social responsibility and sound management .
Ways should also , however , be looked into of ensuring , in the future , proper administration that complies with the requirements of the law , is inexpensive and is suitably in keeping with the organisation’s social responsibility .     Mr President , both reports are expressions of the well-known ambition to extend the power of the EU institutions at the expense both of the Member States and ultimately , therefore , of democracy Of Mr Di Pietro’s report , I can only say that it concerns a matter belonging within the remit of the Council of Europe and not of the EU.
Mr Costa’s report is full of fine-sounding idealism , but the ideals and the good intentions suffer from the unfortunate defect of generally lacking a basis in reality .
I would first of all point to the fact that , in a number of Member States , criminal procedure and the prison systems contain numerous gross infringements of fundamental human rights
