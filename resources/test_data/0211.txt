I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well .
But that is not to say that we are satisfied , and that everything in the garden is rosy .
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue .
It indicates , however , that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction .
I just want to outline some of the issues that we , as Socialists , have put down as amendments .
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform .
First of all , the immunity of officials : this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor .
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption .
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors .
The Court 's report is there for a reason , our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through .
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission .
Even if we hear nothing else , we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see .
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them .
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future .
The other issue is access to confidential documents .
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had .
We understand that we also have a responsibility here , that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential .
We have put down an amendment to that effect .
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital .
The situation there is totally unacceptable .
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue .
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan .
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks .
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons ; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself , are now part of European folklore .
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated .
Remember that the Council of Ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March .
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September .
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored .
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials .
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency .
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly .
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode .
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information .
This was , after all , one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission .
Have the lessons not been learnt ?
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee .
We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package .
The less precise , Mr van Hulten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like .
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented .
We have , as the EPP-ED group , submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report , entirely changing the nature of
