lead to stagnation .
This fragmentation of economic policy is not something which can yield results under the conditions of globalisation in which we live today .
The second point is that we need a bigger strategic initiative , capable of activating the powers of the European economy .
The economies of eastern Europe can become the dynamo of the new European economy ; all it needs is for us , old Europe , to find the courage and the inspiration to imitate the United States of America and mark the end of the cold war with a sort of Marshall plan for eastern Europe , as the USA did at the end of the Second World War .
Mr President , if we could christen this evening 's debate and give it a title , we would say it is a debate about solidarity .
Hence , the approach which we adopted last year , when we decided to update and combine these two policy sectors , was the right one .
Nonetheless , the strategic choice about economic and social prosperity is the right choice .
For the new Member States in general , they are undergoing and facing , as far as the implementation of structural reforms is concerned , the same challenges which the older Member States faced .
I should like at this point to refer also to a matter raised at the beginning of the debate by Mrs Jensen and repeated subsequently : the question of the free movement of workers .
Nor should we forget that they are an integral part of the internal market and European nationality .
We must extend our coordination beyond financial matters to cover broader questions of economic policy and we need to take account of both the social and the environmental dimension which Mrs Myller spoke of , referring to what I said and emphasised earlier and which I would like to clarify better now , that the countries which provide a high level of social protection , such as Denmark and Sweden , also manage to be extremely competitive .
I believe , even if this sounds romantic , that the promotion of the idea of the truce in modern times and the education of people in peaceful coexistence would cost far less and would have more permanent results than strengthening the forces of suppression and the use of military means .
At the same time , it demonstrates the degree of freedom of the press which we have achieved and must maintain .
For the strengthening of security in the European Union , for a more secure world , we certainly need fresh , alternative , non-military policies and strategies and a stronger role for citizens , especially women .
It is supreme institutional protection of the dictatorship of the European monopolies .
New measures have been promoted to suppress grass-roots rights and freedoms by hitting out at working-class and grass-roots struggles and imposing terrorism on peoples .
The working classes of Europe and the peoples must strengthen resistance , insubordination and disobedience in the EU in their fight to prevent the European constitution and bring about the downfall of the ΕU.     – Mr President , if Lisbon taught us anything , it was that strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy , of companies , does not suffice for us to have jobs and social cohesion and to protect the environment .
It proposes a series of measures to reduce administrative controls of the market , to reduce costs , even hinting at increased working times , but it makes no reference to social viability .
As far as the financial perspectives are concerned , it is hypocritical of all of us to say that we need cohesion targets and market integration without , at the same time , increasing the budget of own resources .
In other words , you can instigate fear in immigrants , instead of primarily integrating them .
The Netherlands Presidency should therefore do likewise and stop focusing solely on policing .     . – The declarations by the Netherlands Presidency on its work programme are a provocation to the workers and peoples of the European Union .
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn this policy and stand by and with the grass-roots movement in its fight against these measures .     – Mr President , over the next five years , the European Union needs to strengthen its institutional and democratic functions .
When you visited the Group of the Party of European Socialists yesterday , you told us that you are not a technocrat ; you are a politician who makes political choices .
We are also making a political judgment of the lack of self-criticism in your speech today , now that it has been clearly demonstrated that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
We welcome his assurance that the confidence of European citizens in Europe and how it operates will need to be strengthened .
It is our common conviction that democracy is strengthened through criticism and I am certain that Mr Barroso will , with our support , accept this position also .
We believe that Mr Barroso will , of course , be the leader of the European Commission .
That is why I wish him every success .     – Madam President , Mr Barroso , as a left-wing MEP , I shall vote against you , because I want a Europe which does not act as Mr Bush 's delivery boy , as you did in the Azores , because I am against your neo-liberal policy in Portugal and , furthermore , because I refuse to allow the European Parliament to simply ratify the orders of the summit .
We shall expect you there so that you can tell us what you intend to do and if you will be applying a Community directive .
