the case , and that this will worsen the situation of migratory birds in the European Union .
The end result is that we now have a reasonably balanced proposal for imposing strict limits regarding the incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste , improving the environment and enabling waste to also be used in the production of electricity and heat .
In the first draft sketches for these plants there was a call for unnecessary , technically costly and , in some respects , impossible tests .
The proposal has improved during the debate .
In my opinion , the problem was also that the directive went into precise technical detail which it was hard to get unambiguous opinions on from the experts .
Our parliamentary debate achieved a reasonably balanced proposal that can serve as a basis for action throughout the Union .
Agreement on the derogations in the scope of the directive was one of the hardest questions in the debate and conciliation process .
Parliament was also pushing for greater transparency and better opportunities for the public to have access to information .
Thus , in the conciliation process we were able to agree that plants that incinerate more than two tons per hour should publish a report on their emissions each year and smaller incineration plants should be included in the lists that would come under public scrutiny .
In this respect the conciliation process achieved a good result , as Parliament ' s proposal for stricter nitrogen oxide emissions in all new cement kilns co-incinerating waste was approved .
The report by Mr Blokland , now at its third reading , was for many members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , elected to Parliament for the first time , the first real test of learning with regard to parliamentary practice .
The important element in all this , though , was the genuine desire for cooperation on the part of the three institutions .
Mr President , the dependence of the Member States of the Union on imported energy is massive and is growing all the time .
Using renewable energy sources will increase the freedom and independence of nations and is in harmony with the principles of ecologically and socially sustainable development .
Peat is important in the Nordic countries , and we must have the opportunity there to burn peat , as it is our own source of energy and it reduces the EU' s dependence on imports .
If we do not , we will burn oil or gas .
Landfill site gas can be burned , but the volume of waste should not be increased just so that more gas can be burned than before .
The share should aim to be doubled in the next ten years ; it could well be more than that .
That will create uncertainty in our lives - in the economy as well as other areas .
The formation of peat by assimilation and the production of organic debris are the same as with other plant biomasses .
We do not wish to burn and be dependent just on coal and oil .
For us an annual growth limit in peat is quite enough .
We Finns regard the forest and the marshes as almost sacred , and we know how to use them in compliance with the principle of sustainable development .
Promoting the use of electricity from renewable energy sources is a very worthwhile endeavour .
I am satisfied that the new directive takes account of the importance of biomass , peat ands other wood-based raw materials , for example .
The controversy over ending the use of nuclear power , for example in Sweden and Germany , has shown that without any visible energy alternatives produced at a competitive price and which are environmentally friendly , the debate is surely lacking something .
The total deregulation of the electricity markets is also one precondition of the increased use of renewables .
For example , the cheap energy produced in the Nordic countries in hydroelectric plants is still not freely available to the markets of Central Europe , as the situation stands at present .
A really excellent proposal has been produced , thanks to cooperation .
Increasing the use of renewable energy can reduce dependence on oil and also create jobs in sparsely populated regions .
I think the principle whereby the directive can create a framework for the increased use of renewables in the production of electricity is a good one .
Although it will be left to the Member States to decide on the promotional measures to be used and to implement them , we also need increased input from the Union .
Mr President , on behalf of Mrs van der Laan and myself I want to register that we voted against Amendment No 15 in the Morillon report .
Mr President , what I have to say concerns rather the future than the past , in other words , I would just like to make sure that we are to vote on the BSE issue in today ' s vote .
Obviously there have to be limits to such a right , and that is something we are also discussing today .
At the moment in the European Union there already exists the practice of public access to documentation , and we should remember that brave citizens and many progressive Member States have been fighting for increased transparency for many years .
The report we are now examining in many respects takes the situation in a better direction .
This principle should be strengthened further .
However , the report does not sufficiently explain how possible separate provisions , which would remain in force at the same time as this regulation , would meet the criteria of greater transparency
