That is where we in this House have an exemplary responsibility in performing our role in the development of this particular sector .
My own Group is very committed to the budget that has been laid out in the report .
We are also very committed to diversifying and looking at different sources of funding as befits our new entrepreneurial era .
Finally , it is very important to reiterate what Mrs Pack said about having a long term strategy for the audio-visual sector in the European Union , a long term coordinated and integrated strategy that allows us to benefit from each other 's strengths in every Member State .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on the work that she has done .
There are two simple points I want to make .
There are some things that the public sector cannot do and some things the market cannot do .
Certainly the public sector cannot make good films .
I do not believe it can do much of a job of judging what is a good film .
Whenever we try it in the United Kingdom , any support from the government tends to mean that the film is going to be a flop .
We need to very careful about that .
Similarly , the market does not have adequate resources or adequate ability to ensure that we have sufficiently skilled and trained people .
That certainly is an area that is proposed in this report and is a responsibility at a European level .
I must pay tribute to organisations like , in Britain , the National Film School in Beaconsfield , which needs help to do its work .
I was pleased to see there are some references to digital radio in this report , but not enough .
We should not forget the radio sector in audio-visual .
I hope that will not be forgotten as this report goes through .
Finally , it is very easy to write a long speech .
It is much harder to give a short speech .
It is easy to spend a large budget , but difficult to spend a small budget .
We look to the Commission to spend the money that they have efficiently and effectively .
Mr President , it was late when I made my last speech , it is even later now so I shall be try to be even briefer .
But education is important and we must make sure it gets the attention it deserves .
Often education attracts fine words .
What it does not always get is the action to match those words .
We all know the EU has very limited responsibilities as regards education , but there are some places where the European Union can give added value .
Quality evaluation is one of those .
When I went into town earlier on this evening I saw young people in the city of Strasbourg looking at leaflets up on a wall .
What they were looking at were their baccalaureate results .
So we think nothing about evaluating youngsters .
What we need to do is evaluate the schools and to make sure that the schools are doing well .
Since the schools are preparing young people for an education in the single market of Europe , we must make sure that the schools across Europe are all doing their work to prepare people for the single market those young people are going to work in .
In some parts of the Union - and I am quite willing to cite the United Kingdom - we are not doing as well as we could .
There are very many bright youngsters who do very well in the schools , but 20 % of young people leave British schools without any qualifications at all .
We cannot afford to allow that to continue to happen .
There have been estimates that in the next two years we will require half a million extra people in IT jobs .
Where are those young people going to come from ?
We have to make sure that the schools can deliver them and I am quite sure that what is contained in this report is one of the ways that we can help raise the standards in schools .
In English we say " two heads are better than one " .
I am quite prepared to believe that 15 heads , or 15 sets of data across the Union , will help us achieve better quality in the schools .
I would just say to the Council - and I hope there is somebody from the Council listening to this - I know we can have confidence in the Commissioner , but let us say to the Council that their fine words at Lisbon were great but they should now deliver on them .
I am therefore very sorry that the great efforts that the rapporteur made to get full agreement were not actually rewarded .
So do not be too surprised if this Parliament backs the rapporteur and tries to push the Council to live up to the fine words they were so ready to utter .
Mr President , on Monday I made a point of order about President Nicole Fontaine 's reported comments in the British press regarding her recent visit with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II .
A British Labour Member of this House , Mr Miller , repeated what were purported to be the Queen 's remarks , not once but three times , on Monday , on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
He sought to drag the Queen into a political controversy and to use her name to score cheap political points .
Mr President , it may be that President Fontaine was unfamiliar with the British rules of protocol which obtain in such matters , but Mr Miller has no such excuse
