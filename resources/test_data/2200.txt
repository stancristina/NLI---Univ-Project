In that context we join with the rapporteur in feeling that some kind of special provisions concerning subsidies are merited as long as those market distorting subsidies continue elsewhere .
On targets , I very much side with Mr Linkohr .
We cannot be serious about this without trying to add teeth in some form , moral , financial or otherwise to the concept of targets .
We were not very happy with the early versions from the rapporteur because we felt the targets were there to almost micro-manage the market in renewable energy sources .
That is neither viable nor desirable , but a mixture of the pressure towards targets , combined with competition between effective renewable energy industries , seems to us to be the long-term approach we should all adopt .
Finally , I would make a plea on behalf of my group : let us not set up yet another agency .
Paragraph 22 of this report calls for the establishment of a European sustainable energy agency .
This Parliament and the European institutions have been spawning a blizzard of new agencies all over the European Union .
It does not necessary help us to follow the policies which we wish to follow - it could actually have the effect of ghettoising the policy altogether .
Mr President , I believe that all of us are in agreement that the development of renewable energy sources is the way forward .
If we are serious about this , we must be prepared to make funds available for research and development in this area , both at national and European levels .
Parliament recently voted to maintain and increase funding for the SAVE programme .
In my own country of Ireland a total of EUR 125 million has been devoted to developing an environmentally sustainable energy sector .
I am pleased that the rapporteur identifies the links between the issue of renewable energy sources and wider policy considerations .
The creation of an internal market in electricity should provide consumers of electricity with real choice .
The introduction of an element of competition in any industry should lead to more favourable pricing for the consumer .
While it is desirable to create a level playing field it may also be necessary to provide subsidies for certain types of energy in order to promote other objectives .
Clearly the development of renewables is linked to environmental objectives as well as issues of employment , regional development and the promotion of local initiatives .
I would like to see the development of small local initiatives which would strengthen rural development by the provision of , say , 20 to 30 jobs per project .
Such projects should not only be open to the business sector and local groups such as small locally-based co-ops should be assisted in creating such local enterprises .
This report states that support for renewable energy projects must not be viewed as a straightforward subsidy under the state aid rules .
What is important is that Member States be allowed to continue subsidising renewable energy sources which are not yet economically viable .
Apart from the obvious environmental and other benefits , this can actually be justified on competition grounds .
It is clear that there are serious distortions in the energy market with many hidden subsidies to both coal and oil generated energy .
It would be virtually impossible to quantify these subsidies which have been embedded in the industry over decades of generator construction .
We still face a significant challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto protocol while , at the same time , promoting growth within our economies .
I believe that , while each Member State must work towards the 12 % target of renewables , the imposition of a single binding target would not be helpful because of the great differences in the structure of the energy market between Member States .
All I have said so far is on the positive side but , on the negative side , the report specifically calls for peat to be excluded .
Peat power plants work very well indeed in my country and make an important contribution to Ireland ' s energy supply .
In addition to that , the report emphatically calls for the European imposition of an energy tax .
I am totally opposed to this approach and I reject this taxation .
Therefore , I regret to say that my final vote on this project will be seriously affected .
Mr President , I have an interest , though not a financial one , in this subject in that I am chairman of the Northern Energy Initiative , a company which operates in the north-east of England , and has within it a renewable energy agency whose objective is to promote the development of renewable energies .
The UK has a low proportion of electricity from renewable sources , I believe amongst the lowest .
Yet the studies in my home region have demonstrated considerable potential for renewable projects : wind , including offshore , small hydro , landfill gas , waste incineration , biofuels and photovoltaics .
It is important to have EU and national targets , but it is also important to have a European directive which will support efforts at local and regional level , where many of the decisions are actually taken .
In general terms , there is a need to build up an awareness amongst architects and potential customers of the technologies that are available .
Support for demonstration projects should be included in any directive .
Larger developments often fail to get planning permission , sometimes because of public opposition .
More proactive planning guidance , preferably linked to regional renewable targets , and feasibility studies would be helpful additions to the directive .
