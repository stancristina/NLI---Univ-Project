The accumulation of funds in recent years , the so-called snowball effect , has been a continual source of worry for the Committee on Budgets .
It was this snowball effect that the Committee on Budgets wished to bring to everyone 's attention in its report , and it thus proposed Amendments Nos 2 and 3 .
Mr President , Mr Viola 's own-initiative report seeks to underline the particularly sensitive situation the island regions find themselves in .
They are subject to all kinds of pressures .
A balance has to be struck between the living conditions of their permanent populations and increasing tourism .
If island youth is not tempted to stay at home , not only will unique island cultures disappear but valuable cultural heritages will be lost .
Examples include the vast inhabited archipelago between Finland and Sweden , and the islands in the lake districts of eastern and central Finland .
On Amendments Nos 21 and 22 Mr President , I wish to speak about something that does not concern the Minutes , but is a question of procedure .
This week the results of the working party 's discussion on MEPs ' pay , travel and other expenses will be made known here .
We Finnish parliamentarians , at least some of us , have had to answer questions on this working party 's conclusions .
It has to be said that it is not just a matter here of the European Parliament getting its opinion across and having the opportunity to discuss it .
The European Parliament is justifiably seen as a public forum , one that represents the people , in those matters to which the people in general turn their attention .
It is very easy to imagine that Parliament might well have been rebuffed here on judicial grounds , for political reasons .
That is why it would be a good idea to approve this report and take it very seriously .
On the basis of Mr Pimenta 's report , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has now recommended the rejection of the agreement , initially drawn up with Canada and Russia , and now with the USA .
A good thing is not always the best thing .
This old Finnish saying is obviously unknown to Mr Pimenta , the Committee responsible or Parliament generally .
However , no-one has come up with a system that does not cause at least some pain .
The REX Committee has unanimously taken a positive stand on the agreement that is to be discussed .
I hope that Parliament will take a step forward in this matter .
Mr President , Chairman of the Council of Ministers , Commissioner , I congratulate Mr des Places on a clear report that depicts excellently the effects of the EU 's agricultural pricing and aid policy on farmers ' income .
The introduction of the euro at the beginning of next year will bring with it a further 2 % cut for agriculture .
It must not be taken away under any pretext .
The rapporteur proposes keeping pricing and compensatory payments in line with inflation .
Income from agriculture has declined continuously , and it is still falling with the reforms in the Agenda programme .
How much longer will the farming community tolerate the immense inequalities among population groups which the CAP is increasingly leading to ?
There are elements of a serious crisis in this policy , and I cannot therefore support it .
It reveals the rapporteur 's expertise in the subject .
The greatest challenge of Agenda 2000 will be the integration of the special needs that exist in northern , southern and mountainous regions into the EU common agricultural policy .
This fact has to feature far more prominently in Agenda 2000 .
Agenda 2000 weakens competitiveness between the production of crops and that of fodder , to the detriment of the latter .
Thus there is a need for fodder storage aid , just as the report explains .
Forestry has been and must in the future be within the sphere of the free market economy .
We have the European model of the family farming based unit , which we have to defend .
The present Union aid for afforestation , forest improvements and averting forest fires is enough .
Our money could certainly be invested more productively .
This , however , does not mean that the Union does not nor should not have an important role in forestry matters .
Where is the promise that was made at summit level to preserve the viability of the rural environment by practising agriculture in all regions of the Union ?
On enlargement and Agenda 2000 I finally wish to say that it is not worth prolonging the discussion as long as the institutional problems in the EU today remain unresolved .
The development of the global economy , mass unemployment , enlargement and EMU are all factors that require a structural policy that will level out differences and create new opportunities .
EU regional policy must be more adept and flexible in its attention to differing circumstances .
We have to keep rigidly to the Agenda 2000 timetable for debate .
These areas are suffering acutely from population loss .
For this reason , I would turn your attention to the fact that in Finland money is used , for example , for the purpose of bringing the euro into the market , and that money is for the exclusive use of citizens ' organizations that have a positive view of the euro .
Commissioner , do you really believe that only the people who said 'yes ' should be allowed to use funds for propaganda ?
Mr President , I would like to warmly thank Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl for preparing this report .
Stubborn persistence in attitude does not produce results .
That
