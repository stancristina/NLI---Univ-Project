the Commission 's report on forestry measures promoted as an alternative use of agricultural land , before taking a decision on the proposal for a significant increase in afforestation aid as part of rural development policy under Agenda 2000 .
The vague and weak aspects of the scheme have to be put right before aid policy is extended in any way .
Parliament 's proposal emphasises that forestry must continue to operate according to market forces , without aid that would distort competition , and primarily under State guidance .
The added value of the role of the EU in forestry policy has to be strictly limited to action that supports the multi-functional use of forests and economic exploitation in accordance with sustainable development .
For now , I only want to refer to Mr Otila 's report on forests and woodland .
Cultivated fields just appear as odd patches in the midst of the forest .
In central Europe the forests are mainly recreation areas and parks , where people can interact with the countryside .
The forests of the Mediterranean region are a key factor in protecting the landscape and nature in general .
For these reasons , forest maintenance varies from country to country .
This may also be the main reason why the Treaty of Rome does not bring forestry policy under the jurisdiction of the EU.
This gap must be narrowed by all the means available to us .
In Finland and other countries we have done this with the aid of the institution of the library , and we have been very successful .
The essential task of the nation 's libraries is to safeguard the framework of the educational and cultural system , and this is especially important with the minority language groups , which are difficult for the majority language groups to understand .
I consider this to be a stupid mistake which threatens to ruin the work of an institution that has proved particularly cost-effective in the culture sector , since libraries would then not be able to fulfil their task as providers of information .
The library has become a sort of church of information .
As I believe that this is rooted in ignorance , my position is that we change the Copyright Directive to enable libraries to continue their work and increase their educational role as a promoter of equality , and one that represents wisdom and justice , in today 's information society .
At the same time it maps out , in excellent fashion , the huge potential and the challenges to be faced on the part of the institution of the library over the coming years .
They are also small countries ' only protection .
They have supplied comprehensible and varied information , and provided information on skills and new discoveries , as well as applications in different sectors .
Control of information means power , and a lack of information means a lack of influence .
If national standards of education are not attended to , the result is a critical level of social inequality .
Copyright is a very important part of the western judicial system , safeguarding the rights of inventors , science and scientists .
While it keeps the institution of the library user-friendly and recognises it as the best cultural institution with such limited funding , it also puts forward an appropriate solution for the future development of copyright .
Libraries must keep abreast of the times and , preferably , be ahead of them .
I disagree with the previous speaker that charging for books would not cause people problems in seeking information .
In Finland , at least , books are so expensive that only a few people can afford to buy everything they need for study purposes , or for cultural reasons , for example .
Knowledge is to be found on the Internet these days , rather than on library shelves .
For example , in Finland , which has provided examples for other issues we are discussing here , we have what we call library compensation scheme , under which copyright-holders are paid royalties , on an equal basis , for works of theirs that are available to the public .
The library is also an institution used by the majority of citizens , an information bank for every man and woman .
Cooperation must above all be based on an endeavour to discover ways of working that can be applied in different countries .
Working together in Parliament as we have been doing now for a long time , I have come to know her as someone who conscientiously applies herself to the issue of education .
The fact that they are free of charge is important , but it conflicts with a current , alternative economic policy : the neo-liberalist pay-to-study phenomenon .
This kind of economic policy is the death knell for libraries .
Library staff have the important task of teaching people to distinguish between education and sensation .
This was by way of congratulating the rapporteur .
I do not think that is wise .
For example , financial assistance is provided for Euro News , which is used to produce electronic Europropaganda .
People themselves must have the opportunity to become aware of the options .
This is in connection with Mr Skinner 's report .
In Parliament we have the new technologies of e-mail and all the other communication systems available , but nevertheless , we did not get any advance information that Mr Skinner 's report would be discussed .
We should know in advance what matters are to be discussed , so that we can table any necessary amendments .
Mr President , Mr van den Broek mentioned in his speech , when referring to the situation of gypsies or Romanies , that when it comes to political criteria , and especially the status of minorities , there is cause for concern in many applicant countries .
