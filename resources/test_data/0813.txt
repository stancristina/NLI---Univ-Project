There is no doubt that greater humanitarian efforts are needed in the form of food , and also in the form of medical aid , in order to reach the base level for the existing needs .
The Green group wants the construction of new nuclear power stations through KEDO to be stopped , or at least suspended temporarily until it has been possible to relieve the acute human catastrophe in North Korea .
Instead there is a need for other energy sources which can represent the future .
It is and should remain a national concern for a long time to come .
In the current situation , to generally abolish this principle could lead to great human tragedies , not least among refugees .
The overriding aim of the report is to establish a common European legal and judicial area .
International organized crime is best tackled through international , global cooperation at an intergovernmental level and through a developed cooperation such as in Interpol .
I am referring to Mrs Schaffner 's report on the report from the High-Level Panel on the freedom of movement of persons .
I think we ought to know what we are thinking and voting about on such an important issue .
In the current situation , I do not believe we can vote on Mrs Schaffner 's report unless we get the documents in all languages .
Madam President , Mrs Schaffner 's report is not the problem .
Mr President , let me begin by saying thank you to the rapporteur , Mr Väyrynen , for the very constructive work he has done on this report .
This means a doubling from the current level until the years immediately after the year 2010 .
The current draft directive includes an ambition on the part of the Commission to find common solutions for the whole of the Union , which is of course a good thing .
There are a lot of things in this report which I think are very urgent .
There is reason to take both these different sets of conditions into consideration .
The latter is seen as very important in principle .
That makes the limitation we have proposed with regard to Article 4 seem very important .
On the question of the latter , the European Parliament is still waiting for the Commission 's proposal on what changes are considered necessary .
Anything else would be a waste of resources .
It is highly desirable that there should eventually be common rules both with regard to driving and rest periods and with regard to technical systems for tachographs .
In a single market and in a Europe virtually without frontiers , certainly taking a somewhat longer-term view , this will become necessary .
I shall not therefore repeat those arguments , but simply stress that the Commission should get a yellow card for the way it deals with some of the issues which are of concern to us in Parliament .
This report points out , among other things , how remarkable it is that funds from the seventh European Development Fund have been used without any legal base to finance measures which come under the Fourth Lomé Convention .
Mr President , one of the most important tasks we have at national , European and international level is to prevent poverty and exclusion and to create social , economic and sustainable environmental development .
I think that in her report the rapporteur sums up in a very worthwhile way a proposal which goes further .
Firstly , as regards trade and reduced tolls and taxes , the EU has a special responsibility .
However , a majority of the group is opposed to a Tobin Tax and wants to reduce the number of references to ethical regulations in paragraph 17 .
Mr President , poverty can above all be tackled through economic growth , with rising real wages and growing tax bases .
The report does not contain a single word about economic growth as a condition for economic improvement .
The fact that a well-known economist has previously talked about such a system is not a guarantee for the idea 's political wisdom any more than that of the person who has an exaggerated respect for the games an advanced theorist plays with reality .
I believe it is necessary to make such a point .
I can say that in Sweden we have a large number of companies all over the country which employ disabled people .
It would be very important , I believe , to include the fact that this type of company belongs to the group which is granted exemptions .
I think it often seems in this House as if state aid just means that one country goes and steals work in some way , but that is only one side of the coin .
For example , if Spain wanted to subsidize wine exports to Sweden , Swedish consumers would just get cheaper wine .
I would therefore like us to have a somewhat less rigid view of this state aid .
Not only is it costly and an inefficient way to use public funds in the Member States , but it is also delaying an essential structural change which affects not only the individual region , but also the EU as a whole .
This is a credibility issue , not least in relation to third parties , that is , companies and their employees who are affected by unhealthy competitive disadvantages .
The Commission 's credibility now depends on sharpening the supervision of state aid which is talked about a lot in industry .
Mr President , I would like to begin by saying that I am very impressed by Mr Murphy 's work .
It is still an extremely complicated directive with a lot of diagrams and formulas which are extremely difficult to understand
