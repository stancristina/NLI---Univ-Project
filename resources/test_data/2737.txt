.
Thus Commissioner Wallstr√∂m is quite correctly linking this directive to the long and vitally , in the literal sense , important process which began in Rio in 1992 , ten years ago next week .
The directive being proposed is the first pillar in ratifying the Aarhus Convention .
The second pillar concerns public participation and Parliament will be able to start the second reading in the near future , as at the start of tomorrow 's session it will be announced that the Council 's common position has finally been received .
The third pillar aiming at ratifying the Aarhus Convention concerns access to justice and a proposal regarding this is currently being prepared by the Commission .
It is hoped that the Commission will be able to confirm this today .
The Council has also made a number of important proposals worthy of support , among which I would especially mention the Council 's definition of a public authority , which is an improved adaptation of the wording proposed by Parliament , as well as the Council 's adaptation of the point concerning access to justice .
The Council has not , however , taken into account Parliament 's proposal on reducing the time-limit within which authorities must respond from one month to two weeks .
The recommendation includes a compromise proposal , which has been copied from an act based on Article 255 of the Treaty of Rome , on access to information held by the Union 's institutions , which was accepted after the first reading of this directive proposal .
After the first reading , our British colleagues in the main put forward a concern about the fate of the sale of commercial information by authorities .
In my opinion this was a rushed gesture , and I did not see it as the best way of resolving the matter .
I support it , but in my view the original amendment rejected by the committee was better , as this new version is unlikely to delight the British either .
The Aarhus Convention has thus progressed many steps towards ratification and implementation in the European Union .
All the above have played a part in the conciliation process achieving an excellent result .
In any case the idea first presented in the Fifth Action Programme of integrating environmental policy with other policy areas is also the driving force behind this Sixth Action Programme and it is quite clear that only in this way can we make progress on environmental issues .
We recognise that this is not easy .
I am also satisfied that in conjunction with conciliation , agreement was reached on Parliament having full rights to participate in creating these strategies and deciding them and that they should be made sufficiently flexible .
Several important principles were approved in the conciliation process , among which it may be worth mentioning that for the first time we have a decision on European-wide environment taxes .
Of course , we do , however , have the Seville Summit decision on energy tax , for example .
New strength was found to combat climate change and traffic pollution is also increasingly becoming an integral part of this joint effort .
We hope that we will succeed in this .
The additional budget under discussion contains two central issues : budgeting last year 's surplus and the new system for own resources .
The new system for own resources was already in this year 's budget in December but it had to be removed because some Member States had not ratified it .
The 40 % reduction in the United Kingdom 's contribution will be retained in the system of own resources .
The most depressing part of this year 's additional budget is the budgeting of last year 's surplus .
This particularly concerns the Structural Funds in which under-utilisation stands at EUR 10.5 billion .
It tried to transfer powers belonging to Parliament to itself .
Fortunately , Parliament 's firm stand forced the Council to realise the facts and at the moment the updating of the regulation is progressing with better mutual understanding .
My group supports this position .
The misunderstanding arose because I was previously of the opinion that this amendment would not be discussed but since this is not the case , I will express my support for it .
Mr President , some here have said that we are now in the midst of reorganising what is a healthy system .
It is the only way of bringing some sparkle and life to the procedures of this House , which have definitely been fossilising over the years .
These reformed procedures , including the 'catch-the-eye ' system , appear to have worked extremely well - for example , for all the Members at open meetings of the Conference of Presidents - so I do not understand why they could not also be tried out more generally in plenary .
This is a matter of political choices , although we are also speaking about jurisprudence and rules .
However , this report contains a very subtle element of balance that meets demands for greater efficiency and the requirements of democracy .
As images of the European Parliament start to be transmitted everywhere in Europe over the Internet I hope the picture will be a little more colourful than the television test card , and that there will be colourful speeches and argument , and real debate here .
It is vital to have careful coordination of slots to improve efficiency and safety at airports .
Take-off and landing times are also of considerable economic importance for air carriers .
It is important to have a system of allocation of slots that is as flexible as possible for those companies , for example , that do business abroad .
Our group has tabled two amendments .
