I hope that in the future we shall find a way of ensuring the more efficient handling of petitions by the Commission and the Council .
I expect new developments to be generated by increased cooperation in the fields such as information technology , for example data compression and image processing , and in medical research , for example immunology , epidemiology and cardiovascular diseases , to mention only a few .
The Weizman Institute , an excellent academic institution which has maintained an office in Brussels for years , bears witness to the European direction of research in Israel .
This must not merely be attached to the aid in the form of a vague hope : it must be a condition of that aid .
Cereal stocks in the EU have been reduced .
Therefore the Commission 's arguments do not hold water .
We have just been told that by our Finnish colleague .
But we ought to recognize that we in the European Union are a community in which Spain borders onto the Czech Republic , and in which Bavaria also borders on Andorra .
Mr President , I asked to speak before Mr Hallam asked .
Does the Commission agree that this kind of link-up exists and share the view of the US Government , and will the Commission call for a WTO panel procedure prior to the American elections ?
Since Parliament took a very detailed decision on Helms-Burton very early on , and also on Iran/Iraq , the content of which basically is still entirely consistent with the situation there , I believe it has fulfilled its obligation and that it will continue to do so .
As even Mr Bangemann has said on occasion , that is indeed the real danger in some central areas .
Secondly : there is a need to improve the situation of all potential beneficiaries of the funds , not least in the disadvantaged regions and peripheral regions , who often receive information slowly or belatedly .
Paragraph 17 notes that noone , not even the Commission , knows where and how EU funding is actually used , because there is obviously a serious lack of information here .
In the case of Portugal , it is energy resources .
Two : we must make greater efforts to evaluate the actual effect of these programmes .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in 1995 we received an evaluation report on the transition from the third to the fourth framework programme .
To return to the beginning : we can only learn from the mistakes of the past if we constantly re-examine them , and it is extremely urgent that we do so in the context of the fifth framework programme .
A similar proposal did not obtain a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and was rejected by a majority and I would ask Members to do the same now in plenary .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a politician I am always pleased when we adopt legislative proposals that officials can actually apply without too much difficulty .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today 's discussion about driving licences is not in fact a major issue .
So long as we do not have uniform systems of fines we cannot take away driving licences for the whole of Europe on a uniform basis because the offences that may involve the withdrawal of a driving licence tend to be committed on holiday and not at home .
Mr President , I would like to endorse what the Commissioner and the previous speaker said .
This was to be done by opening up to the employment market needs that had so far not been met .
I hope , as I said , that the initiative will be rapidly and successfully implemented , in the interests of the unemployed workers , of social peace , and of the people who will benefit from the services provided .
These jobs must be brought out of the grey area .
I should just like to make a few necessary comments on the subjects covered by this report .
The potential which can be achieved at local level , but which is all too seldom used , or is even transferred elsewhere , must be exploited to the full .
Therefore I should like to point out that regional and local employment initiatives must be encouraged before anything else .
Do something ! ' , while another part of the Commission is actually extending this collapsing system .
We are therefore proposing that our group 's oral question should be put on the agenda for this week , and I also hope that the Christian Democrats will propose the same for the PPE Group 's question .
There are rights associated with the environment , because the inviolability of man also involves environmental considerations .
Human rights policy here is always primarily a question of protecting interests .
We must be very careful not to close our eyes to the human rights violations that are happening right here in the Union .
We welcome the fact that market distortions caused by the chartering by rotation system , for example , and overcapacity are to be eliminated by the scrapping fund and the 'old for new ' system .
Lastly , the committee also rejected by a large majority the request for urgent procedure on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures .
But in how many societies does teaching still look the same today as it did when you and I were at school ?
As has been said many times , we really do have a great responsibility here to connect our schools to the Internet , to provide media education in schools , and especially to do
