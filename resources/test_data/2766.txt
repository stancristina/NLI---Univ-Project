I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all , only disunity .
Nevertheless , new objectives have been included , specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000 , for which all rural regions will be eligible .
The third is economic and social rights , as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers , insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union .
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union .
However , we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government .
In this context , the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated .
As for the EU' s responsibility , the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship , in its broadest sense , of children .
There is no contradiction between the two .
I am referring ,of course , to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000 , the basic elements of which I would like to restate .
Secondly , the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties , specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union .
It cannot and must not act as if it were one .
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary .
We will soon have our first opportunity , and an excellent opportunity it will be , to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one .
The honourable Member raised the question .
Mr President , Commissioner , the framework directive which we are considering today at second reading is a kind of constitutional charter for water which will apply across the European Union .
Thanks to Mrs Lienemann' s excellent work , the amendments proposed by the Commission will go some way towards strengthening the directive ' s text and making it more rigorous .
My first concern is about the timetable laid down in the directive : it may prove to be a straitjacket although I think that it also represents a powerful challenge .
Is this a Utopian ideal ?
Mr President , it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission , and I will refer to this later on .
Thirdly , the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment ' s priorities is an extremely positive step .
There is no other such policy .
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House .
The discussions that were held in the 1980s and 1990s demonstrate the importance of social transfers .
The truth is that high levels of protection coexist well with the best indicators of productivity .
These challenges must be responded to as a matter of urgency .
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn , is the lowest in the whole of Europe .
I shall , of course , give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making .
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas : Firstly , there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players , by which I mean donors , requiring greater coordination , greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies ; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems .
Since 1995 , following a concerted international effort between the main donor states , involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee , it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies , both at national and international level .
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here , as has the Bretton Woods system .
As you know , an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies , and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency .
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost , as soon as possible , to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary .
Over the coming months , that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency , this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us .
This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development .
It has to be said that , in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy , the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development
