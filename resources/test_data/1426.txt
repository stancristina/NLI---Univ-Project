I asked for clarification ; I have absolutely no intention of arguing about the appropriateness of a Commission statement .
So that the debate may be held in an ordered fashion , which is what most concerns me , because this issue could distort the four important fisheries debates which we have on the agenda , it would be normal for this statement to be made after that debate , and that would then give us time to continue discussing this issue , although it seems that that will not be possible .
Mr Varela' s request is out of place .
Few cases of torture are admitted by the Spanish courts .
( ES ) Mr President , I should like to begin by praising the fine work done by my colleague , Salvador Garriga Polledo , in the report he is presenting on own resources , a subject he has been following very closely for some time .
If these rules were observed , the pertinent financial interests would be fully protected .
Thirdly , incomplete declarations must be mentioned .
I believe we should think about the real causes behind this incomprehensible fact .
My vote in support of the de Veyrac report on the application of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in the Member States of the European Union is based on the conviction that we must enhance the cultural dimension of the European Union .
Mr President , Mrs Jackson well expressed the concern of the members of the Committee on the Environment , which in my case is heightened since I belong to the European Parliament ' s Committee on Petitions .
This can give companies a competitive edge .
In these times when the younger generation can see that the quality of life is no longer closely linked to industrialisation and cities and large commercial centres , we have the obligation in the Union to encourage and help the younger generation to take over from the older so that the cycle of life and people in agriculture may be completed by means of new Community initiatives that have the young farmer as their priority objective .
In approaching this issue , we have to appraise elements that lie at the roots of our social structure , our territorial organisation , our economy , our culture and our civilisation itself .
The change from collectivised farming economies to situations that can be merged with the Community situation may trigger off speculative processes that will artificially raise market prices for land and thus increase young farmers ' difficulties in setting up or keeping themselves in the countryside .
Question No 26 by (H-0975/00 ) : Subject : Women persecuted without asylum or refuge In some countries women suffer cruel persecution and punishment , basic human rights violations which may involve mutilation and may cost them their lives .
Yes , Commissioner , it is a draft document , and you know that it will soon be going through the Spanish Parliament .
So , as it is such an important project for the joint development of the Spanish regions , I am sure that the comment , promise or statement that the Minister for the Environment has made on several occasions that this is an open document , that this is a draft , a proposal , and that the need for a consensus on it among all the regions affected is absolutely beyond doubt , my question , Commissioner , is as follows : in the framework of the closest cooperation between the Commission and the Spanish Government , and within the situations laid down in the framework directive , precisely what support can the Commission provide so that this project can progress as it should ?
Nevertheless , the British regulatory body has recognised that many of the measures already introduced by the company will still need time to take effect fully .
At the beginning of next month the Commission expects to approve a White Paper on the common transport policy , which will be accompanied by a review of guidelines on the trans-European transport network and possibly other initiatives to promote less polluting and more efficient transport systems .
The Commission will present a communication to show how these guidelines have been taken into account .
What I can tell you is that at the moment more than 50 % is already being earmarked for projects that have to do with the rail sector .
Lastly , in any case , in addition to this aid for renewable energies , which I believe is essential and is put forward not just as a statement but as an objective - and remember that for the first time concrete objectives tailored to each individual Member State are being proposed , and this is being done in the green electricity directive - I consider it vital to maintain support for research in the nuclear sector , especially into matters of safety , storage and waste treatment ( because burying it is not a solution ) , or into alternative issues such as the fusion system .
It is a problem that is out of control now , and what is more , I am afraid it will not be controllable unless we take major steps .
Waste incineration by itself cannot be a renewable energy .
I am sorry for what has happened , because I heard , or I think I heard the Commissioner say that he will keep up the dialogue and continue to regard NGOs as important , but in this context I should like to ask the following question : clearly , Commissioner , we as Members of Parliament , and specifically the Socialist Group , are not going to uphold or overlook the possible bad management by the NGO Liaison Committee ( CLONG ) , but we do think that the political principle of dialogue with the NGOs is very important , and a large proportion of these NGOs is represented by the
