That would not be worthy of our principles .
Mr President , I must begin by congratulating Mr Wurtz on his report and the Commissioner , Mr de Deus Pinheiro , on reaching an agreement on altering the Fourth Lomé Convention .
On the other hand , we should couple the aid we give with an opening of our market to their considerable production .
As for development cooperation , the European Parliament has always been at the forefront and always supported the Commission .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank you , on behalf of the ACP countries , for the effort you have made to improve that cooperation .
But in any case I wish to congratulate him even though I disagree , on a particular issue , with the position taken by Mr Collins .
I would like to touch upon a number of points .
This directive represents one annual Community budget .
This is a requirement of equal opportunities , citizenship and democracy .
The proposals for a regulation that we have from the Commission are prejudicial against Community producers and ACP countries and overlook the principle of Community preference .
I wish him a speedy recovery .
Therefore I call on my colleagues to support the excellent Santini report and the amendments by the Committee on Agriculture .
We would agree if the Commission had wanted to change the production support system , to make the compensatory amounts more flexible , based on a specific calculation that reflected each region 's production .
Madeiran producers , since Portugal joined the Union , applauded the COM but are now concerned that important into the Community might be increased , which would obviously overload the market with negative effects on their interests .
Community structural assistance for Ireland Mr President , all European Councils have a story behind them and some will go down in history .
It was also decided to defer all decisions concerning enlargement and employment , because enlargement cannot disturb the road towards a single currency , which is now a final decision , as the unemployed who so often have been called the priority of priorities should and could hope for .
Mr President , unfortunately , in Singapore , nothing was done about the environment .
Mr Santer , you can be sure that we are going to censor this behaviour by the Commission concerning trade and environment and in particular the issue of leg-hold traps .
These include growing social problems and , in particular , the serious scourge of unemployment , citizen participation in Community life and decision making and whether or not to apply the principles of Community cohesion and solidarity which are enshrined in the Treaty .
New guidelines and , in our view , a farreaching change are vital .
But this is quite symptomatic and revelatory of a certain conception of the European Community .
Not only because we thought that those criteria were artificial and arbitrary in any way , but also because , primarily , the difficulties in fulfilling them are quite obvious even on the part of countries with the stronger economies ! - and secondly because the real aim is the creation of a strong currency and , in the end , we always suspected that the final decisions in this area would be - or will be , finally adopted according to markedly political criteria .
But this time , in our view , these texts are taking on greater importance because they include the political , public and universal promises of the Dutch presidency and also because they are contradicting the recent declarations by the Dutch Finance Minister , Gerrit Zalm , who , with no or with very little restraint , condemned the southern European countries to ostracism as far as the single currency is concerned .
Secondly , it was offensive vis-à-vis the efforts made by governments , citizens and countries which believe in a European compromise and are doing everything to fulfil the belt-tightening policies which are called for .
Declarations of this type from the Moroccan authorities in my opinion are quite worrying and unacceptable .
But once these proposals are on the table , then we have to have a process of compromise and given that either we have to have a possibility for a compromise to be reached between the Commission and the Council or else the lack of agreement between the Commission and the Council will only be enhanced .
But I would like to ask - and I really must insist quite clearly on this to the Commissioner - is whether there really is a will on the Commission 's part to involve Member States in particular Spain and Portugal in the preparation already or after 1999 , or otherwise all we are doing is postponing the problem ?
Therefore - and I agree with what Mr McCartin said , everything pointed to the need for a common forestry policy .
I think that bringing about at this stage a common forestry strategy will only make sense if it is carried out gradually in the future as part of a genuine common forestry policy with express aims , the relevant application instruments and appropriate financial means .
First of all since the CAP reform in 1992 farming and forestry land are increasingly interchangeable in terms of market situation .
The subject of workers ' participation in the system of social relations in which some people see ways of exploiting the labour force and others of a non-social combination of productive factors is one of the most interesting we can discuss .
The report does not make clear this vital distinction and nor does it avoid the risks of that possible identification .
Mr President , Commissioner , there is a certain historical reality in each European country which must be defended .
The Commission should not wait for those who have not
