, and it is this message we must convey to the Council tomorrow , so I hope for as broad a majority as possible .
I also wish to thank many more people who contributed to this , but one in particular : Mr Cashman .
I must say that , in any event , Amendment 81 shows where Mr Weber and 41 others stand .
After all , Europe is there for everyone .
Adjustments do not need to be carried out immediately ; we do not expect Member States to adapt railway stations straight away .
It is more likely that the various grounds are interconnected and there is not just one ground for her being discriminated against .
European citizens must be given an instrument to enforce their rights .
In a free Europe , everyone must have the freedom to hold their own convictions .
This is unacceptable .
Parents may choose a school that is conscientious in this regard and takes the Bible seriously .
In the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supported this report , because it represented a reasonable compromise .
What you really want is the rejection of the entire proposal .
This is not about the employment of teachers .
Let us please stick to the facts .
In the Netherlands , for example , they perform some social care services .
If I drive for one more minute in a country because I need to move my car , I could be faced with sky-high fines in a different country weeks later .
Since the Regulation entered into force , complaints have been pouring in about the application of this Regulation - 'unclear ' and 'unreasonable ' are words often heard .
There is evidently scope under the current legislation for a discriminatory approach to foreign lorry drivers , in particular , on Europe 's roads , which is unacceptable .
Even though the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency has today been awkwardly scheduled between electricity and gas , we are discussing important and very tangible measures that are of direct importance to every consumer , every driver , in fact to most of us in Europe .
This is what is known as pure profit , profit for the consumer and , above all , profit for the environment .
It goes without saying that environmental friendliness should never be at the expense of safety , and this is why we have tabled amendments to this effect .
This is a measure that is of hardly any cost to the tyre industry , and therefore also to the consumer .
I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to the shadow rapporteurs , Mrs Chambris from the European Commission and Mr Sousa de Jesus from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats for our excellent working relationship .
It may have been possible - I do not know - if we had been able to discuss these three years into his term of office , because many interesting suggestions were made .
I think that the discussion about a positive DAS should be continued without let-up .
I should specifically like to ask my fellow MEPs to endorse paragraph 105 , which relates to the voluntary pension fund .
The Czech Presidency also recognised the significance of this dossier , and I think we achieved a sound result , not least for everyone who wants to move freely in Europe .
In 2009 , we were supposed to be moving towards complete freedom , according to both the Commission and the Council .
It is anything but workable , Mr Simpson .
The first question is : what should the government do , and what should we leave to the market through tendering ?
The report is clear about the fact that urban mobility is a part of the transport sector where many challenges and opportunities lie .
I am indebted to the European Commission for coming up with proposals to lower the thresholds for this fund , and I am pleased that Mr Stockmann has embraced these proposals with the necessary dynamism .
We have a well-stocked fund for sustainable transport .
At this rate , we will not achieve the European environmental objectives , and our intention to emit 20 % less CO2 by 2020 will come to nothing .
I cannot emphasise that enough , since we have , of course , been talking about a great many other things in the context of cross-border healthcare : the free movement of medical services and what to do regarding the market in healthcare .
Cross-border care has , of course , long been possible for anyone who can pay for it , but something needs to be done also for those who cannot pay .
Moreover , we are of the opinion that patients who are already so ill should not , if something goes wrong , have to engage in lengthy legal proceedings ; instead , a European ombudsman system for patients should be put in place .
On the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety we have of course had a disagreement about this , and I call on all Members on the left to just set ideology aside this time and ensure that we adopt a good directive for patients and take a pragmatic approach .
We consider that everyone , rich and poor , has a right to adequate access to high quality healthcare .
Given that we have 27 countries with 27 different health care systems , the Commission 's proposal , based solely on Article 95 - the famous harmonisation article - will lead to the dismantling of the national healthcare systems and thus remove the responsibilities from the Member States .
