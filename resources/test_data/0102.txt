It is not a coincidence that hundreds or even thousands of people from Ghana should appear at certain periods .
It is a sector which could set an example for many others , and the best thing about this proposal is that it finally sets out in black and white who needs to do what to strengthen our competitive position , it being clear that the main responsibility in this respect lies with the chemical industry itself .
Mr Bangemann , you look like a man who likes to eat well : just try asking the head chef in a five-star restaurant whether he would be prepared to do this .
We also need to ensure that these cultural aspects are treated on an equal footing with all other aspects .
In this respect , I entirely agree with Mr von Habsburg that we must try to eliminate these kinds of obstacles , even with countries with which we have partnership agreements .
I had the pleasure of accompanying the Dutch presidency and President Santer to the Moscow summit ten days ago , and if I tell you that the partnership agreement with Russia was concluded two years ago , as was the agreement with Ukraine , and we are still struggling to have them both ratified , you will have some idea of the effort required to persuade all 15 Member States to conclude the ratification process in good time .
I find this most regrettable , because the link between cormorants and fish stocks has never been clearly proved .
I welcome the fact that Mr Camis√≥n Asensio and myself are totally ad idem on the priority of this project and on the importance of international links between Member States .
The smooth resumption of trade is regularly addressed in our talks with Israel and with the Palestinian authorities , especially with the leadership of the PLO .
I repeat that it is difficult to continue discussion on these questions and answers because I do not know the Regulation nor the Commission 's answer to the written questions put by Mrs Hautala .
Land mines used to be a military weapon , nowadays they are an instrument of terror which in the wrong hands spread death and destruction .
I think he has a rather one-sided view of this issue .
The major winner of this policy change in Europe is the treasuries of the Member States which will have considerable increases in their excise revenue because the big tax-free sales , which were always an anomaly for normal intraCommunity traffic , will cease and be replaced with normal tax levies .
And in addition to that there was a six-year transition period .
So it cannot be seen in isolation .
This subject as such is not really on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference but will be studied in a group of senior officials which was set up by the Dublin European Council and which was instructed to report in a very short time on organised crime in Europe and beyond , in so far as Europe is involved .
I repeat : all efforts on the part of the Council and of the Members of the Council must be directed at creating the political environment for smoothing the path towards the start of the accession negotiations with Cyprus .
I wish to state that the Dutch presidency attaches the greatest importance to doing everything in its power to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference under its presidency , and that is because of the political link between the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference and the start of accession negotiations .
Incidentally Parliament may ask the Commission itself to release funds for victims of disasters by adopting a resolution , for example , in its debates on urgent questions .
We must keep that in mind .
The Italian drift nets in particular catch less than 20 percent of the total allowable catch of tuna and sword fish , the remaining 80 percent is by-catch .
I do not think this is a very nice way of doing things !
The system is totally out of date ; it is oldfashioned and actually invites fraud .
It has already broken a lot of new ground : UCLAF is required not only to record everything that goes wrong but primarily it has to be a channel for information , a nerve centre and above all UCLAF must be empowered to forward dossiers to the judiciaries of the Member States .
I think we are all aware that the issue we are about to vote on is extremely sensitive .
( NL ) Mr President , I think the best thing Parliament can do at this time is to approve the resolution backing the workers at Vilvoorde .
So let us now vote on this resolution .
So I think ultimately we shall have to have some form of European customs administration or other .
It is a weak link in the system .
That is essential , because then the context becomes clear .
So we shall have to be rather tough in our negotiations with the Swiss , given their missed opportunity for honorary membership , on this question of those who protect the fraudsters operating on Community territory or with the territory of the European Union .
Madam President , Mrs Green said she thought it rather poor that so few people were present here at the start of this debate .
The sums involved are staggering , as the report tells us .
Likewise the case of those countries which cause us truly enormous problems , and here I fully agree with Mr Dankert who said that Commissioner Monti rather shrugged them off , I refer to Switzerland , the Isle of Man , Cyprus and Gibraltar too , countries which provide shelter on a large scale and refuse to co-operate in any way
