It is now the eve of its conclusion and we are aware of the progress which has been made , the partial results which have been achieved , but frankly , over almost ten months of a major Intergovernmental Conference , there has been no rapprochement of the positions , Mr Védrine , and no definition of agreements , not to mention the fact that some of the topics indicated by Parliament in its resolution of 13 April , ranging from the regulation of the economy to the institutional implications of the common defence policy , have not even been debated .
If this contradiction is responsible for the negative outcome of the Conference , it will mean a crisis for European integration .
On the other hand , I would stress the considerable importance of providing our Europe with strong institutions to fill the institutional void being created by progress on the economic front with the euro .
That , Mr President , is why we are launching an appeal in this House to prevent Brussels and Strasbourg being reduced to forums for national party political issues .
At this point , I would just like to mention a few specific aspects of the next few days and emphasise the Commission 's determination to achieve a high level Summit which will , at last , make it possible for our institutions to function properly once the great process of enlargement that we are undertaking has been accomplished .
I am well aware that 15 countries will make the decisions at Nice and that the role of the Presidency is not to be a one-man-band , but I have also learned through experience what the role of the Presidency and the responsibility of the French Presidency are .
In recent weeks , we have with great confidence and responsibility presented the French Presidency with a series of major decisions to be taken , aware of the role that France has consistently played in advancing the progress of the European institutions .
There are France , Spain , Germany : all the countries save Belgium and Italy have reasons for being unwilling to change from unanimous voting to qualified majority voting .
I feel that , in addition to expressing sympathy towards a leading figure , an important Italian political leader who has also been a Member of this House , Parliament must firmly condemn such incidents and show its solidarity with the victims .
It would therefore be appropriate for Parliament to endeavour to avoid there being such a huge discrepancy between its fine declarations of principles and harsh reality .
( The President cut the speaker off )
For various reasons , not least in order to unleash them on Kashmir once they have conquered the whole of Afghanistan , so that they will create anti-Indian hostility there once again .
As far as we are concerned , the only reform possible was put forward by the Socialist Group when it tabled 3 amendments to the Bösch report , which we discussed during the last part-session .
Those with legislative responsibility cannot , and must not , let themselves be influenced by emotion and must not accept proposals in toto which , although the product of brilliant minds , do not follow the principle of representativeness .
They must be accountable but not subjected to humiliation .
Before we start to talk about aid to projects , we should try to remove all the existing causes of exploitation , identifying and bringing to justice those who have exploited and abused peoples which are in a state of need .
Our past and recent history has been dotted with calamities , and that might also seem quite natural , though upsetting , if we did not remember that 75 % of them have been caused by human hand .
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , transport by sea is undoubtedly one of the least environmentally damaging modes of transport .
Madam President , this is a point of order concerning Rule 44 .
I note with satisfaction that this acknowledges the high quality of the end-result arrived at on 21 November by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the basis of a transparent and balanced compromise between the various positions .
Watts report ( A5-0343/2000 )
A pensioner to whom I mentioned that this document by Mr Hatzidakis was going to be discussed exclaimed , ' But could n' t you have thought of that before ? ! ' .
I remember when the inspectors of the states that had to check the ship came on board .
What I mean is that the European Union should become a true union of states , with a parliament placed at the centre of lawmaking .
But are these wars really necessary ? ! ' .
Joining forces is a positive step . ' .
That is why we voted for the Lalumière report , but with many reservations and objections concerning the aggressive tone found in some parts of the resolution which , in any case , we shall fight to avoid .
They have given their pension contributions to the various national governments , which have quickly made them vanish like clever magicians .
I have voted in favour of the Lamassoure report , which concerns itself most of all with the institutional aspects of Commission reform .
This is absolutely essential !
It seems no easy task .
We believe that this report needs further consideration , which is why we would ask to be able to discuss it and vote on it in January .
By merging three pre-existing directives , we are obviously staying strictly within the boundaries of improving the operation of the internal market without , however , renouncing forging ahead with a harm-reduction strategy and curbing a true scourge : smoking , which is costly in both social and economic
