the context of the free movement of persons , this report really is a step in the right direction .
This would clearly also involve reviewing the Maastricht criteria .
This text has been streamlined and updated and takes account of the rulings of the Court of Justice , but also of the current realities of employment and of certain types of self-employed workers .
Access to care is increasingly becoming a privilege of the wealthy .
What sort of results do we need from Canc√∫n to ensure the success of this negotiating round , which , at Doha , we called the 'development programme ' ?
Some things in it , I repeat , are not acceptable .
On this point , I would simply remind Mrs Lucas that these four subjects - investment , business facilitation , transparency in public purchasing and competition - form part of the negotiating programme drawn up at Doha , it being understood that we have to come to an agreement on how negotiations are to be conducted .
Among the negotiations , the programme for which was adopted at Doha , there are talks on the relationship between the rules on the environment and those on trade .
This is not the case : there are in fact about nineteen others .
In a sense , in establishing these systems , we have taken unilateral action to support developing countries .
In short , on this point , the situation is perfectly clear .
At the WTO negotiation table , the interests of developing countries are expressed by government representatives from these countries .
I do not overestimate the 10 % of the work we have completed .
You have said so yourself , Commissioner .
We know some disabled people are excluded , dependent and live in poverty .
This indicates the desirability of a legally-binding instrument and specific legal protection for disabled people the world over .
Essentially , what is at issue are the so-called access rights : rights to access a job , buildings , email and the Internet .
This story sends a cold shiver down the spine .
They also suggest a need to collate precise statistics in order to assess the extent of the violence .
Recognising the need to combat this violence is difficult , but so is recognising the very existence of the problem .
We need to acknowledge that violence exists , and that it kills , every single week and in every single country .
Combating violence , in all its forms , is not limited to a single programme called DAPHNE.
Interesting as the amendments may be , they have no place here .
It would not have been able to supply us with the statistics we required whilst not providing it with the necessary means .
They are suffering as a result of the policy of confrontation with the United States after 44 years of the blockade and the Helms-Burton law .
You invited me to come at the beginning of July but I had not yet presented the text of our work to the Council Presidency and because it is the Council Presidency that called for this work to be done , it was , therefore , to the Council that we were bound to submit the text first .
Today , the idea of a Constitution for Europe has entered the consciousness of the European : Europe 's citizens are now ready for the Constitution .
Every proposal , every amendment , every alternative solution , whether it came from a Convention member , a Member State , the European Commission , civil society or , of course , from the European Parliament has been rigorously examined and pored over with a critical and objective eye .
Another proposal is the clear , transparent and stable definition of the Union 's competences , and these are three aspects that I wish to reiterate .
The Council of Ministers will be refocused towards the tasks of the Legislative and General Affairs Councils and the various formations within it will be regrouped .
At the behest of Giuliano Amato , the Convention has succeeded in undertaking an enormous task of simplifying and classifying European decisions .
The Intergovernmental Conference will open in precisely one month , under the Italian Presidency , a representative of which will perhaps say something about this a little later .
By probably satisfying a few people , they run the risk of dissatisfying and disappointing everyone else .
It must , therefore , adhere to specific rules .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , President Giscard d'Estaing , I am addressing you in your own language because I wish first of all to salute your consistency , together with your campaign for Europe which do not just date from the time since you were a Member of the European Parliament .
Indeed , all Europeans , both men and women , could identify with this speech made 2 500 years ago .
In no circumstances can it aspire to restrict for thirty to fifty years - for that is the lifespan of this document , as promised by President Giscard d'Estaing - the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own model of society .
It is valid in terms of the economic and social dimensions of this project , as well as in terms of its political dimension , since Article 40 , for example , foresees the common security and defence policy being , and I quote , 'compatible with the ? policy established within [the ] framework [of NATO] . '
What referendum , however ?
We could have effected a political revolution by declaring our independence , affirming our vision of a multipolar world and defending the central role of the United Nations in world affairs
