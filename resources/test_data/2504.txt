However , the Commission cannot accept any deviation from the procedural rules laid down in the Transparency Directive .
The proposal will improve health protection for our children and it will simultaneously promote innovation and competitiveness in the European medicinal products industry .
This regulation on the security of children’s medical products is a great success for patients in Europe .
The Commission ’s proposal , made in April of last year , for a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme should signal our willingness to follow up the analysis with the necessary effective steps to more growth and employment .
Special thanks go to the Austrian Presidency of the Council , which has truly embraced the cause of innovation and the aim of its adoption within the term of its incumbency .
This is a new principle and an important contribution to the simplification of procedure , an important step in cutting red tape , and I am confident that the Commission will ensure that detailed inquiries will always find the relevant , competent consultant .
The magnetic-levitation train that you all know , the Transrapid , was invented as early as 1934 , and we still have not managed to realise it in Europe .
I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to Commissioner Almunia for the clarity of his report and of his stance , and I make a point of saying this because a year ago , during the review of the Stability and Growth Pact , I was rather inclined to think of the Commission as too compliant .
We deliberated and agreed that countries would not be named , but that we wanted , on the other hand , to enter into discussions with the Commission and the European Central Bank on the setting of the rate of inflation , another area in which differences exist .
I say this because Parliament will ask the Commission whether it can vouch for the data on which it bases its recommendation .
That is why I wish to stress most emphatically that interreligious dialogue must be a major part of intercultural dialogue .

It standardises and improves legal protection for the victims of discrimination in the workplace .
For example , we need to examine even more closely the causes of the pronounced segregation in the labour market and must also make the public out there , where it happens , more aware of it .

I am very pleased that the institutions have worked together so well on this matter , producing an acceptable and modern text , which will hopefully look to a better future for gender equality .     .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think it is most important that we should remind ourselves that the Commission really is , in this respect , the guardian of Community law and that it regards the two European anti-discrimination directives as the fundamental instrument in the fight against inequality .
In countries such as Iraq and Palestine , they are excluded from assuming political responsibility ; in the conflict in Sudan , sexual violence is getting out of hand .
That , however , is not the point I want to make .
The proposal for a split vote on Parts 2 , 3 and 4 refers only to the amendments to the English version and not to the versions in other languages .
Nevertheless , the real aim of those responsible for EU military policy is to be able , quite independently of NATO and without help from the USA , to conduct military interventions anywhere in the world – as is now happening in Congo .
At one point , the report goes so far as to encourage the EU to ‘give greater attention to the presence , preparation , training and equipment of police forces forming part of its military missions , since police units constitute the most important means whereby the security of the civilian population , particularly women and children , may be guaranteed . ’ Precisely what the ideology of what is alleged to be ‘humanitarian intervention ’ is doing in this report remains a secret known only to the grand coalition in the European Parliament that advocates , with neither ifs nor buts , the militarisation of the EU.
Of course I must take note of it , becoming cleverer is also a good democratic right .
