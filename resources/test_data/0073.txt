As many have mentioned , it is to be welcomed in this respect that the legislation is now to cover heavier vehicles , so that stricter requirements on car equipment will counter the trend towards ever larger cars .
It is also to be welcomed that requirements on the design of car front ends have been imposed , so that any collision with a vulnerable living human being does as little harm as possible to the unlucky person .
However , we need to go down to 40 km/h for this to make sense .
The requirements on this should have been even stricter , as should the time limit .
It is not the rapporteur 's fault that this has been progressing so slowly .
It is depressing if this is the reason why we have again ended up with a proposal that falls short of our wishes , by which I mean the wish for fewer deaths and injuries on the roads .
It is !
Although Mrs Lambert 's report on the evaluation of the Dublin system contains viewpoints and proposals that I do not support , I decided to vote in favour of the report in the final vote .
The June Movement is evaluating fuel cells that use hydrogen as an energy carrier based on renewable energy such as solar , wind and wave power as a system for transport because it is a clean fuel , i .e . there is no particle pollution and at the same time the fuel can be produced using renewable energy .
This is far outperformed by electric vehicles running on computer-controlled lithium batteries , which have an energy efficiency level of 80-90 % .
At the same time , millions of batteries could solve the storage problem for renewable energy .
Therefore , we would like to work towards the Commission taking steps towards promoting this alternative .
Now that two proposals for the Ports Directive have failed , this must be rethought .
Therefore , it is the correct strategy at present for the Commission to prepare guidelines for state support .
There may be questions about how far into a port a road is considered a public project and the point at which this becomes the port 's responsibility .
It is important that there is openness and transparency in questions concerning state support and I would like to give my wholehearted support to the rapporteur 's recommendations in this connection .
In terms of the overall picture , port expansions improve the environment by promoting maritime transport , which is more environmentally sound .
Greater clarity will also ensure that environmental matters do not arise that in reality are merely aimed at delaying and complicating port expansion - matters that have not been raised out of genuine concern for the environment .
The Commission will promote the development of a port network and ensure the development of good supporting investments .
How we get goods to and from ports is a major problem and good traffic links on land should be better reflected in the EU 's support programmes in future , not only in regional support but perhaps also in a programme such as Marco Polo .
In addition , I think that it would be a good result for the consultation process if the dialogue between the social partners could be more constructive in future .
This requires a focus on qualifications and training .
I would like to wish Mr Ortuondo luck with an excellent report and look forward to the Commission implementing the action plan .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Haug for her sterling efforts in keeping all the different aspects of this budget procedure together .
For the ALDE Group , energy and climate policy , as well as research and innovation , were important priorities for the 2009 budget .
In view of Russia 's invasion of Georgia , it was important to the ALDE Group both to secure reconstruction aid for Georgia and to support the development of the Nabucco gas pipeline , which is intended to ensure a supply of gas to Europe outside Russian control .
We are pleased that a majority has supported these priorities .
The present draft budget eliminates a number of the Council 's savings and gives a more realistic assessment of the needs for payment over the coming years .
The budgetary ceilings for foreign policy go on being too restrictive , and every year we have to fight to fund new priorities .
The Commission has proposed funding the food facility for developing countries using the money saved from the EU 's export refunds .
The idea is right , but in terms of the budget we must do things differently so that we comply with the agreements entered into between the institutions .
It is not fair to obtain this money by cutting down on important programmes for poor countries .
The background to this proposal was that we wanted to pressure the Commission into doing more to avoid the errors in the region of 12 % that emerged during the debate for the discharge of the 2006 budget .
Mr Lewandowski had an interesting task in preparing Parliament 's and the other institutions ' budget .
I think he has managed to obtain a good compromise in which Parliament 's budget stays below 20 % of the administrative expenditure .
The June Movement has voted against Amendment 208 in the report , as the outbreak of infectious animal diseases is due to insufficient veterinary separation of the animals .
It is therefore farmers and their industry that bear the responsibility and the risk associated with the proper handling of the animals to avoid disease .
I am pleased to be a member of a political group , namely the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , that does not compromise on the health and safety of workers
