The summit took place one year after the adoption of the four roadmaps for the Common Spaces and thus provided a good opportunity to review the progress made since then .
The summit was the occasion for the signature of the visa facilitation and readmission agreements .
The readmission agreement will help tackle illegal immigration , an issue of growing concern to both the EU and Russia .
That was extremely helpful as we prepare for the European Council discussions on the external aspects of EU energy policy on the basis of the joint paper by the Commission and the High Representative .
As for the future framework for EU-Russia relations , the Summit agreed that our aim should be to replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with a new , durable , comprehensive and legally-binding agreement which should be capable of promoting the further development of EU-Russia relations .
If the Council is in a position to adopt them by the next EU-Russia Summit , negotiations could begin by the end of this year .
For both the EU and Russia , Russia’s WTO accession remains a key priority .
In that context , let me report to Parliament that we are making good progress on agreeing a new framework document for the renovated Northern Dimension policy .
We hope to have an agreement in time for the senior officials ’ meeting in Finland in September .
The dialogue which has developed with Russia over recent months , in particular on Iran and the Middle East , is a sound example of the EU and Russia working to put the concept of effective multilateralism into practice .
A number of other sensitive issues were discussed in a constructive spirit at the summit .
The EU stressed the importance of Russia ratifying the border agreement with Estonia and signing and ratifying the border agreement with Latvia .
The EU also raised its continuing concerns with regard to the situation in Chechnya , notably in the light of the most recent visit by the UN High Representative for Human Rights , Louise Arbour .
As the EU-Russia strategic partnership develops , the need for EU coherence becomes all the more essential .
What did we awake to ?
In this connection , we hopefully awoke to the problems of the free passage of energy , which have become evident from the events in Ukraine and Russia .
What happened before the first cold spell of the year ?
That suited Russia , as long as Russia would receive market prices for the gas and not just for transit .
In this connection , then , we hopefully awoke to the fact that these problems of transit are serious and stability is also needed in transit countries , and not just in Russia , when it comes to gas supplies .
Energy is a barometer of EU and Russian policy and the EU and Russian economies .
The interruptions in January left Europe in a partial state of emergency .
What then could be done about this ?
Russia wants long-term supply contracts so that it can focus on investing in equipment to guarantee its own energy supply .
Contracts guarantee the position of both buyer and seller , and they create stability in the energy supply .
Action could be taken during the Finnish Presidency , as we in Finland have had a long energy partnership with Russia with very long-term agreements , and there have been no worries about reliability of operations , even though Russia has had a couple of revolutions in the last 15 years .
Madam President , thank you for a very serious and substantive debate .
I fully agree with Mr Winkler in that regard .
We want both human rights and energy .
Let me point out that in the field of human rights we have established a set of formal consultations and we have had three meetings since the launch of these consultations in 2005 .
I want to inform you that we will be holding the next meeting of these consultations in November in Moscow and will be pursuing the idea of closer involvement of NGOs .
On energy , Mr Kelam referred to the interdependence between the EU and Russia .
We can also say that we not only have interdependence but also import dependence , since by 2020 the EU will have to import around 70 % of the gas it consumes .
We are therefore working to ensure that sufficient additional quantities of gas can come into the EU and we will have to look at all possible sources and routes , including Turkey , incidentally .
One of Europe’s greatest challenges will be to reduce dependence on energy imports and on fossil fuels .
In this regard the main concern within the EU is the apparent lack of a level playing field .
In this context , the rules applicable to Gazprom , notably EU competition rules , would be no different to those applied to any other company .
The fact that Gazprom is the exclusive supplier of gas from Russia to the EU would have to be taken into account in any objective analysis .
I want to finish with this , because this is a very important strategic issue in EU-Russia relations .
In this regard , it is important to note that the WTO accession process is now coming to its final phase and we expect that this condition will soon be met by Russia .
Let me conclude now , because I know that many colleagues have more important things to do .     I am very pleased to hear that , Commissioner .
I should like to ask a question regarding the more general work regarding patent policy .
We now have a lot of proposals on the table , such as the Community patent , a European patent litigation agreement and
