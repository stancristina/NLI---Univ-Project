Amendment No 54 will make it possible to extend the safety margins around new high-risk installations , to include , amongst other things , apartment blocks , transport routes , industrial buildings and recreation areas .
I believe , therefore , that the proposed amendment is quite representative of the conflict that we have here .
The educational choices which have to be made on this subject are the responsibility of parents and the family .
This is a debate about people 's rights , and the reproductive rights that we are talking about this evening represent a further step forward .
Even Mrs Van Lancker recognises this in her report , and I quote , ' ... the legal or regulatory policy concerning reproductive health falls within the Member States ' sphere of competence ' .
What , then , is the framework for good practice ?
The third point , which really concerns me , is that I believe that at the present time , the combination of the recommended longer period during which abortion will be allowed and the progress being made in science which means that potential anomalies in unborn children can be diagnosed increasingly early , plus the progress being made in bio-ethics , carries with it a risk .
I should like to thank most sincerely the rapporteur , Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl , for the very thorough work which she has done on the proposal for these rules , in close collaboration with the intervention zones .
I should just like to say a word about the Euratom participation rules .
Denmark is also synonymous with enlargement , as Mr Rasmussen reminded us several times .
Secondly , with regard to illegal immigration , the previous presidency made the fight against illegal immigration one of its priorities .
Your country , Mr President-in-Office , has opted out .
The chosen solution does not seem to be the best way to create a more stable and united Europe , which is the aim of enlargement .
My second example is the Earth Summit in Johannesburg and its implications for our entire planet .
Denmark is proof that it is possible to take part in Europe without sacrificing more to the Brussels system than is strictly necessary .
The importation of products must not result in the insidious introduction into Member States of foods made from transgenic crops that we do not allow our own farmers to grow .
The corporate giants in the realms of agri-food , chemicals and biotechnology are clearly not keen on the imposition of excessively restrictive rules and are even less favourably disposed to the introduction of proper scrutiny , particularly in view of the legitimacy of consumers ' fears .
The Scheele report endorses a highly exceptionable centralised European system for the authorisation of GMOs , as proposed in communication COM(2001 )425 final from the Commission .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
The height of absurdity is reached when the Commission calls on Member States not to prosecute in cases of illegal abortions !
It is certainly true that too many pregnant women find themselves in situations of human or material distress .
How can anyone attach any credit to a US Administration that has just increased its subsidies to cotton farmers or to the governments of the EU Member States that refused to commit themselves in Doha to a timetable for the reduction of their subsidies on agricultural exports ?
This is the price that has to be paid to rid the world of hunger .
From that point of view , Europe has but one political option , namely to pursue a policy of redressing the balance , because otherwise we shall truly become America 's poodle .
Moreover , it is to be feared that the international situation will lead to a resurgence of such acts .
Thank you , Commissioner , for this proposal , which the report is intended to reaffirm .
Commissioner , Mr President , let me conclude by saying to you that this report will be voted down in any event , which I regret , for unless we grant economic , social and ? ( The President cut the speaker off )
If racism is to be combated more effectively on a day-to-day basis , it is not enough to adopt legislative acts .
In view of the huge social impact of these operations , it is imperative that representatives of the workforce and the other interested parties be consulted before any final decisions are made , as proposed by Mr Goebbels and Mr Berenguer Fuster in their amendments .
This , Mr President , is a crucial point .
In terms of form , the text employs typical methods to extend European competences .
What we must do , of course , is take initiatives and introduce regulations at world level .
They are the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining , the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour , the effective abolition of child labour and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation .
To tackle this problem , the report recommends , amongst other things , that the EU-ILO partnership be reviewed and improved - this process is under way , which is to be welcomed ; that the ILO obtain observer status at the WTO ; that the ILO decisions , particularly the results of its monitoring procedures , be published and that the Union genuinely take them into account in its relations with third countries .
Mr President , first of all , I think we should congratulate Mrs Gillig on this report .
We are today reaffirming , Mr President , Commissioner , that the universal application of fundamental rights is , obviously , a prerequisite for making progress .
We also demand that sanctions be principally aimed at transnational companies that fail to observe
