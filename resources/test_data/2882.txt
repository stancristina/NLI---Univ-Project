more quickly , and I think that we should stand firm on that view .
In general , the European Parliament is more in favour of an open European rail transport market and of European railway companies than the Council .
In some countries they are , but in others they definitely are not .
Indeed , my request that the agreement between the social partners be ratified took its inspiration from the social sphere .
This package gives the railways the opportunity of ‘recapturing ’ the transport market .
I should also like to warn , however , that in so doing we must not hinder a number of countries from liberalising freight transport .
I should like to advocate that a great deal of attention be paid to the interconnection of route plans at international level , therefore .
When that system failed , State-owned companies came along , and tried to develop a uniform model for their respective countries as far as possible .
They all have in common that they envisage an important role for rail transport again in the future , too ; and that represents progress in relation to the time when the railways were consigned to the museum of nineteenth century curiosities .
This package undoubtedly has the potential to contribute to this , provided it is properly developed and implemented .
The same goes for a number of proposals contained in the report by Mrs Ainardi .
Nowadays , however , Flanders feels the need to reactivate this railway line , in view of the growing problems with container traffic in Flanders , the Netherlands and Germany , which is growing at an exponential rate .
The Sterckx , Ainardi and Savary reports are more in tune with the needs of today .
I hope that the European Agency carries out a clear evaluation of this , and that we include this aspect in the debate on trans-European networks .
The first rail package was aimed at opening up freight transport , particularly internationally , and set a specific date .
We should have an evaluation first , and then a debate on how to proceed with this kind of liberalisation .
He deserves praise for striving for the complete liberalisation of freight transport by 2006 .
The recent reports of forthcoming cooperation between the German , French and Italian operators of high-speed trains on the construction of train units are a signal that European cooperation is getting up steam ; and now on electricity , too .
In it , he made a passionate plea for the ‘Iron Rhine ’ railway connection between the port of Antwerp and the Ruhr area .
Continuing this derogation until the end of 2009 is not in the interests of public health .
I have recommended that my group cast a ‘yes ’ vote after these attempts at dilution have been rejected .     . – Many thanks , Mr President .
As has already been said several times in earlier debates , this 2004 budget has a number of particular features .
I should like to say another thing about the various chapters of the budget ; firstly , the agricultural budget , Chapter 1 .
We think that increasing the payment appropriations will enable us to make improvements there .
This year , we also paid a great deal of attention to the agencies .
Great uncertainty will reign until this has been taken .
We have entered a provision of EUR 30 million in the budget , and we are aware that the Commission has proposed the sum of EUR 200 million , EUR 40 million of which , in all probability , will be paid out of the 2003 budget and EUR 160 million of which out of the 2004 budget , possibly using the flexibility instrument .
We still have some doubts about this at the moment .
I should like to discuss one last point in connection with the budget , namely administrative expenditure .
Finally , I should like to thank my fellow MEPs , the Council and the Commission on this occasion , too , for the pleasant cooperation I have enjoyed up to now .
This is quite specifically about what we do and do not want to spend tax money on .
But for the time being it is above all also a signal that the PPE is not really concerned about spending of tax money carefully .
I am talking for instance about our amendment with regard to the financing of the structural funds to say explicitly that no European money may be spent on projects that are inconsistent with European directives such as the Habitat Directive or the Birds Directive .
As I would refuse to throw away those EUR 50 a week , which come on top of our generous daily allowance , on a taxi ride , you do not have to get on your bike .
This is a mere pittance compared to the EUR 1.5 billion that Japan is voting and the 22 billion that the United States is setting aside on top of the expenditure that it has already incurred for the liberation of that country .
Prevention of new frauds requires not only sound financial management but also strong external control .     Madam President , on the eve of the donor conference on Iraq , I , as the budget rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , would like to endorse the Commission ’s realistic proposals to release a further EUR 200 million for the reconstruction of Iraq on top of the EUR 100 million of humanitarian aid previously promised .
Whatever , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy does not wish to see funds for the reconstruction of Iraq being at the expense of other commitments of the Union , such as those with regard to Afghanistan , the Middle East and Latin America
