Where do these weapons come from ?
It goes without saying that the refugees must be able to return home , that they should do so or find shelter somewhere else , but be able to do so without any pressure .
It is now time to see if we mean it seriously .
The government must try in a dialogue with the opposition to find a solution to the current economic and political crisis .
Better preparation increases our chance of successfully influencing the UN Commission .
I mention the occupation of Tibet , the situation in Turkestan and Inner Mongolia , the lengthy prison sentences for dissidents , including Wei Jingsheng .
I would have much preferred this House to spend its energy on a matter in the same region which is so important in relation to human rights .
The time is also ripe for another breakthrough .
First of all I see that the protectors of the national identity are being increasingly applauded .
That was so more than ten years ago , Mr Vanhecke , when Mr Le Pen came to this House for the first time and when we had the joint solemn declaration signed by the Council , Commission and Parliament , and that was also the case when we had the remit to the Kahn commission and when we have our annual resolutions in this House , and when too we agreed on the European Year Against Racism .
Mr President , I have asked for the floor for a personal statement .
That is already one reason for not criticising him too severely , but he would have been well advised to come here if only to listen to what Mr McGowan had to say .
And that is a sign of bad coordination .
Our commissioner for development cooperation , Mr Pinheiro , also has responsibility in his field for foreign policy , trade and human rights , and that works well .
And then , Madam President , there is also a third problem when we come to cooperation with multilateral organisations , the IMF , world bank , or whether cooperation with the NGOs , where completely different guidelines are being followed .
The most important point is that this can make aid more effective and the European Union is the largest donor in the world when it comes to development aid .
The Member States show very little determination to coordinate their policy on development aid with each other and with the Union .
We have been saying that for the past 30 years .
Yesterday 's vote was an extremely difficult one and I fully sympathise with there being the odd mistake , but I would like this corrected .
Mr McGowan 's report clearly illustrates this .
In the explanatory statement Mr McGowan says that public opinion in the Netherlands accepts a relatively high percentage of GNP being spent on development aid precisely because this gives the Netherlands a strong national profile .
That is why on 17 March 1995 this House adopted a resolution that henceforth there should be a separate discharge for the agricultural expenditure in the Guarantee section of the EAGGF.
The Court of Auditors also announced that it would produce annually a special report on this expenditure .
And secondly , the Commission granted certain favours to countries which the Court of Auditors says were not justified .
In the case of production aid for cotton to Greece the same kind of comments can be made .
Furthermore , there is in our view the major question as to whether the maximum financial correction of 10 % is indeed enough .
But they should only be about whether the Commission has correctly estimated the amounts which were wrongly paid out .
These countries did not protest and had to pay the full 10 % .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
Circumstances such as divorce , death or invalidity of the spouse can put an unexpected end to this recognition and herald in total misery .
The assisting spouse can henceforth only be registered as an employee or business manager , but for many liberal professions this is impossible in view of the deontology of the liberal profession and company legislation .
This is all the more striking because it is precisely the European Community and the Union that have tried to make the position of women on the labour market the same as that of men , and it is a substantial part of the labour market that is in fact being shunted aside .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate the Committee on Women 's Rights and the rapporteur in particular on taking the initiative to highlight the situation of the assisting spouse and to put forward proposals to create a statute at long last for a category of the population which is large in number but small in statistics .
The other side of the coin is undoubtedly a certain price tag , but where no-one denies that there is a price to be paid for everything for respected self-employed entrepreneurs , all sorts of objections are raised when it comes to the assisting spouses of these entrepreneurs .
The Commission acted against the will of the European Council of Ministers , against the will of the European Parliament .
The Commission has managed to threaten to take to court the only country that planned to implement the regulation at the correct time .
For it is quite clear that that is being ignored in the WTO and that if we want to save anything here then this urgent question must be put on the agenda where we must win the day .
And because you have stated that so clearly I assume that over the next two and a half years you will , among other things , take the opportunity to make drastic changes to Parliament 's
