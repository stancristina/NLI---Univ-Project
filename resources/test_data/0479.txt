That is what we would like to see you come back with at some time in the future .
In the meantime though , enforce and implement the regulations as we expect them to be enforced and implemented .
Tell the Americans that if they want to talk in an atmosphere of confidence and trust and goodwill , the first thing they can do is to suspend their Article 84 complaint in ICAO.
They do not have to withdraw it , they do not have to take it away , they just have to make sure it does not go on the agenda of the next meeting .
Suggest that to them , Madame Palacio .
Start the negotiations and then come back to us with a reasonable compromise .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mr Hern√°ndez Molar for the excellent work that he has done on this report and for the spirit of cooperation with which he has sought an all-party consensus behind his recommendations .
I would like too to pay tribute to the work that the Commission has done in this area .
We face a number of challenges in a world where the drive for emigration and the drive for immigration into Europe is still substantial .
Clearly , we face a situation where there are push factors in countries of origin and pull factors in our own countries .
It is important that we approach this debate with a very clear distinction between asylum and illegal immigration .
It is important that we retain the commitment set out in the Geneva Convention and a humane approach .
If I would pass one message to the governments of the Member States , it is that all too often they fall into the temptation to seek easy headlines by taking the populist approach to the so-called problems of asylum seekers and illegal immigration .
Too rarely do they look to the principles to which they have signed up and try to deal with this problem seriously .
This report sets out a number of proposals for action which are , in my view , to be welcomed .
In particular it looks at immigration and at the inadequacy of current data .
It looks at the problems of the action plans that have been drawn up which fail to strike the right balance between security and immigration .
It looks at the policing of illegal immigration and calls for focus on combating trafficking and combating illegal employment .
These are the things our Member States should be doing .
And , of course , most importantly , it looks at budgets and the fact that under half of the measures proposed have budgetary allocations so that if we are to be serious about this , then an approach will be needed by the Council to give a legal base to the budgets which are being proposed .
So in conclusion , Mr President , and on behalf of the Liberal Group , I welcome this report which we will vote on tomorrow .
Mr President , I hope that honourable Members will forgive me if I stand back and ask a fundamental question .
Why does the European Union need a common asylum policy ?
No one would deny that this is an area where countries can gain from mutual collaboration but , of course , there is nothing new about cooperation among our home countries in the asylum field .
Since long before the signing of the Treaty of Rome , the Member States of the Union have been bound together by a complex web of agreements covering the right of asylum , the treatment of refugees , the principle of non-refoulement and much else .
We must not make the mistake , as we so often seem to do in this House , of believing that the only alternative to EU action is some kind of anarchy wherein no nation consults with any other .
On the contrary , the alternative to action at EU level is a negotiation of bilateral and multilateral accords among independent nations .
Such accords have two potential advantages it seems to me over Community action .
First , they are often well tried and well trusted and established and second , they can , of course , apply to states outside of the European Union .
In my own constituency of South-east England the local police and immigration services long enjoyed excellent relations with their French and Belgian counterparts .
Indeed , it is at least arguable that we cooperated more closely with other Member States ten years ago than we do today following the entry into force of the Dublin Convention and its flanking accords .
Now , how can this possibly be ?
Well , it was Aristotle who first adumbrated the principle that which no one owns no one will look after .
His precept surely holds true among nations as it does among individuals .
Put bluntly , a border guard who sees that a traveller is heading for a destination beyond his own frontiers may have little incentive to detain him and so to provoke an asylum application within his own jurisdiction .
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees , 93 000 people applied for sanctuary in the United Kingdom last year .
This makes Britain the most common destination for asylum claimants in Europe , a position we hold jointly with Germany .
But what is most astonishing is that this figure has risen in the United Kingdom by some 40 % since the mid-1990s while across the European Union as a whole , it has remained relatively stable .
I say 'astonishing ' because the vast number of applicants in my constituency have passed through several safe countries prior to their arrival there .
Now surely a genuine refugee
