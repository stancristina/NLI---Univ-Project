( DE ) Mr President , this Statute is important , and it must not be allowed to go under .
It is in fact Parliament that is the heart of the European parties , for it was in Parliament that the need arose to develop commonalities within Europe , and , if you bear in mind that 133 political parties are represented today in this House , united in seven political families , that alone shows how there are no limits to the work done for Europe , in this House , by the political groups , which , in the European Parliament , bring together the states whose political parties are elected to the European Parliament .
I am , myself , in favour of them .
In our own time , parliamentary democracy is characterised by political parties campaigning in elections and by parliamentary deputies - nominated by these parties and directly elected by the citizens - joining together in political groups in the parliaments .
We welcome the clear qualitative and quantitative criteria and the requirement for democratic legitimacy , both of which must be provided for and complied with if a party is to have European status .
Before we come to what I hope will be the conclusion to this matter , I would like to thank everyone most warmly : my fellow Members , the staff of the political groups and also the secretariat , all of whom have done such hard work on this .
I speak from personal experience , having , myself , some years ago , been deeply involved in the field of turkey-rearing .
It was therefore of primary importance to us that we should today come to a decision in principle on what is to be done about coccidiostats and histomonostats , and , in this , the sequence of events was , ultimately , of only secondary importance .
Any risk of detriment to human health or to the environment must be excluded as far as possible .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert , we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance naturally support the policy of ceasing to add antibiotics to feed .
We therefore have a major opportunity today of passing , at first reading , this law that is so important for democracy and transparency in Europe .
( Applause )
Mr President , I do indeed have an objection to make to this .
The German authorities supplied this further detailed information after two more years had elapsed - that is how long this process took - and this meant that our committee could then rule on the matter .
I might add that Mr MacCormick 's report , as well as the opinion that our secretariat has been so kind as to draw up , clearly show that this is the decision we came to in the past .
It aims to introduce a single passport for prospectuses , approved by the authorities in the country of origin and subsequently recognised throughout the EU for the purposes of the public offering of securities and/or their admission to trading on regulated markets .
This may well continue to be a live issue .
In December 2002 , the Commission estimated that the creation of an efficient internal market in securities would result in a 1.1 % growth in gross domestic product .
Mr President , there is no doubt that the European Passport for issues of securities will , in future , make it easier to raise capital .
On that , Commissioner , I can back you 100 % ; the only problem I have is that I am one of those who believe that what we have received from the Council as a Common Position fails to comply with these very requirements and conditions .
It appears from this debate that the opinion-forming process is not yet complete .
Mr President , let me , in my capacity as my group 's shadow rapporteur , apologise to you , to the Commissioner , and to all my fellow Members for not having been present at the beginning of the debate .
If we are struggling to make improvements , our primary concern here is with restoring the current legal position rather than with going back to what preceded it ; secondly , this is not about mandatory criteria along the lines of every contract-awarding body having to apply every conceivable criterion ; rather , it is about them being able to do so if that is what they would like to do and if they are transparent in the way they do it .
Europeans must act together !
I should like to thank you in particular , Mr President-in-Office , for your contribution to the Statute for European political parties .
Essentially a very clear question is at stake in this work : namely whether we are going to deliver on the promises , values and aims set out in the first and second parts , whether we are actually going to make the competences , responsibilities and principles of democracy , that we enshrined by consensus in the first and second parts , a reality , or whether we are simply setting ourselves new objectives without freeing Europe from the chains of the past .
Lessons were learnt from this and it gave the Convention impetus to make perhaps greater progress on aspects of the foreign , security and defence policy than we had initially thought possible .
For us enlargement already has a human face , in the shape of the colleagues who are already working here as observers .
The foreign minister - who is yet to be appointed - will embody the schizophrenia of the European Union .
The Convention itself fostered this and that is why I think that a public opinion poll on the result of the Intergovernmental Conference would call
