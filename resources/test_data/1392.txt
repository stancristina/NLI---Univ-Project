Lambert , I am concerned that this compromise has not gone quite far enough in relation to doctors ' hours .
There would remain though some workers in some working places where practical issues do not readily lend themselves to the implementation of this type of directive .
Coming from Scotland , with one of the largest EU fishing fleets , I would like once again to focus on the problem of fisheries and the defining of working time .
I note the compromise concerning sea-fishermen - a maximum of 48 hours of weekly work in a reference period of 12 months and the possibility of derogation after consultation and by agreement .
This may be an improvement but I still have some questions to put to the Commission .
We have to recognise that there were good reasons for the initial exclusion of the fisheries sector .
As regards fishing there is a deep-seated suspicion of Brussels in many respects and a lot of opposition to the whole idea of fishermen being told when to sleep or when to go to sea , given that their working time is governed by uncontrollable factors such as climatic conditions and the movement of shoals of fish .
The directive says that work at sea comprises sea fishing and other offshore work .
Many fishermen , particularly in Scotland , are organised on a family basis - they are share-fishermen paid only a proportion of their vessel 's catch .
They are clearly not employees in the sense of the word that we would understand .
Is this directive going to affect them or is it not ?
I have asked the Commission this question previously in committee and in plenary and have not yet received absolute clarification of this point .
The Conciliation Committee concluded in the case of those share fishermen who are employees - a statement which seems to me to be contradictory - that it is for Member States to determine the conditions for entitlement to annual leave and payments etc , but there is no explanation as to whether or when a share fisherman is employed .
I know for sure that the fishermen that I see around the coast of Scotland can only be defined as self-employed and I stress the need for clarification of this .
There are huge differences between a large-scale long-distance fleet where fishermen are employed by companies and sent off for months on end and the smaller - and medium-sized boats , which operate on a family or a cooperative basis .
This is an issue about the definition of self-employment or owner operation and I know that the compromise deletes own-account transport operators , clearly and quite properly identifying an exception in that area .
I call for a similar exception for share-fishermen .
It was never going to be easy to satisfy all of the interested parties who have lobbied and worked closely with the Union institutions to bring about amendments to the 1993 directive .
This is the new directive , of course , and I am pleased that it has been extended to offshore workers , fishermen and doctors in training .
The most contentious part of the directive was bound to relate to doctors in training who would benefit from this piece of legislation .
One should recall that the Council had originally proposed an exemption for a period of some 13 years before doctors in training would secure the benefits of the directive .
Naturally , Parliament put forward its own proposals to support the right of doctors in training to be covered by this directive after a period of 4 years .
Hence the conciliation procedure which you , Mr President , were involved in .
But whatever honeyed words are attached to the conclusions of the procedure , the bottom line is that junior doctors will not secure benefits for a period of nine years at least .
According to the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee , junior doctors will secure benefits after a transitional period of five years and a four-year transposition period .
I fully support the right of junior doctors and doctors in training to secure the benefits of this directive , but the Conciliation Committee conclusions will have reluctantly to be accepted .
I would like in conclusion to refer to one small but very important matter , namely that under exceptional circumstances there may be a further extension of two years and indeed up to three years if governments argue that the reduction would cause real administrative difficulties .
I do hope that this directive can be implemented sooner rather than later .
Mr President , this is refreshing - the fact that the European Union is acknowledging that there are problems but that we have solutions .
Commissioner Nielson will recall that a couple of months ago I suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes .
Is it not the case now that this proposal , taking away so much from DG Development as it does , is likely to make my prediction come true ?
Secondly , at the end of what Commissioner Patten was saying , I think he reiterated what he was quoted as saying in " The Times " this morning where he said that Member States should back his plans with resources or cut aid .
I have to say , Commissioners , that I find this a deeply worrying and dangerous statement and likely to be taken at its face value by Member States and not in the way that you suggest .
I would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other Commissioner .
Mr President , I am very sorry that Commissioner Patten had to leave .
In his absence I am delighted to direct my questions to the Development Commissioner , Mr Nielson .
