the Commission ' s hand .
This proposed directive is a landmark for Europe .
It is right that Europe should be legislating to guarantee the fundamental right to dignity , irrespective of ethnicity , and not to suffer discrimination .
It is also timely for Europe to legislate now with the alarming rise in the Far Right and racist violence .
I want to highlight a few aspects of the text .
Firstly , the very significant inclusion of indirect and institutional racism , and amendments have strengthened that aspect .
Secondly , the specific inclusion of housing , health and other public authority functions , including policing .
This is not interference in national responsibilities , but an assertion that the non-discriminatory delivery of these services is a European concern .
Thirdly , the inclusion via Amendments Nos 15 and 29 of disguised race discrimination .
My Group is not favourable to the inclusion of religion or belief in the scope of this directive because that needs much more thought .
However , we believe unequal treatment should be caught if it only pretends to be based on religion or nationality but is , in fact , race discrimination pure and simple .
Fourthly , the inclusion , as has already been mentioned , of incitement or pressure to discriminate - that is very important .
Fifthly , the role of the European Union Monitoring Centre in assisting the Commission in monitoring the implementation of this directive - and I hope the Commission will welcome that .
Sixthly , although my Group understands the thinking behind Amendment No 38 , the fact that it includes private clubs or associations is rather problematical .
To give you an example : I represent London and it could mean a problem for Caribbean people getting together to reminisce about life in the Caribbean in the 1950s if some white people were excluded .
I think that Amendment No 38 is not well drafted .
Lastly , on the adjustment of the burden of proof , and I am borrowing Mr Oostlander ' s phrase here , because he is quite correct to refer to it as 'sharing ' or a 'distribution ' of the burden of proof .
I am rather sorry that the Socialist Group insist on calling it a l of the burden of proof because that is slightly misleading .
It applies to the limited circumstances of equal opportunities law which is civil or administrative law .
My Group agrees that since the employer authority has most of the information , it must prove there has been no breach of equal treatment once the complainant has demonstrated a case .
Finally , there will be more heat than light from some speakers today and I am afraid I might include Mr Helmer of whose remarks I had a foretaste last night on the way back from the delightful asparagus dinner .
This is the first directive that we are debating under Article 13 and it is a very good start in our fight against all discrimination across the EU.
MEPs and NGOs worked very hard to get Article 13 into the Treaty .
I look forward to seeing further directives , perhaps starting with disability .
Initially , I was against racism being taken separately .
I would have liked to see it taken with the directive on employment and with the Action Programme .
I was persuaded of the urgency , because of the current rise of racism across the EU.
A number of Members have cited individual cases today .
I hope the Portuguese Presidency can work very hard to push this through and make sure that we do get this racism legislation .
We have to send the message that we are opposed to racism and xenophobia across the EU.
I am glad for that reason that we are having the vote today .
May I turn specifically to some of the amendments .
I am very well aware that some European jargon excludes people .
This is the reason I wanted Amendment No 48 on simple language to go in .
Amendment No 43 : people have talked already about the burden of proof .
This is working towards a shared burden of proof .
The plaintiff does have to provide facts and it has already been said that equal opportunities for men and women cover this in European legislation as well .
Amendment No 51 : I am delighted that charities and non-governmental organisations are going to be consulted .
They are at the sharp end ; they know what they are talking about .
Finally , I would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Buitenweg and to Mr Howitt in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for working so closely together to put forward an excellent report .
Mr President , in mediaeval times groups of thugs and hooligans would pick on elderly women and accuse them of witchcraft .
They would throw them into the village pond .
If the poor souls drowned , they were shown to be innocent ; if they survived , it proved their guilt and they were then burned at the stake .
Either way , the result is the same .
We had a similar example in 20th century China during the Cultural Revolution .
Red Guards would accuse intellectuals of bourgeois thinking .
If they confessed , they were guilty - but , of course , redeemable - but if they denied the charge , they were condemned out of their own mouths because they failed to recognise their guilt .
In both of those cases , we see the danger of placing the burden of proof on the accused .
Our justice systems have always rightly placed the burden of proof on the accuser , not on the defendant .
They have always assumed that a person is innocent until proven guilty
