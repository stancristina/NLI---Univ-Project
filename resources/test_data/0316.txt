With regard to relations with Libya , a considerable advance was made with the lifting of sanctions , with the exception of the weapons embargo , last September .
The participants highlighted the low and inadequate flow of investment to the Mediterranean region in comparison with its potential , and in comparison with other parts of the world .
We are aware that this new factor could have a negative effect on the whole process .
Although there are grounds for disappointment in view of the expectations raised by the launching of the Barcelona Process in November 1995 - and I am perhaps one of the few people here to have been present at that launch , at the signing of that agreement - this is largely attributable to the political circumstances in the Middle East , which were favourable in November 1995 but which have deteriorated considerably since then with the impasse that has arisen in the peace process .
We know that increasing numbers of people are seeking better opportunities or protection through migration , in order to escape war , persecution , poverty , unemployment or violations of their human rights .
We must step up the fight against illegal immigration , ensure that the rights of the victims of criminal networks are protected , and step up efforts to prevent all forms of trafficking in human beings , paying particular attention to the situation of women ' s and children ' s rights .
- ( PT ) Mr President , the action plans under way in the Council ' s High-Level Working Group are , as we all know , an unreliable instrument for jointly tackling a problem which , for some , is merely one of security and for others is merely one of integration , and it is usually impossible to tell where the line between the right to asylum ends and the right to economic survival begins .
It would be better if , instead of being treated like 'police cases ' , they were treated , as a matter of course , as cases of universal exclusion .
Mr President , the Commission would like to thank Parliament for the opportunity of having this debate and I would like personally to warmly congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar , for his excellent report and the excellent motion for a resolution .
Clearly this is not an easy task .
We are all very well aware of the fact that migration problems will not be solved within the coming month .
The Commission stresses that it will play an active part in maintaining that balance .
I therefore very much welcome your recommendation for the possibility of allocation of extra funds to cover cooperation with third countries in the fields of justice and home affairs with particular reference to immigration .
In autumn this year we will have a new opportunity to discuss the priorities of a comprehensive immigration policy of the Union when the Commission presents to the Council and to Parliament a review of the communication of 1994 in order to bring on board the new dynamics , the new social , political and economic realities of the world we live in as far as immigration policy is concerned .
The provisions of the Treaty are designed to be implemented .
Let there be investment , then , in a culture of initiative .
This debate has launched the budget procedure and , at the end of the year , when the final assessment is made of the draft budget for 2001 , it must contain the essence of this Parliament ' s position .
This gives us the opportunity not only to clarify our position but also to inform you about all the measures taken by the Council on the lawful interception of telecommunications .
I must stress this very firmly .
In certain clearly specified and truly exceptional cases , the interception of telecommunications may be justified under these conditions .
In the area of police cooperation , the Council adopted a resolution on 17 January 1995 on the lawful interception of telecommunications .
Immediately after the start of this work , the Council consulted the European Parliament on this proposal on which this House issued an opinion in May 1999 .
In the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters , particular attention should be paid to the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between the Member States .
It must be stressed that Europol does not have powers of investigation and does not carry out work of an operational nature .
In this way the general rules on the protection of data sent to Europol by the Member States are respected .
This system provides for an authority responsible for protecting personal data .
Furthermore , the Portuguese presidency intends to submit in due course , for the Council ' s consideration , initial ideas on the possibility of developing general principles on data protection , which would apply to all the instruments of the Third Pillar .
What does the term 'fair trade ' mean when major American companies can gain unlawful advantages thanks to privileged information provided by this system ?
What comments might the Council and the Commission have on France ' s recent decision to remove commercial closed source code systems from its public computer systems , thus allowing open source code systems to be used , which is intended , as indicated by the French Defence Minister , to guarantee that no nation and no defence systems are at the mercy of a single person or a single company ?
Mr Wiebenga said that I did not clearly and specifically condemn Echelon .
I can only answer the Member ' s second question in writing , as I do not have precise information on this .
