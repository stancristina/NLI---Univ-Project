institutions to facilitate adequate political action .
I did this in conjunction with all international and national journalists ' organisations , and I am now asking you why I have not to date even received an acknowledgment of receipt .
It is only regrettable that it has taken so long to put common principles down on paper .
Another important point is the question of the pesticidal paint .
Mr President , I do not claim to have invented the simple solution .
You could no longer see the wood for the trees although I would have happily lived with intelligible series which would also have brought quite a number of environmental advantages .
Well , Mr President , I am most concerned about them because I also hail from a small village where alas the last corner shop has disappeared .
Mr President , the two-fold pricing that the Commission is proposing is undoubtedly a help for shoppers who want to compare prices .
And speaking of small businesses , Mr President , we are not just talking about corner shops owned by little old ladies , but about many young people who are trying to make a business for themselves with very little capital and certainly no hoards of staff to do this kind of job for them .
The Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Party welcomes the present directive to replace two old directives for the last two just did not work in practice .
We are crossing bridges before we come to them , and I think it much more sensible to produce general rules for this transitional period when more is known , rather that try to write solutions into all kinds of different directives .
I wish to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten .
But when these markets fall prey to speculation , there are manifestly no checks on the system .
Mr President , I have just voted for this report with the greatest of pleasure .
The Polish Government only reacted to the local authority 's commercial plans after a protest from the Polish President and a number of groups .
It is a question we must keep asking ourselves and the Polish Government .
But those who live in glass-houses should n't throw stones .
The groups appear to have become even more fragmented .
It is precisely as one honourable Member said just now .
The European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Group is very happy with the European Union 's decision to submit a resolution to the UN Commission on Human Rights on the situation in China and Tibet .
That worries us .
That is nothing new ; you know that from the papers , from television and the radio .
The controversy surrounding President Samper is undermining the authority of the Government , which has to contend with continuing bloodbaths .
May we return to China , Madam President ?
The European Parliament , Madam President , has nothing at all to gain from constantly pillorying China , but it does have a responsibility to promote stability in the world economy which is becoming more and more interdependent , and China is a factor of major importance in it .
We must not sit on our hands in this case either .
Mr President , China seems likely to feature permanently in our debates on topical and urgent matters .
I shall vote for the compromise resolution , but in my view it does not go far enough .
Consequently , Mr President , we make another urgent appeal today to the Russian Federation to ratify START II , the treaty limiting nuclear arsenals , to China to end its test programmes , and to all parties concerned , amongst them the European Union , the US and the Russian Federation , to return to the negotiating table in Geneva to sign a comprehensive test ban treaty .
The peaceful nuclear testing which China wants are undesirable .
Kosovo is a vital part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which will , if prevented from developing satisfactorily , radiate a dangerous and negative influence into the surrounding area .
At the beginning of this week a meeting was held in Bolivia between foreign ministers from the Latin American countries and their European Union counterparts .
In short , Madam President , north-south cooperation and measures against drugs have failed in terms simply of a war on drugs .
The harm this does to stability and economic development in these countries gives us cause not only for great concern but also cause to reflect on what is in effect the failure of our development cooperation .
The funds for north-south cooperation are far too modest , Madam President .
Unlike the opinions delivered by other committees his report provides a balanced account and has avoided the temptation to make unduly forthright comments about liberalization and legalization .
We must not forget that the growing of narcotics is often the result of a deeper underlying problem , poverty .
Many thanks .
That alone indicates that one must be careful about European interference .
Madam President , may I take this opportunity to wish Mr Martens many happy returns of his birthday today .
Only a very limited proportion of the energy supply comes from nuclear energy so this agreement should not be addressed to keeping open or improving nuclear power stations but to closing nuclear power stations and switching over to other forms of energy , just with the very reserves of oil and gas found in Kazakhstan .
It offers the opportunity for strengthening trade and investments , for economic and technical cooperation and provides an ideal forum for regular discussion in the joint parliamentary committee .
I should like to hear from the Commission what the situation is with regard to that proposal
