suppliers themselves .
The same thing applies to the amendment seeking to open up the system laid down in the Brussels Convention on jurisdiction clauses in consumer contracts .
As I see it , however , arbitration generally follows more complex procedural rules than those applied by the courts .
I shall not go into further detail about the idea contained in this amendment that an abusive clause would never be involved , but the truth is that by relying on the binding nature of the decision of the ADR ( Alternative Dispute Resolution ) body on both parties and therefore on the consumer , we would be opting as a general rule to compulsorily replace the courts with extrajudicial dispute resolution mechanisms .
The Commission has also been given the task of preparing a Green Paper solely devoted to alternative methods of dispute resolution , as was decided by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of May of this year .
Lastly , the Commission wishes to state that it is able to accept Amendments Nos 3 , 27 and 30 on the introduction of provisions on trusts , with the reservation that some small changes are made to the terminology used .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission has been disturbed to see renewed acts of violence in the Basque Country .
Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union specifically mentions terrorism as one of the forms of crime to be prevented and fought at European level and one of the areas in which the European Union can bring added value to this fight .
We must go further in terms of European cooperation .
Immediately following its entry into force , therefore , the Heads of State and Government meeting at the Tampere European Council included terrorism in their overall approach to combating all forms of crime .
The path we must take is quite clear , as it was decided in Tampere that formal extradition proceedings between Member States for those who have actually been sentenced must in future be abolished .
I should therefore like to reiterate the Commission ' s commitment to promoting more effective European action against terrorism , using all the means made available to it under the treaties , whether these terrorist acts take place in Spain or in any other Member State , as I have just been informed has happened tonight in the United Kingdom .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe is an area of freedom which we all wish to strengthen .
I should also like to congratulate the French Presidency on their statement to us .
This is a fight which must engage us all and which must be able , specifically , to count on the participation of the European Parliament in defining the strategies to adopt and the priorities to set .
Venture capital companies have a major role to play in this field and the European Union must make more rapid progress if it wishes to catch up , in particular with the United States , which is currently far ahead of us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should just like to say a few words to emphasise our great concern about Timor and to urge that this issue be specifically tabled on the agenda of the forthcoming summit .
The Commission can partially accept Amendments Nos 5 , 8 and 9 .
This extraordinary event , symbolised by the fall of the Berlin wall which separated two blocks of countries and also divided one nation , to a certain extent represented a pioneering step in the process of European enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe .
On 30 March 1998 , a negotiation process was finally opened with the first group of countries , including Hungary , the country which is the subject of the progress report now under discussion in the European Parliament .
We have seen a consolidation of the democracy which is strengthening the positive trends that have already been shown .
This is not borne out by my own observation of the current situation .
Fourthly , there is the topical issue of the fight against organised crime , specifically crime that has its roots in Russia .
This issue needs to be addressed seriously but within a broader framework that covers not just Hungary but also the other candidate countries that still operate this antiquated and relatively unsafe technology .
They managed to be both realistic and pragmatic in their analyses , without losing sight of the far-thinking objectives that give real meaning to the European project .
We have exorcised the ghosts of the past .
We all agree that there is a need for compulsory labelling that clearly indicates the various components of compound feedingstuffs and their nature .
It is essential that the Commission and the Council should fight for these same rules to apply to all partners worldwide , especially in the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
By way of example , let me repeat that it will not be acceptable to us if it takes place at the expense of the less highly-developed Member States - as suggested by the failure to review the financial perspective - or if it entails an institutional change such as the one that some people are advocating .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as is well known , many forms of discrimination still remain in the European Union , specifically in employment and professional activities , even though they are prohibited under Article 13 of the EU Treaty .
Mr President , I should like to underline what my colleague Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar has just said .
Clear proof of this comes from the results of a fairly recent Eurobarometer survey , which showed that one in three Europeans , roughly 33 % , regarded themselves as very or fairly racist
