disaster 45 times over .
I agree with my colleagues , but I would just like to point out that there are different traffic cultures , so we would be doing ourselves a service to allow development from below and not so much from above , if we want to create joint regulations .
My recommendations are no different from those of my colleagues .
I would simply like to point out that when alcohol and medication are mentioned , then fatigue - that is , driving and rest periods - should also be mentioned .
Traffic safety is something that affects us all .
It is important for us to agree on frameworks for speed limits and not have speed limits that are too different .
I would also like to mention an issue that the Red Cross is not alone in having raised .
We should also do something about providing first aid on the spot .
In closing , I would like to underline the importance of having secure frameworks for traffic , the safety of citizens , and so on .
If we could be equally aware of what is going on in the area of traffic , we would come a long way in a Europe whose future is based on cohesion and mobility .
Madam President , I would like to begin by saying that this agreement should not have been negotiated only in the OECD.
What I wish to comment on is that workers ' rights have been relegated to the preamble of the MAI agreement .
It is important for investors to be bound to keep certain commitments in the countries in which they operate .
This implies that the references to workers ' rights are not legally binding , but are more in the nature of a statement of intent .
Countries must recognize the ILO 's regulations on working conditions and the protection of the right to form unions , the prohibition of child labour and so on , so that such matters cannot become a competitive consideration used by states to try to attract investors .
It is important to bear in mind that the relaxation of provisions relating to direct foreign investments should not just be to the advantage of the investors and the country of origin .
This Parliament is the only parliament - as far as I know - to have discussed the MAI.
It is important to initiate debate in the Member States and the national parliaments about this agreement .
I know this may not be the right place , but I am doing it anyway .
I know there is a directive on the way and that we are prepared to do something about this , but we must ensure we move the process on .
Three or four times a year , the Danish coast is littered with birds covered in oil because our ships discharge oil in our waters .
I would ask you to refer the matter to the Commission and the Council and ask them to get this process moving .
Mr President , before we move on to today 's business , I would like to inform Parliament that we still have a Social Democrat government in Denmark .
It saddens me that we have to have this debate on postponement of discharge at all .
It saddens me because we would be better off expending our efforts on promoting the development of common policies rather than on cursing the Commission .
These are familiar difficulties and Parliament is simply forced to prevail upon the Commission to take action .
And it is scandalous that the Commission has not as yet succeeded in implementing the PHARE area programme more effectively to produce tangible and visible results in the destination countries .
I would like to note in particular the Commission 's announcement today to the effect that the proposals set out in the special report on PHARE will be implemented in 1999 , concerning delegating the administration to the destination country itself .
I would also like to know the name of the country concerned , and I strongly urge the Commission to ensure that , if any legal changes are necessary , the relevant motions will be tabled , so that we can ensure that all obstacles are cleared out of the way to allow us to implement true decentralization on 1 January 1999 .
Mr President , I think Mrs Theato 's report on criminal proceedings relating to the protection of the EU 's financial interests constitutes a very worthy and significant contribution to the discussion of how to proceed in this area .
But this also demonstrates how difficult it is to make progress unless all the Member States show the political will to make some concrete decisions in this area with a view to putting in place the systems required for effective collaboration .
Mrs Theato is proposing some very necessary initiatives , but at the same time , I must say that the report is rather ambitious .
It is ambitious considering how difficult it is to come to any decisions in this area , and here , of course , I am thinking of our good old problem of the convention to protect the financial interests of the EU not having been ratified .
This is a serious area and an important one , and I would also like to illustrate this with a simple example - perhaps even a banal example in the wider context - but right now in Denmark we are debating the problem of the loss of many millions of kroner that Denmark incurs because fathers are avoiding their obligation to pay child support .
Thus , this topic also affects everyday life ; there are many such examples .
