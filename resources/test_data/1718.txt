It is therefore vital that at this summit the European Union participate fully in this battle to gain recognition of the fact that the right to food is a fundamental human right .
The new technologies on reproduction , in particular genetically modified organisms , will not change anything either ; quite the opposite .
It is therefore a matter of urgency to address the consequences of this tragedy by of course providing financial aid , contributions and programmes , but it is also vital to tackle the root causes of this situation .
Mr President , I wanted to indicate that personally I am in favour of this amendment , but on the important condition that it be considered as an addition rather than as a deletion , in which case we would say that Parliament , 'wishes to see a simple and precise distribution of competences' , where 'and precise ' is the amendment and the rest is the original text .
This confirms that it is better to restrict the scope of Community action to what is strictly necessary upstream rather than having to repair the damage afterwards .
The report calls for employment to be more flexible .
The current system for division of competences is horribly complex , it is true .

The European Community does , of course , support the efforts being made by the Organisation of African Unity and by President Wade within it .
The second important point is that we need to guarantee emergency humanitarian aid in order to alleviate the awful conditions under which the people have been living for several months now .
Without political and financial aid on our part , there is a risk of the walls closing round the contradictions of the Indonesian experiment , which would probably put an end to the democratisation process which , all said and done , is still in its infancy .
That was certainly not the case before globalisation .
We can thus refine the quota system and make the destruction of new vessels unnecessary .
The draft text aims to reduce the substantial price differences in the Union , but these would be much less substantial if we harmonised taxation .
Parliament would be well advised to take on board most of these conclusions .
We must demonstrate a more balanced and fair frame of mind in relation to this dossier in which many different factors are at stake , ranging from those relating to consumer safety to that of employment in all Member States , as well as in the most remote regions .
This procedure , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , is obviously too lengthy , too slow and totally inadequate if we want Europol to have the capacity to take swift action against the manifold forms of serious crime .
We believe that it is risky to recommend something new without having a democratic safety belt and we believe that it is rather dangerous to support the idea that it is possible to have a majority in the Council without having co-decision as well .
If , on the one hand , European agriculture has no future other than to respond appropriately to the expectations of European citizens , there will , on the other hand , be no genuine multifunctionality unless the policy that is implemented provides its actors with sufficient income to enable them to make a living in all the Member States .
The common organisations of the market and their market regulatory instruments must continue to play an essential role whilst reinforcing the rural development pillar .
We must allocate the resources to achieve this ambition by gradually re-allocating a significant part of the Community budget of the 'market ' pillar to the 'rural development ' pillar , whilst encouraging all types of agricultural businesses , and particularly the most fragile .
I shall not dwell on the causes of the enormous delay placed upon us , other than to say that it must be attributed , in the main , to a lack of political will , on the part of the Commission as well as the Member States .
My reply to these two questions is negative .
Naturally we are pleased that the new guidelines being proposed to us for the TENs are moving towards and are in line with the policy of sustainable mobility which was proposed to us in the White Paper .
If you were to launch such an initiative , there are a number of us who would support it .
Yet the policy of dismantling our institutions and our sovereignties carries on regardless , whatever the cost and whatever the damage caused .
In fact they were unfortunate enough to try to comply with the texts which place Europol in the area of inter-governmental relationships .
The Green Paper on security of energy supply has taken these facts into consideration .
My constituency is in the Auvergne region of France , which has a number of good features , but which is also experiencing difficulties with local economic development .
If we do not take such action , the principles with which Messrs Fischler and Lamy are threatening the Americans today will rebound on us like boomerangs , and will destroy agriculture in the countries of Europe .
Then , later on , these exceptional imports would no doubt be used to argue that , for the sake of consistency , we should abolish all our prohibitions on the growing and selling of GMOs .
In Western France , because of fungicides sprayed on fields of wheat , more than four thousand hives have been affected and 70 % of honey production has already been lost .
This should be regarded as an all-important objective of any future-oriented business
