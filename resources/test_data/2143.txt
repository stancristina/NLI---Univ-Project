on the draft constitution is rather pathetic and takes us back in time : this is Nice all over again .
This proposal concerns peace in the Middle East .
By the same token , these federalist members were also extremely naïve to think that the countries joining the European Union would be satisfied with a minor role for their ‘pretend ’ Commissioners .
The federal budget of the United States redistributes more than 30 % of its national GDP.
Europe is neglecting future spending , which means spending on education , research and infrastructure .
All of these crucial issues , which are hidden from public view , must be addressed one day , we hope at least in referendums on ratifying the constitution .
They reveal an entire blueprint for the world and , I would even say , a genuine fear of the world .
We also agree with its confirmation of multilateralism and the ranking of Europe’s priorities in foreign policy and even with the positions it adopts on the Middle East .
For the CFSP , as for other matters , furthermore , let us rely on the judicious recommendations of the Convention .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I believe we should welcome the fact that the cause fought for by the abolitionists has become , in the space of a few decades , a few generations , one of the general public’s most passionate demands in the field of human rights .
A universal moratorium is called for here on a regular basis , but when will this actually be implemented ?
Avraham Burg , the former Speaker of the Knesset whom we have received and applauded in this very House , accuses Mr Sharon of killing the Israeli nation by destroying its values .
Having said that , there are still at least three paragraphs that I cannot accept : paragraph 18 , which calls both the Palestinian attacks and Israeli military repression terrorist acts and lumps them together , and I also wish to speak out against my communist fellow Member who has just called the United States a terrorist nation .
It is equally crucial to exert all possible pressure , including economic and trade pressure , not only to stop the construction of this apartheid-style wall , but also to destroy it .
We have come a long way from the stone-throwing of the first Intifada : what has succeeded this are the suicide attacks against Israel’s civilian population and this terror is met by the systematic use of intelligent weapons of targeted destruction , which also kill civilians – this time Palestinians .
It is true that we need peace right away – it is urgent – it is true that we need to show the prospect , as has been said , and that we need to re-humanise this debate and avoid turning the parties into monsters .
A few years ago in Lisbon , the European Union set itself the objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world , capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion .
While the European Union has a considerable involvement in many of these fields , it is essential that we find the best way of coordinating all those different instruments in order to arrive at a genuine industrial strategy for the European Union .
That is why I am proposing that the European Union launch an ambitious initiative , such as setting a target figure for expenditure on lifelong learning .
We therefore consider it very important that this gap should be filled , because very small businesses and the craft trades make up more than 90 % of European enterprises and they are both the creators of jobs and the sources of innovation you want to see .
I cannot criticise her for doing that , but it has sometimes resulted in something like a Prévert-style inventory and the poor Commission is sometimes asked to work miracles .
Tomorrow , it will affect the countries joining the European Union if we do not respond .
There is no desire to promote the European productive system as a whole .
We cannot go back to the scientism of the 1960s and industrial policies that included no risk assessment or ecology , which are the very foundation of the twenty-first century .
A real industrial policy must be based on large projects and sustained strategies in sectors combining , for example , research and development efforts with the creation of European champions .
There is , however , still much to be done , like drawing up a European specification for businesses , better representation for SMEs in Community think tanks , aid mechanisms for their internationalisation , etc . and I expect our work will continue in this direction .     Mr President , it is fortunate that the Commission has finally come around to the idea of separating cod and hake , having initially intended to deal with the two species under the same recovery plan , which would not have allowed for an understanding of the characteristics specific to each of these two stocks .
We are somewhat surprised that a parliamentary report should say so little about the genuine suffering felt by the communities that will be hard hit by this plan , communities that we represent .
This is not easy to draft , however , because it seeks to discriminate , in a very clumsy way , between the supposedly ‘integrationist ’ political parties and the others , but also between the strictly European political parties and those that , from a national base , work at European level .
For years , however , European policy has focused on solely on performance , profit and sustainable development
