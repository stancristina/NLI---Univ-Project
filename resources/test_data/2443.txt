wine , which are fundamental to the agricultural economies of the southern countries .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our financial forecasts for the years 2000 to 2006 , upon which our cohesion policy depends , will be decided in March next year , according to the Cardiff Summit , after the effects of the German elections have been put into perspective .
That is mere sophistry : false reasoning masquerading as sound argument .
This is why the Cohesion Fund must be kept and why , in short , it would be a very serious mistake to abolish it .
That protection has been provided by subsidies and preferential treatment which is expressed in a special system of import certificates and a customary duty-free import quota .
Among the various measures that should be taken , we think the overall reference income should be adopted and increased by around 20 % , so as to restore the necessary income guarantee to Community producers , and the Community should undertake to reduce the independent quota to prevent a possible glut on the market which would jeopardize sales of Community bananas .
The Commission must understand that the flooding of the European market with large quotas of cheap bananas from non-EU , nonACP countries will seriously affect the income of Community producers and make it almost impossible for traditional ACP countries to compete with Latin American producers .
I should therefore be grateful if the Minutes could be amended accordingly .
Symbolic because the Commission 's proposals would entail an intolerable acceptance of the universal predominance of the WTO - and the interests of the USA - with the inevitable sacrifice of the traditional privileged relations between the EU and the ACP countries , for bananas now , and extended to other areas later .
There is still one fundamental matter : we must revise some of the WTO 's mechanisms .
In addition , the proposals put forward at this plenary emphasize the way we must go following the creation of the single currency , whose numerous advantages and universal benefits will only thus be revealed , namely tax reforms at community level .
So I think it is becoming a matter of urgency to improve the coordination of these policies , which are a hindrance to the proper working of the internal market .
To succeed in our fight against unemployment it is important to counteract the disastrous consequences of harmful tax competition , and I would emphasize that , if it becomes necessary , we must retain beneficial forms of competition in taxation between Member States as an instrument for increasing the competitiveness of the European economy in the face of the present challenges of the global market .
When the currency is the same it makes no difference whether , for example , the money is deposited in one country or another , because the countries with the lowest tax rates will naturally benefit and transfers are therefore to be expected .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Secchi on his report on this important subject .
The problem of harmonizing this situation is therefore an extremely difficult one .
But if it is to do so its work must not be kept secret .
Hence , also , the amendment designed to require the EP to subscribe to the Commission 's position for the Cohesion Fund after 1999 as set out in Agenda 2000 ( perhaps one of the few positive aspects of that document ) .
Thus I have to express my reservations and concern at the attempts to reduce the proportion of the budget relating to Structural Funds in the context of the present 15-nation European Union and in the light of the 'innovations ' within the scope of the new draft Regulations , the result of which may be to make the Community Support Frameworks more difficult to implement in full .
For that reason , because everything can still be resolved democratically and without further unnecessary violence , the signatories to all the motions acknowledge that the first condition for resolving the problem is the release of the historic Timorean leader , Xanana Gusm√£o .
We are delighted about this and hope that a solution to the problem can thus be found .
The dictator has fallen .
Where we have respect for international law and the right to self-determination which is , and continues to be , the central issue .
We must obtain a bilateral cease-fire as a matter of urgency as a pre-condition for negotiations , but we must ensure that the current mediation initiatives do not suffer from excess or multiplication .
The only ones who profit are the arms dealers , and the only losers are the people .
The European Parliament calls for the re-establishment of constitutional order , for arms to be laid down and for a peaceful solution to a serious internal and regional conflict , the establishment of democratic constitutional order within the framework of Guinea-Bissau 's political institutions and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country .
I would not wish to offer an opinion on the internal political problems of Guinea-Bissau , nor to comment on the participation of the Senegalese and Guinea-Conakry armies in this conflict , their legitimacy or any territorial claims they may have on Guinea-Bissau .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Madam Commissioner , I should like to refer to the report submitted by my honourable friend Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna , whom I congratulate on a notable , I repeat notable , piece of work .
