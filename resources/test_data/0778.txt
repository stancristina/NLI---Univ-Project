to draw from several serious cases .
I only have to remind you of the most recent example , the reprimand issued by the Ombudsman last week against OLAF in connection with the libelling of a journalist in public statements made by the Office .
The evaluation of OLAF’s activities over the last three years , which is the subject of the report , has been largely eclipsed by the Eurostat affair .
I should , however , also like to scotch the rumours that could be heard after the President of the Commission had made his speech , namely that if Commission officials were suspected of fraud the Commission wanted to take control of the internal investigations away from OLAF .
However , I can say that on the whole strengthening the Supervisory Committee , as proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control , is something with which we can agree , particularly when it comes to examining complaints .
In so doing it missed the opportunity to recover a considerable proportion of the at least EUR 8 million that had been embezzled .
We are aware of this .
Overall , I think we need a thorough rethink of the amendments .
Until this objective is achieved , I fully support strengthening the Supervisory Committee , both as regards the Secretariat – we need to discuss its allocation to the European Parliament budget – and also , and especially , the appointment of highly qualified , independent persons as members of the Supervisory Committee .
Mrs Theato has just mentioned them again .
We cannot amend this Regulation at the present time .     .
As regards the matter at hand , I would like to begin with the last point .
If some Member States choose to go down the tax rate route and others prefer direct subsidies , we must be saying to ourselves that this House is committed to the principle of subsidiarity , and only to the Community principle where there are actual distortions of competition .
It is also doubtful whether an experiment conducted over just three years can be described as a failure after such a short time .
Not only for that , but also for the depth and breadth of their work , as also for their unambiguous recommendations for specific further action , many thanks are owed to all the members of the Court of Auditors .
The Court again had criticisms to make of the Structural Funds , in that , whilst the funds are not expected to be used to their fullest extent , the surplus is not to be repaid to the Member States next year , but in a supplementary budget in the current year .
We are learning our lessons from the Eurostat experience , primarily , of course , within Eurostat itself , but also as regards OLAF and the relationship between the Directorates-General and the political level .
Overall , I would say that this is an utterly deplorable result in terms of the quality of the Commission ’s implementation of the Budget , even if much of the blame lies with the Member States .
Let me just briefly say something in response to your closing remarks about the Intergovernmental Conference .
The enlargement programmes such as Sapard , are meant to help with the proper functioning , post-enlargement , of the agricultural programmes , the structural programmes and the administrative structures .
Let me give another example , that of export refunds , which , in 2002 , totalled some EUR 3 622 million , money that I do not think has been used properly , for we keep learning on a daily basis how export refunds lead to irregularities and fraud , quite apart from which , such export refunds are also unjust , because they destroy markets in the developing world .
I would furthermore like to make it clear that we disregarded group boundaries in voting together on one point on which the House has taken a political decision , namely the reduced rate of tax for labour-intensive services , and were outraged to hear Commissioner Bolkestein say yesterday evening that he envisages extending this for only six months , even though even the Council is thinking in terms of two years and we in terms of six .
In the course of the past week , we have succeeded in coming to an agreement with the Italian Presidency of the Council on a whole range of amendments , which means that , what you will be voting on tomorrow at midday is a package of compromises to which the Council has already agreed with the permanent representatives , and if this House adopts it , we can avoid a conciliation procedure .
The Council of Ministers firmly refused to accept this amendment , and , in the negotiations , I no longer insisted on it in order to avoid the need for a conciliation procedure .
Over recent months , the rapporteur and the committees were kept fully and regularly informed of the progress of the deliberations .
We have run the Rule 162a – enhanced cooperation – procedure very well and have achieved a good result .
Let me start by saying that the proposal that the Commission has put forward is a serious attempt at resolving this problem , but that , at the same time , it is true that good things can still be improved .
In addition , the Commission has proposed a new definition of postal services , which has left me rather surprised .
No attempt is made to interfere with the ‘polluter pays ’ principle .
The last point I would like to address has to do with farmers and foresters .
It is , then , quite incomprehensible that the operators of environmentally hazardous plant or those who use dangerous substances should not have to insure against liability
