With the recent plan of ECU 10m , we have slightly enlarged the list of the NGOs .
The real major need is for drinking water in order to prevent epidemics .
We are still considering whether it is wise , possible or viable to have a fund which can be more easily used to react to , prevent , or prepare for natural catastrophes .
Mr President , Europe 's competitiveness in the maritime sector is increasingly dependent on the transport and port system : 90 % of the EU 's traffic with third countries and 30 % of intra-Community traffic passes through the ports .
Mr President , I shall devote part of my four minutes ' speaking time to the Green Paper .
Indeed , that is where I should like to begin : the Green Paper on sea ports and maritime infrastructure has aroused great expectations , not least because for the first time ports are recognised as an integral part of the trans-European network system .
I would stress two further points here .
The time has therefore come to press ahead with the decisions and investment needed for a European satellite navigation system .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking on the Danesin report on trans-European transport networks .
Finally , I hope that the Commission will not merely offer long-term credit arrangements , but will also take more active steps to attract substantial private investment .
Moreover , with reference to the likely impact of the positioning and navigation system , investment should not be restricted to positioning alone ; investment and experimentation should also be furthered by boosting the role of SMEs , providers and all bodies capable of making a valid contribution to disseminating this advanced technological system .
I hope the Christmas break has given everyone time to reflect , and that the vote in Brussels on 28 January will lead to a revision of these amendments .
For cereals , we can avoid this danger if we deal with the sector in the manner suggested by the Commission .
The second rectification needed is a set-aside rate of 10 % .
This is an important opportunity to bring the CAP into line with consumers ' and citizens ' needs .
For Europeans to shut the door to the outside world has always been a mistake : it is precisely at times of crisis that Europe must be a little more adventurous and assert its presence on the world stage .
Let us avoid wars of words here too : to say 'no ' to cofinancing in the name of Community solidarity is to sow discord ; to discuss it seriously is another matter , and means assessing all the implications .
Mr President , I agree with those colleagues who are concerned that the very valuable debate being conducted on Agenda 2000 might result in low-profile conclusions in terms of CAP reform .
Mr President , the proposed reform of the CAP contained within the Agenda 2000 package , to be implemented through the Structural Funds and the draft regulations under discussion today , is an effort , albeit a tentative one , which deserves our support .
But in actual fact , even these tentative efforts are being undermined by the desire for balanced national budget contributions and the lack of any true innovation .
Production for its own sake , to rake in premiums , the misuse of scientific research , the difficulty of monitoring certification standards on the use of transgenic products at consumer level , the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in plants and animals - all of these have continued .
A second reason for dissatisfaction comes from the work which we have done - or rather , I should say , have not done - in Parliament , in that only one of the five reports under discussion was approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I am reasonably satisfied with the particular attention devoted in this reform to peripheral areas , such as mountainous regions , with the raising of milk quotas by 1 % , and above all the attention paid to young farmers .
The fact that it is impossible to know about all the VAT provisions in force in the other Member States means that taxpayers have to operate in a situation of legal uncertainty , which provides those who know how to exploit it with the opportunity of creating a competitive advantage , which in effect constitutes a distortion of competition .
This proposal introduces a derogation from the eighth VAT directive by establishing that the Member State of purchase will be responsible for verifying that the VAT has actually been paid , whilst the Member State of deduction will be responsible for monitoring the actual deduction of the tax .
If the percentage of business use is not as high as the percentage of the ceiling for deductible VAT , the deduction is made according to the normal rules .
That is true harmonisation .
Such tourism is clearly at a disadvantage , in that the existing rules are not only incompatible with the elaboration of a broadly harmonised , definitive VAT system in Europe , but they are also unable to compensate for the serious distortions currently burdening a sector which can provide a large number of jobs , to the benefit of local economies adversely affected by seasonal factors .
My answer is that the Internet really is a new , revolutionary technological product ; its advent is on a par with the invention of the printing press .
Hierarchies are disappearing , production plant and physical processes are no longer concentrated in a fixed location , as was typical of the industrial era ; a new knowledge-based society is emerging , one which is more mobile both geographically and culturally .
There is ample evidence of the need for international coordination ,
