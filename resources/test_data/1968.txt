budget capable of creating economic and social cohesion and a European taxation system .
One of the methods that should be used is that of the interinstitutional agreements which have long been proposed in order to ensure that the European Parliament can exercise effective control and intervene effectively in the mechanisms already provided by the Treaty .
The Herman report seeks to strike a blow to make Parliament really influential , and I want to support and applaud that course of action .
I myself voted for the European Parliament 's recommendation on the creation of the euro .
The important thing , from my point of view , is that the countries harmonized their opinions and reached a final decision .
The rapporteur was therefore faced with a worthwhile piece of work but one , as we agree , of limited scope .
Finally , and in conjunction with the two previous aspects , there is an urgent need for greater and more effective involvement of the people in the decision making processes , especially those they normally have less chance to influence .
An interinstitutional agreement to involve the European Parliament in the decision making legitimization chain is appropriate with the advent of an economic policy that will of necessity be more and more a joint one , in the wake of the single currency .
Everyone , therefore , is aware that our most important future task should be democratization above all .
The text we are to vote on is the possible wording .
The attention the report proposes to give to regional television stations should be expressed by using the initiatives that already exist in that field , particularly the regional CIRCOM , which consists of 376 regional stations in 39 European countries .
We also refer to the so-called services of general interest , with the support of Article 7( D ) of the Treaty currently undergoing ratification .
It should be noted as an exception , however , that there is a set of conditions in the Community legislation which give Member States and the Commission the right to intervene in order to deal with certain situations and needs .
Mr President , it will soon be three years since we launched an ambitious set of negotiations with the new South Africa , after the Union had set itself a unique goal : that of establishing a long-term framework for cooperation with this important partner , that would underpin its historical transition to democracy and reflect the dual nature of its economy . ln April last year , we had the pleasure to welcome South Africa as the 86th member of the Convention of Lom√© .
Last month we had our 18th round of negotiations and a further round is planned for 10 and 11 June .
What are the main outstanding issues ?
The first principle is its full compliance with WTO requirements .
We know it is not an easy step to make , because it touches on sensitive sectors and interests on both sides .
The trade agreement with South Africa must be coherent with existing European Union policies such as the European Union 's common commercial policy and , in particular , the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy .
The third principle is the coherence with the provisions of agreements with other preferential partners .
From the outset of the negotiations two years ago , we began a process of regular consultations with the ACP group and various sub-groups whom we meet regularly .
In our view the impact of this European Union/South Africa free-trade agreement will be felt in three concentric circles .
Job creation and an investment drive in the region are expected to be the main positive effects of our free trade agreement with South Africa , and will be enhanced by a more intense economic cooperation .
I hope our Member States will join us in expressing these views and if this is so in Cardiff , I am confident we will succeed very soon .
But I would like to know , and I therefore ask Commissioner Deus Pinheiro , who will have no difficulty in replying in Portuguese , what is happening ?
That is to say , how can we help South Africa to fulfil its role as the driving power of economic development in Africa , in our mutual interest , genuinely but without undue domination , and with due consideration for other states in the region ?
Firstly , this round of negotiations was not postponed because of the Commission but because the South Africans were not ready .
This is not easy but we know it is willing to take it .
As regards wine , imports from South Africa have increased 150 % even with the current tariffs so you will understand that having excess wine production in Europe there is some concern about liberalizing the market .
So , we must make sure that what we propose to WTO is compatible so we will have legal security with regard to our agreement .
Now that the euro has been adopted , it is necessary to speed up everything which has already been in the course of preparation for its practical introduction .
And that leap , quite apart from the amendments , adds a clause to the Commission 's proposal which will mean we can no longer speak of national authorities .
Although their importance is enshrined in the Commission 's text , I have reason to fear that in practice they are still not being dealt with satisfactorily .
If that is done , a country like Portugal will be prevented from taking part in SMB support schemes , which is undoubtedly the opposite of what Mr Marset Campos intends to achieve by proposing this amendment .
The world would not understand such a lack of vision and the future would not forgive us for it
