a future permanent war crimes court it must have two things .
In its resolution today Parliament demands changes in both these respects .
Parliament 's demands , Mr President , are not founded on a desire for revenge .
Mr President , I should like to use my sixty seconds to make two points .
The contrast with the democratic development in Taiwan is all the more striking .
There is one thing that they are not suitable for , however , and that is sitting on .
This would always be wrong but it feels particularly painful now at a time of austerity , when many law-abiding citizens are having to tighten their belts .
This is the wrong way to go where there is supposed to be cooperation between countries ; it only creates greater mistrust of the EU.
Mr President , the idea of monetary union involves three serious fundamental mistakes : it transfers power from democratic governments to a bureaucratic and closed institution and thus increases the democratic deficit in the Union .
Currency and interest rates which are here turned into matters of major concern and the driving force of the whole enterprise in a most remarkable way are in reality special factors which are entirely dependent on the above-mentioned major real economic trends .
In actual fact , however , it is a highly political issue which , moreover , has not yet been fully resolved .
The common currency is basically a political project .
They reveal very small benefits but major economic risks .
After all , the economic policy of EMU already dominates Western Europe now .
The price for this dogmatic EMU policy is being paid today by the unemployed and by those affected by social cuts .
This is a view shared by a majority of the Swedish people and , I would venture to say , by a majority of academic economists in the western world .
EMU really does involve a tangible risk that unemployment will rise .
This will increase unemployment but not because of some kind of Phillips link between inflation and unemployment but simply because zero inflation will force certain businesses to make direct wage cuts in order to bring relative wages into line with supply and demand .
Socially , EMU is a high-risk project and it is the low paid and those with few qualifications who will face the risks .
The first amendment concerns the importance of noting that the fourth framework programme committed a great deal of funding to large enterprises and large institutions , whereas we in Parliament have stated many times that it is small businesses that are important and that we should support .
That is why it is important that we also mention in our conclusions the social and environmental needs for research .
This is of course not so at all .
Mr President , we all know that traffic , and especially the use of cars , causes a large proportion of the environmental problems , particularly in the big cities .
The Transport Committee 's report drawn up by Mr Wijsenbeek on the other hand is a very good report which has the full support of the Liberal Group .
Park-and-ride facilities , facilities for the disabled , good travel information and flexible working hours can increase the use of public transport .
Mr President , there are many good arguments in favour of summer time , including the fact that , as the rapporteur stated earlier , we extend the day and have lighter evenings ; there is also the fact that summer time has a positive effect on tourism , recreational activities and the service industries .
If darkness were the crucial factor for sleep children in Sweden , for example , would scarcely sleep an hour in mid-summer but 18-19 hours in mid-winter .
This demonstrates that there is a certain lack of reason in the debate .
Despite the fact that the system is already in operation it is now being said that the Council of Ministers is considering abandoning the principle of a common summer time throughout the EU.
There are already enough complications in the EU today with three different time zones .
Each day we see and hear about strikes and demonstrations in the Member States , where angry and often desperate people express their dissatisfaction with the policies currently being pursued in the Member States .
The policies being pursued cause greater regional imbalances , increasing structural unemployment , increased unemployment among poorly educated women , a continuing increase in the number of disabled people without work .
Let us do something about this !
Let us make a start on this crucial work !
We would have to make changes in the banking system to ensure better credit and easier access to risk capital for new companies and for environmental investments .
Mr President , this report by Friedrich Otto Wolf on the Commission 's report on employment in Europe in 1996 should perhaps , as Mr Cassidy suggested , really be called unemployment in Europe .
In this connection , when we discuss what we can do to reduce unemployment we must also realise that there is a paradox involved , because the Union itself is also creating unemployment and exclusion through the tight schedule for monetary union and through the convergence criteria which compel the Member States to tighten their budgets and force cuts in social welfare .
What can be done then ?
I nonetheless believe that the report indicates the paths to be followed for a new strategy .
A new strategy must involve ecological conversion and green innovation , tax reforms based on the principle of solidarity , and strong local economies .
One must acknowledge that Europe has failed where unemployment is concerned .
Is it therefore the EU in its capacity as an institution that has failed
