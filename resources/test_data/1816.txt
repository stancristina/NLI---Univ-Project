bill to be ruined for the sake of an amateur law in the fight against crime !
OISIN is a programme of cooperation between law enforcement authorities with a budget of EUR 8 million .
It is also difficult for Parliament to keep track of the programmes .
Here again , I would stress that candidate countries should be included at the earliest possible opportunity .
I can therefore say , on behalf of my Group , that we are unreservedly in favour of continuing the GROTIUS programme and I should also like to say that it is European money extremely well spent .
We are calling for not only organic holdings to be permitted to cultivate legumes on land set aside , but , against the background of BSE and foot-and-mouth , all livestock holdings .
Our aim - the aim of the Commission - is quite a different one , namely to create an additional encouragement of environmental agriculture , since organic farmers are dependent on the cultivation of fodder legumes like clover and lucerne to a greater degree than conventional agriculture .
Namely , I would have liked to have heard if anyone had said that what the committee has here proposed and what we have gone on to examine more thoroughly and make more detailed proposals about fills the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture with great satisfaction .
But it is much more than a merely functional community .
And there can be no doubt that all these questions must be decided by the sovereign power in each of our European democracies , i .e . by the people and only the people .
But surely this is just a semantic argument ?
A federation meets all these requirements .
That must be the guideline .
But often the Commission is used as a scapegoat and the hunt for scapegoats is everyone ' s favourite pastime ! ( Laughter , applause ) I recognise the tendency of almost all national governments to brand decisions which they themselves have taken at European level as the monstrous invention of European regulatory mania ...
So how should the route towards a European constitution be constructed , what shape should the "process for the future of Europe " , as it is so aptly called , take ?
I am with you all the way ! ( Long , loud standing ovation )
Interestingly , the then Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany worked on this .
You see , we are prepared to make compromises here too .
To be able to assess the changed demand for feedingstuffs we must first take a look at the development of meat consumption and meat production .
The disadvantage of this option is that it would re-introduce crop-specific aid for oilseeds and production would be subject to the upper ceiling set out in the Blair House agreement .
What is more , the current budgetary plan does not allow for any leeway to implement the options we have assessed .
That may have brought about more movement in the direction we now want to go in .
Just like people , animals need balanced nutrition .
Secondly , I must remind you that the implementation of this policy is subject to the precondition that no distinction is made between promoting protein crops , cereals or other crops .
What is at issue is whether the Commission worked out a disease plan in consultation with the Member States which made clear what had to happen if the disease broke out .
Following my visit to Rabat in February this year , I had to conclude that the gulf between the two positions could not be bridged , in particular , because of the compensation demands by Morocco for the catch facilities that were being offered .
In any case , we evaluated the financial part not only in purely economic terms ; we also took political considerations into account , such as the need to have good political relations with Morocco .
There is currently a Commission proposal with Parliament and also with the Council , whereby compensation payments will be extended to 30 June of this year .

Commission .
But in future years we will be able to take our decision by 30 June .
This would cause problems , however , for business people , especially from small and medium-sized businesses , who , for obvious reasons of security , deposit their day ' s takings in the safe-deposit box of their bank after the banks have closed .

I actually find it frivolous to make policy on a day-to-day basis at the expense of farmers .
But above all this is an issue for the state authorities .
The position of the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is that it is no longer enough for the international community simply to complain .
It is a very important initiative , because safety is a subject of great importance to the fisheries sector as a whole .
Fishermen need our active moral and legislative support especially in the area of safety at work .
As far as your conclusions are concerned , Madam Rapporteur , I feel there is a need to act in the following areas .
As regards fleet renewal , I would like to remind you that one of the objectives of all the structural programmes in the fisheries sector is to modernise fishing vessels
