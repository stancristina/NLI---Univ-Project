to a genuine communication project which , I regret to have to say , on behalf of the Committee , is lacking , despite the numerous debates which I have called for and which have taken place in committee and , quite frankly , despite the appeals made by all the groups to Commissioner Reding and President Prodi .
First of all - point one - the communication on information policy planned by the Commission will be presented before the end of the summer and will then be presented to the Interinstitutional Committee , the Parliamentary Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , of which you are Chairman , Mr Gargani , and the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets .
Fifthly , the Commission intends to develop a regional dimension for its information policy , in particular by means of paying closer attention to the regional press and the questions of local authorities .
With regard to the seventh point , the Commission is going to implement assessment mechanisms and parameters to measure effectiveness .
This effort must be continued and increased manifold .
I would like to make a few brief comments .
Clearly , this transfer raises logistical problems , but these will be resolved by the summer .
If I may , I would point out that Parliament should perhaps consider the fact that its political reservations regarding budget lines are , in fact , holding citizens ' information services hostage and not the Commission as such .
I can assure you that all my colleagues are working along similar lines and I hope that the overall communication on information policy to be presented by the Commission before the summer will go a long way towards meeting your concerns .
The Commission feels that unfair competition practices in the international shipbuilding sector need to be tackled by means of appropriate mechanisms .
It is precisely the typical negative consequences of operating aid that have led the Commission to express a generally negative opinion on this type of aid .
This mechanism should specifically discourage the unfair practices of South Korea for as long as the WTO procedure takes to reach its conclusion and target those market segments in which European industry has suffered directly as a result of the unfair trade practices of South Korea .
This work has already started in collaboration with industry .
I would like to start by explaining the origins of the capacity restraints and the reasons why they have been imposed .
Capacity restraint was imposed on the yards of the former Democratic Republic of Germany by a special Council directive , adopted in 1992 , which contained a derogation from the prevailing regulations on operating aid applicable at that time to Community shipyards .
My departments have the task of monitoring observance of these restraints .
I must point out , however , that this is not so much the result of the imposition of capacity restraints as the general trend of the shipbuilding industry in Europe .
There is no doubt that the considerations expressed by Mrs Cerdeira , Mrs SÃ¶rensen and Mrs Frahm and by the last speaker appear to be well-founded , but in order to be able to evaluate the report and the proposal , we need to take into account a question of principle , and that is that we have reached the point where we are going to have to resort to fragmentation on the issue of immigration policy , for otherwise we would have to admit , or rather the Council , above all , would have to admit that it is unable to regulate this phenomenon or rather that it failed to predict what might happen , that it failed to prevent it and that it is still unable to regulate it through government proposals .
I therefore hope that , during this voting session , Parliament will once again heed the advice of the rapporteurs and the vote of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , which calls for the Council 's and Member States ' proposals to be rejected .
Thus we find ourselves discussing matters which will never see the light of day or which will have to be re-examined , for the Council will never manage to reach a definitive conclusion .
This sense of insecurity affects absolutely everybody : companies , families and individual people , particularly women , the elderly and children .
The undertaking would include the exchange of information and news in as short a time as possible precisely in order to be able to study the origins of criminal phenomena .
Welcome Mr President , it would almost appear that we have to vote on a issue which is a foregone conclusion , that is on whether Parliament is for or against crime .
The United Nations decided to carry out an internal inquiry into how these funds are spent : of course , the European Union does not feel the need to do this .
This morning , I took part in an important meeting organised by Mr Pronk on pensions in France .
I feel that it is much more important - and so do all the pensioners who sent me to the European Parliament - and would be much more useful to combat illegal immigration into Europe by stepping up controls at Europe 's borders .
You are late , very late ! "
Mr President , the Frahm report - I am saying this for the benefit of those who are listening to me now and did not take part in the vote - concerns the requirement to obtain a visa for those who come to Europe and who move around within our territory but are not citizens of our Member States .
Why is this ?
These goods are highly dangerous "
