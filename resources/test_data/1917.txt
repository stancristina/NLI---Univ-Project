The widening of the definition proposed by Mr Santini is therefore acceptable on humanitarian grounds or on serious health grounds .
In this very sensitive field , the Community must respect the developments introduced in Member State legislation and must be flexible in this .
In fact , at present , the legislation of only two Member States recognises union between persons of the same sex as marriage .
In addition , the principle of non-discrimination requires that the host Member State treat unmarried couples of other Member States in the same way as its own nationals .
I am aware that the Commission 's text needs to be adapted in the light of the recent judgment of the Court of Justice in this field , which stated that any citizen residing legally in another Member State must enjoy equal treatment with its nationals in matters of social welfare .
One has to recognise that partners who do not lose the privileges they have in the country of origin , will enjoy a privilege which the citizens of the host state do not have .
This is very much a step forward .
In this respect , it must be pointed out that such rights do not cover the right to stay unemployed in the European Union .
Its aim is simply to harmonise the procedure for admission and it believes such harmonisation is necessary .
There is , therefore , no incompatibility between the fight against unemployment and the proposal .
In our opinion , however , the power of Member States ' to regulate , through their governments , whether or not to open up their labour markets cannot and must not be taken away from them .
Mr President , as in other areas of human immigration , we must always be prudent .
To be frank , Mr Nassauer and I have been discussing these issues for a very long time , and we all know that there is no magic solution to this very complex problem of immigration .
Immigration is only a possibility .
That is a source of concern , because the existing migrants will be a burden for the social welfare state .
I do not want to harmonise anything with regard to reform of the welfare state .
I look forward to seeing Parliament 's amendments and thank you for this very interesting and stimulating debate .
Taking into account these two aspects , the Commission proposed transferring Ecuador to Annex 1 of Regulation 539/2001 which lists the third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa obligation .
The Commission cannot accept one of the amendments on purely legal grounds .
( PT ) Although visas should only be granted at borders in exceptional circumstances , common procedures must be established in the Member States for the transit of seamen , a professional category that is subject to enormous labour mobility .
This initiative , with the amendments tabled by the European Parliament can contribute to making the complex Schengen acquis a little more comprehensible and bring solutions which , although perhaps not the ones we would wish to see - such as the introduction of more thoroughgoing reforms of the Schengen acquis - are solutions that are possible .
On the contrary , I feel that any artificial attempt to standardise , exceeding the provisions of Article 63( 3 )( a ) of the EC Treaty , would be counterproductive .
( PT ) I welcome the improvements being made to the situation of EU citizens who wish to settle in another Member State of the Union , in particular reducing the bureaucracy that currently proliferates .
The report makes some positive improvements , widening the concept of the family , eliminating or simplifying some bureaucracy , and guaranteeing more rights than those planned initially .
In fact , with regard to the definition of the term 'family ' , most of the solutions were adopted in a sense that does not match the values that I hold dear , especially Amendment No 53 : the 'spouse ' , regardless of their sex , the 'unmarried partner ' and/or 'person with whom they live ' , regardless of their sex , 'in a de facto union' , 'with whom the applicant has a durable relationship ' and 'registered ' under the terms of the relevant national legislation , the 'partner ' and/or 'person with whom they live ' from third countries or without a residence permit and lastly , direct descendents and direct relatives in the ascendant line and those of the spouse or registered partner with whom they live .
In addition to breaking down the internal doors of the Union , this text would not allow Member States to learn about and monitor migratory phenomena , a factor that will affect their domestic social balance and the implementation of their budgets , especially for social assistance .
( PT ) The European Parliament has today had to face the fact that five Member States have declared themselves to be in favour of transferring Ecuador to the list of third countries whose nationals require visas , basically because of illegal immigration , trafficking in human beings , regional coherence and considerations of public order .
.
No less importantly , account must be taken of people 's right to mobility that is safe , affordable and of high quality .
This is why we have these railway and aviation accidents , which are basically caused by the lack of investment in equipment and in safety , or because of redundancies and the deterioration of employees ' social conditions .
In particular I appreciated his approach to providing the technical means necessary to implement these aims , for example extending bandwidth and multichannel distribution , and on the delicate problem of security of information .
Mr President , we are a long way off
