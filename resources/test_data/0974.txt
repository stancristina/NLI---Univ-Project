ban harassment , the action plan must require employers to foster a climate of non-harassment between colleagues , accompanied by mutual encouragement between colleagues in the workplace .
I quite agree that harassment is an extremely important issue , it is dangerous in the workplace and it has significant social and economic repercussions not just on the employee and the company but also on the economy as a whole in that it is one of the main reasons for falling productivity .
It has set up a sub-committee especially to study the question of violence in the workplace .
And this report will play an important part ; it will help bring about change and propose a new strategy on health and safety and for this reason I should like to make a point of thanking the rapporteur .
( EL ) Mr President , I understand that the Commission is to make a statement on my report and I should very much like to hear it .
The relentless law of asymmetrical development operating within the capitalist system is not a figment of our imagination , it is a reality and the figures in the Commission 's own reports confirm that there can be no talk of convergence ; on the contrary , what we have is divergence between the Member States of the Community , between the rich and poor regions , even between regions within a Member State .
Decisions by the ÅU are exacerbating social and economic differences , thereby giving the monopolies more and more options .
Structural interventions funded from the Community purse are not designed to bring about real development in each region .
Even the report admits that the ÅU " still exhibits major regional asymmetries in economic and social development [and ] regional asymmetries have actually increased within some Member States" .
Even the report tells us that the ten poorest regions have an unemployment rate of 23 % .
And this funding has been paid for by scrapping traditional productive sectors , changing crops , destroying agricultural produce and deserting areas .
( EL ) The harsh reality of the huge social problems which plague workers , both male and female , not only shows up every pronouncement about equality and prosperity for what it is in practice , and in the harshest possible manner , it also makes them look provocative and derisory .
The first and the main victims of this miserable market - and competitiveness-based policy are women .
It is still mainly women who fill the more menial , unskilled jobs and who rarely hold responsible , higher management jobs in economic , social and political life .
Only the workers ' struggle can overturn the anti-grass roots polices being promoted and improve women 's lot .
It is particularly revealing with regard to the Schengen Information System ( that is , personal electronic records ) , in which 89 % of personal information pertains to 'unwanted ' persons .
All this confirms that the Schengen Convention is a tool which is used to make it easier to carry out the job of pan-European suppression , make and monitor suspects and terrorise demonstrators .
However , they are accompanied by a proposal to introduce a Community information system , that is , a single computer network for data from the Schengen , Europol and Customs Use conventions in order to make personal electronic records even more efficient , again in the name of freedom , security and justice !
And that , I think , applies not just to us but to the Heads of State who have applied to become members of the European Union .
We are currently at second reading and we need to focus on the main issues , as set out by the rapporteur .
Finally , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his sterling work .
Ladies and gentlemen , Greek islands are under pressure from an unprecedented influx of refugees and asylum seekers , mainly from Afghanistan .
Whatever Mr Titley 's intentions as rapporteur , in today 's general climate of militarisation and warmongering , with a new structure to NATO , with the militarisation of the European Union and , more importantly , with the shameless exploitation of the terrorist attack in the United States , codes like this , even if they do not pull the wool over the people 's eyes , are no more than a hypocritical wish list .
I should like to make a point of thanking the Commissioner for what was a very detailed reply , including from the technical point of view .
All that remains to be seen is what the government 's response will be to the Commission 's move .
However , my question to the Commissioner is this : why confine ourselves solely to the psychology profession and , more to the point , to psychologists who have graduated from French universities when numerous complaints have been lodged with the Commission by other disciplines and by students studying in other faculties and graduating from foreign universities , even though they have taken part of their course in Greece ?
This being the case , I should like to say that I welcome your finding that the Court 's judgment is not being applied properly and , because the Greek public is listening to what we have to say , to ask you : if the Greek government continues to take this view , what are the legal implications ?
Mr President , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , the Durban Conference represents a major step forward in the endeavour to bring about global understanding , global political agreement on questions of racial discrimination , racism , xenophobia and intolerance .
The Conference was exciting and difficult , with a heavy workload .
A global message was sent out and specific , globally agreed proposals were tabled
