The lack of young people entering the agricultural industry in the UK is a very worrying problem .
Statistics show that in Ireland 14.8 % of farm owners are under 35 , in France the figure is 13.2 % , but in the UK it is a mere 6.8 % .
I stress that farms are also important employers in our rural communities .
Employment protects our countryside , it keeps our post offices , schools and services open there .
Farming and the viability of farming is the life blood of the future of our rural communities as we know them .
If all small businesses - which includes farmers - were to employ just one more person each , then the whole unemployment situation throughout the European Union would be solved overnight .
Of all the European Union countries , only the UK and the Netherlands do not operate a specific aid scheme for young farmers .
European rural development regulations allow a grant of EUR 16 500 to be made available for people under 40 years of age to establish themselves in a viable farm holding .
Yet the Labour government in the UK has not taken advantage of this excellent scheme .
I therefore fully support making installation aids mandatory across the European Union .
The farming industry needs young blood in order to inject a new vibrancy into an industry which at present is aged and disillusioned .
Young farmers are the future of the farming industry and vital components in urban communities .
I thank Mr Parish for his report and wish his report all the best to ensure that we can follow up these important decisions taken by him in a specific and constructive manner .
Mr President , there is indeed a crisis of succession in farming as Mr Parish with his expertise as a farmer knows well .
If this crisis is particularly acute in Mr Parish 's own Member State , it is the direct result of policies pursued by UK governments over the past twenty years , and to overcome it the United Kingdom must review the implications of the Fontainbleau Agreement for its contribution to European Union finances .
This has been disastrous for farming .
Moreover , the rapporteur , a member of the Conservative Party , must work within his own party to secure support for his proposals in the House of Commons .
In countries where less than 10 % of the population now lives in rural areas , it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas , and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries .
Mr President , could I begin by congratulating Mr Parish on bringing forward a very excellent report .
I know very well that he put a lot of time and effort into it and I am happy it can be debated by Parliament today .
It is a very difficult subject to address and there is no easy solution to the problem of young farmers , as any of us who have any knowledge of the problem and the background would accept .
Of course , everybody likes to say we must help the young farmers .
The problem is when you ask them how to make the help really worthwhile , they are very slow to come forward with answers .
How can you encourage young people onto the land ?
You have to address the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today .
Many young people from rural areas some 20 , 30 or 40 years ago , at the time Mr McCartin was speaking about , would naturally have gone on to become young farmers .
Nowadays those young people have many other options open to them .
They look around and they see their friends going into jobs where they may quit working at lunchtime on Friday and not start work again until the Monday morning .
But the young farmer will work seven days a week for very little money .
You only have to look at the financial situation right throughout the European Union at the moment to see that we have a terrible problem here and one that is not going to be easy to address .
The reality is that if you do not get young people into the industry , you will not bring the new ideas in and you will not allow the industry to develop and take on the challenges that it faces in the future , relating not just to the production of food , but to how that food is produced and to ensuring that it is produced in a way the consumer finds acceptable .
It is not enough just to give financial assistance to young farmers because then all you do is put the price of lamb up out of reach .
We in the European Union have brought in milk quotas , we have brought in suckler cow quotas , we have brought in sheep quotas , all now with a financial value that the young farmer could not even begin to contemplate .
So I believe the best way is to make it easier for young farmers to inherit the family farm at an earlier stage , be it through an early retirement scheme or through a bond scheme .
I certainly feel that the European Investment Bank should be encouraged to help young farmers into the industry through the bond scheme .
But , if you are going to bring this scheme in it has to be mandatory and it has to be introduced in every Member State .
It is not enough to introduce it in one Member State alone .
Finally , we are spending a lot of money on rural development and the Commission would do well
