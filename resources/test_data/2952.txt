Quite simply , growth and human development require us to put an end to gender discrimination .
The Commission reports on which this debate is based presuppose that there are to be no major changes this year , because a large-scale evaluation of the first five-year period is to be carried out in the course of next year .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs submitted a number of proposals for the report , of which a number were adopted and introduced into the report .
I therefore believe that , in the current situation , the amendments in question militate against a European employment strategy .
There is relatively broad agreement between those pursuing labour market policy in the Member States but , in spite of that , no such policy is being implemented in the Member States themselves .
It is therefore incredibly important that more attention be paid to the parliaments in particular , but also to the entire political process in the Member States , if the result is to be effective .
Now that the economy is in decline , the moment of truth has , however , arrived , and I believe that the need for a coordinated employment policy is even greater than before .
As has been observed in recent years , there are also problems when it comes to the older workforce .
I welcome the discussion about quality at work and about not only creating more job opportunities but also increasing the quality of those jobs .
I believe that this is perhaps the most central issue if we are to be able to obtain economic growth and create more employment opportunities in the future , and that is why I am supporting this universal right .
I genuinely want to see a framework agreement at European level in which the social partners agree to this right .
However , it would be the best solution .
The open coordination method is good , but is lacking in the areas of democratic control and transparency .
By this time , almost all practical proposals from Parliament have been dealt with , and I must therefore concentrate on a number of more theoretical points of view .
In the EU , this balancing act is unusually complicated due to the fact that it has to be carried out both by two budget authorities in tandem and by each authority in its own right .
There are often considerable commitments made , but the level of implementation is low and the funding insufficient .
The myth of the EU as a hopeless colossus is so strong that I am scarcely believed at home when I say that , even for Sweden , the net cost of the EU amounts to only 1 per cent of the State budget , that the budget is not increasing in real terms and that it is implemented in such a way that the Swedish exchequer gets back a large part of its contribution each year .
First of all , I believe that we must simplify the budget procedure itself and ensure that it is made more transparent .
I am also convinced that , as Commissioner Schreyer pointed out in his speech , we are going to have to make the budget more flexible and increase our ability to respond to new events .
In both 2000 and 2001 , we solved this problem by means of the flexibility instrument , which gave us a further EUR 200 million per year .
This does not hold water .
With this policy , the Council is forcing us to do something I should preferably have liked us to avoid , namely to say no to a proportion of the major expenditure on the Balkans , even if we are obviously using this to protect the most sensitive areas , that is to say Serbia and Kosovo .
We want to rescue aid to the Balkans .
It is with satisfaction that I at least observe that , for the first time in quite a few years , there has been no serious talk about revising the budget ceiling .
The limited margin in both these categories is cause for concern , especially when , in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 11 September , we see an approaching need for measures of humanitarian aid for Afghanistan , as well as a need for measures in the area of justice and home affairs .
There is , however , reason for calling for a general tightening-up , on the parts of both the Council and Parliament , before the second reading so that , from a purely budgetary point of view , they are able to handle the situation that has arisen in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States .
I must however note that a very great deal remains to be done in order to prepare and adapt the administration before an enlargement that will soon be only two years ahead of us .
We believe that environmental investment in that area is required urgently and , in certain cases , even as an emergency measure .
We , in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , can therefore warmly support the proposal tabled .
EU countries are naturally affected just as much by these problems as large parts of Russia , Poland , Kaliningrad etc .
We know , for example , that untreated waste water from 3-4 million people in the St Petersburg region is still being released and that the situation around Kaliningrad is much the same .
The matter is urgent , and that is why I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has also expressed its wishes .
