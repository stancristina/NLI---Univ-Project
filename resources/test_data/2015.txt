In addition , the EU has been involved in bilateral discussions to promote the entry into force of the treaty with all those countries that have not yet signed or ratified it , but whose ratification is vital for the treaty to come into force .
These efforts to promote the treaty ' s entry into force must continue , with the relevant objectives very much in mind .
The European Union considers the Non-Proliferation Treaty to be a major tool of international security that offers a set of global frameworks for the promotion of both non-proliferation and the decommissioning of weapons .
The Test Ban Treaty is unique in nature .
The verification system also contains legal provisions that enables on-the-spot checks to be carried out when there is reason to suspect that there has been a breach of the treaty .
Members of the European Parliament , the European Union will play an active part in the preparatory work being done in Vienna to create an organisation for the implementation of the treaty and a verification system for it .
The Union supports the efforts on the part of the CTBTO Preparations Commission to establish a verification system in good time and with the degree of efficiency the treaty requires .
Mr President , I am very satisfied that the debate here in Parliament has shown complete unanimity , and it is good that the Commission , Parliament and the Council have very clearly emphasised the support of the European Union for the Test Ban Treaty .
I assure you that , for our part , this issue will be raised continually in political dialogue between the European Union and the United States .
Mr President , Members of the European Parliament , the summit conference held by the EU and Russia took place in what is a historic building , as far as Russia is concerned , the Assembly House of the Estates in Helsinki .
On the agenda at the meeting , there were four main items : firstly , EU/Russian relations , including the current situation in the EU and Russia ; secondly , the northern dimension ; thirdly , cooperation in the fight against crime ; and , fourthly , current international affairs , in which the focus was on the forthcoming OSCE Summit and the situation in the west Balkans .
The most positive result of the summit was Russia ' s EU strategy .
The strategy is now being analysed .
Prime Minister Putin said the Russian economy was growing in most areas .
Next year ' s budget will be based on a growth rate of 1.5 % .
The bank system must also be improved .
Furthermore , central and regional budgetary relations have to be redefined , and Russia ' s still very closed economy opened up .
He said that , despite speculation , a state of emergency would not be declared for the whole country on account of the situation in the northern Caucasus .
Russia has created a security zone and is feeding the 100,000 people who have left the region .
Dialogue with moderate Muslim leaders had also been neglected .
It is good that the UN humanitarian evaluation expedition is able to travel to Ingushetia to investigate the situation .
Representing the country to hold the presidency , Prime Minister Lipponen , and the President of the Commission , Romano Prodi , were urging Russia to initiate action to de-escalate the crisis .
Military action could not solve political problems or remedy the desperate economic situation in the region .
Prime Minister Lipponen furthermore stated this to the press on his visit to Parliament earlier today .
Prime Minister Lipponen and High Representative Javier Solana gave a presentation to the Russian delegation on the development of the common foreign and security policy .
Regarding the fight against crime , it was stated that the European Council at Tampere had been fruitful .
Regional cooperation is important in the fight against cross-border crime , and Russia is a key partner in cooperation .
The action programme should be ready at the start of 2000 .
He said the Duma had just adopted a convention for the extradition of criminals .
TACIS aid would also be needed in the area of combating crime .
Workers belonging to the Red Cross and other relief organisations have been captured .
Drug smuggling , according to Mr Putin , was a special problem in Central Asia which , broadly speaking , if you included Afghanistan and Iran , had overtaken Latin America as the most important drugs manufacturing centre in the world .
Finally , I would like to say a few words about the northern dimension , whose aim it is to increase well-being , strengthen security and prevent environmental pollution , nuclear risks and the dangers of organised cross-border crime .
It is important for Russia that the region is comprehensively developed .
Presumably , the Russian leaders also received some sort of promise regarding this when they were making their contribution to the peaceful dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union .
Military withdrawal from Chechnya was seen as a dangerous precedent .
The events of Dagestan gave cause to presume that the disease is spreading .
They should , however , realise that a country ' s sovereignty cannot be secured through military force .
The West must clearly condemn the excessive use of military force in Chechnya - more clearly than what was the case at the Helsinki Summit meeting .
For example , the European Council ' s agreements strictly prohibit countries from murdering and bombing their own nationals .
The OSCE agreements also demonstrated clearly that countries are committed to the notion that violations of human rights can never constitute the internal affairs of a state .
We might even suspect that ethnic cleansing is taking place there
