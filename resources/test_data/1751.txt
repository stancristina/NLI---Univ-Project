like to compliment the Commission on sticking with the negotiations with the USA over the last two years .
The reality is that data is flowing across the Atlantic and we , and our citizens , have no protection at present .
So the question for us must be : do we give them the protection that is on offer or do we say it is not enough ?
If we do that , then what will happen ?
Concerns have rightly been raised about the access for individuals to redress and compensation .
But this raises the fundamental debate about the clash of legal cultures which has been so central to these negotiations .
Clearly , as an elected Parliament , we have a duty to protect our citizens , but I fear that the conditionality in paragraph 7 of Mrs Paciotti 's report endangers the whole agreement , for it could hardly be more fundamental to the debate about adequacy or equivalence .
We are in a global context here and e-commerce will continually throw at us clashes of legal systems and style .
Yet we cannot attempt to change the way the Americans deal with their own national legislation and legal system .
They have their way and we have ours .
They will come to their own conclusions about how they will change their system .
Yes , they are considering it ; yes , they have had several annual reports about the protection of personal data .
I wish we had that within our European Union .
I urge colleagues in the vote tomorrow to give protection to our citizens now .
Conditionality will mean no protection now .
But if we express our very strong reservations and to ask for clear review , this will give our citizens protection now and offer us progress in this very difficult area .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Paciotti for the work she has done on this report and to extend my thanks to Commissioner Bolkestein , who has regularly sent his officials to assist the work of the committee I have the honour to chair in dealing with this report .
Data protection , which is essential to privacy , poses huge challenges in an age of electronic communication .
If we are frank , we will admit that no government has yet found a way to offer adequate protection to its citizens .
In the European Union the route of regulation through legislation has proven far from perfect .
In the US , the route of self-regulation has also brought up serious problems , as the report from the Federal Trade Commission to Congress last month shows us .
Liberal Democrats have taken the view that the proposals in this draft agreement beg many questions , but that on balance , and since this is the deal on offer , it is better to have regulation to allow this valuable trade to grow than to allow anarchy to reign .
There has been much debate in my group about the impact and the legal effect of this report .
I take the view that this report says yes , but - quite rightly - requires firms participating in the safe harbour to agree to pay compensation in the case of individuals suffering damage from abuse of data held on them .
In my view this is necessary for consumer confidence , which is a fickle thing , but others , probably the majority in my group , will support Amendment Nos 1 and 2 which they believe clear up all legal uncertainty .
Clearly , we cannot know how the United States will react to our concerns .
I am guided by the considerable economic interest of the USA in having this agreement , but I recognise that others are guided by a deep concern about the current lack of protection and a burning desire to see even the limited protection offered by this agreement .
Either way , it remains our hope that legislative developments on the other side of the Atlantic will render the safe harbour obsolete and we salute the Commission in the work they have done in achieving what they clearly believe is the best achievable result .
Mr President , I should first of all like to pay tribute to the rapporteur , who has put forward a very concise and well-presented report and one that we are happy to support .
I would like to draw attention to one or two points from it .
I hope that most Members in this House will agree with me that we should be moving towards a visa-free Europe , a Europe without barriers , at ease with itself and the rest of the world .
I know we still have some stumbling blocks and Europe and the world are not quite ready for that at the moment .
But the rapporteur has spoken about no exceptions and I am delighted to support him in that we have one single list .
I also want to draw attention to a few amendments .
Amendment No. 2 is important .
It says it is essential that we have procedures that are as smooth and as simple as possible and do not cause unreasonable expenditure for the applicants .
Many of us in this House know as well as anyone that getting a visa can be a time-consuming and expensive business .
We want to make certain in Europe that is not the case working in the opposite direction .
Similarly , Amendment No 6 speaks about young people and encouraging them to take part in youth programmes by not giving them the extra burden of visas .
That is important because young people are enthusiastic about the European ideal and we do not want to put anything in their way that makes them think that Europe is not welcoming and not moving in the right direction
