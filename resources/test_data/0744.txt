Allow me first of all to say to the Council that we are dealing with an initiative of the French Government , and recently in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs we have seen individual Member States taking initiatives time and again , and we have then seen that the Member States sometimes happen to be mistaken about their choice of legal basis .
( Applause )
EUR 4 billion are available in Category VIII for the year 2002 .
Incidentally , my tone was not one of regret when I mentioned our former access to the Mediterranean .
The concept of a state of war best describes the situation .
I do not feel , as has been said here , that we can expect to see the situation improve after the elections in Israel , particularly if Sharon takes over , bearing in mind what happened under Menachem Begin .
What we have heard you say today sounds very promising and I believe the Union must continue its work along these lines .
Secondly , the exemption clause - originally planned by Austria - which would have enabled Member States to evade the strict European requirements emanating from the respective national regulation authority , has been dropped .
If you recall , the French President-in-Office of the Council had believed that following the first reading of the Council ' s common position , all negotiations would come to an end , and we would have to accept the situation .
I should also like to thank Vice-President Imbeni in particular , who led the parliamentary delegation very circumspectly and very precisely , and also our committee Chairman , Mr Hatzidakis , who backed us in word and deed and showed confidence in the rapporteurs .
Proper account must therefore also be taken of environmental costs , which - even if Mr Jarzembowski still does not quite believe it , he is already half convinced - are certainly appreciably higher for road than for rail .
But the question of labour law and working hours is also important .
There has been a massive decline in the amount of freight transported by rail over the last few years , and there is every reason to believe that it will be very difficult to reverse the trend in the foreseeable future .
I believe that having equal conditions of access for all will not prove profitable in every case .
In freight transport , the advantages are tangible and plain for all to see .
In producing this proposal for a regulation , the Commission has now created a legal basis .
If you carry out this review , then as I see it , we will have an excellent foundation on which to base a real trade policy and philosophy .
What we need to do is set about convincing them .
Permit me to close with a brief remark .
The Energy Star Board will be required to draw up a report on the market penetration of products bearing the Energy Star logo .
None of this is problematic from a technical viewpoint any longer .
Why did the vast majority of us insist on this Conciliation Procedure ?
Has he kept himself abreast of developments ?
Thirdly and lastly , the specialised training course for general practitioners was extended to three years .
I will dress it up in a question that has still not been answered by this directive : why are we so reluctant to recognise qualifications obtained outside the European Union ?
In Luxembourg , for example , the Minister of Justice must give his personal authorisation whenever the banking sector is involved .
However , may I also state for the record that Parliament called back in November for all animals over 18 months old to be tested and , Commissioner , I see a danger here .
If , Mr Byrne , as you now say , the question of removing the vertebral column is a problem , then they are again dragging their feet .
We need to do the same with animal fats .
Until such time as the Member States introduce comprehensive testing , and we know how slipshod testing can be , until such time as everything is tested comprehensively , including - and I agree with Mr BÃ¶ge here - the animals taken from the market , then we shall never have a complete picture ; until such time as there is comprehensive testing , we shall not know if Finland , Germany , Austria or Italy are BSE-free .
We are helping the wrong people .
And , Mr Byrne , the question is , where does the mechanically recovered meat go , if not into the food chain ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , I should like to thank the Commission for the information which it has given us on the fight against BSE and to tell Commissioner Byrne that my impression is that he has the situation in hand and that his proposals are clear and decisive .
I say to you , in all honesty that , from what I hear from the Member States at the moment , I have no cause for optimism whatsoever .
Compliance with the hormone ban must also be strictly controlled within the European Union .
So why question it ?
Mr Wurtz contributed some ideas - and I have to say that Mr Wurtz 's group and my own do not form a permanent coalition - but when we do share the same position on something , why should we not then act accordingly ?
Nevertheless , that should not stop us from entering into a dialogue with the other groups and perhaps requesting that this should go on the agenda in March .
In particular , everyone is now aware that the Commission and Parliament are not pausing for breath
