However , in this instance , language is not an emotive issue , but a practical one .
I agree with many of my fellow Members who have said that the rapporteur has produced an excellent piece of work and that he ( together with the shadow rapporteurs , of course ) is now able to present a superb report .
What I think is the bottom line here is that we use the most efficient modes of transport and that we make optimal use of our existing infrastructure , from an environmental and an economic perspective .
I will conclude by saying that we really need to come up with quantifiable targets for all manner of things connected with transport and I would ask the Commission to address that in the White Paper : we need specific quantifiable targets and a time scale so that we know how to implement all of that .
It is indeed proof of Europe 's decisiveness that we achieved a result in this way , in consultation between all the institutions .
We need to further strengthen our own institutions .
We must shoulder our responsibility in that regard , and we must do so by striking a successful balance with data protection , whilst bearing in mind our commitment to building up our protective mechanisms .
These are all positive steps .
The Netherlands itself is best placed to make tailored policy .
For example , the Netherlands already has a policy in place at local level for passenger infrastructure and access for disabled passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway .
We must prevent the social exclusion of a whole generation of young people and the jeopardising of Europe 's economic and social future .
Today , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tabled an alternative resolution that aimed to put the main focus on an unambiguous status of 'worker ' ( in whatever capacity ) and pushed for a directive guaranteeing equal rights for all workers .
It also wishes to cooperate on taking the next step towards the Community method .
Deeds not words is exactly what Parliament wants when it comes to strengthening economic governance , and also when it comes to the legislation on European supervision of the financial institutions .
My report seeks to show that this is insufficient and that we need to look at remuneration policies from a broader perspective and strengthen the corporate-governance rules so that the ground rules and internal procedures for all the companies in the financial sector , on the one hand , and listed companies , on the other , meet the same criteria .
In addition , in the interests of social justice and for ethical reasons , the difference between the highest and the lowest remuneration in a company should remain reasonable .
Commissioner , I am looking forward to your proposals on corporate governance , which have been announced in the Green Paper , as that is another dossier we shall certainly be continuing to work on in the coming months and years .
Therefore , Commissioner , I am delighted to hear that you are in favour of a corporate governance regulatory framework for all companies , and I gather that there is to be an in-depth discussion on this with stakeholders in the coming months .
Well , these are products that were not on the EU market before 15 May 1997 because they had not yet been invented or were not yet recognised as food in the EU , for example .
Research has shown that consumers are spending more and more money on animal products produced using methods respectful of animal welfare .
The Council took the view that meat from cloned animals should fall under novel foods legislation .
After all , as a politician , it is damned difficult to explain to voters why - without a public debate on the subject - we are serving up meat from cloned animals on the tables of our consumers .
At first reading , she managed to obtain the support of a particularly large majority for her proposals : 658 MEPs supported her work , which is a majority of the kind seldom seen .
Therefore , my whole group supports the rapporteur 's approach , the desire to retain as many of the first reading amendments as possible and also the whole approach to cloned animals and other elements of this proposal .
Indeed , much has been said about this , but the novel foods regulation is about very much more .
In the light of this , I am truly disappointed with the course of the negotiations .
Therefore , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will ultimately be voting in favour of this legislation , but with a heavy heart , as it has been such heavy going .
Five hundred million Europeans no longer want to use illegally harvested timber , and those who do attempt this practice will be punished .
Unfortunately , if it is not enforced effectively , it will be a paper tiger .
The EPP Group wanted to decrease the protection of local populations by hiding behind the low moral standards of legislators in third countries , who allow their people to be exploited by facilitating large-scale deforestation or failing to combat it effectively .
I should also like to make clear that we feel rather encouraged in our approach to these six months .
We have actively striven for what Mr Daul would call 'moins de promesses , plus de r√©sultats ' ; that is , fewer promises and more results .
As a former parliamentary official , I know that preparing a budget - I am going back 15 years here - is always a rather delicate task .
Today , with the disappearance of the distinction between
