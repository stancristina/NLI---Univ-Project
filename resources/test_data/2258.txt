The Council will also take its decision without any political benefit .
In your case , we are certain that you will submit proposals for the regulation of the financial markets quickly , reliably and correctly and be able to implement them together with us .
It must be strictly regulated and the decisions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs comprise a total of 48 individual points : standardisation of derivatives , trade repositories , the establishment of central counterparty clearing houses , use of organised trading venues , enhancement of market integrity and market oversight , derivatives for companies and end users must be regulated separately and we need the aforementioned ownership rules .

It has already been said that they failed to spot the crisis coming .
