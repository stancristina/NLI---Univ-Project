.
Unless a new financial perspective is established , the institutions will find themselves in a situation in which there is no agreement between them , and that would lead to total economic uncertainty and stagnation in the EU.     .
Approximately EUR 85 million of this is ‘fresh’ money .
In December , the EU managed to set aside EUR 123 million in this year’s budget , of which food aid accounted for EUR 23 million , and the emergency relief reserve EUR 100 million .
Now the issue is one of reconstruction assistance .
It means clearing up entire regions , the repair and construction of homes , and reviving the economy .
Recently , cooperation between the Council and Parliament has not been exactly brilliant in matters relating to the budget , and that reached an acute stage in the complete deadlock in talks on the financial framework in June .
I support the proposed regulation and I also support Mrs Grossetête’s excellent report , and I wish to raise three brief points with regard to it .
In my opinion , this proposal for a regulation is an incentive for further research , and should be supported .
My second remark is that the six month supplementary protection proposed by the Commission and Françoise Grossetête is a good thing , as at present we rely too much on the use of medicines intended for adults as medication directly adapted for children .
My last point is that I think it is ultimately a question of whether we conduct clinical research or learn through our mistakes when children have received the wrong drugs .
A pill for a child is not half of that for an adult , and a child’s coat is not a shrunken version of an adult’s .
However , fewer than 30 % of the medications registered in Finland , for example , include dosage instructions for children of all ages .
I come from Finland , so I do not want to make this into a commercial for a mobile phone company , but it is the best way of connecting people .
Karl Deutsch talked about it in the 1930s .
It is as simple as that .
There is real growth potential in the services sector .
All of that is good .
One thing I find unfortunate , but the rapporteur could not do anything about it , is that we did not get tourism into the treaty , because the Constitution has not yet entered into force , but I think the system of classification in the report is good .
Finally , I hope that Mr Berlusconi and Mr Chirac read this report and become inspired to travel around Europe and taste different kinds of food .     .
It could be described as a patchwork quilt : it lacks any grand design or focus .
His conclusion that the gender dimension should be taken into account and the areas of focus which he mentioned were truly welcome .
It was also very positive that the Commissioner suggested that mental health was a priority .
Alcohol consumption has increased in almost all Member States , and deaths and alcohol-related illnesses have become common .
This has been a fatal trend , especially among the young .
Mr President , it is excellent that the Northern Dimension is once again entering the debate , and I am very encouraged by Commissioner Michel’s eagerness to commit to its development .
The programme has not yet produced the results that were hoped for , and many people still know very little about it .
Apart from attracting very little attention , the Northern Dimension has been given very little money .
The Northern Dimension has suffered from a certain lack of identity , and so far has been unable to create a clear profile for itself that distinguishes it from other programmes .
We should be realistic : only a strategy with a clear financial framework and a budget line will succeed in establishing its status .
The Baltic Sea is unquestionably part of the Northern Dimension .
Surrounding it are new Member States of the EU which are highly motivated to strengthen cooperation in the Baltic region so that all the important elements of the Northern Dimension are reinforced and new political muscle is used for regional cooperation .
This is where Baltic Sea conservation and development of the Baltic Sea economic region are important .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for this communication .
The enlarged European Union needs visibility in its various geographical regions .
The Northern Dimension is a later arrival in the sphere of EU activity .
The EU’s most recent round of enlargement also raises the matter of the need for a new Eastern Dimension .
Canada , too , is involved in many projects .
This autumn a sewage works southwest of St Petersburg will be completed .
It will have considerable importance for reducing the waste load in the Baltic Sea .
As the Commissioner said , the Nordic Council of Ministers , the Council of the Baltic Sea States , and the Barents Euro-Arctic Regional Council are all important players in the Northern Dimension .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Northern Dimension is both an issue of external relations and an internal matter .
The Baltic is one of the most vulnerable areas of sea in the world , and at present it is in very poor shape .
It is actually a vast zone devoid of oxygen , where the basic living organisms have died .
The Baltic is fairly large in area but it is shallow .
The pollution load reaching the Baltic , however , is high .
We know that a major oil tanker accident is a catastrophe wherever it may occur .
The greatest cause of this is agriculture .
