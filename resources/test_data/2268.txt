the substantial increase in the number and size of operators and the changing conditions of competition over the market as a whole , the national regulatory authorities should , henceforth , start to use their competences , moving on from an ex ante approach to regulation to an ex post approach .
Mr President , I feel that this report marks a decisive moment for the future of electronic communications in Europe .
Mr President , the Commission ' s communication provides an in-depth analysis of the sector and certainly presents a series of positive proposals .
In my opinion , Mr Zimeray should continue to enjoy parliamentary immunity .
I refer to the fact that it is essential not to place the citizens in the situation where they have to change all the equipment they use because a potential source of harm to the environment has been found , caused by the emission into the environment of substances produced by the machines - often common appliances such as refrigerators and cars - that they use .
While we are on the subject , I would like to inform you that my mother , who is 85 years old , is still walking round Rome without a mobile phone , which is one of the issues covered by this resolution .
As Parliament has already stated , the deactivation of obsolete installations and waste management will have to be financed from dedicated funds , not from capital intended to fund research .
It must be recognised that , for some time , the comparison between the cost of the different sources of energy has been distorted by underestimation of the cost of decommissioning the installations and waste management .
However , it has to be said that the current situation of the Joint Research Centres , particularly the situation of the Ispra site , is the result of a past policy which did not take the problem of the disposal of nuclear waste into due account .
Madam President , on the other hand , the Italian Radical Members do not support the proposal to allow this system of excessive taxation and monopolies to continue for a further three years .
Let us take care , then !
And it makes no difference whether the products in question are beer , as in this case , or other products .
Information on smuggling in the Scandinavian countries of products which are in themselves harmless , such as beer or wine , must serve as a warning against political prohibition of alcohol , and against prohibition of other products as well , rather than being an example which some have maintained should be followed by the other countries of the European Union .
It may be that the Treaties are not sufficiently clear on this subject , seeing that they do not mention the rights of the disabled and they do not provide enough protection for children and babies , who are nowadays particularly affected by widespread paedophilia in Europe .
Mr President , I am ashamed to say so but I could not stop myself dozing off a couple of times during the votes which have just taken place and only managed to wake up and cast my vote at the last minute .
According to the Schengen Agreement , there should not be any systematic checks and there should not be any obligation to present oneself to the Customs authorities or notify them that one is leaving national territory .
Since we are recording the amount of goods which cross the borders , why do we not also record how many people cross from one country to another within the European Union ?
' And when was that ? ' you may ask .
I would stress another point : I come from Italy , which is a Mediterranean country , and I would like to emphasise that the attempt to reduce subsidies for tobacco plantations is a very delicate issue .
Lulling report ( A5-0144/2000 )
Mr President , I have to say that I was very surprised to find myself voting for this report , for it represents , perhaps , the surrender of the European Union to one of the original Communities out of which it grew , namely Euratom : the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
Mr President , the Beijing +5 Conference has not actually made any significant progress in achieving the aims defined in the Beijing 1995 action programme .
Mr President , I , too , would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency , in particular Minister Maria de Bel√©m , and the Commission , represented by Commissioner Diamantopoulou , for their guidance and coordination work both at the preparatory stage and during the Conference , for this allowed the European Union to make a substantial contribution to the production of the final document .
Poverty affects women more than anybody else .
Therefore , we need to focus on clear policies which fight the social exclusion of women and consolidate their role as active protagonists of political change and economic development .
We attach great importance to preserving and consolidating this Agreement , and I would like to make it quite clear that , as far as we are concerned , there is no question about this .
It is also based on shared values , on respect for cultural , religious and linguistic differences , and on policies capable of producing prosperity and security for the entire Mediterranean area .
It is therefore to be hoped that the EU-Tunisia Association Council will assume the responsibility of continuously monitoring the human rights situation in Tunisia by means of a joint action carried out together with the equivalent Tunisian representatives , and that it will create a joint system to monitor the issue which can only bring social improvements to the human rights situation in Tunisia .
