Despite this , there are quite a few exceptions on the basis of military or economic interests , and the extent of public access differs from Member State to Member State in the EU.
.
( NL ) Animals are not products .
This policy should therefore be reviewed as a matter of urgency .
Since a political majority wishes to protect the interests of the traders and carriers involved , various petitions organised over the years have failed to improve the situation .
We found that the text was too watered down ( for example in the votes pertaining to par . 33 ) .
I gleaned very opposing interests and views from these conversations .
But also in the Netherlands , which led the way in privatisation and liberalisation , the disadvantages of a disorganised rail company and of delayed growth in public transport in densely populated areas are now emerging .
Although the municipal tram company or the local bus company can also take part in the tender , these companies will go under as soon as they lose the tender at some point in the future .
Quite the reverse , in fact .
I do not need to repeat that ports are important .
We should therefore not dispose of the handling of cargo .
Particularly since the Green Paper actually asked for something else on behalf of Parliament and its handling than what we have now received , namely a consideration of the competition among ports instead of in ports .
This , in turn , impacts on the environment , it results in an excessive use of space and generates all kinds of additional problems which we as Greens are also being faced with to a considerable extent .
Mr President , this report has had a rather odd journey .
When these contracts lapse , it is likely that economic insights will have changed yet again .
Unlike in the past , modern port users are uncommitted : they choose their port on the basis of price and quality .
Freight services , or cargo handling , should simply remain in the directive .
I regret that the way in which this directive has been dealt with in Parliament has created unnecessary tension between northern , southern and western Europe .
That is why we need to avoid the wrong interventionist measures from the powers that be .
The Commission Green Paper was already first-rate , but with this supplement I believe we have many sound building blocks for the EU' s energy policy .
It has been said time and again : if there is no energy chapter , then nothing can be done .
Of course , I too would welcome a complete overhaul , but in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , the Commission has already warned that if the chemical substances policy is overloaded , the ship will sink .
Mr President , the principles underlying the strategy for a future EU policy on chemical substances , namely to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment while ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market and stimulating innovation and competitiveness in the chemical industry , receive my unqualified support .
Responsibility should really be placed with industry , and that means , therefore , that it must also be able to take risk-restricting measures off its own bat .
That is why support for the White Paper is so important , but even more so , support for the improvements which are being proposed in the Sch√∂rling report .
Pressure from the chemical industry has been enormous , particularly in the last few days .
A second essential element is that we must be able to ban substances of high concern , such as persistent and bioaccumulative substances and endocrine disrupters , unless they are essential from a social point of view and no alternatives are available .
Fortunately , we are not starting from scratch .
However , there is also bad news , and I should like to mention four points .
As it is difficult to recycle plastic , something must be done about this .
First of all , we must devote more attention to recycling .
For that purpose , I suggest making the manufacturers responsible .
In addition to the three above-mentioned points , fellow MEPs have added a number of useful suggestions : clear responsibility not only for products but also for retailers ; paying attention to the role of local councils and of consumers ; and paying attention to planning and transport packaging .
This is truly a joint outcome , and I therefore hope that the Commission , as well as the Council , is prepared to take this outcome seriously .
We have slightly shifted the priorities .
Indeed , on the one hand , it is important to create a framework within which research is to take place , but on the other hand , it is important , by means of further research , to create space for solutions to be found for existing illnesses with a genetic hereditary factor .
Citizens would then be forced to contribute towards research which is punishable in a Member State such as Germany and which a number of national parliaments have declared themselves openly against .
Has the Commission looked into this ?
That is not only applied research , but also fundamental research .
Mr President , I should like to ask you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution further to yesterday ' s communication by Commissioner de Palacio that she would not accept what is now being decided upon by a large majority in Parliament .
That is the only point added , and I therefore hope that our socialist friends , as well as others , will vote in favour of this amendment .
The wish from
