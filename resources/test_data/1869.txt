External aid , however , is an area where we still see substantial problems .
The rapporteur has referred clearly to the disastrous way the aid to Palestine was handled , which gives a very poor signal at a time when the utmost political delicacy and sensitivity were needed in that region .
Another Court of Auditors ' report on external aid has come out very recently and we shall be looking at that in the future .
Once again , I thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on a job well done .
Mr President , I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Dell'Alba 's report and its recognition that the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation Fund are an innovative means of consolidating the peace process .
The difficult environment in which the Funds have had to operate , their role as a pump primer , the approach in giving priority to disadvantaged areas and the unique role in pioneering the joint management and delivery of cross-border programmes have all been given the recognition they deserve .
I understand that the International Fund for Ireland has produced a comprehensive response to the issues raised in the Court of Auditors ' report , which can be made available to Members .
That response includes a number of specific actions that the Fund is taking to address matters raised in the report .
It is important to stress one crucial point in relation to the International Fund for Ireland : this is not a European Union programme .
The Fund is , in fact , an international organisation with its own governing body , rules , audit procedures and so on .
Furthermore , the European Union is just one of five donors involved in its financing .
The European Union 's annual contribution constitutes 35 % of the total .
The International Fund for Ireland was established by the British and Irish Governments in 1986 with the objective of promoting economic and social advance and encouraging contact , dialogue and reconciliation between the Unionists and Nationalists throughout Ireland .
Contributors to the Fund are the United States , the European Union , Canada , New Zealand and Australia .
Since the Fund was set up it has provided assistance of EUR 597 million to 4 600 projects , which have helped to create 38 000 jobs , leading to an additional investment of approximately EUR 1.193 billion , bringing the overall investment in these projects to almost EUR 1.79 billion ; directed almost 90 % of its commitments to the most deprived areas ; encouraged over 9 000 participants in cross-community groups and encouraged 5 000 participants in cross-border structures .
Mr President , I would like to start by giving my thanks to the Court of Auditors for its very useful report this time on a range of issues .
We were very critical of it at the time of the annual report but I think these special reports are very valuable .
There are clearly a range of areas where the Commission has yet to act to improve matters .
Today , I am going to concentrate on a response to the report written by Mr Dell'Alba on various aspects of the Structural Funds .
Certainly , in my country , this is one of the areas where the European Union can visibly claim to be making a difference , and there is a recognition that Structural Funds and the attempt to increase wealth , and improve social conditions and employment rates in an area give a positive image of the EU.
But we cannot stand by and uncritically applaud .
The reports by the Court of Auditors clearly show that there is room for radical improvement , and the Commission has already introduced a new Structural Fund regulation to improve the situation and will obviously be checking very carefully to see whether these reforms have gone far enough .
In the case of additionality , we must remember that European Funds are intended not to finance but to cofinance operations and must not take the place of public expenditure by national authorities .
That is all very well , but even the new regulations only allow for assessment of additionality at a national level and not at a regional level .
Rules are rules , but if there is no effective punishment after breaking them , they become weaker and unenforceable , so we need to see a solid legal basis to develop the possible imposition of sanctions .
On the issue of the development of industrial sites , the Commission should not wring its hands but say that this should only be seen as part of a wider policy to assist SMEs .
Substantial sums go into these developments .
In Wales , for example , we know that this is a clear target ; we need clear targets and objectives and we will be looking forward to seeing those within the Structural Fund programmes in future .
Mr President , I thank the rapporteur for the specific references in his report to two major fundings in Northern Ireland relating to our peace process and for his positive response to the International Fund for Ireland , which is funded not just by Europe but also by the United States , Canada and Australia .
I would advise other regions with serious problems of unemployment to study the work of the International Fund in Northern Ireland and the border counties .
It has done such outstanding work .
For example , it has funded some 4 600 projects , creating 38 000 jobs , and almost 90 % of these jobs are in areas of high unemployment and in deprived areas .
Some 9 000 people from cross-community groups have been involved in these projects for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and some 5 000 people have been involved in the
