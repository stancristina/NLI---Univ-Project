have to accept the results of democratic elections .
However , democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy .
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust , the death of 6 million Jews , to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s .
However , we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition .
Leopards do not change their spots .
The real culprits are Austria ' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945 .
Madam President , we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of JÃ¶rg Haider ' s Freedom Party in Austria , which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part , and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people .
We warn that this coalition , if it is formed today , unacceptably legitimises the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this European Union .
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria , and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens .
I am proud to support such a resolution .
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today , I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken .
Madam President , on a point of order .
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House , holding a senior position within his delegation , continues to offer strategic advice to private clients , but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are .
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit , but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible .
Madam President , since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors , may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and , above all , to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House , but is also published on the Internet ?
Madam President , on a point of order .
As this is the first Valentine ' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease , the biggest killer in the European Union .
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease .
Happy Valentine ' s Day !
Madam President , I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning .
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices , because that would be a very serious matter indeed .
In the past the British Conservatives ' double standards have brought the United Kingdom ' s House of Commons into disrepute , and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House .
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking .
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC ?
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies , or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe ?
Madam President , this afternoon , in this Chamber , reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning , which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House .
These are serious allegations .
They are completely untrue , malicious , politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood .
We are taking legal advice .
My colleagues ' register of interests is complete .
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House .
Madam President , it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here !
