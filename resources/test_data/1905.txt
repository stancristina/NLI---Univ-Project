role as emboldener and researcher .
Markets are growing and , at the same pace , industry 's expectations for sales of cordless and fixed multimedia applications are growing also .
International competition for customers is fierce , however .
There are great demands now being made by consumers .
Unless these needs are understood in good time , Europe might lose its influence and no longer be an important player in this important area of industry .
This competitiveness in products and services coming out of the production process must be preserved , because it forms the basis of the developing information society .
With them the price can get so high that it clearly affects the operator 's ability to get sufficient coverage and provide a decent service .
This would distort competition and hamper the chances of new , innovative , small-sized companies getting into the market .
Mr President , firstly a few words about Mrs Read 's report .
Now they intend to ease the process still further .
We must take care that the work environment is not so confusing and complex as to encourage a growing variety of telecommunications systems , which are not at all compatible for the user .
Here there is a very great danger of inequality arising out of the prospect of new telecommunications equipment making it difficult for disabled people to work .
I believe the Commission has to address this matter much more seriously .
This is an important point when we consider how more and more new wavelengths are being split up .
The ECU 70 million addition to the Socrates programme is a positive move .
In the spirit of the treaty let us strive to bring the European dimension to the question of education .
Each Community-spent mark , franc or crown which helps our citizens to become more mobile in a concrete way , makes the Union seem more real and meaningful in the eyes of our people .
If students and researchers are made more mobile this should be the key project for both close-knittedness in the Union and future enlargement .
It is a crying shame that some of the exchange programme places have not been filled just because the Erasmus project was so meagre in its funding and so young people have not been given the opportunity to study abroad .
Is this the European dimension in educational development ?
Would it be right to claim compensation for the unequal distribution of olive oil resources , for example ?
This region we are in here is a pretty substantial non-olive oil producing region .
The reference to the canals of Provence and California was made without justification or critical examination .
In the case of Europe the matter is complicated by the fact that the effects are common to more than one Member State .
Rights of ownership to land and water differ dramatically from one country to another .
A positive feature of the resolution is the mention of the creation of a water market .
This must be made much more of in our efforts to reach a stage where everything will happen within the framework of a free market .
In any case an inventory of water reserves should be drawn up and these reserves must be protected through EU directives .
Mr President , we are now discussing matters which came about before Finland joined the EU , matters which do not concern us but countries in the EU that lie further south .
Administrative confusion is clearly peculiar to the European Union .
The Commission appears to have operated in a way reminiscent of the Belgian police .
It is a serious issue when the Commission stands accused of responding negatively to investigation , that it holds back information from Parliament , and that illegalities have occurred which remain unexplained .
It amazes me that there are so many incompetent people working in the service of the Commission .
There has been financial negligence both at the distribution and at the receipt end .
It has to do with people 's mental and physical health , and their fitness for work .
There cannot be anything more important than this .
Health and safety at work do not just benefit the worker , but also the employer and the whole of society .
Hopefully the completion of a common position by the Council means that the health and safety at work log-jam is breaking up at last , now that it is the British term of office .
The report states that biological limit values may be determined only in exceptional circumstances where other means fail .
Naturally , the principle of biological monitoring is always agreed beforehand with workers ' representatives .
I would like clarification of whether this document will concern all or just three - the most important three - bodies mentioned in the Amsterdam Treaty : the Commission , Parliament and the Council .
Is it understood that Europe 's future central bank should be subordinate to public legislation ?
I think this would be an excellent way to proceed .
Vehicle emissions must be cut by every possible means .
Work must be done at their source , with the development of the combustible engine .
It is important now to develop viable catalytic convertors for diesel fuels and to improve their quality .
The industry is acting as if it had to meet these new costs itself .
That would result in just a minute rise in the price of fuel .
It is the European Parliament 's duty to refuse to ensure the survival of the oil industry by subsidizing poor quality oil .
Any oil industry which cannot sell its products except at the cost of the pollution of the natural world deserves to go bust .
It is important if we wish to improve air quality .
