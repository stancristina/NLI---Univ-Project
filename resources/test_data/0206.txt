Following on from what was said yesterday , I would like again to urge the bureau to give some attention to the question of how MEPs are to be guaranteed adequate access when exercising their right to vote .
I agree with Mr Juncker , the Prime Minister of Luxembourg , that the proposals relating to the presidency of the specialised Councils of Ministers are unclear , in other words , that they still need some clarificatory amendments .
Personalities are of course important , and we also know that the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , and the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat are the decision-makers , but , in essence , this is about the people of these countries .
Nor can we expect the Americans to do everything - their elections mean , in any case , that they are less capable of acting in this area .
The fact is that there is violence other than terrorism in the traditional sense .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , honourable Members , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Lamy and I agree entirely in judging Cancún , to our regret , to have been a disappointment , a failure that leaves us all damaged and is of course also a setback for the whole Doha development agenda .
There was , for the very first time , the prospect of the complete abolition of all forms of export promotion for a whole list of products of particular interest to the developing countries .
Secondly , there are of course especially great differences between the industrialised and developing countries , but these blocs are far from homogeneous , any more than the European Union is a homogeneous edifice .
We felt the same thing once again in Cancún in relation to the African states involved , and that feeling has even to some extent reached the G21 countries , who of course also attempted to mount a kind of revolt and to break this monopoly of power between Europe and the United States and perhaps also other nations .
No, I think that the TENs are a very important tool for the European Union , economic cohesion , the internal market and a modern transport policy .
When the European Union has set itself two important objectives - the first in Lisbon , concerning the competitiveness of our continent , and the second , which has since been insufficiently implemented , in Gothenburg , concerning the sustainability of economic development on our continent - it is rather strange that there are already many contradictions in transport policy , in terms of many very different investments and trends , and of the fact that - although we hope this will soon happen - roads are , to some extent , still not paying their way in the light , for example , of the Road Costs Directive .
People and companies ought to benefit from this wealth of information .
This , of course , is where , especially , use of the Internet comes in .
The way it works is that , even if you have something and nothing in the way of information - just a clue as to a book 's title or an author 's name - you arrive at the relevant page and are immediately told : ' Customers who bought this book also bought ? '
In the environment , account is to be taken of effects upon photosynthesis .
It is technically impossible to reduce the proportion of volatile organic solvents to below 300 grams per litre by 2007 and still further by 2010 , but it is technically possible and sensible to reduce the proportion of these substances to 400 grams per litre by 2007 and to a permissible maximum value of 300 grams per litre by 2010 .
I hope that , in the near future , we can count upon a proposal by the Commission on chemicals policy .
Now we could say very coldly , ' Well , hard luck ! '
I now turn , however , to arms policy : after the operations in the Balkans , we were told repeatedly by the American side that Europe only spent 50 % of what the Americans spend on defence , but that measured in terms of efficiency it was only 10 % .
Thirdly , we note that it is relatively straightforward to ascertain who has manufactured the arms , and often this also tells you who owns them .
Brokers in the arms trade are quite unique agents .
That is why we urgently need registration , firstly of the product , secondly of its movements and thirdly of the end-user .
Or look to the East , for example : thankfully the situation in Central Europe has improved - next to me is sitting my friend Figel from Slovakia , a human rights campaigner - and happily 12 years ago these nations overthrew the cruel regimes that practised torture in a democratic revolution , but in the Member States of the Council of Europe , which is meeting concurrently at the other side of the Ill , the problem still exists .
This gives me grounds for optimism about the willingness to debate and discuss this issue within the ACP partnership , because as you know it is one that we unfortunately have to deal with in these countries .
It is certainly right to check how cooperation is assured on an individual basis , but there should be no doubt about the European Union 's commitment to providing victims of torture with a refuge here .
I am also trying to enlist support for the proposal in my own group .
    – Mr President , the next item on the agenda is the oral question on the liberal professions .
There are two basic reasons
