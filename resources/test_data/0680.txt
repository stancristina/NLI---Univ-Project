The rapporteur says it is important to create a means of making comparisons in investment and employment throughout the Union .
The Commission 's proposal to reduce VAT in labour-intensive sectors is most worthwhile .
In this way we could introduce tax relief systems for sectors that employ large numbers of workers .
There are two dimensions to sandwich courses and apprenticeship training : the financial and the socio-economic , and they complement each other .
On the other hand , it is important to stress that small and medium-sized companies have a special role as employers .
That is why common resources must be put into this sector , enabling it to offer apprenticeships and places for young trainees .
This latter has been underrated for a long time now as a fully-fledged participant in social dialogue within the Union .
The main responsibility for the harmonization of exams and the training and apprenticeship periods that go with them belongs to the authorities in the Member States of the Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of my group I would like to thank Mr Monfils for his splendid report .
By the year 2000 all Member States of the Union will have their own City of Culture year planned .
Helsinki should have got her own City of Culture year considering her internationally respected , and at the same time totally indigenous , contribution to the Arts , as well as the cultural arrangements that are now being undertaken in preparation for the year 2000 .
The most important contribution the City of Culture project can make is , in the end , its permanent influence on society , and it is therefore necessary to try to get the community as a whole involved in events , to take part in them and get something out of them .
You can then build a selected theme on that individual cultural base , taking advantage of reciprocal action and cultural offerings on an international basis .
The birth of lasting cultural cooperation is one of the key goals of the Union .
I hope the Commission will continue to develop the European City of Culture notion , which is a splendid opportunity , for example , for associate countries to develop their cultural heritage and creativity .
It is important to stress that the City of Culture programme ought also to be used to bring capital cities outside the EU to the attention of the public .
Sufficient community funding must be found for these programmes , but even more important is the link between business and the events themselves .
Mr President , after almost ten years of debating the issue , the natural gas markets are now being deregulated .
I would like to thank Claude Desama for his excellent work on this matter .
Electricity producers will be allowed to pipe gas regardless of the size of the company , but if the company is a producer of combined heat and power , Member States may determine the minimum size of the gas company allowed to pipe gas .
Besides , I think it is very important that the implementation of the directive in Member States is monitored and that the Commission also shares its experiences with the European Parliament and Council by means of a report .
Actually , this target has been well exceeded in Finland .
According to proposed national quotas , an additional reduction in gas emissions will cost Finland more per ton of CO2 than any other EU country .
We have already begun to adopt all the easiest ways of reducing emissions , such as district heating , using wood for fuel , setting up combined heat and electricity production plants and following energy saving programmes .
High technology in Finland has a place in nearly every walk of life .
Mr President , we would avoid problems like that raised by Mr Medina Ortega if the rapporteur would not preside when we are dealing with his report .
A common currency does not only mean a new dimension in economic cooperation , but it also has a bearing on political matters and security .
Next on the agenda is the selection of the European Central Bank 's Executive Board .
I hope that it will represent the wider economic view , and that the question of equality is not ignored .
Events that prove to be historic develop step by step , event by event , from one moment to the next .
The decisions have been taken consciously and on the basis of current information and the best possible forecasts .
A broad base is essential for the euro area , without divisions in the EU.
The biggest challenge in the world is the creation of stability , with capital moving freely and globally .
Citizens must be able to have considerably more say in Union matters than they do now , so that the gulf between them and the decision-makers does not widen even further .
The various national economies are still different from one another in character and they are at different stages of progress .
Monetary policy must be open and accountable .
Madam President , I voted "yes ' , but it is important that no new provisos are created for the Growth and Stability Pact in respect of EMU, but , on the contrary , that we should leave some room for manoeuvre , economically speaking , so as to improve employment and create a social Europe .
If we want to get the approval of the citizens of Europe for EMU, we must be able to reduce mass unemployment .
It is important that welfare and employment are shared fairly among all our citizens .
The proposal is about the patenting of natural life forms on behalf of major European companies , so that they cannot enjoy the same unethical rights
