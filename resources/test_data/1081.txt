The company is urging the EU to pass on the report .
It is important that openness is not just a theory but that it is applied in practice as well .
Sweden is one of those countries in the EU which has some of the longest transport distances .
Now that the EU wants to change this system , reference is made to a report marked secret .
I would like to thank the Council President for the answer I received .
For example , what legislation should be used to decide if a person may be put under surveillance or not .
So is our resolution and our debate today meaningless ?
So are all those who oppose the regime in Teheran good democrats ?
More and more Iranians are becoming involved and it is to them which we in the European Parliament give the full support of Europe .
So you must also ask the question , who is against , so that we who are against can register our opposition , even if there are only a few of us .
Both are largely in agreement with the conclusions which the Regional Committee came to at their meeting on 15 January 1997 .
I would like to emphasise strongly the great paucity of information made available to those concerned , particularly to small and medium sized companies in Sweden .
As all three countries are net contributors to the EU it is important psychologically that there is a proper and quantitative return to these countries in the form of regional aid and that this can be used simply , quickly and effectively .
To my great disappointment I now see that Mr Rack in amendment proposal no . 4 wants to go against both the Commission and the committee by removing the NGO 's participation .
So I urge Parliament to vote against amendment proposal no 4 in favour of the original text .
There are also parts of the EU 's regional aid which have worked quite well in practice .
There are also several problems which are particularly connected with the Objective 6-Region in Sweden which deals with aid to sparsely populated areas .
What is currently happening is that municipalities and regional authorities are closing down perfectly healthy businesses in order to take on temporary EU projects , which is not a particularly positive development .
It is also important to view regional policy as a whole and to look at the effect EU membership has had .
The EU is also moving towards serious intervention in national regional policy , for example in our transport aid , which is a very effective form of regional political aid .
The regions in the North of Sweden and Finland are extremely sparsely populated with as few as two inhabitants per square kilometre .
Sweden pays 20 billion kronor per year in Membership dues to the EU.
The money which is returned is also loaded with a mass of rules and administration .
We cannot resolve this huge issue now but it must be included when we evaluate the Structural Funds after 1999 .
Mr President , fewer Objectives , fewer funds and community initiatives , better co-ordination between the EU 's regional policy and that of the Member State 's , increased regional and local influence in decision making , planning , implementation and supervision of EU projects , putting all our efforts into doing something about the high unemployment in Northern Sweden and in Northern Finland along with some proposals for a better environment and a border region co-operation are some of the proposals which could further improve regional policy both for the Member States and for the EU.
I consider the Commissioner 's response to be far too weak .
We have discussed the issue time and time again and have received unsatisfactory answers from the Commissioner .
If the people in one particular country democratically decide to raise or lower their taxes we should not be able to prevent them from doing so .
So , looking at all the interpreters around me , I would like to say a special thank you to those of you who are struggling with us at this late hour when so many are absent .
A Europe which does not have an effective system of combating crime or which has a feeble legal system will not win the wide , popular support needed to develop it sufficiently to ensure that people 's hopes and expectations , in securing freedom of movement for example , can be fulfilled .
The fight against crime within the Union is based on the dissemination of information between the national authorities .
There must be clear restrictions surrounding the collection of information , but vital information relevant to a particular case must be included , otherwise it can never be a key instrument in the fight against crime and it has no other function to fulfil .
Had the matter been raised under Article 235 , the Council could have avoided the current unpleasantness .
He states the following : ' The Convention creates the information system necessary through the Convention on Controls on External Frontiers , gives concrete reasons for greater co-operation in the legal sector and for police and customs co-operation , facilitates an improvement in the safety of people ( and objects ) on the Union 's territory and contributes to the removal of barriers to the proper performance of national economies : the fight against the criminal economy , illegal trade of all types ( narcotics , weapons ) , terrorism , criminality , crime and the embezzlement of capital . '
Then we hope that this convention will be quickly ratified so that people can move freely .
Mr President , this report regulates the social security system in the case of an employee or a self employed
