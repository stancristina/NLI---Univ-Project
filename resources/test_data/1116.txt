promoters of eco-labels for fishery products are feathering their nests , causing complete confusion amongst consumers , at best , and more than likely discrediting the system in general , since when a premium can be added to a product by saying that it is ecological , without the need to prove it , then fraud is a likely outcome .
Governments , NGOs , private companies and fishermen have also expressed their opinions .
The change in living habits and the introduction of new technologies have led to an evolution amongst European consumers , who are increasingly concerned about their health and also the protection of the environment .
We in the Committee on Fisheries share the Commission ’s objectives , such as sustainability and the need for European action in this field .     Mr President , after Commissioner Frattini’s speech , I have the impression that we have achieved the objective that we had set ourselves with this exercise , despite it being so late .
European Union law in the private field is still largely national law and therefore the creation of that parliamentary forum would enable us to harmonise positions .
This is not the time to discuss it , but it is something that will improve the quality of our legislation and will undoubtedly enable the European Union to bring its own priorities to the Hague Conference .
In this regard , the fact that the rapporteur comes from the Island of Crete , cradle of Minoan civilisation , Europe’s oldest civilisation , and that I come from the Balearic Islands , the location of the Naveta des Tudons , also considered to be Europe’s oldest example of building , from around 1 500 B.C. , makes us both particularly sensitive to the need to encourage the European Union to adopt measures to protect and revive Europe’s cultural heritage .
I propose that the visit to Spain before 6 October go ahead as planned and , if his group wants us to visit other countries after 6 October , he has my assurance that I will vote in favour of that .     .
Mr President , the political crisis and human rights situation in Zimbabwe is still a serious and alarming issue .
For all of these reasons , I believe that it is our duty to call for the withdrawal of that law .
We are seeing the re-emergence of forms of racism , xenophobia , machismo and homophobia , which suggests that the democratic gains made by the European Union are in retreat .
The example of Switzerland , although it is not part of the European Union , cannot help us , either .
In relation to the maritime transport sector , I agree with the aim of achieving a level playing field , but I also believe it is important to work within the International Maritime Organisation to designate the new sulphur emission control areas ; otherwise , we shall drive part of the European fleet to register in non-EU countries where controls are virtually non-existent .
The working party found that the practice was legal and was also customary in these financial engineering real-estate contracts , as was what , in my view , is the improper use of actual middlemen .
The Commissioner has already mentioned some examples that are leading in that direction , but this report must help to strengthen this requirement even more at a Community level , not only in order to provide the necessary skills in the area of European citizenship , but also to help citizens learn about the Union’s policies and institutions .
That process obliges us to implement an economic reform and , undoubtedly , a modernisation of Europe , but at the same time to remember that , in order to ensure that the economic reform is a success , we must build a more cohesive and inclusive society .
An important and positive negotiation therefore began , which has been maintained throughout the parliamentary procedure that is ending today , with results that we can describe as more than reasonable .
The Pericles programme is intended to support and complement the actions introduced by the Member States and by the existing programmes for protecting the euro by means of exchanges , assistance and training with a view to protecting our single currency against counterfeiting .
It is becoming increasingly difficult to counterfeit our currency .
The Council is postponing the Pericles decision until a final agreement has been adopted on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 ; we entirely agree that it should conform to the financial perspective , with an annual budget of EUR 1 million .
I have here the agenda , with the timetable and the schedule for voting on the two Pericles reports this morning .
Finally , we must point out that the principle of participation in the drawing up of European policy has been taken into account .
We would urge the Commission to continue with its negotiating efforts and ensure that there are going to be no further delays , so that Galileo , the largest of the European-scale industrial projects , moves forward under the best possible conditions and can play its appropriate role in the achievement of the Lisbon objectives .
In this regard , I would like to say that we need a great debate and a great result , which cannot be delayed at this point in the construction of the European Union , because we are often talking about concrete measures , but we need to define what is most important .
It is impossible to accept that with regard to an emerging phenomenon such as Islamic terrorism – which has dared to move on from placing bombs on a bus to placing bombs on a plane , from attacking cartoons to directly attacking the Pope , that is , an emerging phenomenon – the European Union and its institutions do not yet have a political role that the citizens can see .
