The June List has therefore chosen to vote against the proposal that the details should be reported to the Commission .     Sometimes , one is forced , as an MEP , to make a choice between two bad alternatives and choose the least bad .
A third of work-related illnesses are due to the use of chemicals dangerous to people’s health .
Diseases and ill-health affect different groups in society in different ways .
We have had the report include both the fact that there needs to be more focus upon particularly vulnerable groups and the fact that data must be collected in such a way that more information can be obtained about the ways in which different groups in society are vulnerable and are affected by various forms of environmental pollution .
We Social Democrats have therefore chosen to emphasise the need for increased efforts to combat disease caused , especially , by alcohol but also by tobacco , poor diet and lack of exercise .     Madam President , Commissioner , firstly , I wish to thank Mr Grosch for his excellent cooperation and his very constructive method of working on the process of producing the committee’s proposal .
This will take many years , but it is important for old driving licences to be replaced .
That is unacceptable , and we cannot have such a situation .
Change is vitally important for us as fellow road users , for we too are out and about on the roads and we want to know that the driving licences that exist are genuine .
Europe’s doctors must be used to treat people who are ill and for work in the health sphere , not for checking up on every driver .
National exemptions are accepted for cars and mopeds , and we therefore believe that this should also be the case for motorcycles .
We must , therefore , also help produce a basic document entitling people to drive vehicles : a driving licence that is genuine , reliable and up-to-date .     Thank you very much for your answer , which I found encouraging .
We must make use of every option for promoting road safety : all the various existing options and those which are becoming available in the different Member States .
Sugar is also one of the most crucial export products for many of those same poor countries .
As you said , a lot has happened since I put that question , and I just want to express my gratitude to the Commission for showing such great understanding and for having been so accommodating towards both Sweden and the Baltic countries , which have been hit hard in the way described .
As I see it , the decision we shall take tomorrow will lead to an improvement in the situation in the seas and in the marine environment .
I shall therefore be brief and simply conclude by supporting the proposed agreement .     I would thank you for your answer , Commissioner Borg and wish you luck with your fight in the FAO.
In the case of certain species , an increased minimum size can bring about a win-win situation in which , in the long term , we increase reproduction , the biomass and catches .
The rules have been focused upon commercial species but , in the interests of the biosystems and of the commercial species ’ health , we must conserve and protect the non-commercial species too .
Many states and many people around the world , including dissidents and the oppressed , follow this exercise with very great interest .
For example , it is completely absurd that a rogue State such as Libya has chaired the session on human rights .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds this regrettable and would very much like to see resolutions on those very countries – Iran and China – because they are the worst offenders when it comes to the infringement of human rights .
It is also very important that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , her staff and various bodies be given sufficient resources to enable them to work on the issue .
The courage of these people is essential to our learning of human rights abuses , and it is thus a prerequisite for the session in Geneva .
For that reason , it is our duty not to forget the work they do .     . – The Commission is proposing that the Council authorise the Member States falling under the EU’s common visa , asylum and immigration policy ( including Sweden ) to ratify , in the interests of the Community , the Seafarers ’ Identity Documents Convention of the International Labour Organisation .
The June List does not , therefore , see anything to prevent the Member States from making their own decisions on whether they wish to accede to the Convention , without authorisation from the EU.     . – In our opinion , it is a good thing as far as possible to harmonise the rules for , and appearance of , driving licences within the European Union .
It is often said that the Member States have to trust each other when it comes to legislation and rules .
The Swedish Government Offices ’ information note 2003/04 :FPM113 states that there has been a ‘marked increase in the amount of fraud in connection with the certification procedure’ .
In our opinion , it is wrong , however , of the European Parliament to call on the Commission to take the initiative on issues of lifestyle-related diseases or various measures against smoking .
For this reason , it is wrong to call on the Commission to work , on the one hand
