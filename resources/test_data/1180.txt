backing .
This anniversary is particularly relevant at a time when the Commission is preparing further reform of the common organisation of the market in wine , with a view to gradually dismantling it .
Young people must be helped to understand this , and to absorb the fact that they belong to a shared tapestry of civilisation that gives rise , on the one hand , to diverse cultures and national entities , and , on the other , to a particular view of Europe around the world that , historically , has changed the course of the human race .
This is the dimension of which we speak .
Secondly , we believe that SGIs must be described and defined , and the distinction between services of general economic interest ( SGEIs ) and services of non-economic general interest ( SNEGIs ) clarified as regards their legal certainty .
I hope that the Commission and its President focus not only on the report but also on the points that I have raised .     .
Hence our abstention .     .
This is a treasure trove of knowledge that the whole of Europe should be promoting .
The pollution limit values put forward in the Commission ’s first proposal were a step backward in relation to what was agreed in 1999 , that is to say , in Directive 1999/30/EC .
This proposal is therefore of the highest importance .
The issue of where the seats of the institutions are located is not merely a geographical , logistical or economic issue .
The lack of good faith , decent hospitality and fairness that this reveals is something we should condemn outright and should be taken into account when decisions are taken as to where Parliament should be located .     .
Furthermore , it will provide a boost for European citizenship and for the creation of a society based on knowledge , innovation and entrepreneurship .     .
It is now necessary to make up for lost time and adopt a series of measures aimed at removing the last remaining ( legal , administrative and financial ) obstacles , thereby deriving the maximum benefit from mobility in education and training .
Coming , as I do , from a country in which there are still high levels of illiteracy and long-term unemployment , and in which 50 % of pupils do not finish secondary education , I supported this report , which puts lifelong learning high on the agenda in the reform of labour markets .
I voted in favour of the Hegyi report ( A6-0233/2006 ) on the thematic strategy on the urban environment , because it is vital to boost the overall environmental performance of cities in Europe by reducing bureaucracy , by enhancing the efficiency of environmental policy implementation , and by encouraging long-term environmental planning .
Far from it , in fact ; the EU has been introducing more obligations and requirements without creating the appropriate financial resources , which may exacerbate the inequalities between the wealthiest countries and regions and other areas that lag behind .     .
It therefore strikes me as clear that in order to foster an integrated approach to urban policy , it is crucial to promote private-public partnerships and to effectively manage existing Community instruments to support urban policy .
In this regard , the report contains some contradictions , for example , the attempts to bring the EQF into line with the so-called Bologna process and the so-called Lisbon Strategy , which as we know , is aimed primarily at pandering to the interests of the economic and financial groups .
I regret , however , that this initiative does not sufficiently reflect what is actually happening in the labour market and overlooks the importance of vocational training , focusing , instead , mainly on academic training .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we accept that the euro needs to be adequately protected by means of a range of integrated , effective measures involving close cooperation at both European and international level .
In other words , the level of counterfeiting is low , a major factor in which is the high level of cooperation among the relevant services .
Furthermore – and this is a point I wish to emphasise – it is aimed at extending its application to the non-participating Member States .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a decision on strategic guidelines on cohesion , to which we have been asked to give a favourable response , and which will serve as the basis for drawing up national strategic reference frameworks , strikes me as an excellent statement of intentions for the Council , for which we must thank Mrs Krehl .
For this to happen , these factors must be embraced by all of us in a spirit of cooperation .
Once this Council decision has been adopted , the Member States will not have much time to submit their strategies for implementing the Structural Funds , incorporating these Community guidelines , to the Commission .
I trust , therefore , that the national strategies to be submitted succeed in achieving the best possible balance between competitiveness and solidarity .     – Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr  Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , once again we are taking stock here in this Chamber of the construction of the area of freedom , security and justice .
We want to see more democratic legitimacy and a common European approach to migration that is based on the principles of cohesion and solidarity and that covers the integration of immigrants living legally in Europe
