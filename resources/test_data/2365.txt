We want the results of its work to make a real contribution to improving safety at sea , achieving the aims for which it was created , which are : - to study maritime disasters , in particular those of the and ; - to analyse their social and economic consequences , with regard in particular to fisheries , industry and tourism , as well as the environment and health ; - to assess current international safety standards and the way in which these are applied ; - to help to ensure implementation of the recommendations that have already been adopted by the EP and to complement them if necessary .
Setting common standards for all Member States on respecting and protecting the individual rights of suspects , defendantsor those convicted in criminal proceedings , as the Commission proposed in its Green Paper , would be useful .
In other words , I disagree with the recommendation for an extremely lengthy list of changes , which would ultimately lead to better safeguards for foreign citizens than for nationals .
The decision to draw up an own-initiative report on promoting women’s participation in what is known as the ‘new information society ’ was a good one .
I regret the fact , however , that the text is unable to resist the temptation to indulge in feminist rhetoric and populism , in the guise of supposedly neutral language .
This proactive attitude is what the vast majority of European citizens want because they associate the excessive red tape and high administrative costs , and also the fragmentation of the car market , with the difficulties in consolidating the internal market .
The proposed links between levels of taxation and CO2 emissions are to be praised , as is the much-desired closer harmonisation of market conditions and the observation the report makes that competition between Member States in the field of taxation is reasonable and advantageous for strong economic development in the EU.
Until this is done , there can be no real social inclusion .
We hope that this year will spark effective policies in this field of supporting people with disabilities and bring recognition of their rights .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as has already been said , we are in the final stages of the European year of People with Disabilities and I wish to add my voice to those of my fellow Members who have spoken in favour of a cross-cutting European directive to address this problem .
More than this , it is a known fact and recognition of this fact .
Otherwise , we will be breaching the principle of subsidiarity , which we believe must be scrupulously observed .
We must emphasise , however , that this is not the real issue .
Loyalty to beliefs and to their origins is their .
Unlike Mr Lisi , I see no good reason for completely excluding Community funding from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research ‘Research using embryonic stem cells’ .
Consequently , this increase of the maximum funding level must be accompanied by an increase in the overall appropriations .     Madam President , the Commission initiatives on harmonising taxation of vehicles and fuels are broadly justified and are to be welcomed .
The ultimate aim of all Community initiatives and proposals for initiatives must be to meet the needs of Europe’s citizens , either by making goods available and guaranteeing their quality , by ensuring the environmental sustainability of societies or by gradually reducing the costs of accessing this type of goods .
I also wish to note something else that cannot be ignored and that is the fact that the internal hearings , both at central and Eurostat level , have worked well and independently .
Otherwise , we will not be able to take the Commission seriously .     . – According to the information available , the number of radioactive sources currently in circulation in the European Union exceeds 100 000 .
This is an attempt to prevent the malicious use of these sources and to enable them to be monitored in the European Union by facilitating their harmonised management at European level , the ongoing monitoring of their life cycle and their safe exchange between countries of the Union .
The system of separate checkpoints for citizens covered by Community law at authorised points for crossing the Union’s external borders is fully justified .
In this respect , I agree with , support and encourage all actions that seek to provide a practical basis for political statements such as the Lisbon Strategy of 2000 and the Europe plan adopted in Seville in 2002 .
The IDA programmes seek to promote cooperation between national public administrations and between these and the Commission , ‘helping ’ to implement legislation , Community programmes , monitoring procedures , ‘and the open coordination method’ .
I am also pleased to note the impressive results achieved under the IDA programme – cross-border cooperation and coordination between public administrations .
This proposal for a directive should be seen in the context of the strategy presented in the White Paper entitled ‘A European Transport Policy for 2010 : time to decide’ , which states the desire to redistribute the tax burden between ‘users ’ and ‘taxpayers ’ and to pass on to ‘users ’ the ‘real ’ costs of transport .
We must look more closely at the idea of establishing two categories of tax on petrol and at the guarantee that the tax applicable to private vehicles – fuel for non-commercial purposes – will also be rapidly applied to the tax on unleaded petrol in order to take account of the repercussions that these measures will have for the industrial sectors in question .
These are issues that go far beyond science and technology policy .
Today , this percentage stands at only 1.9 % , which falls considerably short of the percentages seen in
