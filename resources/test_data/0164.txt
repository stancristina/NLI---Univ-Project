The proposal means that the ecopoint system can continue throughout 2004 , with the option of extending it both in 2005 and 2006 .
Before we reach that point , however , there are still a number of problems of which both opponents and supporters of the compromise are required to take account with regard to Austria .
If we are finally to get to grips with the problem of pollution , we have to think along different , and new , lines .
We must move transported goods off the roads and onto the railways .
This means that the Austrians are obliged to concentrate upon railway capacity through Austria .
I should also like to say to the fellow MEP of mine who put on a demonstration in this House that I think it splendid that he has already begun his election campaign , but he would do better to conduct his demonstration at home in Austria instead of here in Parliament , in which case he and his vacuous demonstration would not , of course , be photographed , however .     Mr President , we have , then , finally obtained a compromise proposal concerning compensation for air passengers , and we in the European Parliament , in particular , should be pleased about this proposal .
We are therefore only too well aware of overbooked , delayed flights and poor service , as well as the resultant frustration .
It would also hopefully lead to more sensible departure times and clear compensation for passengers whenever they do not leave on time .
There is , however , a problem I fear may arise .
That is something I can , of course , only welcome since it places European consumers in a better position .
The problem is just that it can often be difficult to discover the correct price of an airline ticket that is part of a package trip .
I am certain , however , that this is something that can easily be solved in practice , as and when the problem arises .
These would entail the Member States being instructed ( paragraph 7 a [new] ) or recommended ( paragraph 7 b [new] ) to introduce a levy on GMO seed and GMO feed .
The revenue would also compensate for damage caused by GMO pollution which occurs despite correct practice on the part of GMO farmers .
It must , however , be possible for a Member State to be exempted if a decision to that effect is taken at a public national parliamentary sitting in the Member State concerned and is presented by the Head of Government to an EU Council meeting .
This decision emphasises the crucial need for a UN moratorium on the death penalty , which would make it much more difficult to give in to pressure to begin carrying out executions again .
The Philippines are of course only one of many places in the world in which there is a danger of being sentenced to death for non-violent offences .
Innocent people too are at risk .
In 2003 , nine people were pardoned in the United States because they were innocent .
We have to accept that a country ’s penal system reflects traditions and special historical circumstances , but the death penalty involves denying a person his or her dignity .
It is not only a question of the sea being polluted , causing damage to fisheries .
Equipment for easily removing waste oil must be set up in our ports .
The Commission now proposes that penalties for illegal discharges now be transferred to EU law .
Illegal discharges into Danish waters must be penalised under Danish law .
The Commission proposes that an EU coastguard be set up to track down the lawbreakers .
We therefore need neither EU law nor an EU coastguard with their attendant bureaucracy .
We should , however , like to see the EU take the initiative in setting up an international environmental court under the auspices of the UN.
At the same time , the Commission suggests promoting the reflagging of ships by bringing passenger vessels under existing easy-going rules and by limiting what is termed the quarantine period .
The ship owners would also evade the VAT and tax rules that fund the welfare state .
Finally , the proposal that ships ’ flags should have the EU symbol with the twelve gold stars against a blue background in the top corners of their national flags is ridiculous .
Once again .     Mr President , I also want to thank the Commissioner for the brilliant work she has done on this matter .
The first concerns waste .
You take a bus , travel five kilometres into the mountain , and you can see what they are doing .
The method appears to be clearly delineated .
It is well accepted , and the sites designated for possible final storage are well accepted in the municipalities , where more than 70 % of citizens have agreed to have them .
I consider the problem of waste to have been solved in technical terms .
We are all entitled to our opinions .
In Denmark , we have 230 kilos from our experimental reactor and elsewhere which , under the current rules , we apparently have to store ourselves at an additional cost of approximately , or more than , EUR 100 million .
We are therefore pleased about being able to export waste to countries that will accept it , that fulfil the EU’s safety requirements and in which we are certain that inspection and such like guarantees that the waste is being constantly monitored .     Mr President , first of all , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his considerable efforts , even though he and I are definitely not in agreement .
It has been a refreshing political discussion , reflecting the political differences
