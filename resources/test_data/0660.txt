Fifty-seven of these were adopted through a joint decision-making process .
Now it is Mr Blair’s own foreign minister , Margaret Beckett , who is trying to block progress at the last minute .
The majority of EU laws will , however , continue to be adopted by officials in 300 secret Council working parties after having been prepared in 3 000 other secret working parties under the auspices of the Commission .
The real progress made at the Summit is in terms of its support for the Commission ’s proposal that , in future , all proposals should be dealt with in proximity to the people , that is to say in the national parliaments .
It is a constructive proposal , and the initiative now lies with the national parliaments .
I hope that they are ready to seize the opportunity .     Mr President , I have an appeal to make to the EU Heads of State or Government when they meet in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday .
When reforms are debated in the Member States , not a single word is said about the EU.
In , for example , Germany , France and my own country , Denmark , we are currently debating what economic reforms are needed to secure welfare in the future .
Why , then , this deafening silence ?
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have constantly worked to bring about openness in the Council of Ministers .
It is simply not good enough .
I would therefore call on all the Heads of State or Government to open up the meetings of the Council of Ministers so that everyone can see how they proceed , can hopefully see that there is nothing to hide and can see whether ministers have actually been present .
We should thus also avoid holding 25 different press conferences in which everyone is a hero .
I am also looking forward to the Presidency giving a favourable reception to President Borrell’s call for action to bring about a one-seat EU.     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is with great satisfaction that I note that the motion for a resolution recognises that growth and sustainable development are not opposites but , on the contrary , preconditions of each other .
The fact that the motion for a resolution extends sustainability to include areas in addition to the environment also constitutes great progress .
In that connection I should like to emphasise that sustainable development also involves equality between the sexes .
Any strategy on sustainable development must take account of this inequality and of the fact that social problems affect men and women in different ways .
The report represents work of a very high quality , as is always the case when Mr Bösch is involved .
The EU has an image problem when it comes to how it administers taxpayers ' money .
The first of these is the simple fact that fraud involving EU funds does take place .
The other is that there is not enough transparency .
Clearly , this sets a number of challenges for the institutions – the European Parliament , OLAF and the other EU institutions .
Secondly , the situation calls for greater transparency .
I believe that , unfortunately , this article was truly symptomatic of the view that the European people have of Europe .
We all want transparency , but we do nothing about it .
Fortunately , the Commission is currently in the process of taking an initiative whereby it is to be obligatory to publish the names of those receiving agricultural subsidies .
We would like the same principle also to apply to Structural Fund resources .
More also needs to be done , however , in relation to monitoring .
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament acknowledge that the integrated financial control system works well , but we do believe , at the same time , that it is a problem that the system has still not been fully implemented , more than seven years after the date by which it was supposed to have been implemented .
The same applies to resources from the Structural Funds , where there is likewise a lack of satisfactory monitoring .
For example , are we to have a Constitutional Treaty ?
Yet the truth is that these questions are incredibly important in terms of achieving legitimacy in the eyes of the people of Europe .
Total harmonisation should much more often become minimum harmonisation , so that countries are encouraged to go further in the fight for security , health and the environment .
Last year , out of a total of 3 124 laws , the EU adopted 57 laws in this way .
The general principle will continue to be that the EU adopts its laws in 300 secret Council working parties , assisted by 3 000 other secret working parties under the auspices of the Commission .
Seize the opportunity – allow COSAC to deal with the annual programme until October .
That was the praise ; now for the criticism .
In my opinion , Chancellor Schüssel should be ashamed of calling for the ratification of a Constitution that has been rejected by the people of the Netherlands and of France .
Why is Finland now to ratify a text that only 22 % of Finns support , while 48 % are against it ?
Choose yourselves some new populations instead ; or start afresh with a convention directly elected to draw up new texts that can then be put to referendums in every country on the same day .
That way , there are no longer closed meetings , like in North Korea , Cuba and COREPER .     Mr President , the EU has problems with its image .
