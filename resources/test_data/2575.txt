The Union could try to influence the situation by means of various arrangements for co-operation in the areas of foreign and security policy , development co-operation , economic co-operation and migration policy .
A report by a top-level working party in the Council , which discussed this issue in full , will be distributed , with its various annexes according to country , to Parliament in the next few days .
We have to remove the technical , administrative and legislative barriers that hamper co-operation among the authorities .
Europol is an important tool in this sort of co-operation .
At Tampere Europol ' s field of operation should first be expanded to cover crime relating to money laundering .
Secondly , the European Council could charge the Council with embarking on the drafting of legislation that would oblige Member States to respond to requests from Europol for investigation and assistance .
These must be equally balanced .
I know that it would take any amount of hard work , but I shall list those matters that are of most importance .
In fighting crime , we must strive for its prevention .
In this way , we safeguard our future .
We must pay special attention to the status of the victims of crime and those suspected or accused of crime .
At Tampere , we should be able to reach a decision on the drafting of a programme of co-operation at Union level to help the victims of crime .
I hope that you will not think I am taking up too much time on these issues ; I admit I am a former Minister for Justice , although here and now I appear in my capacity as Foreign Minister .
However , it is at least as important to consider how we may improve the situation with respect to human rights in the European Union .
There are more and more marriages between people of different countries and , similarly , people work and study abroad , buy and sell goods and services abroad , and invest or borrow money in countries other than their own .
This has become a part of normal everyday life .
We know that the barriers are in certain respects very much due to the differences that exist in national legal systems .
The creation of a European judicial area will be , however , one of the most important challenges for the Union in the next few years .
Firstly , people must , without undue difficulty , be able to discover what factors mainly affect their legal status .
Procedures must not be too slow , complicated or expensive .
People should be able to take full advantage of existing information technology .
I think Member States should adopt a constructive stance in recognising decisions and judgements made by the authorities in other Member States .
This would save people from unnecessary bureaucracy and excessive costs , and would show that we have confidence in the legal systems of others .
Neither should we fear the harmonisation of civil and criminal law , or at least investigating the possibility of it .
Then , dare I say it , we could also investigate in what areas of the law of property , contract law and even family law we could make progress in .
This would increase legal security .
There are obviously enormous cultural differences within the area , but nothing should prevent us from exploring possibilities for making people ' s everyday existence easier .
On the contrary , as I said , a legal system is part of a culture ; it reflects each country ' s own particular culture .
At Tampere , we shall also decide upon the implementation of the decisions taken on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
That Article obliges the Community to commence action to counter discrimination .
I shall expect initiatives from the Commission regarding the implementation of this aim , which should be achieved as quickly as possible .
The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Home Affairs whom you have heard speak here , begin their talks on the same subject tomorrow in Turku .
We are also working in co-operation with the UN.
The European Parliament has now had a significant impact on the outcome of the Tampere agenda .
I can assure you now that our discussions today will play an important part too .
I shall convey your views to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Home Affairs who can then take account of them in their own talks .
The meeting will start with a speech by the President of the European Parliament .
We are taking decisions that will directly impact on the lives of our citizens .
I promise to listen closely to you and reply to your questions to the best of my ability .
Madam President , my thanks go to the Minister for her most comprehensive presentation .
The Social Democrats here in Parliament are very keen to participate already at this stage in the debate on these important issues .
With the single market we wish to improve Europe ' s capacity for responding to global competition and thereby create conditions to improve the welfare of our citizens .
In this connection , we must emphasise the importance of non-discrimination and the realisation of the rights of minorities .
One of the main issues of the meeting is that of fundamental rights as recognised under the Treaty of Amsterdam , including the right of citizens to security .
Safeguarding the free movement of our citizens and the flexible creation of legislation on the subject will require the adoption of the practice of majority ruling in Union legislation .
In reality , it is a question of the implementation , among other things , of the Schengen Convention .
Our job will be to show that this is an integral part of European co-operation and , in this way , we
