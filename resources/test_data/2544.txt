We have now committed ourselves to tabling before long a proposal for revision of the existing proposal and for new targets .
We must therefore adopt several different approaches to this work .
It is important that we continue to work with an Integrated Product Policy .
Are we to continue to do this , and how are we to look at this issue in broad outline ?
It is perfectly correct to point out that we need to review the whole of this issue in order to obtain a policy which will last for many years into the future and which will mean that we do not need to go chasing frantically after problems .
I personally believe that we shall be adopting too many amendments .
That is something which I think invites reflection .
In other contexts , it is usual to applaud Finnish innovation policy .
Social research does not belong in that context .
I personally view the committee ' s proposal as being well balanced .
We must adhere to the old principles and proceed further within the various frameworks .
I hope that these comments are not too alarming , but that they lead to reflection on the part of all who are interested in our researchers ' really being able to carry out good research .
In its proposal in connection with the Sixth Framework Programme , the Commission has identified several important problems and research areas which Europe needs to concentrate on .
Major resources are being invested in a small number of selected areas .
From the point of view of efficiency , independent research has shown itself to be far superior to politically directed research .
We believe that the Sixth Framework Programme would give rise to undue centralisation of independent research .
As a Christian Democrat , I believe that we need ethical frameworks in society .
Research using embryo stem cells is ethically very controversial and , moreover , prohibited in four of the Member States .
Funds from the framework programme are , despite everything , limited .
We are forced to prioritise .
What is depressing is that fellow MEPs now want to make a bad proposal still worse .
We built the largest oil tanker in history .
If we in the EU now want to show real solidarity with the shipyard workers and their families , the Commission ' s and the committees ' proposals must naturally be rejected .
This was for two reasons : State aid had not proved to have had any major effect on the industry ' s ability to survive , and there was a conviction on grounds of principle that State aid should be reduced as much as possible and preferably cease .
According to the committee ' s proposal , this is to continue right up until the end of 2003 , at the same time as dispute settlement proceedings have been instituted before the WTO against South Korea as a result of the latter ' s having violated current trade agreements .
The Taliban regime is fleeing .
Have they been taken to Kandahar ?
It is my wish that you in the Belgian Presidency should do everything you can .
Mr President , you did not give the Belgian Presidency the opportunity to reply to my follow-up question subsequent to my Question No 12 .
Normally a follow-up question is answered , and a follow-up question to Question No 14 has just now been answered .
In my question on a point of order , what specifically I pointed out was that , in my follow-up question , I had indicated that a whole new situation had arisen in Afghanistan and Kabul now that the Taliban regime had fled the capital .
Is it a compromise along those lines that is being considered ?
Given the risk that chemicals present to people ' s health and to the environment , we Swedish Christian Democrats believe it to be obvious that , in accordance with the principle of 'no data , no marketing ' , chemicals which have not undergone certain tests should not be allowed to be marketed , either .
In that way , we shall in quite a few respects be departing from the position adopted by the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats .
The work on these areas cannot be regarded as being complete if one half of humanity is ignored .
This right , and this rejection of the treaty by the Irish people , should be respected at the Laeken Summit and a statement made to the effect that the Treaty should be rewritten .
Mr President , you said that openness , efficiency and bringing the EU closer to the people were to be important issues at Laeken .
A clear constitution is needed , explaining how the EU is governed and who does what .
It is completely unacceptable for it to legislate behind the closed doors of the Council of Ministers .
If it is to be possible to simultaneously enlarge and deepen the EU , we must involve people and win back their trust .
Because there is no balance of power in the legal area , the terrorist legislation , which is entirely necessary , is in danger of undermining democracy in the long term .
On 11 September , the EU' s structure in terms of pillars ceased to be at all effective .
These rights must become unconditional at EU level .
Anyone who wants to develop the EU and make it better and larger should support the thinking that is being done in terms of devising a constitution which is characterised by an effective division of power and which , it is to be hoped , will develop out of today ' s excellent reports .
Above all , I want to emphasise the importance of bringing this proposal forward from 2011 to
