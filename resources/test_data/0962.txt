Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on her work , which addresses the fundamental concerns of consumers ' associations , which must be accepted as equal partners in a constructive dialogue .
The reliability of product safety and after-sale care represent added value for a "made in Europe " label at a particularly difficult and crucial time .

With regard to the overriding issue of the Community ' s contribution to the fund , I also wish to point out that the proposals in the Garot report are an improvement as compared with the Commission ' s position , but we still disagree with the idea of linking this contribution to the principle of CAP cofinancing which was , in fact , rejected in Agenda 2000 .
Whilst there are considerable differences between the various Member States , the most serious situation is definitely that of Portugal , with around 24 % of the population living below the poverty line due primarily to low salaries , insecure and badly paid jobs and pensions and benefits so low that they do not enable workers and their families or the elderly to live with a minimum of dignity .

The beneficiaries of this programme should be the victims of poverty and social exclusion , and we must prevent this from becoming in practice merely a means of financing bodies which investigate the problems of poverty and social exclusion .
I support the need to gain more knowledge about the causes of poverty and I also support preventative action against exclusion resulting from mergers , industrial change , relocations , rural desertification , and urban ghettoisation , with innovative and tangible responses involving both sides of industry , local and national government and concerted action by the public .
Portugal , which only opened up its diplomatic service to women following the " Revolution of April 1974 " , has recently demonstrated with the case of East Timor and our ambassador to Indonesia , Ana Gomes , how the role of a woman and her sensitivity to the problems and sufferings of a people that fought unaided for its freedom for 25 years can be recognised by the whole world and especially here in the European Parliament .
