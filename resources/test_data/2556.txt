Indeed , next year , our efforts will focus on enlargement , growth and internal and external security .
The Financial Perspective must not only be in line with the constitutional Treaty that will emerge from the Convention and the subsequent intergovernmental conference but also lay the necessary foundations for an enlarged Union that strives to achieve three major political objectives : peace , freedom and solidarity .
The current crisis must serve as an incentive for us to speed up the reform process which is underway .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank the rapporteurs .
Secondly , I believe we need to increase the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises and their ability to form partnerships with the small and medium-sized enterprises of the candidate countries .
We are not in a position to decide , and so we have kept our options open .
For instance , he pointed out possible shortcomings in the chapter on external relations , particularly as regards the transatlantic partnership .
In any case , however , we must realise that , should a disciplinary procedure be necessary , all the rights of those involved in the procedure must be respected .
In any case - I would stress - the letter must be made public without delay .
I would like to take this opportunity to call for a last spurt so that an agreement can be achieved during the interinstitutional summit on 19 March .
They will be Members of the Union , but they will be subject to the same strict conditions which have applied to the countries of this first phase of enlargement .
We are in an extremely difficult situation in which everything is falling apart .
It has taken four years to bring the hundreds of committees into line with the new system and to prepare for the vote which we are about to take .
It is my genuine hope that the reports we are voting on today will soon be forgotten or superseded too , and that the mysteries of the comitology system will be confined to the history books .
With regard to accession , considering everything that has happened in recent weeks between the President of a Member State and the candidate countries and considering the recent statements of the Chairman of the Convention regarding the danger that the Convention might not conclude its work within the timeframes laid down , our optimism is clouded by a misgiving which we hope is unfounded .
Indeed , his proposals are based on the highest Community tradition in social matters and employment policy and , in terms of proactive measures , incorporate a broad range of innovative points and fields such as the knowledge-based society and its strategic implications .
Called upon to implement forms of local partnership and contractual flexibility within a coherent framework of principles , the social partners are now , despite the European social dialogue , in a position where they do not , in practice , have the bodies or policies to lay down minimum social standards for enterprises , particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , notwithstanding , inter alia , the fact that a great many of these enterprises originate from current Member States .
Each year , the European Parliament has consistently succeeded in its resolutions in finding the right balance between flexibility and security and putting economic policy , employment policy and social policy on an equal footing .
Mr President , Commissioner , before us is a compromise which has achieved only one clear objective , that of unanimous consensus in the Governing Council , which is not exactly what the European Central Bank needs to prepare for enlargement .
The ECB will be consulted , but it cannot be allowed to be the promoter of this decision which concerns it so closely .
In short , our aim is to develop a policy for these countries which are calling for a special relationship with the Union but for which the Union cannot foresee an enlargement strategy , at least in the short term .
Thus , we want to develop with each individual country , on the basis of experience and our current contractual obligations , an agreed action plan which sets out the path we intend to pursue together .
We find it hard , however , to imagine enlarging Europe even further without launching a debate which is now urgent : ultimately , how wide can Europe 's borders stretch ?
I want it to be clear that this objective of building a ring of friends does not imply any commitment or any exclusion as regards enlargement : none of these countries has the right to membership and none of them is excluded .
However , clearly , this does not resolve the issue raised in the last question .
There are Member countries , but countries which have a relationship of increasing active cooperation with the countries around them , with the ring of friends .
Membership of the Union means sharing specific political objectives too , sharing roots and identities , sharing much more than just democratic sentiments .
There are different ethical considerations where immigration is concerned : cooperation with these countries would make it possible to deal with the issue of immigration more compassionately , more thoroughly , less traumatically and with greater involvement of the countries concerned .
Do the Lisbon objectives also concern the EMU States and to what extent , and , if they do , how can we make them as binding as the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact ?
I hope that similar considerations and opportunities will all be taken into account together at the forthcoming Spring Council , and I would quietly point out , by way of conclusion , that there has to
