Mr President , Ladies and gentlemen , today the Commission adopted a Communication that is important for the future of research in Europe .
These new methods of intervention are the result of new methods of management .
You are well aware of the need to centre the actions of the Joint Research Centre on areas in which it can fulfil this role of European added value , by virtue of the fact that it does not depend on the private sector and is independent of the Member States .
Concerning the question about the European Union and its disinterested approach to basic research , I do not feel that this is the case .
In any case , these were the conclusions that the Ministers for Research and Science reached on this subject at Capri last weekend .
There is Mr Gerold ' s report , certain elements of which I am still waiting to receive , but I can tell you now that , as it says in the policy paper , there is a need to increase the size of projects .
Much targeted research has a highly prominent commercial aspect , but there are also more basic forms of research which serve general European Union policies and , at times , also have beneficial spin-offs for commercial interests .
It is my responsibility to manage as rigorously and as actively as possible the European Union ' s second largest budget , that for Regional Policy and the Cohesion Fund .
Could you give us the figures for Spain and Greece ?
Given that armaments are the flagship product of international trade and a huge source of profit for a number of large industrial groups which like to think they are respectable , the only role left to the European Parliament is that of attaching the fig leaf of hypocrisy to the traffic in arms and the loathsome state of affairs which enables it to thrive .
At the very most , the talk is of tentative convergence .
I defend it , because it is essential .
Although I do not think it is feasible to adopt uniform criteria , I think it is our responsibility to arrive at some classification of the contents of television programmes , while leaving parents the option of deciding whether the programmes may or may not be watched by minors .
There are plans for the Commission to prepare a report for Parliament and the Council on the measures taken by the Member States to apply this recommendation .
What is more , most of the problems of which we are aware do not stem from the Commission but from the Member States and even the regions .
You are doing so today and will do so tomorrow .
These concern researchers .
This open method of cooperation is based upon the assumption that European guidelines will be established , the implementation of which it will be possible to adapt in relation to regional and national diversity .
Things are moving slowly , and that is frustrating because the objective can be seen there before us .
It is a fine objective , and we should like matters to move more quickly .
At Leipzig on 6 July , you issued a call for a vision for the future of Europe , based on a draft constitution .
We were particularly conscious of this , Mr President , last September , when we welcomed the Speaker of the Knesset and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council , who came here together , to this very rostrum , to deliver a message brimming with peace and hope .
Thirdly and finally , I think the proposal to make implementation of the principle of equal treatment a selection criterion for any Community aid or funding is essential to promoting equality .
This law will be applied to all elections , including local elections from 2001 .
Because we know that as long as women have to carry the burden of a double working day alone they will continue to face a dilemma between their private and family lives and between their working lives and their lives as citizens .
This review will not only bring the law into line with the many rulings from the Court of Justice , but will also incorporate other very important points into Community legislation .
I am frequently asked about this .
I found them both enormously interesting .
Is access to part-time work a social right ?
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , all of us here agree that equal opportunities for men and women must be pursued in all our policies .
As the debates and regulations go by , a compartmentalised vision of our society appears .
The Polish delegation to the New York conference already had occasion to appreciate the arrogance of a part of the European delegation incapable of accepting other positions more measured than its own .
That will not be enough .
This is currently being debated in Parliament , and I have introduced a provision , which obviously does not suit everyone in my country , but which is compulsory and will compel each company or profession to negotiate on equality in the workplace every three years , covering salaries , conditions of work , career prospects , and access to lifelong training .
Excluding gender equality from the acquis communautaire is unimaginable , and of course we shall be just as vigilant on that issue as on the others .
That is what the Commission proposal deplores and the Evans report confirms .
It is very difficult for French Baccalaureat candidates to meet a deadline of 15 July when they only receive their results in mid-July , and must then obtain recognition of their qualification - recognition which , in my opinion , costs far too much - not to mention the young people who
