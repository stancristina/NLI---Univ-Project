the Commission to give very serious consideration to Parliament ' s suggestions and to take the Imbeni report carefully into account when carrying out the restructuring which is to take place to make ECHO ' s actions increasingly useful and effective in assisting the areas and peoples in the greatest need .
We can draw encouragement from all this and from the continuing work of the Clinton government on this initiative .
Now the taboo has been broken .
And I , together with the thousand Italians , saw these settlements expanding all over the place .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the Speaker of the Knesset - whose acquaintance I made during a visit to Israel a very short while ago - and the representatives of the Palestinian Legislative Council .
I would also like to touch on a personal , political consideration .
Together with the United States , the European Union now has the difficult and vital task of preventing either party from reverting to its past position and of assessing the possibility of finding a solution to the problems of the Palestinians and the Israelis .
While I was there , a Tunisian pensioner came up to me - goodness knows how he had found out that I represent the Italian pensioners in the European Parliament - and he said to me : " I know that there is an aid programme for Tunisia as there is for all the Mediterranean countries , but what good has it done me , a pensioner in Tunisia ?
Sadly , this did not happen , but I hope that it will come about with the next Commission communication .
We therefore now need to discuss the different issues .
Working towards constitutionalisation of the European Union , one benefit of which would be institutional citizenship in international bodies , the creation of a European diplomacy as per the Galeote report , the cultural concern which we must take on board in order to avoid fresh incidents of colonialism , the support and valuing of democratic processes which have also been established in certain countries such as Iran , and the regulation of relations with NGOs , which could become the operational arm of the European Union - these options could all contribute to an effective political initiative for developing countries , an initiative which would assert the supremacy of European civilisation in terms of a quest for solidarity to improve quality of life and bear witness to respect for human dignity , celebrating it in every corner of the world .
They are requesting people not to use condoms in the name of life , but that is to condemn the children to certain death .
I therefore feel that there is a need for the Commission and the Member States of the Union to make an ad hoc intervention , in consideration of the European Union 's major responsibility precisely towards developing countries .
Indeed , I would argue that we should relate the cancellation of the external debt of the poor countries to the fight against the Aids epidemic , and it is precisely with a view to this that we support the request of the specific programme Debt for Aids contained in the resolution .
I feel that the creation of a monitoring centre - a centre coordinating all the information useful for predicting restructuring and conversion processes - could be a valuable service for the Community institutions and facilitate social dialogue at European level .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the document on the Community 's audiovisual policy in the digital age , presented by the Commission , is important because this technological innovation has , to a certain extent , a direct bearing on our cultural future and therefore on sensitive issues such as pluralism and the quality of democracy in our continent .
However , the debate generated in Parliament , which has looked at different points of view and has pulled out all the stops , as did the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , in order to find a common point of agreement with the result that the report was adopted unanimously , proposes a limited number of nevertheless important supplements .
This is therefore the spirit of the report and its attempt to operate within the bounds proposed by the Commission 's report .
The citizens ' confidence in the audiovisual service must be won through compliance with the principles of the protection of human dignity and of minors .
Lastly , we must guarantee multiplicity and pluralism of bids and provide all operators with the possibility of playing an innovative and leading role , thus liberalising access to public financing .
Therefore , our objective is to achieve an interactive audiovisual policy where there is more participation in order to give expression to the countless individual characteristics and differences in which our great European identity is rich .
The regulation refers to the separation of infrastructures and content , serving up for content the old regulations once again .
This was the right way for things to happen and it is right that they should remain that way .
Lastly , on the subject of the privatisation of television , we call for a revision of the Amsterdam protocol which is referred to here as if it is set in stone .
Digitalisation will enable citizens to access a substantial quantity of new , innovative content and this is why I can only fully support Mr Veltroni 's consideration that all this has implications for democracy , the organisation of Europe and the States and the quality of the communications that we provide for our citizens .
Mr President , we very frequently complain about the Council 's attitude towards Parliament .
