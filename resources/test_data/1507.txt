We believe that it should have been incorporated in a special Chapter of the Treaty devoted to Equal Opportunity between women and men .
This would have been a logical consequence of the new central role given to equality between women and men in the Treaty .
Some issues were more sensitive than others : partnerships , for example , on which we need to reach a compromise in order to assert and support the Commission proposal .
This is in line with ongoing discrimination , which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies .
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance , and that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up .
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation , the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions , particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe .
Madam President , I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday .
To respect my speaking time , I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme : a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century , when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective , a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation .
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down .
Some of you may find it lacks detail , but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes .
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient , to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved , starting with the important issue of the involvement of women .
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are , what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities , thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries , regions and local communities .
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner ' s efforts , of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication , but I also think of new events , such as Croatia , where the situation has changed in a few weeks : the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia ' s problems , but more particularly Serbia ' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia .
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union ; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation ; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic , pluralist society in these countries with institutions , public structures , police forces and a structured civil society , but , above all , we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region , as regards both politics and the economy .
There will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process .
We therefore have another duty at international level , which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade : the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries , not just in terms of writing off debts , but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world , with a great deal of willingness on our part , which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice .
We need to provide alternative answers , otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe ' s positive roles in history .
Reread the letter : The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty , I repeat , Article 6 of the Treaty .
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen .
This , ladies and gentlemen , could be the decade of Europe .
In this House , in the past , large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission , under its power of initiative , launched , not as experiments , but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress , but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union .
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu , but with more unsatisfactory implications , restricting the Commission , so you say , to the task of drawing up a few White Papers , as you proposed .
We approve of your position on this : you did well not to isolate that country any further .
Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong , but also listening to their explanations .
Europe , which is so democratic , so progressive , does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board , while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases .
Madam President , as a Padanian taxpayer , I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy , Mr Prodi , since
