Despite some progress in the treatment of women in paid employment and in implementing equal treatment boundaries throughout Europe , sexual inequality persists .
Secondly , it is hypocritical of the European Union to preach liberalisation of the markets as a universal panacea while bemoaning the fact that the 48 poorest countries have been allowed to export all their products to the Union duty free since the year 2000 .
That way , the present proposals could be implemented immediately and I would gladly promise to submit a new proposal to implement the most recent measures decided in the international tuna fishing organisations by 1 October 2001 , i .e . by 1 October this year .
However , negotiations on a new protocol initially broke down , which is why we agreed with Equatorial Guinea that the old protocol should be extended by a year .
But I see no reason why I should comment on this principle of the Group of the Greens in my reply .
I believe that it is imperative to make a distinction in this regard .
Therefore we support the Commission in its negotiations and also regret of course that the European Parliament is not yet formally involved in the definition of negotiating mandates .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on these interesting and important reports and to pledge our support , particularly as regards the demand that the European Parliament become more directly involved in the negotiations .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
The Members of this House trust that your answers will clarify the matter .

Let me make it quite clear , the most dangerous aspect of the transport of radioactive material today are the demonstrators on the periphery who cut the railway lines in half , dig out railway embankments , and do other similar things .
Many people in Germany , in particular , are worried at present ; they are upset about what lies ahead .

We farmers need a policy on which we can rely .
In addition , it is intended to reduce the overall quota by 115 000 tonnes , which is 50 % of the structural surplus under the WTO 's export restrictions .
