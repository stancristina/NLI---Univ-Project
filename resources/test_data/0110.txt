Two of them have also taken a violent form : Northern Ireland and the Basque Country .
The European Audiovisual Observatory , as has been said , was set up in 1992 , under the initial auspices of the Audiovisual Eureka programme .
For this reason , I believe it to be appropriate , on the one hand , that the Observatory makes a greater effort to attract the interest of professionals , substantially reducing their increasing dependency on the request for their services on the part of the Commission .
And the question is very simple : those who are against this point being included in the resolution may ask for a separate vote .
And I would also like , Madam President , to tell you that the motion for a resolution will be debated this afternoon and I understand that , in accordance with Rule 37( 3 ) , the vote should take place following the debate , that is , this afternoon and not tomorrow , as you have said .
My question , Madam President , has to do with the procedure .
Anything else is pure confusion and we do not understand it and , anyway , we do not understand why something as normal as a minority group of MEPs supporting the majority groups , should be presented in such a problematic light .
And Parliament was in agreement .
Here there is a political will to create a conflict with the Council and not to respect our word .
This is a matter which must remain outside the regulations and therefore the logical and reasonable thing - and rules , when the law is the law and not just formal texts , must be reasonable - should be that this be supported by an absolute majority in this Parliament .
Mr President , firstly , on behalf of Commissioner Reding , I would like to congratulate Mrs Gr√∂ner and all the Members of the Committee who have worked so significantly on the whole of this document .
Secondly , because I cannot see anywhere , and nor did we see it at the time nor since , these supposed legal irregularities which would give rise to the rejection of the text .
To this end , I would like to express my agreement with Mr Hatzidakis and with certain other speakers and to express my regret that the European Committee for Standardisation has still not reached an agreement which would allow Member States to legislate in accordance with what will be the final regulation , and not to find themselves in a position , if today and in the weeks to come we are not capable of amending the current directive , where they have to legislate to amend the legislation once again within a short space of time , with all the problems which that would entail .
In this case , the instrument necessary to amend a directive is another directive .
The forecast regarding the increase in the transport of goods in the coming years - which is good or bad depending on your point of view - is very significant .
Mr President , I wish to repeat my thanks and say that I hope that we will soon conclude the handling of this directive , which will allow the Committee for Standardisation to carry out its work correctly .
We must also congratulate ourselves on the fact that the Council has approved , despite the storm clouds which had gathered , this proposed mandate .
The proposed resolutions presented speak for themselves and I need no more evidence .
When ?
What kind of agreement , Commissioner ?
Effective measures concerning the monitoring and control of the issues agreed , equally applicable to both parties , will be necessary .
You will be aware , Mr Fischler , that the current agreement will expire on 30 November and that the following day the activities of the Community fleet which is fishing in the waters covered by this agreement will come to a halt .
They are hard-working sea-faring people , who just want to work in the job that they know and for which they take such risks .
I believe it would be useful if you were to establish a line of defence for European fishing .
There are already joint Euro-Moroccan enterprises and these will continue to exist , but this cannot be an exclusive model .
Natural discretion and reserve is one thing but secretiveness towards those who have everything to lose is another thing altogether .
I hope that Morocco will fulfil its international obligations , as indicated in the talks held last week in Brussels by the Moroccan authorities .
I wish to express our support for the signing of the agreement for two fundamental reasons .
I said that this particularly affects the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese States : the Canary Islands , Andalusia and Galicia , in Spain .
On the other hand , joint enterprises would mean fewer Community crews and the demand by Morocco for more landings in Moroccan ports .
Frequently , these concessions are granted as a contribution to the development of non-EU countries .
This attitude cannot be permitted from a supposed partner .
We should not use this debate to look after our own national political interests .
Parliament , this very morning , fulfilled its obligation to include in the 2000 budget an item of EUR 125 million , which had not been envisaged in the Financial Perspective negotiated in Berlin , in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement between the Council and Parliament , but which is fundamental to the starting of the negotiations .
At the moment , we are dealing with the future of the neighbouring countries of Central and Eastern Europe by means of incorporating them into the European Union , but we also have to concern ourselves with the future of the
