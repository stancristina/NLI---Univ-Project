Without the adoption of certain amendments , including those relating to the framework directive , it is these principles themselves that are likely to fall by the wayside ; there is a risk of the drift toward ultraliberalism caused by sectoral directives becoming the norm .
To quote only one point from ten or twenty articles which are along the same lines , we read that Parliament ‘welcomes the liberalisation in the fields of telecommunications , postal services , transport and energy , which has led to modernisation , interconnection and integration of the sectors , has led to price reductions through increased competition , and has led to the creation of nearly one million jobs across the European Union’ .
The real problem here concerns the sharing of competences between the EU and the Member States .
It is estimated that 64 billion dollars are required per year to achieve the goals set by NEPAD.
Fund providers must face up to their responsibilities .
During this term , it has expressed several concerns that it hopes will be reflected at the session , and I would just like to mention five of them .
As in 2003 , it would like an delegation to be able to attend the next session in Geneva .     Mr President , here at the beginning of 2004 the climate of obsession with security has become more pronounced .
I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate and by the forthcoming visit by Kofi Annan to Brussels to receive the Sakharov Prize to reiterate demands that have already been stated here but which are still relevant .
We must remedy this lack of consideration for a question that nonetheless affects peoples on five continents .
I would therefore like to ask you , Commissioner , how a communication or document of this kind comes to be written in the Commission .
That is why I shall be voting for Amendment No 4 , which notes that third country nationals have the right to vote in local elections in some countries but does not oblige the other Member States to do the same .     Mr President , I would like to say to Mr Pirker that this is a good report , even if , personally , I would have liked to go further .
I also welcome the European Commission ’s efforts to develop genuine European policies on immigration and asylum .
We must not , however , bury our heads in the sand : illegal immigration is also a necessity for our economy .
It is even more necessary for us to say what the real needs for services are .
At the beginning of 1998 , LTCM had USD 4.8 billion of its own funds to meet liabilities worth USD 120 billion , in other words , a leverage of 25 .
Whilst being against taxation , we do not want to prevent the extension of reduced rates of VAT for some sectors even though the choice of sectors benefiting from this measure is arbitrary and restrictive .
In this report there are some good proposals for resolving the crucial problems of the Member States and of the third-country nationals who want to live and work in Europe .
This would include a set of rights and responsibilities , such as equality of social , economic and political treatment , in areas such as working conditions and voting rights in local and European elections .     . – The Pirker Report considers the Commission communication on illegal immigration , which rightly seeks to combine various documents on a number of different issues , such as , among others , the fight against illegal immigration , the smuggling and trafficking of human beings , control of external borders , and policy on return of illegal residents .
In truth , the entire text is utterly insignificant , since , let us not forget , the tone on illegal immigration was set at the June 2002 summit in Seville .
While remaining resolute , we must encourage dialogue with civil society , and request a UN mediator to reach a long-term political agreement , in order to help the Haitian people back onto the road to democracy and sustainable development .     – Mr President , the appalling situation in Haiti is partly attributable to the violence perpetrated by armed gangs on which the regime relies , but mainly to the abject poverty suffered by the majority of the population .
In its Judgment of 10 April 2003 , the Court states that the verification powers possessed by Parliament when it has to ‘take note’ apply ‘upstream of the disqualification’ , and therefore of the vacancy of the seat .
This is the only thing that should be taken as established because at best , we do not think that anything better or greater can ever be done than this collective , democratic effort , which took eighteen months .
In reality , the European institutions , the Commission and Parliament combined , are clinging to this supposed constitution as if it is their last hope , while their policies , particularly this year , have clearly failed , and while public opinion is generally disenchanted , if we believe the latest Euro-barometer , which I think is enlightening on this subject .
We will fight any attempt to violate the law .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like to ask you , and the Commission , one small thing .
The Commission welcomes the agreement that was achieved on defence at the Intergovernmental Conference , including the content of the protocol that was discussed following the conclave in Naples .
It is only after the rule has been made that you should ensure compatibility with competition .
There have been many speeches about services of
