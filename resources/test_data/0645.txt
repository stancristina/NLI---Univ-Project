Education is the best weapon in the fight against poverty .
We must not neglect these people .
Now we need to elaborate upon these in our working plan .
Can it also be used for this ?
This eLearning programme offers new opportunities in this area .
I have regarded my report as a kind of annual report on the functioning of the European Parliament in 2001 .
Three of the Directors-General recently recruited are men , and , in 2001 , only 14.3 % of women were promoted in category A as compared with 30.8 % of men .
In the previous discharge report , the Bureau and the Secretary-General were asked to publish a study on this .
I know that this is still a significant problem , as a proposal of this kind still has to go to the Intergovernmental Conference , and indeed a number of Member States still have a veto .
I think , however and I say this in my report that a number of things have gone wrong , not on Parliament 's side , but on the Belgian side .
Let us set an example , let our Parliament take this step , too , and ensure a real climate policy plan for the European Parliament .
Nor could we do that .
The most striking feature of current agricultural policy is that it is no longer based on price support , but rather on income support - the integrated administration and control system .
Officials who gain knowledge of these shortcomings and wish to contribute to a quick solution are not rewarded , but instead punished .
Today , however , four years on , a positive Statement of Assurance from the European Court of Auditors is nowhere to be seen .
We are convinced it is not .
The alarmist and often factually incorrect reporting by some newspapers does not do justice to the efforts being undertaken to put things right .
Second , that the CoR failed to properly apply the rules on the reimbursement of travel expenses and other financial rules .
In view of the seriousness of these allegations , which I consider to be reliable , I have decided to refer this case to the Anti-fraud Agency OLAF in the hope and the expectation that OLAF will launch an immediate inquiry to get to the bottom of all this .
We would urge , therefore , that careful attention be paid to the valuable comments made by both the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Direct budgetary support already amounts to EUR 2 604 million , although we know that it involves great risks , which the rapporteur has explained very well .
In short , Commissioner , I should like to urge that the European Development Fund and the money that the Commission administers for development and cooperation be examined not only on the basis of legality , but also of the results achieved in connection with the priority we all set ourselves , namely the eradication of poverty .
We propose a split vote into two parts , and we recommend rejecting the first part of Paragraph 66 and accepting the second part , which begins with 'also regrets that after the assurances etc . '
We wish to distance ourselves from this irresponsibly lax position .
Even the rapporteur 's criticism of the constant necessity of dealing with land speculators when extending buildings in Brussels is spot on .
The zero tolerance approach that emerges from the three relevant UN conventions is not undisputed , after all .
Ecstasy users are a different group entirely .
I have opted , as a rapporteur , to put down on paper a recommendation that will help that political debate , in particular , on its way .
I do not , however , accept that label with regard to this report ; as the essence of this report is a rational recommendation , an evaluation .
He said that Mrs Buitenweg 's report takes a pragmatic approach , and I fully share this view .
I cannot do that .
I do not understand , then , why so many amendments aiming to prevent the evaluation have been tabled .
It is actually quite clever how they manage to turn up in all the places that matter .
The Member States refused to make a declaration pushing , among other things , for an amendment of the UN conventions .
It implies accepting drug addiction as a social phenomenon and looking on while fellow human beings are destroyed .
Their aim is to do away with the present UN Conventions and legalise drugs .
As a true politician , she also wants to give some guidance .
We should be extremely careful that it is really done properly , therefore , and so we should heed Mr Blokland 's warning about the staff working on it .
I do not think much of that .
We have to realise that those ecstasy tablets are responsible for a great deal of senseless nightlife violence .
On the subject of an open coordination method , I , too , along with a great many others , also wish to be taken seriously .
What happens if a Member State does not appeal to it and is not itself able to act ?
Are you aware of that difference of opinion ?
It is clear to us all that the present situation is unacceptable , as Europol is under neither democratic nor legal control .
If I succeed in this , I think that it is abundantly clear that this debate is radically different from this afternoon 's , because this afternoon everyone was , first and foremost , absolutely convinced of being in the right .
I want it to be clear from the Europol database where the
