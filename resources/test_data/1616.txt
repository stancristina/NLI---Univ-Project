were judged , and this judgement accords Greece the position which it deserves , the position which it could have taken up back then , when it could have become a member of EMU along with everyone else , but which it failed to take up because of the weakness of its government .
The euro restored politics to Europe and it is incumbent upon us to pave the way so that politics in Europe can be institutionalised and globalisation , which is progressing blindly , without any historical or political plan , can be politicised at a later date , through a unified Europe , For Greece and the other members of EMU, the problem of sustainability is crucial .
A large part of the economy pays no taxes and the basic taxes which exist in other Member States do not exist in Greece .
These are the areas which need to be strengthened immediately if sustainability is to have a future .
The truth is that Greece now meets the convergence criteria , with the exception of the public debt criterion .
Policies in Greece need to focus today on further structural changes , while maintaining an anti-inflationary line , with the aim of achieving a real social market economy in conditions of healthy competition , so that Greece can keep comfortably to the Dublin Stability and Development Pact .
The world has many examples of where such a slippery slope can lead ; however , there are relatively few examples of a country which has found the strength not only to stop but to reverse the decline and manage to satisfy the extremely stringent stability criteria of today ' s world .
For a nation to build monetary stability on such a basis requires greater effort and sacrifice than in a richer economy .
We are here not because we wanted to conceal our weaknesses , but because we wanted to fight and we fought and we won .
That is the meaning of Greece ' s accession , that is the meaning of its acceptance .
As far as EMU in general is concerned , we are in favour of real economic and monetary union .
This is the opinion expressed by the Nobel prize-winning economists Friedman , Tobin and Modigliani .
The Goebbels report tells us that Parliament ' s reply cannot but be a political one and assures us that Greece ' s accession to the euro zone does not involve any political risk .
However , the report adds that there are economic risks and that they are greater in the case of Greece than in the case of other countries belonging to the euro zone .
Of course , I have trouble understanding how anyone can distinguish so easily between political and economic risks , but we shall let that pass .
The competitiveness of the economy has not improved and unemployment continues to rise .
It is therefore the Greek government ' s choice of means which we object to .
However , 7 million workers in the EU , in transport and fisheries and doctors in training are exempted from Directive 104/93/Ã…C on the organisation of working time .
We must also bear in mind that the original directive did not stipulate the length of a working day ( it stipulated a working week of 48 hours - an implied violation of the measure ) .
I should like to use the opportunity which I have to ask a second supplementary question and the occasion of the presence here of the husband and son of Leila Zana , who was awarded the European Parliament ' s Sakharov prize , to ask the minister the following question : does he not think that before assuming the Portuguese Presidency , he should have raised the matter of the release of a lady member of parliament honoured by our very own House with the Sakharov prize for her fight for human rights now that Turkey wishes to draw closer to , and integrate into , the European Union ?
First he assures us that no part of the CAP budget will be used for Kosovo or for exercising the European Union ' s foreign policy and then he says that , in any case , the Commission has said - and rightly so - that any sums not taken up will be shared out .
Our farmers are already being squeezed dry , their needs are tremendous , as we see on a daily basis , and it would be unacceptable to take money away from their already reduced budget .
You say that the situation is unclear and that there is a political and military vacuum .
What I am hearing is quite absurd .
I think that this situation is scandalous in every sense of the word from an international and political point of view and I wonder how you tolerate it .
One of these groups is the disabled .
Member States choose amongst these actions according to their particular situations and subsequently report on their implementation .
Also , does the Council intend to work with candidate countries on the recognition of the rights of minority groups , given that we know they are not properly respected in many of these countries ?
Thus , we have progressed from the simple wireless telegraph to the digital transmission of sound and image , satellite navigation and the third generation of mobile telephones .
The constant increase in the demand for radio frequencies for new applications is such that we need to review the principles on which they are distributed and the policy which the European Union needs to apply in this sector .
Starting from the premise that the spectrum is a valuable but scarce natural resource and that the demand for it is rising constantly , it stresses that it must be used efficiently in order to best serve the public interest and help develop new high-quality services .
