courageous .
That is the first point I wanted to make .
Success is our goal , but there are no guarantees .
We are afraid , and that is also reflected in the resolution , that these issues could lead to hitches in the negotiation process , or even to its suspension .
Let there be no doubt about this .
That also means , though , that the EU must deliver on its promise to bring the northern part of Cyprus out of its isolation , and that also means , while we are on the subject of Cyprus – and this I say for the benefit of the Socialist Members of this House – that things must be done in their proper order : we first need to ask Kofi Annan to examine whether a solution is possible , and then follow it up with recognition , because the other way round will not work .
Meanwhile , the prospect of negotiations with Turkey particularly saddens me on account of the position of the Christian church in that country , which is – and I emphasise this – without rights , and I am not even mentioning the serious cases of physical abuse of Turkish Protestants last month .
In the end , the conference took place at the Bilgi University where I was , as it happens , giving a speech on women’s rights at the same time .
I wish Turkey and the EU much wisdom and patience on that day and in the days to come .     Mr President , I have a simple amendment to replace the words 'as soon as possible ' , in paragraph 6 , with the words 'at an early stage in the negotiating process ' .     .
I think that the Turkey issue is becoming the most striking and most politically frightening illustration of the way in which the European Union is suspending the normal democratic decision-making processes and is ramming decisions down the public’s throat , if need be with all the dirty tricks of the trade , and , in the case of Turkey , with lies and deceit .
As expressed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution , Turkey must , of course , embark on full implementation of the customs union without delay , thereby , among other things , opening up its ports to Cypriot ships .
This does not augur well for other areas of discussion .
The EU must support the reformers , demand the correct implementation of the customs union and insist on the penal code being honed down further .
The Savary report is desperately needed to drive back the technical problems involving cross-border trains , such problems having occurred since electrification .
There is also the issue of whether Europe can indeed add value to the way in which Member States can , in future , make their national railways more efficient , more customer-friendly and more environmentally-friendly .
I fear that the Commission , with its consistent , yet somewhat harsh stance , has too little consideration for this .
They are vital and , as you know better than I do , much of the price goes on VAT and excise to boost the national coffers .
Neither did it reach consensus about the principles of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and , last but not least , the so desperately needed reform of the Security Council is being postponed once again .
Brussels would do well to take a leaf out of their book .
I look forward to an answer .
When war is over it is unacceptable that one or two ethnic groups are welcomed as citizens and codecision makers , whereas the others find themselves changed into disadvantaged groups , minorities and IDPs .
I have a few very concrete questions , Commissioner .
Mr President , it was almost unanimously , let us say with one abstention , that this House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs , on 13 July , adopted its opinion on the report by Mrs Lucas , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , about the prospects for trade relations between the EU and China .
In the unlikely event of the Council deciding in favour of lifting it , then this would certainly not prompt the Chinese authorities into taking respect for human rights seriously at long last .
I would like to make it clear once again that whilst this is not an argument against the free market , or indeed , against free competition , Europe has the duty to protect its companies and to guarantee fair competition , and this has , unfortunately , recently fallen by the wayside .
Rather than putting protectionist measures in place to protect these jobs , the EU must promote the interests of its companies by reminding China of its WTO commitments .
That is clearly the case with regard to respect for intellectual property .
They have , in the past , taken up a disproportionate share of the European budget without ever having been profitable , or showing any signs of becoming so .
Another problem in the trade relations with China is the large-scale violation of intellectual property .
China acts too much in the tradition of Confucius , the Chinese philosopher , according to whom the imitation of a master is commendable .
The only imperfection in this positive development at the time was the glorification of Habib Bourgiba , the man who considered himself to be the Father of the Nation .
Ready for school , 13-year old Klementina Sötét opened the front door on that Wednesday morning , 15 September 2004 , only to find what she thought was blood on the door .
The European Parliament is just as much in favour of a positive interpretation of the rights of national minorities
