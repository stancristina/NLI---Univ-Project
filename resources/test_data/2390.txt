High Representative who acts as Vice-President of the Commission , to come from our party .
This is an issue which needs to be resolved in Copenhagen in just the same way as the global health policy , the question of whether Europe should show solidarity with a dying continent like Africa , combating aids and opening up resources for the future .
We will have the opportunity to get to know them even better in the hearings .
Why do we have so many social and labour market problems in the European Union ?
We know that estimates of this kind are often lower than the real figures .
Mr President , I have taken the message on board and I will pass it on to the Commission President and the other commissioners .
I cannot justify to my voters using their money in this way .
I also support the European Union 's efforts to start the process of modernising the economies of these countries and , therefore , to help the population .
From now on , the country of origin must be specified on certain products imported into the EU from third countries .
It abuses valid concern for health protection in an attempt to transfer invalid authority in the field of health policy and of work and social issues to a European level .
They do not ratify them and they do not implement them .
The people who are suffering from hunger today and tomorrow are not interested in the climate in one hundred years .
There are some areas which are in a better position according to the classification of the Court of Auditors , for example external aid .
Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , you will all be familiar with Google , the internet search engine .
What are the opposing interests in this case and how can we find a suitable balance between them ?
I would like to consider one last important point and that is once again the subject of collecting societies .
Related to this is the highly critical question of so-called orphan works , whose authors cannot be located .
In addition , the unresolved conflicts on Turkey 's borders will become EU problems if Turkey were to join .
It must be made clear that the EU has no authority in this area .
It is outrageous that the numerous calls from the European Union and other parts of the world for improvements in the human rights situation have simply been ignored .
However , sadly , China is the world leader in executions .
They say that they want to work their land and feed and care for their animals rather than spend the whole day keeping books and records about what they are doing .
That indicates that our agricultural policy only really serves the interests of the large concerns .
The European Union has gone a long way to accommodate its partners , in particular those in the developing countries .
At the beginning , it was the US and Europe who wanted to force the consent of the developing countries by the use of the concept of 'development ' . In the meantime , however , the negotiations have failed twice .
Looking at the agricultural sector over the last twenty years , what has this permanent liberalisation actually brought ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are , in fact , once again debating a proposal for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
For example , it has pointed out that , in the Swedish case , of the 4 687 redundancies mentioned , only 1 500 are targeted to receive the assistance .
However , they do not use it for micro-credits .
In this form , we will reject this programme .
This must actually be achieved by the limit values set , as otherwise such a directive is worthless .
The study shows that this is technically possible .
However , I must reiterate that you cannot expect me , and likewise I cannot expect you , to make a decision in respect of the disagreements among scientists regarding methods .
I hope that makes it clear .
The relevant instructions have been sent to the European standardisation organisations .
This is where we are now .
First of all , I would like to thank both rapporteurs very warmly for their dedication and I would also like to say at this point that everything that Mrs Haug has just said about the 2009 budget is absolutely right .
The resolution to be submitted on Thursday states clearly that we are calling on the new Commission to publish a report on the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement as soon as possible , as provided for in the agreements .
However , while the conference in Copenhagen is still underway , I would like to add the following point .
The 2010 budget represents a step in the right direction , but it is by no means enough .
To spell it out , we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective .
In difficult economic times , measures are , of course , needed to stimulate the economy , but it is doubtful whether instruments such as the European Economic Recovery Programme can achieve this .
It is mainly young people , who were already at serious risk of unemployment , who have been particularly hard hit by the changing situation .
We should work together to set new priorities with respect to our economic and socio-political objectives and to avoid recreating the situation that we currently find ourselves in .
How can the climate commissioner be a powerful force and how can she assert herself , if this , on the basis of the second option , is not reflected in the structures ?
