have established rules , and know where we want to go ; progress , obviously , is slow because this entails transfers of power and transfers of competence which are always difficult to carry out .
Why ?
Therefore firstly , I cannot fail to vote for this report , in the hope , secondly , that I too will manage to commercially exploit the explanations of vote over these five years at the European Parliament .
Therefore , in the meantime , I voted for this report too .
What about pensioners ?
We must be more mindful of the environment , food security and animal rights , for these are issues related to quality of life .
Yet , here , there have been no political proposals , apart from a few banalities , and , whether this self-important House likes it or not , the only political proposal currently on the table is for a free , democratic Iraq governed by a transition government under the auspices of the United Nations , which would mastermind the democratic transition for Iraq and the Iraqi people .
I believe it can enable us to regain some of our lost dignity .
Iraq has , in practice , failed to comply .
Thirdly , to make every endeavour to preserve the credibility of the multilateral organisations , NATO and the UN.
Firstly , Nato has not banned depleted uranium weapons , and the fact that it has not banned them leads us to fear , to believe that they have been used , that they might even have been used more than once .
Indeed , we were aware of the importance of not leaving a gap between the adoption of a new regulation and the expiry of the previous one .
( IT ) We feel Mrs Sandbaek , Mrs Martens and Mrs Ferrer 's work is satisfactory , considering the different starting points .
The Third Millennium is characterised by the culture of information and knowledge and , therefore , must provide the conditions for free exchange between minds .
Women must be able to dialogue with men without being affected by any form of sexism .
In addition to medical and pharmaceutical care , we need to provide drug addicts with psychological help too .
Amendment No 62 recommends great caution in providing access to needles , condoms and syringes .
For 40 years , silicone breast implants have been used throughout the world for both aesthetic reasons , as in the case of serious psychological problems , and for reconstruction , as in the case of mastectomies carried out to remove breast cancer where there are no age restrictions .
It is compulsory for the patient to sign a form after receiving all the necessary information , before any treatment is applied , including implants .
Most of all , we condemn the Council of the European Union 's complicity with the instigators of the coup at the time .
We too have a responsibility to further this process and to ensure that the complexity of the situation in Latin America , not least , does not become such as to constantly jeopardise the autonomy of its people .
We welcome the increasing attempts at dialogue which are taking shape and we are also convinced that the international role , the positive role being played by the Group of Friends and the Organisation of American States , is certainly a positive innovation in Latin America , where mediation in internal affairs is by no means the norm .
This was to be a programme to prepare for the Year of Sport and it has been abolished .
The European citizens must be the ones to decide whether cinema or other audiovisual products are better in Europe , whether they want those produced in Europe or those produced elsewhere , not to mention the fact that the large-scale distribution of music and films over the Internet is in danger of raising a question which is already longstanding , the question of protection of alleged cultural diversity in the field of audiovisual services .
The same must apply to self-handling .
The debate on the state of the Union is an established item on our agenda .
Meanwhile , negotiations are going ahead with Bulgaria and Romania so that they can join shortly afterwards and , with the necessary adjustments , joint work is continuing with Turkey .
The very positive outcome of the referendum in Malta is an auspicious sign and an incentive to even greater efforts .
Important though it is , the accession of the new Member countries is only one stage in the process , and it must not obscure the fact that there is still much to do .
It is time we had an in-depth , honest , completely transparent debate on the type of Europe we want to build together .
These differences are important because they mark the line between war and peace , but they do not affect the ultimate objective of our policies or the solidity of our alliance or cast doubt on the whole web of transatlantic relations , our shared history and the extent of our bonds .
Indeed , we Europeans not only have a political obligation to reach a common position : after Maastricht , we are obliged by the Treaties to show loyalty and mutual solidarity .
What kind of Europe do we want ?
On the question of war and peace - and we have had a spectacular and unprecedented demonstration of the public 's views in the streets and squares of our cities - the shared views of the public know no barriers in Europe .
As they stand , the institutions and procedures , conceived and designed for a community of six largely homogenous States , no longer meet the requirements of a larger , more diverse Union .
