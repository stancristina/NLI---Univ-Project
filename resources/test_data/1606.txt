The disappointment has been especially great inasmuch as it showed that the international community’s faith in a situation where there would be permanent improvement in East Timor was well before its time .
The joint proposal by six political groups for a motion for a resolution on East Timor has the backing of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and deserves wide support from the European Parliament as a whole .     Mr President , Chancellor , Commissioner , the most significant issue during the Austrian Presidency was the agreement on new economic guidelines for the period 2007–2013 .
Also evident in Barroso’s speeches on the EU Constitution is a lack of credibility .
It would have been democratic if the EU Constitution had been pronounced dead .
The opposite of democracy with the agreement of a state is dictatorship by a majority .
The EU’s political elite and eurocracy are bad losers .
You are trying to resurrect a dead constitution ; you are asking the Member States to ratify something which will never come into force .
As a positive aspect of the summit , we note the new transparency of the Councils and comitology .
Under the leadership of Austria , the Services Directive has provided a solution based largely on the results of voting in Parliament .
The European Union should move forward in matters of the single market and the economy , if Europe as an economic area wants to succeed in global competition and provide its citizens with jobs .
Increased transparency is a good thing , but the decision that has now been made is just a small step and a beginning , but by no means enough , and not yet an end product .
The first is that I think the Austrian Presidency was a very successful one .
You all know that it is not the presidency that makes the agenda , it is the agenda that makes the presidency .
Neither one of us made it to the World Cup ; perhaps we can try sending out a joint team the next time around , because we seem to work quite well together .
We will get a proposal during the German and Portuguese presidencies , and we might even do a little bit of renegotiation during the Slovenian and the French presidencies .
But , may I make just one careful proposal – and I am doing so under the close observation of my group chairman and of Mr Daul .
If some people want to change the name of the constitution and we finish those negotiations in 2008 during the French Presidency , why do we not call it the Treaty of Strasbourg ?
Think about it !
Let us start working and looking at the bigger picture .
Mr President , after the Chancellor’s comprehensive summing-up of the debate , let me just say a few words about enlargement after the European Council .
The Commission welcomes the conclusions on enlargement of the European Council , skilfully presided by the Austrian Presidency .
This new consensus should , above all , enhance our enlightened self-interest to extend the zone of peace , democracy and prosperity in Europe , while , at the same time , ensuring our capacity to function effectively and gradually absorb new members .
Secondly , I am satisfied that the European Council did not change the criteria of accession that were agreed in Copenhagen in 1993 .
Bulgaria and Romania , Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans .
It is a very important dimension and objective for this House and for the Commission .
As we know , the European Council will hold a debate in December 2006 , and the Commission was invited to report on all the relevant aspects of enlargement pertaining to the Union’s absorption capacity .
The Commission will duly and gladly present a strategy document on enlargement , including absorption capacity , as part of our enlargement package in October/November 2006 .
It is time to create a new consensus on EU enlargement policy , based on the consolidation of our commitments , rigorous application of conditionality and better communication with our citizens .
It is also up to the Commission to make judgements on whether the Euronext-Frankfurt Börse merger is better than the transatlantic one .
I think if the market forces decide that we will have a transatlantic stock exchange , that will be a huge opportunity for regulatory convergence .
It is not about extra-territorial Sarbanes Oxley rules coming to Europe ; the point is also that we can put forward our strategic models , our very good technological platforms and put them to very effective use in the US.
We have been trying to get our trading screens to US stock markets and vice versa , but this has not happened .
Emissions from air traffic are growing faster than any other source of carbon dioxide emissions , and the other emissions and impact of aviation more than double its effect on global warming .
This cannot be allowed to continue .
Every aspect of air travel , however , is subsidised , including fuel , which is not subject to taxation .
On the other hand , rail traffic is taxed in a number of ways , and it is also affected by the trade in carbon dioxide emissions .
The next global climate agreement should cover air traffic , but there are good reasons now for extending emissions trading to all flights arriving in and departing from the European Union , preferably based on a separate emissions trading system , to make the incentive for reducing emissions effective .
We can compensate for the emissions from our own air travel voluntarily .
I call on all my fellow Members to do likewise – we can afford to .     Mr President
