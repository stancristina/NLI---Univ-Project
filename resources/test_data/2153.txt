President-in-Office , your speech clearly showed Italy 's decision to give great weight to the Union 's actions abroad .
The concerns that have surrounded it , however , are not all due to prejudice .
This proposal can only make headway if it adopts a truly European perspective , if it is firmly anchored in the Community method and is financially viable .
After the difficult Iraqi crisis , it is therefore even more urgent to define a sound common foreign and security policy , backed by overthrowing the right of veto .
We need to be bolder , however , if we do not want our compromises to slip away , especially as regards control of the economy , foreign policy and the necessary new defence policy , so as to minimise the risk of paralysis due to the need for unanimity .
Europe is , of course , an important episode ; it is a challenge that has quite rightly been called historic .
Someone spoke of a Keynesian policy ; I beg to differ : large-scale infrastructure is not a Keynesian policy ; it may instead be a threat to the environment through deregulation , and it also runs the risk of not being completed because of the difficulties in financing it .
That , at least , would be a good sign of civilisation .
Parliament does not have the right to initiate legislation - the only case in the world , I believe .
Or rather , we in Italy know only too well , unfortunately , given what he has done up to now .
An immense weight hangs over him and his actions because of the ongoing conflict between his own personal interests and those of the people of Italy and Europe as a whole .
Let this be quite clear : for this reason we shall act decisively out of a pure sense of national responsibility and a staunch European spirit .
The other difficult test lying ahead of you is the solution to the Middle East problem , bearing in mind that the roadmap requires a highly impartial attitude , and therefore European intervention must not be directed to just one side .
In this context , I think the Italian Presidency should remind the European Union of a number of specific responsibilities , which are : to strengthen economic and social cohesion ; to reduce the disparity in the development levels of many regions , which is still present in our Union and will be even more accentuated with enlargement ; and to implement ideas of geographical solidarity , and in this respect we are thinking of the remoter regions .
This is based especially on three principles : that without resources the cohesion policy will be difficult to implement ; that the sectoral policies that the Union is developing - just think of the effects of the reform of the agricultural policy - should contribute to a great ideal of European cohesion ; and that the new idea of European cohesion should also include the flexibility criterion .
I also hope there will be some thought about the fact that human values , which are clearly expressed in the clauses of the Constitution and are there to protect the European citizenry , have Christian roots .
Mr President-in-Office , you spoke of a great Europe and , indeed , with the arrival of the new countries , we are experiencing a moment of Europe 's reconciliation with its own history and its own civilisation .
It is also necessary to bring the subject of a sustainable pensions system to European Union level .
The approach of negotiation announced by Mr Berlusconi is the approach of wisdom and true hard work , the approach that Europe needs in everyone 's interests .
We are certain they will not disappoint us but will , instead , prove worthy of Italy 's history and the creation of the Community .
The draft Constitution it has adopted will certainly be referred , under the Treaty , for final decisions by the Heads of State and Government , but it would be foolish to call into question the most significant innovations in it after sixteen months of hard work put in by the representatives from the governments , the national parliaments and the European Parliament .
A last thought concerns world poverty .
This sector is in a happy situation , with the arrival of the Van Miert proposal , which has finally given us a new programme of new projects that are equal to the challenges facing us as a continent ; your government 's proposal of an ingenious way to finance these projects ; and the Commission 's proposal to increase European funding to 20 % .
Paradoxically , I believe all of this is a good sign , Mr Berlusconi : remember that malice of this kind was loudly voiced in 2001 and only contributed to your resounding victory in those elections .
Competitiveness , social cohesion , solidarity across generations , the valuing of human resources , solidarity towards the countries in the many southern parts of the world are not just many objectives within our reach , but they are also the founding values of the best episodes in our peoples ' histories .
There is no doubt that you will carry them both through .
Indeed , this reference is not a contribution to the clerical concerns of certain social groups but the historical memory of the truest meaning behind our institutions .
I should like to tell him that I am still convinced that the great Europe of the future , if it genuinely wants to be a leader in world politics able to sit at a table on equal terms with the United States , will have to be a great Europe that can also include Ukraine , Belarus , Moldova , Israel , the Russian Federation and its military strength
