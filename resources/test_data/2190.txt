Why not have the same control for taxation ?
Offering employment is penalized , when it should be rewarded .
We have to start straightening out the wrinkles in the tax system .
The Council now accepts a system whereby all telecoms in every Member State pay VAT directly to the inland revenue office in their customer 's country .
This we all have a duty to put right .
Mr Goerens must be wholeheartedly congratulated on his splendid work .
The participation of women is key to the success of the development process .
And their involvement means , above everything else , education .
The connection between education for women and the birth rate is obvious .
Another vital point in the resolution , I think , is to stress the principles of partnership and involvement in development .
It is also right to demand greater democracy where appropriate and a respect for human rights , together with greater openness and efficiency in handling the economy , as conditions of aid .
To improve the effectiveness of Community aid a lot can certainly also be done by making the tasks of the different sectors more compatible with each other , given that they all have the same objective anyway .
National and EU initiatives must also be better coordinated .
Evalution is naturally the key tool in improved effectiveness .
Furthermore , it is necessary to exchange experiences more often , and perhaps this should be the concern of the central processing unit mentioned in the motion .
The report now being discussed concerns eleven countries with the lowest national product in the world , the indebted and poverty-stricken HIPC countries .
The poor developing countries are in a grave state .
They have to pay off their loans in the shape of cheap produce , apart from in cash .
The poor countries are in urgent need of help .
This impasse hampers even further the development of these countries .
The situation also jeopardizes the progress of democracy and peace .
Agriculture has to focus on exports and nonfoodstuffs while the nation suffers from undernourishment .
For this reason I strongly support the ideas contained in the Commission 's communication .
Mr President , I would like to mention that my name is not in the Minutes of the Strasbourg session on Friday , and I should like this to be corrected , as I added my name to the list and also took part in the voting that day , which can , of course , be checked .
I would like to ask how the Minutes are matched with the names on the list , who is responsible for this , and how we are going to make sure that all the names down on the list also get into the Minutes , which are distributed to the public and the press .
Why is this ?
Secondly , the East has already cancelled orders from certain European countries , including Finland , which might have some considerable effect on their economies .
Thirdly , prices on the stock exchange are jumping up and down , reflecting the general concern .
That is why I would like to ask whether , if the worst comes to the worst , the Commission intends to plan a course of increased latitude , economically speaking , towards these countries which might well be plunged into crisis .
One might be tempted to do the same as in the famous English film which we see in so many countries at New Year about the old lady 's birthday , same procedure as last year , but I am not going to do that .
That is just one example of the assessment and perhaps reassessment which is required .
Why this duplicated work , which is confusing for the Member States because the information is sometimes contradictory ?
From the report I shall point out three things : that the Commission is taking its task as the guardian of the Treaty seriously these days , that there is a tendency towards a more open and faster processing of complaints , but also that the number of complaints has fallen .
The Commission has shown this through its decision in August 1996 on the application of penalty payments , astreinte , when Member States have not complied with judgments , and the decision of February 1997 on how the penalty payments shall be calculated .
Parliament has asked for that , and that is good , but unfortunately we on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights do not think the criteria presented are sufficiently clear .
However , we do know that it would not do so if Parliament 's criteria were followed .
However , speed cannot be achieved unless the Member States are given stricter time limits for answering , both with regard to complaints to Parliament and petitions to us .
Thirdly , the number of complaints has fallen .
The Commission points to some circumstances in the report .
We can see a reduction in faith through the fact that 36 per cent of the permitted complaints to the Union 's Ombudsman concern how the Commission has handled these issues .
By making such explanations public it will be possible for everyone to see whether the Commission is making use of its right of inquiry in an impartial and nondiscriminatory way .
To create access to legislation on the Internet is an important way to disseminate knowledge of Community law and to create a citizens ' Europe .
It is equally important to finally progress from words to deeds in the work for improved legislation , in accordance with the declaration in Amsterdam .
The explosive development in telecommunications has been changing our world at a very fast pace .
The Commission has to stress its special
