This method of investigation , where conclusions are based on vague estimates and the policy is to ignore other research data , cannot have any real meaning .
Hopefully , we all appreciate the need for a closer study of the effects of these on users , and the possible need to take action when we have some real facts before us .
I do not intend to repeat the praise that has already been heaped on Mr Needle 's excellent report .
I would like to go a little further and make a few remarks on the fact that public health must be seen from a very broad perspective .
We have discovered from various sets of statistics that unemployment is one reason for deteriorating public health ; exclusion in particular , stemming from long-term unemployment , for example , is a clear risk to health .
Furthermore , consumer and environmental policies are extremely important , as is the fact that public health should play a clearer role in the enlargement strategy .
It aims at the heart of the matter , as Agenda 2000 negotiations have reached a critical stage .
The proposal is a radical one and would have enormous consequences for the EU budget , which would shrink by some EUR 18 billion , approximately the cost of eastward enlargement .
Thus the proposal would solve the financial problem threatening eastward enlargement .
At a rough estimate , Germany 's net contribution would be reduced by approximately EUR 1 300 million a year and that of the Netherlands by approximately EUR 450 million , while the contributions of Spain , Greece and France would increase by EUR 1 billion .
Would it not be fairer if all those benefiting also paid ?
Mrs Haug 's report is an important addition to the Agenda 2000 debate , and to the ongoing preparation process for the next phase of the programme .
The issue is the financing of EU enlargement .
We are now fighting over who is going to pay for it .
The total EU budget should not be increased by more than 1.27 % .
I do not think it is out of the question to increase the share that agriculture itself contributes .
Mr President , the Council has not answered my question at all .
The European Central Bank and the national central banks which report to it are part of the EU scheme .
The same rules for personnel apply to them as to any other EU institution .
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to answer my question .
I think it is important that the European Central Bank should operate transparently .
Instead , you said there is no conflict in a situation where a person of experience receives a salary from the European Central Bank and a pension from some former position .
Who will ?
It is important that different sectors within the Commission move in the same direction , to conserve energy and exploit renewables .
However , these areas lead the world in developing the kind of logistics know-how for gathering this material , and growth in the industry is forecast .
Secondly , I would like to stress , as others have , how important the issue of taxation on energy is .
There will be great scope for coordinated cooperation on the part of the ECB , the Commission and the various Councils , to try to ensure there is favourable development both for the EU as a whole and for the individual Member States .
It must be stressed that currency stability , whose importance the ECB strongly emphasises , cannot be the only objective of economic policy .
The ECB bases its policy predominantly on the regulation of the money supply .
It is not right either that the Commission should be forever stressing the importance of meeting overrated convergence criteria which do not take account of Keynesian views on economic and budgetary policy .
The importance of this is particularly obvious now , when the public deficit forecast for the three largest Euroland countries for the current year is at least 2 % , making flexibility and scope for recovery almost non-existent .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are here to discuss a Commission proposal to change the basic regulation governing the Community Customs Code .
The Commission 's aim has been to simplify and rationalise the customs regulation , which is certainly justified , as it contains a total of 253 articles and innumerable subparagraphs and repeals at least 28 legal instruments in use before the regulation came into force .
However the proposal still does not manage to any significant extent to fulfill the Commission 's objectives to clarify the rules , which is unfortunate .
The Customs Code has a significant impact on Community trade policy , especially agricultural policy , where traditional agricultural taxation has in fact become customs duty .
The Code is also a tool for compiling trade statistics , and it therefore affects statistics on foreign trade .
In my own country , as in many other Member States , it is important that the use of electronic customs declarations should be established once and for all , and accompanying documents should also not be submitted in paper form .
Using electronic media will speed up the work of the customs authorities and make it more effective .
On the other hand , it would appear that our adversaries , that is to say the criminals , are quite capable of keeping in contact .
I also did not agree with the Commission 's proposal in relation to Article 5 on direct and indirect representation to customs agents .
I would ask you to look especially closely at Amendment No 13 .
In it I propose that if a certificate issued by the
