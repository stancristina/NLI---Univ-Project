I am sorry if , at the beginning of this point , it is a point of order , I said that the Council was not there , because it was not represented at ministerial level .
It is already coming up to a year since it submitted a proposal to us to amend the 1976 Directive .
This special nature leads to a complementary relationship between men and women , rather than rivalry .
As mothers , we hold the future of humanity in our hands , and you are right , Mrs Hautala , when you stress that nothing must be allowed to prevent a woman from giving the gift of life .
Besides , there has been a lot of talk about the Treaty of Amsterdam , but one could also mention the Charter of Fundamental Rights , Article 23 of which stipulates equality between the sexes in all areas , which is a major advance on equality in professional and economic spheres alone .
For workers , of course , it is another matter , and I note that , quite rightly , Recital C in Mr Ribeiro e Castro ' s report says that 'a high level of mobility on the labour market is not an end in itself ' .
Communications must be strengthened , and addressed as a matter of priority to professional organisations , training centres and universities .
Mr President , I can also ask my group not to vote to put this amendment in the ...
In particular , the following are worthy of note : Declaration 23 on the future of the Union , and the launching of a wide-ranging and in-depth debate ; the revision of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union on the respecting of fundamental rights in the Member States ; the loosening up of procedures , making it possible to engage in enhanced cooperation ; the increasing of the powers of the President of the Commission and his appointment by a qualified majority of the Council which , together with the recent proposals by the French Prime Minister , Lionel Jospin , on the election of the latter , make it possible to reinforce considerably its legitimacy and therefore its authority .
For example , there is the introduction of integration as an objective for the Union and the Community ( Article 43 of the EU Treaty ) , the introduction of uniform regulations and conditions governing Members of the European Parliament ( Article 190(5 ) of the EC Treaty ) , the creation of regulations governing political parties at European level ( Article 191 of the EC Treaty ) , the appointing of the Commission by a qualified majority ( Article 214( 2 ) of the EC Treaty ) , the approval by a qualified majority of certain international agreements on common foreign and security policy ( Article 24 of the EU Treaty ) , the new measures taken , by majority vote , to introduce the euro ( Articles 111 and 123( 4 ) of the EC Treaty ) , the transfer to Community level of international trade negotiations on services and intellectual property ( Article 133 of the EC Treaty ) , the inclusion of the Community in responsibility for modernising social security ( Article 137 of the EC Treaty ) , or the creation , in vague terms , of a rapid-response military force ( Article 17 of the EU Treaty ) .
This would give a strong political signal to our fellow-citizens .
We did not vote against the Treaty of Nice because it did not go far enough , as the more rampant supporters of federalism believe .
This is why a democratic and public debate , a debate which is open to all our peoples , must precede this pre-constitutional stage , so as to remove any ambiguities about the kind of Europe that we want to build together .
Any new European plan will have to be accompanied by a radical transformation in the thinking behind the CAP.
It is important that the concept of sustainable development should be taken into account at all levels of decision making and in all sectors .
Then again , some amendments go against directives which have already been adopted by the European Parliament , or else they place too many restrictions around those that we shall be considering in the near future .
Such provisions are essential as they make it possible to reduce the severity of injuries in the case of an accident .
On this point , I should like to point out that , while I agree with the idea that one should not discriminate against fathers either , the members of my group were unable to vote in favour of this amendment because there will always be a difference between 'maternity ' and 'paternity ' .
Will they not prefer to take on men rather than women ?
There are six vital areas covered by this unprecedented reform proposal : the reaffirmation of the principles of budgetary law , the execution of the budget , markets and subsidies , accounting and the presentation of accounts , external measures of the European Union , and other major aspects such as the discharge procedure , the EAGGF Guarantee Section , the Structural Funds , research and development , OLAF and administrative appropriations .
The resolutions have succeeded in giving practical expression to our responsibilities and obligations in the face of the continuous deterioration of our planet , global warming , and the disappearance of biodiversity , and they serve as a reminder that only a completely new approach to policies can hope to reverse these trends .
Now , at Nice , you proclaimed a charter on our behalf , which gave rise to considerable discussions as to whether the expression
