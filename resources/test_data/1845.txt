that the EU also needs an Arctic policy .
The Commission has already responded to this challenge by proposing an updating of the list of projects for trans-European energy networks .
I hope that Parliament 's first reading can be completed according to schedule , at the November part-session .
Madam President , in my opinion this whole reopening of the debate on bioethics constitutes an abuse of the Rules of Procedure .
Madam President , in a word , I agree with Mr Cot .
I wish to say this on the record , and in public , because this is the same subject on which a vote was taken here in July on the report which bears my name .
The Committee on Legal Affairs devoted four meetings to the matter .
Contrary to parliamentary usage , you have re-tabled by means of an oral question a motion for a resolution which Parliament has already rejected .
It will vote against the resolution , which is being tabled jointly , because we cannot approve either of its content or of the procedure followed .
This being so , it must also be stressed that the research institutes which make statements on the subject should be genuinely independent .
It is enough that coordination should be carried out at EU level , since some cases clearly concern matters which go beyond national borders .
They are not likely to be very objective .
In our opinion such advertising should be permitted .
It ought to be possible for small producers - and big ones too , by all means - to state that their products do not contain a particular ingredient .
They began on 15 March 1995 , and the agreement was initialled in July the same year .
At that time the territory , which had belonged to Italy , was incorporated into Yugoslavia and its inhabitants were evacuated to Italy .
At the same time the newly independent Slovenia adopted legislation banning foreigners from owning property in its territory .
In itself the Europe Agreement means that Slovenia undertakes to bring its legislation on ownership of real estate and land into line with EU legislation and to eliminate all discrimination against nationals of EU Member States with regard to the movement of capital .
Numerous attempts by the Slovenian Government to secure adoption of the Council 's draft failed when the required majority failed to back it in Parliament .
In addition , citizens of the Union who have lived in Slovenia for at least three years will have the right to acquire property as soon as the agreement enters into force .
I am glad that it was resolved precisely during the Italian presidency .
The development which led to the democratization of the countries of Central Europe and the independence of the Baltic States was positive .
It affords genuine opportunities to build a common Europe .
The war in the former Yugoslavia is the most tragic instance of this .
Measured against many criteria , Slovenia 's economic and political development has been encouraging .
I hope that Parliament can now take a positive decision , to enable Slovenia to catch up with the other associated countries which have stolen a march on it in their relations with the European Union .
Accordingly , I should like to thank all the colleagues with whom I have enjoyed good working relations in the European Parliament and wish you all success in building a common , peaceful Europe .
Agricultural policy is no longer really enough to ensure the development of rural areas : a broad and manysided rural policy is needed .
We therefore have a particular need for a rural policy .
The problem is the lack of resources with which to carry it out .
Agriculture must be adapted to meet the needs of the markets , albeit taking care that old livelihoods are not destroyed before new ones get off the ground .
Both European Union and national support should be used to develop know-how , entrepreneurial activity and infrastructure .
The new subcontractors ' networks and quality chains will help to diversify rural employment and promote small enterprise .
Mr President , I should like to recall that AIDS is increasingly a women 's problem .
Women also pass the infection on to the next generation .
At the UN world conference on the status of women in Beijing it was stated clearly that it was essential to improve the status of women - that is , enhance it both economically and socially - in order to bring AIDS under control .
The common position of the Council now under consideration includes support for women among the measures to combat AIDS .
Now care must to taken to ensure that , in implementing this decision and selecting projects for support , enough stress is placed on measures to improve the status of women .
Mr President , Commissioner , the rapporteurs on the television directive deserve acknowledgement for their good work , although the long drawn-out procedural stages have annoyed many Members .
We disagree only about the means .
The competitiveness of the audiovisual sector and the development of new services must be strengthened .
The rapidly growing field of communications could create many new jobs .
European producers should be encouraged to produce quality programmes which interest viewers , so that television companies want to show them on their stations .
However , finding ways of protecting minors is a matter which should be left to national level .
For example , the retirement age for women has already been raised to 65 - i .e . the same as for men - in all the pension schemes in Finland .
In our view , the Council should allow Member States a transitional period to implement the Directive , so that women do not suffer unduly
