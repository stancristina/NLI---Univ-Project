would like to stress that this is as much a question of city and urban areas as of other areas .
In the large cities , one can see major local differences between poor immigrant districts and the districts of the rich and between the labour markets linked to these .
I have proposed local partnerships which are open to many different types of actor .
I have no objections to Amendment No 3 , but am happy to support it .
In my opinion , the major problem facing the future labour market is that we realise that within quite a short while , we will have a labour shortage across the European Union .
We are drawing up strategies centrally which must be implemented locally if we are to be able to match labour market policy with the requirements we see before us on the labour market .
We must achieve such a balance in the future .
We Swedish Social Democrats chose to vote in favour of the resolution in its entirety and in favour of Amendment No 12 .
Certain elements of Amendment No 12 , particularly item ( f ) , may contravene our freedom of association , as enshrined in our constitution .
At the same time , it is our duty as democrats to enter the debate with the racists .
Striking a balance between these freedoms and effective work against racism and xenophobia is , therefore , difficult .
With this in mind , it is with some hesitation that we support the proposal on banning the dissemination of printed material and the proposal which may in practice mean that membership of certain organisations and parties may be criminalised .
We Liberals would like to protest strongly against this trial on several grounds .
In addition , they have already been through a first trial , as several colleagues have already pointed out .
Is it not time , Commissioners , to take this article seriously and find the means to make it useable , allowing us , in certain cases , to bring countries contravening Article 2 to their senses or at least to implement sanctions against them ?
The fact that its top official Andrew Carpenter , who has been deeply involved in democracy and human rights in this European state , failed to received an extension to his visa in practice meant the closure of the office .
The Commission , represented here by Commissioner Diamantopoulou , must now seriously review the European Union 's strategy with regard to Belarus .
It is a neighbour of Latvia , Lithuania and Poland , of the enlarged EU.
These people must be given a European vision , must be given hope of a different future .
We must support democracy but without splitting the country .
People who follow a political line different to that of the government are subject to reprisals .
It is important that all democratic institutions are assisted in work to strengthen the independent press in Belarus .
Therefore , I welcome the fact that Parliament is once again training the spotlight on the situation in Belarus .
There is no justification for the committee 's taking the ban on processing animal protein in animal feed as a pretext for demanding EU subsidies for lupins - would you believe - and other protein-rich crops .
On the contrary .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , first of all , I wish to express my and my group 's sympathy for everyone hit by the disaster .
In Johannesburg , an attempt was made to find global solutions .
I believe that that is the case .
The next major project for the European Union should be to create a common environmental policy that is both tough and directly binding upon countries and individuals .
Mr President , thank you ladies and gentlemen and , especially , a big thank-you to the Danish Presidency .
We were subjected to strong pressure from the Member States and the Council and finally decided to agree to the flexibility instrument 's not being used .
It would be difficult in the long term to impose a lot of major new tasks upon the Commission without also providing the necessary resources in terms of staff and administrative resources .
Every year , the budget allocates major resources which are subsequently not used .
The finance ministers cannot just sit and applaud when they are given back money that has not been used .
We have a political responsibility actually to realise the ambitions and implement the programmes we have decided upon in the European Union .
I believe that we shall be conducting a debate along these lines in Parliament this year too .
We must also perhaps begin to discuss cutting back on our commitments .
Year after year , we have seen how the Council has acquired more ambitions .
This year , we are discussing Afghanistan , the Middle East and the police force for Bosnia .
There are already huge cut-backs in the budget in connection with Kosovo , humanitarian aid etc .
We have studied Structural Funds and a series of different political programmes .
Within the EU , we must sit down and go through our methods , documents and bureaucracy so that the process is made a little simpler for all those who need to use EU resources .
Ever since early last winter , when we began work on the 2003 budget , my objective , as rapporteur and as a person responsible for next year 's budgets for eight of the EU institutions , has at any rate been to find a solution in which the EU 's administrative budget is balanced and in which we do not have to ask for extra money by making use of what is known as the flexibility instrument .
