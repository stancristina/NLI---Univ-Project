I believe that this accords completely with positions consistently adopted by this House .
( NL ) Because labour is a significant cost factor in the production of goods and even more in the supply of services , one sees , time and time again , that employers try to reduce their obligations .
Foster report ( A5-0415/2001 )
Costs of insurance , security , advertising campaigns and fuel tax must be included in full in the ticket prices , so that flying loses its competitive advantage over the train .
.
This is also in line with the Council ' s current view .
Furthermore , it very much looks as if the Dutch government is able to remove more of our objections via the Council than we are via the European Parliament .
I fully support the measures against terrorism and in my view , it is possible and necessary for the EU Member States to work closely together in this field .
This also applies if oppositional non-terrorists are bullied or if people are imprisoned for actions which are not punishable in their own countries .
We are in favour of this , and we expect a decision by the Council before the end of this year .
They are in favour of the Council ' s approach with a positive list on the basis of the Europol mandate .
A criminal law system at EU level is , certainly at the moment , both undesirable and unrealistic .

FÃ¤rm report ( A5-0410/2001 )
I regret this as a friend and expert of the former federation of Yugoslavia , but I accept the reality which people have chosen at grassroots level .
This role of melting pot proved unsuccessful .
A great deal is discussed behind closed doors between the governments of the Member States that form part of it .
We cannot change this attitude by thinking up ever more bureaucratic procedures and rules .
It appears that human rights issues fade into the background if military or economic interests are at stake .
Neither have we made any agreements on genetic tests .
We have not reached agreement on whether , in European countries , something similar can be demanded when taking out insurance cover .
Since the negotiations are of such significance , we must really employ our full powers and reach a verdict .
As such , this is absolutely and fundamentally a different viewpoint from that adopted by Mr Berlusconi , and it should not be confused with his .
We often see this in the food industry too .
It is indeed true that we need transparency in order to restore consumer confidence .
These are worrying statistics , and we are not even talking about other food-related illnesses .
Madam President , given the tug-of-war about the location of the European Food Safety Authority , it appears to be a highly prestigious matter .
It is indeed unwise to enlarge this management board any further , because this could compromise its decisiveness .
This should not be sixteen , but twelve , for we need independence .
There is also a flip side , namely the lack of a civil society .
By process , I mean the procedure we followed to reach a package which is hopefully acceptable to Parliament .
A package entails the risk that if you tug at one string of the package , the whole thing may fall apart .
But first and foremost , I admire his enormous perseverance , particularly in the light of the fact that we have arrived at this result .
This also naturally leads on to the question : what will the consumer gain from this ?
Although you have not adopted Amendment No 36 , you have done so at a practical level , and I am extremely grateful to you for this .
And we can only achieve this in this way .
He refers to the United States of America in this respect .
This meeting can be considered a success for the world community , and certainly for the European Union .
This is the name , in fact , that has been given to all of the texts adopted .
It has managed to bring initially very diverse opinions closer together and has contributed greatly to the final text which was met by approval by all parties .
It appeared impossible to make a reference in the ministerial statement to the development of a permanent forum between the ILO and other international organisations , including the WTO .
You know the outcome , but let me assure you that it was nevertheless a difficult journey , and that for a long time it looked like the Commissioners would not succeed in reaching a sound agreement .
Therefore , our respective representatives read the texts at the same time as all the other delegations .
Several delegations from developing countries showed their appreciation and satisfaction with the working method used during their closing speeches .
This means that globalisation can also be at the service of people , and not the other way round .
This fresh step is certainly also of importance in the removal of inequalities between North and South .
Needless to say , the agreements involving the waiver for the Cotonou Agreement of the ACP and EU countries are of crucial importance , for this has helped us bring about an enormous breakthrough in our relations with the ACP countries , a breakthrough which we might not have had otherwise .

If the right people are now also deployed in the right places , and the Authority is accorded a location which will give it the opportunity of establishing external contacts easily , then I believe that all conditions are in place to turn this
