regime .
Madam President , as you know , and as we saw yesterday , there are groups in the Basque Country who support terrorism .
I believe that their presence is without doubt something which will allow us to believe that the Basque people can regain its capacity for dialogue and can return to peace .
The front line of democracy must be defended democratically .
We encourage the opposing parties to persist courageously with the negotiations , ignoring the most pessimistic , sometimes threatening , voices , which sometimes emerge from their respective countries .
We are approaching a deadline .
It is a cultural , historical and religious problem .
Indeed , they have even given ground in the supposedly neutral area of basic concepts .
( ES ) Mr President , perhaps you could give the Commissioner the opportunity to explain to the House what he intends to do with this Parliament initiative , bearing in mind the new code of conduct which governs relations between Parliament and the Commission .
You can understand that the difference is a very substantial one .
You must record the sense of what I said yesterday .
During the Balkan crisis the inadequacies of the European Union were made blatantly clear .
This dispute between the institutions must be resolved , and the European Parliament must not simply be serving at the table , but it also wishes to take its place in the kitchen .
In truth , through his actions and proposals , Mr Fischler , the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture , has made the anti-Mediterranean impact of enlargement a reality .
There are five points I would like to highlight because I believe that sooner or later they will have to be reviewed : First is the definition of public service .
The audiovisual policy should tackle these points and also go into more depth in the field of competition .
That is the only way we can make Europe into a true union of diversities .
Morocco , Mauritania and Greenland are great negotiating challenges for the European Commission and we all hope that these negotiations will soon conclude successfully .
On the other hand , there is an important direct relationship between the financial compensation and the objectives and cooperation actions that have been agreed .
We are therefore in favour of both fisheries agreements , which we hope may continue in the future , and we are anxious , Commissioner , to be able soon to hold a debate in our Fisheries Committee , and to repeat what we are saying now , in relation to the extremely important fisheries agreement with Morocco .
There can be no doubt about the cost-effectiveness of these agreements for the European Union , as demonstrated in the study commissioned by the Commission on their cost-benefit relationships .
The approval by the European Parliament of these two fisheries agreements sends a political message demonstrating our support for the signing and renewal of other fisheries agreements which are of much greater importance for our sector because of the number of ships and fishermen which depend on them .
Mr President , it seems that the Commission is happy to ignore the requests of the Council and this Parliament - the former clearly expressed at the Council of Ministers of October 1997 - and delay the work on the guidelines for the negotiation of the fisheries agreements .
In the agreements with the northern countries they are completely under-exploited and there is no way that the fleets with the greatest interest in fishing there can do so .
We must clarify today in this Parliament whether we want the immigrants and refugees who live amongst us to do so legally with their families , giving them the opportunity to live a normal life and to integrate fully into our society , or whether we are going to continue to feed the myth that they are provisional co-citizens whose final destiny is to return to the hypothetical homes they came from .
Therefore , there are very different situations in many countries , and on this minor point I would agree with Mrs Klamt .
Furthermore , to treat unmarried couples on the same terms as married couples , which does not raise many problems in the case of Community citizens , given the diversity of the legislation , does raise problems in the case of third country citizens because there would be very real problems recognising stable cohabitation .
The same would apply to students .
Provided , of course , that the necessary precautions are taken .
Secondly , the scope of the directive must , in any event , be sufficiently broad and systematically include those plans which have a significant impact on the environment .
This would exclude many plans which have an impact on the environment .
Establishing the best way to deal with these issues will require practical experience .
Mr President , having carefully examined all the amendments , I can tell you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 5 ( sections 2 and 5 ) , 6 , 12 , 28 ( section 1 ) and 29 .
This is one of the 100 000 cases which occur throughout the year on Europe ' s coastlines .
I believe that the whole of this House and also the representatives of the Council and the Commission are included in this group , not only the ecologists , but all those who are concerned about this type of problem .
It is also the Commission ' s responsibility to verify that that control of 25 % , another key element of this directive , is carried out by the Member States .
( ES ) Madam President , the Commission can accept the three amendments proposed by Parliament on second reading , corresponding to Mr Morillon ' s report
