Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that , at this juncture , over and above the measures which need to be adopted immediately , two things will be discovered which are more important than the race to adopt emergency measures , namely how the epidemic started and why it spread so quickly .
Last Monday , I went to sleep in the aeroplane that was carrying me to Strasbourg via Rome , Nice and Milan , and I dreamed I was on a ship : that 's right , on a ship , because Mrs Langenhagen is usually the rapporteur for maritime issues .
I therefore feel - and I had to vote for the report - that , with this system , the terrorists will be vanquished .
Vote , therefore , for the least possible aid to be given to this type of treatment of agricultural produce . '
The Community should be able to play a fundamental role in defining the strategy for controlling foot and mouth disease .
Since the Presidency of Parliament , responding to a similar speech by Mrs Ghilardotti at the start of the sitting of 5 September , said that they would make representations to Belgian Railways , I would like to know what was done , following both my and my fellow Member 's requests , to obtain the response of Belgian Railways .
It is a budget which , in my view , suffers throughout from the failure to revise the Financial Perspective established in 1999 at Berlin : a Financial Perspective which I believe is now inadequate and can only become politically more unacceptable in the coming years .
What would we have done in the case of the Balkans ?
This evaluation , which ought to have concerned the Regulation of 21 October 1997 and would have been submitted to Parliament in July 2002 , certainly never reached the Secretariat of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights .
I succeeded , with some difficulty , in unearthing it .
None of this happened , and now we are blithely refinancing this budget line when we have financed it every year for years , without a legal basis , for dubious operations of which , even now , the Commission is unable or unwilling to provide a proper evaluation .
Copenhagen is a historic milestone .
We will ask for increasingly large contributions to balance our accounts but the size of the pensions they will lead to will steadily decrease .
In this general climate of satisfaction , I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she feels that it would not be appropriate , as regards the funds which each Member State has freely decided to use to pay pensions , to go and assess the fairness with which the different individual situations are handled .
When I took office , I pledged that enlargement would be my Commission 's top priority .
At the same time , this result is the fruit of our hard work too .
In December 2004 we have a date with Turkey to see if it meets the conditions for opening negotiations .
Last week 's European Council achieved practically all its objectives .
In my opinion , the countries of the western Balkans belong by definition in the European Union and this view was confirmed by the Copenhagen Council .
Indeed , European integration must provide benefits and new prospects for our neighbours as well , even if they are to remain just neighbours .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have successfully concluded the accession negotiations and we now have to make European unification a tangible , everyday reality .
As Günter Verheugen has said , this is the best prepared enlargement in the history of the Union .
The moment of truth , however , in the coming year will be institutional reform .
The success of Copenhagen and the generosity displayed there - we had expected egoism and breaking away but what we found there was a sense of unity in countries for which enlargement has a different meaning , is something different , is being experienced in a different way , but which have all understood the magnitude of what has happened - have shown that , if we can overcome the obstacles still facing us , we will genuinely be able to put to good use the blend of vision and pragmatism that have made the European Union a unique model of political integration .
What can I say of the inclusion in Europe of a Turkey which has just elected as its leader a person , Mr Erdogan , who said to the Turkish newspaper , jumh Uriet , that millions of Muslims throughout the world are waiting for the reawakening of Turkey to rise up , a Turkey which yesterday refused to allow a former Sakharov Prizewinner , Leyla Zana , to leave the country , preventing her from coming to Strasbourg to take part in the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought awards ceremony ?
This is a further warning to those in favour of Turkey 's accession , whom we would strongly urge to remember the Armenian holocaust which Copenhagen wrongly disregarded .
The rules of our founding fathers , the rules which were the basis for the development of the European Economic Community , now need very careful revision , revision which I am sure will be achieved by the Convention but which needs a further contribution .
It also indicates a sanguine nature , which Mr Nisticò , like all the people of Calabria , certainly has , so much so that he has achieved great success in this conciliation .
We condemn the fact that the Council has only adopted part of the Commission 's proposals .
Moreover , we must on no account disregard the fact that many Nature 2000 areas are affected by this disaster .
These areas
