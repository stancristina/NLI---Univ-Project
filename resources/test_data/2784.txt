And I do not accept that Jimmy Carter is any less American because he argues that this war is unjust .
( Applause from the left ) This is therefore a responsibility for the Commission .
If we believe in the United Nations , we must support it and we must strengthen it .
I regret the letter of the eight members .
We must increase our efforts to contribute to the search for peace in the Middle East , and to eliminate the points of tension in the Maghreb and , of course , provide humanitarian aid during the conflict and then assist in the human , political and economic reconstruction of the country afterwards , as the Presidency of the Union has pointed out .
Mr President , in today 's debate I believe we are faced with a double frustration .
Mr President , we must mobilise all our resources .
A wave of new arrests took place during subsequent weeks .
On behalf of my group , I should like to express our heartfelt condolences to the families of all the victims of this war .
Once again , I must emphasise that the present unilateral action is in breach of the United Nations Charter and of international law .
Given that so many are swearing by some God 's name or taking it in vain , I should like to seize this opportunity of sending out a timely reminder .
You will recall that the European Union evolved from a common market .
It has resulted in disaster , because very often the local population does not perceive the troops as a liberating force .
The latter is offering to subcontract some of the work to European companies .
He will speak on the Spring Council .
The public does not understand the urgency of this war or the reasons for it .
This is essential if we are to act honourably in the interest of the future of all humankind .
Sadly , it was therefore unable to exert its influence as we had hoped .
Also , the discipline promised concerning key aspects such as the promotion of research and development activities failed to materialise .
Unfortunately at this stage consensus appears impossible .
It sent out an unequivocal call for European Union involvement in rebuilding Iraq .
We cannot however fail to deal with international terrorism or threats to our security .
There are two possible responses to the impotence demonstrated by the European Union .
Unfortunately , however , it does not make its weight felt as it should in the international context .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , Council representatives , at this stage of the debate I do not imagine a single Member of this House is unaware that the inclusion of Annex XV is most unfortunate .
It is unfortunate in a legal sense because it calls into question specific rights of the European Parliament .
My group is of the opinion that such delicate implementation calls for a stable and permanent financial framework , recognised by all .
I could give a louder warning but it would be hard to give a clearer one .
I should emphasise that the Treaty has not yet been signed and therefore everything is still open to amendment .
It deals with the basic laws of human stupidity .
It is a new invention and that is really why the difficulty emerged .
I think we have worked together to the very best of our abilities in producing this report .
In my opinion , this is a good and well thought-out package .
That said , I believe the amendments Mr Harbour referred to are reasonable and necessary .
The staff regulations contained an anachronistic rule , similar to an ecclesiastical nihil obstat .
The report also includes proposals to modify the regulations for people of a different sexual orientation , namely gay men and lesbians .
I trust that tomorrow 's comments on the subject of the oral question will help to clarify the situation with regard to this threat to the pension plan for European Union civil servants .
We all understood that the task was to amend the Commission 's proposal in order to make it more effective .
Mr President , this is how the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has contributed to the report .
The new civil servants will need to assimilate to the culture of the European civil service .
Clearly , the proposals amount to a statement of the actions the Commission intends to take in the near future .
Firstly , the Commission 's proposal does not take account of the different problems encountered in using pesticides in different regions in Europe .
There is no mention of Community policy on integrated production in the Commission 's proposal either .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner and also Mr Stevenson for the solidarity he has shown for Galicia as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries .
The proposal we have tabled has been improved by the contributions of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
They sought to make the regulation more flexible and to convert this particular Community fleet .
A large number of associated industries were brought to a virtual standstill .
When she met with the Committee on Fisheries , the Director-General of Fisheries of the Andalusian Regional Government told us that the Spanish authorities had not submitted the necessary information on the proportion of fishermen from this region who had received benefits during the six months ' ban to the Regional Government .
Mr President , I would naturally like to add to the congratulations for the rapporteur - Mr Caudron - who has done excellent work on improving , where necessary , the Commission 's proposal , which is also an extremely important proposal which initiates , in pilot form , what could be a new relationship
