Following that debate , the Commission adopted a White Paper , some of the important actions from which are raised in your question .
In this connection , I would like to point out the importance of Parliament’s opinion for concluding this agreement between the European Community and the ESA .

Unfortunately , the European Parliament has not managed to comply with these rules , neither in the Eurostat affair nor in respect of the Committee of the Regions .
Whereas , until now , it appeared to entertain the idea of making MEPs financially independent of their countries , the prospect of the voters ’ dissatisfaction with this improper inducement has brought it to its senses .
