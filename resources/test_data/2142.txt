The detainees are in a legal vacuum .
As ordinary criminals , they should be safeguarded by American law but , according to a court of appeal in Washington , the naval base does not fall under American jurisdiction since it is not a proper part of the United States .
On its own initiative , the American Supreme Court has decided to investigate whether American jurisdiction should also apply to the Guantánamo naval base , and a response is awaited by no later than June of this year .
Nor , according to the American authorities , are the detainees at the naval base prisoners of war , and they are thus not protected by the Geneva Conventions , either .
The detainees were not part of a regular army when they were taken prisoner .
Instead , the detainees are regarded by the American authorities as illegal combatants who do not come within known legal systems and who can be detained for an unspecified period without being tried or given access to lawyers .
They do not know what they are charged with , and whether or when they can be given fair trials .
It is important to emphasise in this connection that the report applies not only to the European prisoners , but to all the prisoners and to their individual rights as human beings .
Thereafter , they may , if occasion should arise , fall within either the Third Geneva Convention , which applies to legal combatants , thereby affording them status and protection as prisoners of war , or within the Fourth Geneva Convention , which applies to civilians .
The EU and the United States have always been allies .
The report states that the transatlantic relationship is invaluable and irreplaceable and could be a formidable force for good in the world , but only if basic human rights – such as the right to fair trial and the prohibition on arbitrary detention – are respected and remain the core values shared by the United States and the EU.
We therefore call upon the United States fully to comply with the obligations it has itself assumed in relation to international law and international humanitarian law .
The report recommends to the Council that the issue of the conditions under which the Guantánamo detainees are being held be addressed at the summit that is to take place between the EU and the United States in June 2004 .
I should like to thank my fellow MEPs in this House for the many positive contributions I have received from them in connection with this work and for the almost unanimous adoption by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy of the proposal for a recommendation .     Mr President , I find it strange that the European Parliament should be so busy with these efforts on behalf of enemies of democracy .
All the evidence suggests that the detainees have been treated humanely .
It is only a few of the EU Member States that are actively participating militarily in the fight against the reactionary forces that would use terrorism to change the direction in which the world is moving .
To listen to some of those with a professional hatred of the United States , one would imagine that , in their view , the Taliban and al-Qa’ida are a species of freedom fighter who wish to help poor and oppressed peoples .
The terrorists must be given the kind of fright that will deter them from continuing with their criminal acts .
The detainees at the Guantánamo naval base are not soldiers in an organised army .
They are not an underground movement in an occupied country .
They are terrorists who fanatically oppose the human rights that some in this House now believe they should enjoy .
When , subsequently , they take part , with or without visible weapons , in an armed struggle in which some of our soldiers are killed , then they are traitors and must be treated as such .
It is unfitting that we , who are not waging war in Afghanistan and who have not ourselves been exposed to genuine terrorist attacks in our countries , should think we should tell the United States what to do .
I wish to recommend to Parliament that it vote against the report .     Mr President , my Irish friends , congratulations on your victory over England in the rugby , but remember : EU citizens must not be vanquished ; they must decide .
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will recommend the voters politely to reject a Constitution that would give the EU legislative power in 15 new areas instead of limiting the EU to cross-border issues ; that would abolish the right of veto in approximately 40 areas instead of giving the last word to voters and their elected representatives ; and that would demand recognition of the EU Constitution’s priority over the national constitutions instead of respecting the Member States’ constitutions .
Use the Brussels Summit to decide that the Constitution must be debated and voted on in referendums in all the EU countries before it can come into force .
We could then debate our possible common future jointly and choose representatives according to our view of the Constitution .
We could then ourselves decide whether we wish to transfer more power from the voters and elected representatives in the Member States to EU officials and ministers .
Now , a question : will the Presidency say what is happening regarding the secret negotiations concerning the Constitution ?
Is the Presidency fully informed ?
Finally , a brief question to Mr Watson : if the Treaty of Nice is death for enlargement , why , then , did the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party recommend it ?     Mr President
