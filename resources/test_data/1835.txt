, Dimitrios Evregenis , of whose work Mr Le Pen has said that he will use all means possible to prevent its being put into practice .
I wish to make two comments with respect to the reports in front of us ; one on the Belder report , which contains a version of an amendment which I have tabled concerning the treatment of the Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and Latvia .
I believe it has a place here .
What was happening 15 years ago in Austria was that Mr Haider was actually persecuting the Slovene-speaking minority there .
Very few of us wanted to stand up and say anything at the time .
We need to tell the Estonians and the Latvians that , if they continue that treatment , their prospects of joining the European Union will be that much less .
Secondly , the Ludford report has a series of amendments tabled by the Christian Democrats challenging a series of paragraphs that were originally in the Evregenis report 15 years ago - and were approved by the Christian Democrats then - on the amendment of the Staff Regulations to allow ethnic minority members to join the European Community staff .
On voting rights , on the selection of ethnic minority candidates , what I do not understand is whether they have no institutional memory or whether , a more sinister development , their political position has changed .
Madam President , as my colleague Chris Patten has clearly said , it is my responsibility to set out the Commission ' s position on the other two reports being discussed this afternoon .
These are the Haarder and Ludford reports .
Firstly , the Commission shares the European Parliament ' s view that the new legal context , following the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty , gives the Union increased competence and responsibility for human rights .
In this respect the Commission congratulates the European Council ' s initiative to prepare an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This will give greater visibility to these rights and also , I hope , greater legal security if , as desired by both Parliament and the Commission , this Charter becomes a legally binding instrument under the supervision of the courts .
In this context and as the personal representative of the Commission President to the convention responsible for preparing this Charter , I must defend the view that the Charter should be extended to third country nationals legally resident on the territory of Member States .
The Commission is also pleased to note that its views are basically in agreement with those of the European Parliament on the nature and content of this Charter .
This was also the case in yesterday ' s debate on the Duff and Voggenhuber report and it is also true with regard to the conclusions of the report by Mr Haarder whom I warmly congratulate .
The Commission shares the concern for action , and not just words , in ensuring the coherence of the rules on human rights applied by the national courts and by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg or the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
In this respect there is no doubt that the signature of the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Union would allow the hierarchy of the courts ' decisions to be clarified and would allow external supervision of Community law , as is already the case with the legal systems of the Member States .
The signature of this Convention is certainly compatible with the preparation of a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights .
With regard to the content of the Haarder report , I will particularly concentrate on the aspects which come directly within my area of competence within the Commission .
The conclusions of the Tampere European Council provide a very clear political framework for the EU' s policy on respecting and promoting migrants ' rights in the broad sense of the term .
The Heads of State and Government underlined that the joint policies on immigration and asylum to be developed on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty should be founded on principles which are clear to the people and which offer guarantees to those seeking protection in the European Union or requesting access to its territory .
Furthermore , the Presidency ' s conclusions define the four pillars which will form the future basis of the joint European policy on asylum and immigration .
These pillars are : partnership with the countries of origin , a common European asylum system , fair treatment for third country nationals and more efficient management of migratory flows .
I must particularly stress the need for the European Union to have a comprehensive approach to immigration which covers political aspects , human rights and development questions in the countries and regions of origin and transit .
The latter involve the fight against poverty , improvement of living conditions and job opportunities , prevention of conflicts , consolidation of democratic states and respect for human rights , including those of minorities .
I wish to confirm the importance which the Union and its Member States attach to absolute respect for the right to ask for asylum on the basis of a full and comprehensive application of the Geneva Convention .
I must also underline the intention to develop a vigorous policy on the integration of third country nationals legally resident on EU Member State territory .
Finally , although these measures are needed to guarantee social peace in our Member States , we must recognise that the fight against illegal immigration must be strengthened and the protection of the rights of the victims of the criminal networks organising such immigration must be guaranteed .
Particular attention must be paid to the situation of women ' s and children ' s rights
