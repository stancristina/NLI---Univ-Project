to promote entrepreneurial spirit , high-quality employment , training and the provision of life-long services for rural women .
Furthermore , the Council urges the Member States to adopt policies which actively strengthen women 's economic capacity in the rural districts .
The Danish Presidency wants to follow the same line , inter alia in the context of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and the further negotiations on accession .
Finally , I should point out that the current Chairman of this Agricultural Ministers Council is herself from a farming background .
I am not in a position to answer the question that has been asked , and I am not even sure that studies will make it possible to answer it .
I cannot .
I do not think that we in Denmark have any information as to how many there are in Denmark .
It may be regrettable ; but I do not think the information exists .
However , I shall willingly try to find the information , if it is wanted .
We know quite precisely , both in Poland and the other countries .
We do not have the classification by gender .
On behalf of the Council , I would like to recall that , at the meeting in Seville , Ireland 's Prime Minister stated that his government intended holding a referendum this autumn , so that Ireland can ratify the Treaty of Nice .
The European Council adopted a declaration , in which note was taken of the national declaration by Ireland .
The European Council expressed satisfaction that the Irish Government had firmly decided to get the Treaty of Nice approved , something which - as is well known - is a prerequisite for enlargement to be implemented within the time limits laid down .
I cannot say any more than I have already said , because this is the way things stand .
It is a very uncertain situation , and one which puts enlargement at risk in any case .
This is what it says in the Seville conclusions , and I take my stand on these .
I have said what was agreed in Seville , and I take my stand on that .
What was said in Seville was that the Treaty of Nice is a precondition for enlargement to take place within the scheduled timescale .
The European Council in Seville welcomed a number of communications from the Commission on how lawmaking might be improved .
I am thinking in particular of the action plan for finding ways of simplifying and improving the quality of the regulatory environment .
The High Level Technical Group for Interinstitutional Cooperation met on 15 July 2002 .
At the meeting on 15 July 2002 , it was decided firstly to reach common agreement on the chief elements of a future interinstitutional agreement .
At the same time , it was emphasised that the principle of specific actions in an agreement should be viewed in the context of the work being undertaken in the Convention .
In this context , I can tell you that the next meeting of the High Level Technical Group is expected to take place next week , on 10 September .
I should like to have given a clear answer .
I cannot say what will happen , therefore , but I can say this : a reform is not undertaken without carrying out assessments , and without pursuing the aims of the reform .
Finding a way of assessing its possible impact is a natural subject for the interinstitutional agreement .
I cannot say whether I am 100 % in agreement with what was said , but the speaker is in any case an intelligent man and he is probably right in what he says .
It is that which is to be discussed on 10 September , and I ask that the House appreciate this .
The conclusions from the Seville European Council outline the measures which are to be taken with a view to combating the problem of illegal immigration effectively at EU level ; and here we are talking about both prevention and restriction of immigration .
It should also be mentioned that , even before the Seville European Council , the Spanish Presidency had given a significant impetus to this matter , notably by adopting two normative instruments , which not only map out some of the necessary measures , but also set the framework for future efforts and the development thereof .
In addition , this Council reached an agreement on 13 June of this year on conclusions about measures to be taken to prevent and combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings by sea .
Firstly , speeding up the conclusion of readmission agreements currently being negotiated and approval of new briefs for the negotiation of readmission agreements with countries already identified by the Council : see conclusion No 30 .
Secondly , as regards expulsion and repatriation policies , adoption by the end of the year at the latest of the components of a repatriation programme based on the Green Paper submitted by the Commission in April 2002 .
This also falls under conclusion No 30 .
A number of measures are mapped out which should make it possible to achieve this goal very shortly : see conclusions Nos 31 and 32 .
They pointed out that an integrated , comprehensive and balanced approach to tackle the root causes of illegal immigration must remain the EU 's constant long-term objective .
The conclusions confirmed that it is necessary to carry out a systematic assessment of relations with third countries which do not cooperate in combating illegal immigration in the relevant areas .
In the light of the conclusions from Seville , the Danish Presidency has attached a high priority in its work schedule to the fight against illegal immigration , so that the European Council conclusions can be implemented swiftly
