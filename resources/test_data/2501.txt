the opportunity to deliver an opinion on these conclusions .
Given the danger of this development taking longer than planned , however , I think it is acceptable and appropriate for us to be making some improvements - at least those that are possible at this stage - to the SIS in force .
The draft initiatives in question will be discussed for the first time at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 19 December , in the Joint Committee with Iceland and Norway , and the Commission is willing to support several of the concerns expressed by the rapporteur and which , I am sure , Parliament 's plenary will support .
Similarly , the study of the proportionality of certain measures can be facilitated through consultation with the competent authorities , whether they are acting under the third or the first pillar .
This will enable us better to help candidate countries prepare for the future elimination of internal borders , which can only take place when SIS-II becomes operational .
Some of these measures have a direct effect on the Schengen Information System .
The need to improve cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs and , in particular , the linking and crosschecking of information from databases , is one of the aims that the European Union and the Member States must pursue .
National members of Eurojust will have to record all searches they undertake and will not be able to supply data to third countries or to other bodies .
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to all measures designed to protect the health and safety of workers .
Finally , I would like to thank Parliament , as well as the Danish Presidency and the Council , for their work to date on this issue .
The Commission put this question to Parliament and the Council following a consultation of industry and consumer organisations and other interested parties .
The first option proposed allowing the irradiation of shrimps and frogs ' legs , as these foods are often imported from subtropical and tropical countries and a certain microbe content can hardly be avoided .
The Commission will take note of Parliament 's conclusions but must await the reaction of the Council before making any formal proposal .
I would stress that not all foods can or will be irradiated .
We also have the technical tools to enforce correct labelling .
If products are detected by the food control authorities which do not comply with legal requirements , they have to be removed from the market .
I think that what is more important than thinking about the agencies is considering how to make this entire matter more straightforward , accessible and uniform in all the Member States so that everything can be processed more rapidly , both in terms of payments , as expounded on by Mr BÃ¶sch , and also in terms of the concept of the programme itself .
I have therefore voted in favour of the report .
The proposal that has been made only proposes the establishment of a system of exchanging information between Member States on disqualifications imposed in the courts , but does not provide for any type of mutual recognition of sentencing for the purposes of its implementation , which means that an individual who is sentenced to disqualification or to the loss of rights in one Member State can still exercise these rights freely in another State of the Union .
We have received a plethora of outlandish proposals , by which I mean proposals that do not form part of any plan and did not feature in the Commission 's 'scoreboard ' . These are arbitrary , insignificant , incoherent proposals , sometimes dictated by the national political agenda , and transform the third pillar into an ever-expanding universe , containing chaos in all directions ; a bureaucratic ball of thread without ends .

The resolution also strives to change the method of amending the Treaties and advocates the institutionalisation of the 'convention ' method with increased powers , laying down different amending processes - making a distinction between what is known as the 'constitutional ' part and the 'policy ' part - and opening up the possibility of the national parliaments no longer being able to play their full role in ratifying the Treaties .
( PT ) I broadly share the legal assessment this report makes of the Community legal system .
In fact , on the basis of a civilian use of nuclear energy , this appears to have no other use apart from replacing the normal hygiene and safety rules that processed foods should already follow .
We must , however , stress the connection between outbreaks of animal diseases , such as BSE , foot and mouth etc. , as well as other food safety risks , such as dioxins , sewage sludge , etc. , and the concentration and intensification of production as the consequence of adhering to a farming model based on exports and on liberalising agricultural markets , and which has therefore preferred culling to vaccination .
Mr President , as I have already had occasion to point out , the exercises in financial engineering that the current budgetary process has required have once again demonstrated the precariousness of the Community financial framework and , consequently , the need for it to be revised and adapted .
This compression of funds is now being extended to food aid , to cooperation with Latin America , the Balkans and to the MEDA Programme .
The issue becomes even more clear and urgent , however , if we consider the fact that the volume of payment expenditure being proposed for adoption represents an increase in 2003 of only 1.9 % , in other words , lower than the expected level of inflation , which will lead to a real reduction in the payments budget .
