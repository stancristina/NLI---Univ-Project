Countries that have not yet signed include Russia , Yugoslavia , but also Finland , which uses mines to defend its border with Russia .
Nine hundred million people are still illiterate .
It is outrageous that in Africa twice as much money should be spent on military equipment as on education .
That is , in fact , the strategic reason I can identify behind the manifest neglect of primary education .
I expect much more from governments that are aware of the problem , but in that case we must also be prepared to support those governments and increase their administrative efficiency .
Often they were ex-convicts , ethnic minorities and losers in the battle for the best land .
We share in the grief and suffering of America .
I hope we can adopt this line in unison .
This would involve cooperation among police forces , examining magistrates and intelligence services .
We now have globalisation of terrorism .
Everyone is vulnerable .
We should realise that we must explain what our intentions are .
But it remains to be seen whether we can all agree .
It is of the utmost importance to combat international terrorism .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the attack of 11 September on the WTC and the Pentagon strikes at the very heart of our democracy .
The production of drugs and oil in regions of conflict and the trade in 'blood diamonds ' facilitate the financing of illegal activities , of conflict and of war , and are in turn closely linked with the terrorist networks .
Their hunger is called power .
In terms of external policy , the European Union is able to do this because we increasingly speak with one voice .
Needless to say , justice is important in this context , for we are dealing with a crime here , with whatever fine motives it is presented .
Some may appreciate in these circumstances that a plea for this does not point to an institutional compulsion , but rather to a concern for the effectiveness of the Union ' s actions .
Those images will be etched in our minds forever , but unfortunately , every day , we are once again faced with expressions of blind fanaticism , much closer to home , which cannot be ascribed - as happens - to certain world visions .
Mr President , Commissioner , there is no doubt that over the years , the Cohesion Fund has helped to make less developed regions within the Union stronger .
If that is the case , the existing system has many successful years ahead , even following the accession .
I believe that to be appropriate .
The Koran too leaves no room for mutilation .
Outside Africa , it is practised in southeast Asia , including Indonesia , Sri Lanka , Malaysia , on the Arab peninsula in Yemen , in Oman and in the United Arab Emirates .
I therefore urge the Member States and the Commission once again to recognise genital mutilation , or the threat thereof , as a gender-specific reason for granting asylum .
Mr President , the use of genital mutilation is an extreme form of female repression which , in some countries , is as old as time itself .
The sexual mutilation of girls must be considered a punishable offence in every country and every society , as demanded in various international agreements .
But it is generally accepted that the different career patterns of men and women account for about half of the wage gap - for example , women interrupt their careers more easily than men , with slower career progress as a result - the lower qualifications especially of older working women , the fact that working women are on average younger than working men - in other words , the objective , structural differences .
Moreover , women are generally not involved in job evaluation since they are not the negotiators with the social partners .
So do the social partners .
In summary , there is a need for a global policy strategy .
The report rightly mentions value discrimination .
That is where the government could step in , but so could the social partners .
Equal pay for work of equal value can help break the vicious circle of lifelong inequality : lower pay leads to a smaller pension or to more work in order to obtain the same pension ; more work often entails a greater need for child care , less time to develop other talents or abilities or to relax outside work , etc .
I welcome the fact that , as frequently happens , Europe leads the way in a number of cases .
First of all , a preventive approach can be adopted , which means that companies must make it clear to their staff that they do not tolerate harassment at work .
Mr President , it is nearly three years since the Commission tabled a proposal for a directive amending the rules on the emission of pollutants from large combustion plants .
We as the European Parliament have collectively given real significance to the environmental policy , and I should once again like to extend a warm thanks to all the fellow MEPs who contributed to this .
If I compare this with the regulations which currently apply in Japan and the United States , we , who all want things to be done just so , would have cut a very poor figure with the Council ' s emission regulations during the discussions on Kyoto .
At the trilogue , agreement was reached provisionally on the Commission ' s obligation to extend monitoring - for which we have Mr Hans Blokland to thank - to include emissions of heavy metals .
That is , in fact , too late
