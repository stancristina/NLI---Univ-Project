On balance , I have decided to vote in favour .     .
A glaring indication of this is the pompous declaration that Parliament ‘adopts the Constitutional Treaty’ .
The citizens ’ social rights emerge clearly strengthened due to the fact that the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights has been incorporated into the Constitution – recognition of the public’s place at the heart of the European project .
The occurrence of the catastrophe meant that global security had failed , and , this time , terrorists cannot be blamed .
We need to follow closely and politically the reconstruction in Aceh and in Sri Lanka to prevent the resumption of war .
What , in that case , does the future hold for the credibility of this type of institutional agreement if one of the parties damages it unilaterally , using the argument that it complies with Belgian law ?
Is this because the new executive Commission hopes to reemploy those workers who were unfairly dismissed by the previous executive ?
It might be useful for us to pay a little attention to what is happening with the interpreters , in particular the freelancers , who are highly qualified , have been providing professional services for many years , and the turnover of whom is lower and lower .
Climate change is a consequence and an illustration of the unsustainable nature of the capitalist system of production , with its unchecked plundering of natural resources and its complete subservience to short-term gain , instead of investment in long-term planning that encompasses the preservation of the conditions needed for the human race to survive .
Against this backdrop , the role that the EU has been playing in international efforts to combat climate change is cause for satisfaction and should be duly acknowledged .
Last November in my explanation of vote on the EU’s strategy for the Buenos Aires conference on climate change – COP-10 – I wrote that I felt it was important for ‘the EU delegation to the Buenos Aires Conference ( … ) to take a leading role in negotiations .
We must halt the hypocrisy and cynicism of those who channel astronomical amounts of money into war in Iraq but who have difficulty in raising the necessary financial resources to support the victims of these tragedies and to build a fairer world .     .
This time , also very much due to the efforts of its citizens , Europe lived up to what its stature should be .
Against this backdrop , I feel that it is essential to set up an EU civil rapid reaction corps , in order to enhance the effectiveness of European help in humanitarian crisis situations .
As a member of the Committee on Budgets , I welcome the interinstitutional agreement that has been reached permitting recourse to emergency funds and to flexibility instruments and enabling significant funds to be released , despite their not being initially budgeted .
In a clear sign that this is something that unites them rather than divides them , the EU is playing the supporting role to the American big brother that has historically been attributed to it .
The focus now is on building the future .
We are , in all senses , on two sides of the same ocean .
The fact that we do not always agree should be a catalyst for promoting dialogue and not an excuse to foment sterile and counter-productive tensions , which are of use only to those who have always wanted to see us divided .
Maintaining the debt is unacceptable .
Furthermore , unlike those who advocate the unrestricted opening of borders to all immigration , I believe that the best , most efficient and fairest policy is to endeavour to foster development in the countries most in need , instead of promoting the draining of their most capable human resources .
The economic growth of developing countries must be people-focused .
In the context of that struggle , the name of Viktor Yushchenko comes to the fore , but only as a first among equals .
It is this approach , an integral part of the resolution before us , which led me to vote in favour .     .
I believe that the firmness shown by the EU in defence of democracy and freedom should not be misinterpreted , nor used to antagonise a neighbour of its importance .
This kind of appeasement will bring us the worst possible results .
This is also a consequence of the accession of ten more Member States .
The purpose of this recommendation is to obtain parliamentary consent to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States , of the one part , and the Republic of Chile , of the other part , to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic , the Republic of Estonia , the Republic of Cyprus , the Republic of Latvia , the Republic of Lithuania , the Republic of Hungary , the Republic of Malta , the Republic of Poland , the Republic of Slovenia , and the Slovak Republic to the European Union .
Most importantly , however , the eContent programme – in common with other similar initiatives – should be an effective means of enhancing the information - and knowledge-based society .     . – As well as contributing towards the Lisbon Strategy and towards reinforcing Europe’s competitiveness in the knowledge-based economy , the multiannual Community programme to make digital content in Europe more accessible , usable and exploitable , enables us to achieve satisfactory results in terms of economic growth , job creation , innovation and consumer choice .
I voted in favour of this joint resolution essentially because I agree that , as things currently stand in the Middle East ,
