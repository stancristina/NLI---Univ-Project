witness a continuation of the constructive process of cooperation and dialogue started during this year 's procedure .
But to show you the extent of this minority view , I can tell you that at the decisive moment in the Committee on Budgets , it was 15 to 13 .
Parliament 's role has been reduced to that of stooge , carrying out the dirty work which the Council itself did not want to do , in cutting sections of headings 3 and 4 .
The draft operating budget presented by the Commission shows that there are now sufficient resources to maintain activities , both for conversion aid and social measures , and for research aid .
But it is certainly not going to help conserve jobs in coal and steel .
Talking about amendments , Mr President , I am still worried about the fate of the 20 % placed in reserve for general information activities , and the reserve for the Prince programme , and even the Meda programme , which although justified initially , is worse off today than the Phare programme .
It is an austere budget under difficult conditions in which , nevertheless , commitments are increased by 2.1 % .
This budget also supports employment .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , we value the efforts made both by the Commission , in its proposal , and by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl .
Therefore our group 's vote will depend on the final proposal .
We think it is a positive step that for the first time , at the request of the French Government , there has been a summit on employment , which is the biggest problem faced by European society and the societies of our individual countries .
Furthermore , in many countries there is a belief that the cost of enlargement will be paid by the less well-off Member States , with solidarity policies being reduced , and the common agricultural policy weakened .
We cannot renounce our acceptance of a single , legitimate government for Cyprus because of Turkey 's view , or its threats .
One is the danger of thinking it possible , in such a short time , to resolve each and every one of the problems facing the European Union .
I believe at least one of the two initiatives has already exceeded the figure of 10 , 000 signatures , by means of worthy effort and great personal risk .
Unfortunately all this will turn out to be useless if the reform proposal , which the European Commission proposes , is included in Agenda 2000 , and this is because it introduces elements which are prejudicial to the correct working of this sector .
I conclude , Madam President , by demonstrating our conviction that this Parliament will take on board the proposals contained in the report which we are debating today and on which we will vote tomorrow .
Linked to the previous point , we think that we have to strengthen the role of producer organizations as an essential element in a commercial and promotional policy in regard to the product .
There seems to be no justification in stating that , in a short period of time , large increases in demand are expected , and nor does there seem any justification for us to consider that the results of the extraordinary harvest in the years 1996-1997 would be the future reality .
It is an assessment I share - congratulations to Mr José - and here we are , Commissioner , sending him a clear , majority message whereby this Parliament , having heard all those who had something to say on the subject , believe that this reform must go through .
You have here a reasonable and balanced group of measures .
Therefore , I ask the Assembly to support the Jové report and reject the rest of amendments so that the Committee can start work on this proposal , presenting us with a more reasonable alternative than the one initially submitted for this Parliament 's consideration .
Having said this , there is no doubt that we celebrate , as the rapporteur said , that finally the Council has begun the process of agreement - yes indeed timid and limited - on banning tobacco advertising as Parliament has been requesting for years .
Because , for many other reasons , Madam President , I refuse to be murdered by this product , even passively , as the World Health Organization has it .
In no way must it be allowed for more than 26 products to be labelled , from valerian to chocolate and the scent of liquor , which are in tobacco - this was acknowledged some days ago by a tobacco company in the Spanish press - and there are some we are not sure whether they are also addictive .
And there are also statistical extrapolations which are made about the incidence of lung cancer in smokers .
Secondly , because it is not appropriate , since there will imminently be a new proposal for regulations in the sector .
Mr Marchais was the leader of a party which took part in all aspects of democratic life in France and tribute has been paid to him by French democrats , starting with the present French Prime Minister .
This means that we have no legal basis for getting started on that desirable global vision in the Union .
Mr President , in my view the general lines proposed by Commissioner Fischler , which Parliament has now rejected for a number of reasons , were not acceptable .
We therefore support this proposal for subsidies for actual production , because it will create more jobs , it supports the less favoured regions of the European Union and it will produce less fraud than the tree subsidy system , which is not transparent enough .
