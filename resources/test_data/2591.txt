between the European Parliament and the Central American Parliament .
I remember very well that throughout these years this delegation has maintained extraordinary relations with Parlacen and with the other Latin American parliaments .
Two fundamental objectives are to try to ensure that social differences are not made worse by the economic policies that currently prevail in that region and to try to ensure that the parliaments help with the integration of the area , which would be beneficial to all .
In the case of the Central American Parliament , this task is , if possible , even more important given the enormous challenge of the integration and structural development of these societies on the basis of peace , dialogue and reconciliation .
The Central American Parliament , like the European Parliament , must gain prestige , credibility and legitimacy on the basis of the activity of its political groups , because the life of the parties is , or at least should be , a faithful reflection of the societies they represent .
You can change the language if you like , but not the intention .
In this context , the Commission is taking action and we have specific projects for each of those three areas .
On this issue , we are also working on the definition of a new cooperation programme which should allow us to concentrate on these three fundamental elements : economic integration - the implementation of common policies - the strengthening of the institutions and the strengthening of civil society .
These elections should make up one of the key elements of the national reconciliation that we all wish to see and are calling for .
As has been said , the truth is that the situation in Burma is getting worse ; it is incredible that there is still this persecution of such an important leader of democracy as Aung San Suu Kyi and that the Democratic League cannot operate normally in its work for the re-establishment of democracy , especially when there is still economic investment in that country which is taking advantage precisely of that lack of freedom , that lack of union rights there .
The resolution recently adopted by the United Nations demonstrates that it is not only the European Union that harbours these concerns .
Our ASEAN partners know this very well and are concerned to repair this damage ; on the other hand , they know that encouraging Burma to make a genuine effort and to put an end to its appalling behaviour in the field of human rights is the best way to revive relations between the Union and ASEAN.
Furthermore - and I think this should be highlighted today - within the framework of the new constitution adopted in 1992 , Vietnam has an elected national parliament , which has the duty of adopting legislation and to which the government must answer in relation to its policies .
The circumstances surrounding the execution at the beginning of this year of a Vietnamese-Canadian citizen undoubtedly support our convictions in this regard .
The energy and transport sectors produce 85 % of the total emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union .
This heading disappeared from the Budget some time ago on the basis of the argument that these were matters to which the subsidiarity principle applied and which ought to be raised at national , rather than Community , level .
As you know better than anyone , funds are fully allocated and there are no generalised fund surpluses , even though there may be specific instances where there are no budgetary implementations .
What this article says is that , in the case of natural catastrophes , national aid may be compatible .
We also think that this report makes an important and satisfactory contribution to the whole process .
The report coincides , to a large degree , with the ideas of the Commission and the objectives we are trying to achieve .
We ought to support these objectives by means of sound and prudent standards which guarantee the security of our markets and institutions .
There would also be a third level corresponding to the implementation of mechanisms enabling us to promote consistency and convergence in the area of supervision and to reinforce what is stated along those lines in the paper produced by the Member States and the Commission .
Right from the start , the Commission has been in favour of developing a full internal ratings system , subject to standards which may be achieved by well-managed institutions , independently of their size or of the sector in which they operate .
The Commission has already signalled its agreement on this matter in the past , both for technical budgetary reasons and for reasons to do with the independence of the Ombudsman' s duties .
No one knows who the candidates are , since they are identified by secret codes rather than by their names .
What form is this correcting of examination papers to take ?
Obviously , I was talking about July 2000 .
I am pleased with the progress that is being made in Article 7 , in Article 191 , with regard to the European political parties and to qualified majority voting in certain articles .
I would like to say to Mr Poettering , who has become the advocate for the so-called small countries , that we are all small here , Mr Poettering , there is no large country : if there were one large one it would try to dominate the others .
I think this is completely unacceptable and , of course , it is a good argument in favour of ending the closed door method for the Intergovernmental Conferences , which has had its day , so that we can hold discussions in public and find out who could say such scandalous things .
