a further EUR 6 million in the reserve in budget line 206 .
( The President noted that there was no opposition to the oral amendment being considered ) ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I also want to congratulate the Commission for doing this before the very important climate change conference in Marrakesh , COP 7.
.
The displaced populations from 3 500 destroyed Kurdish villages in the south-east are not being allowed to return to the area .
Fear of what is called " separatism " results in a language , songs and writings being punishable .
Since it was ultimately recognised , the territory on the island of Taiwan that is controlled by the successors to the government driven out in 1949 is regarded as a non-recognised state , which is something we should now try to find a solution for .
He is right to raise the matter of meeting behind closed doors , which is inconsistent with the principles of democracy and openness .
The continued existence of the Council will have an adverse effect on parliamentary democracy .
The profits from investments in these countries flow back to the richest countries .
Action by armies outside their own borders , on the other hand , is always rightly regarded as a form of aggression and imperialism .
We also find the amounts specified by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development excessive .
Instead of modernising the fisheries sector , more than EUR 1 billion of government money is being spent on doing so every year .
The European fisheries policy must be brought much more closely in line with European development policy .
To try to control fisheries with two very different instruments - the TACs and the quota on the one hand and the fleet structure policy on the other - will result in serious problems , particularly if the policy instruments serve different objectives , which is the case .
At the moment , the Commission is , nonetheless , holding onto its MAGP , with some changes which I can only describe as unfortunate .
I note that more than 80 % of our fellow MEPs evidently had a good reason for not participating in the vote this afternoon .
I then agreed to this on the assumption that the other groups needed more time for a fully-fledged discussion .
In May , after months of negotiations with the Council and Commission , we were able to bring the Regulation to a successful end .
So what are the proposed changes to our Rules of Procedure for which we are asking your backing ?
The European Court of Justice has made statements to this effect , which we should , and want to , observe , of course .
In fact , my advice would be to publish those Minutes even earlier than is now the case .
This concludes the most important changes to our Rules of Procedure .
These initiatives are therefore to be welcomed , but the same cracks seem to be appearing again .
After all , that saves them a great deal of time , money and bother .
It clearly is not , for as soon as one is faced with UMTS , the difference between e-mail and SMS fades into the background , with all the consequences that this entails .
I therefore propose approving the Cappato report but also improving on it further by voting in favour of Amendment No 44 instead of Amendment No 35 .
The trade deficit with the US has therefore increased to , and I happily quote this figure because it is so enormous , EUR 6 829 million .
That is why I call for a very ambitious European project .
Americans deliberate longer and work longer on films before they are launched .
I should also like to talk about the way we will be protecting our heritage .
Why is it that European film attracts such a small audience , while the cinema-viewing public is on the increase ?
One of the areas in which investments must be made is e-cinema .
Abuse during transport and the spreading of animal diseases directly impact on the image , and often the income , of animal farmers , while they are not to blame for these causes .
First of all , 15 EU inspectors should be appointed with the task of submitting annual reports to the Council , the Commission , but also the European Parliament , as well as the parliaments of the Member States .
Furthermore , the said regions are disproportionately hit by tightened European legislation on food safety , and I would therefore suggest earmarking structural funds for those regions to invest in small , semi-mobile slaughterhouses .
In the EU , literally millions of animals have been killed and destroyed in the last four years as a result of an explosive spreading of animal diseases including foot-and-mouth and swine fever .
One of the conclusions we are drawing from the foot-and-mouth crisis is that agriculture must focus on the regionalisation of production and that the transport of live animals must come to an end .
We must move towards regionalisation of the production chain with small , clean slaughterhouses .
In my opinion , there should come a day when a positive Statement of Assurance can be made .
I have started to wade through this tome .
Neither do they fight fraud satisfactorily when they collect their revenue .
Progress has thus been made in small ways , but that is not enough to really gain the confidence of the people in Europe .
Citizens should have a choice , particularly in the case of products which are so important in everyday life .
With regard to the drafting of a framework directive , I would prefer to await the Commission position in Laeken
