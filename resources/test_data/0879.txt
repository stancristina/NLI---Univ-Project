The exclusion of donors on the basis of these criteria could be definitive or temporary , depending on the case and the illness .
However , the text proposed to us by the Commission seems to contain , alongside sound demands , some outrageous remarks which I was surprised had got this far without being noticed .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Union for Europe Group and I support the rapporteur 's approach , and are convinced that the budget exercise will commence auspiciously well .
In 1998 , Parliament devoted as much money to the acquisition of the ostentatious D3 building in Brussels as it did to the famous " jobs ' initiative .
Our Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs wanted to take the Treaty of Amsterdam into account by looking ahead to the integration of the Schengen acquis into the community framework and putting the majority vote into perspective .
For it to be effective , free movement must also assist family reunification with children and dependent older relatives as well as non-dependent older relatives , although I think this last group should enjoy the right to free movement in their own right .
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the initiative to compile all the provisions relating to free movement into a single clear document so that these texts finally become accessible to the citizens and practitioners of European law .
Better still , it emphasizes the fact that the right to free movement of European citizens , as set out in the Treaty , should not necessarily be taken to imply the right to move about or stay without completing all the specific formalities .
The report also proposes a more flexible interpretation of the rules governing family reunification .
Mr President , before you call a vote on compromise Amendment No 22 , I would like to intervene regarding paragraph 8 in its entirety .
This progression raises the question of Structural Fund inflation and the fund 's usefulness , which has already been highlighted by my group in a recent study entitled ' Welfare Europe or Europe of the Nations ' .
It is important to reiterate that the final 1998 budget was reduced by ECU 550 million .
On the contrary , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop attempts to reconcile conflicting interests without identifying actual priorities and satisfying the various parties and lobbies who enjoy the Community manna .
Finally , I would like to insist upon blood and plasma donations remaining free .
We have already seen through other recent reports that the road to hell is often paved with good intentions .
We see absolutely no reason why a donor should give information about any sexual activity in Africa , let alone who he or she may have had relations with and when .
We must be able to say this to our Russian counterparts .
Gaps like these cannot be made up in one day !
He has just been heavily sentenced to two years ' imprisonment .
I simply want to say that as far as the United States is concerned , we consider that it is vital that all guarantees enshrined in the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights and other pertinent instruments are respected .
It is he who was to have given us the information .
We cannot ask for a split vote less than an hour before the beginning of the sitting .
First of all , the European Parliament obviously cannot correct the Treaty .
Rather , it is to mirror certain questions regarding the methods used to implement this necessary democratic exercise .
It is also a question of linking up with the cooperation effort initiated by the Fifteen in the field of justice and home affairs .
To conclude , I would like to pay homage to the fact that Mr Posselt has reminded us of our duties towards the nations of eastern Europe .
This exemplifies the major difficulties encountered by the negotiators in the difficult field of justice - namely the lack of mutual confidence between Member States as regards their respective legal systems .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , I have to say that you have sorely disappointed me .
( The Minutes were approved )
Global Satellite Navigation System Mr President , satellite navigation is a strategic sector which represents , together with the information superhighway , one of the technological battles of the future .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree that the technical quality of Mr Adam 's report is very high , and I shall vote in favour of the provisions proposed in it .
The main question today is therefore whether the Commission is going to retract the suspension of the WTO panel relating to the Helms-Burton law , which it requested nearly a year ago , in the unfounded expectation of an amendment of Title 4 by Congress .
( Applause from various quarters )
For this reason , I would like to highlight two extremely important facts regarding French policy towards the euro .
The first relates to what is called the democratic accountability of the European Central Bank , a subject which was mentioned during the debate on the report presented by Mrs Randzio-Plath .
This illegitimate and artificial construction which is known as the European Union is a planned attack against France , against the sovereignty of the people , the state structures and the society .
I am not talking about the Governing Council , which will be the curia .
Just like any religion , it needs its miracles and there are many of them .
Cecchini did not keep his promises , but then a religion is not serious , it is not something rational , it is a matter of belief .
The single currency project does not enjoy massive consensus
