are qualified women around - you only have to look .
My responsibilities include taking decisions on all manner of recruitment issues .
After the decision has been made to end age limits , I 'll be responsible for the matter and I 'll attend to it .
But if you want to see a list of those situations where age limits will be imposed , contrary to this decision , I will gladly prepare one , although it 'll be very short .
Mr President , I am sorry , I misunderstood the question .
As for the Amsterdam Treaty , we are all bound by it in the same way , obviously , but we should I think refrain from commenting on the recruitment policies of other institutions .
Mr President , the increases proposed by Parliament will fall into place like the employment initiative in Europe or the Socrates programme .
I would n't like to make judgements as to how a Member State might benefit one way or the other .
The document is now available and people can make their own judgements accordingly .
It will mean better security for Europe and , in the future , greater prosperity .
European companies will be involved in many such projects , but it is extremely difficult to tell which countries will reap the greatest rewards , and which the smallest .
Then , in the matters of external relations and administration , things get pretty complicated .
For example , when we make guarantee funding payments in agriculture , often an exporting company might be , for instance , a company in Belgium which exports agricultural produce from France or Holland .
But the account we are paying in to is generally geared to one Member State .
It is never possible to get fully accurate information on this , but we have strong indicators from a precise knowledge of how much everyone pays to the Community , what structural funds there are and what each Member State gets , and what is paid out of agricultural guarantee funds .
Would it possibly be that the Commission will be doing all it can to support new projects in the nuclear power industry in Eastern Europe ?
Under the previous government 's policy even the city water supply was privatized .
What was the competitive value of that ?
Water is obviously a public service .
A viable public service system is the basis of equality and democracy .
Without them people 's trust in the Union will diminish .
While the old monopolies need a good shaking up , they should not be replaced by private monopolies or duopolies .
In my view , the Union should not enlarge unless equality improves .
Good public services help us to attain the things most essential to us : solidarity , equality , confidence , and the growth of all three .
Mr President , The Luxembourg European Council may be considered , in the main , to have been successful .
Now we can give proper attention to what resources and means we can have recourse to in the fight against unemployment .
It was good that the status of the Ecofin council was properly defined and that member states were given the opportunity to hold policy talks on decisions regarding monetary union , but the basic problem remains .
There is still little opportunity for ordinary citizens to supervise the work of the central bank and have a say in monetary policy .
But its powers of influence are tenuous when it comes to the work of the European central bank .
Nevertheless , smoking is the greatest single preventable cause of death in the European Union .
So what are we do to about it ?
The most important task of society is the promotion of health with every resolution made .
I do not think we can afford to wait until 1006 for the ban to come into force , as was proposed at Luxembourg .
There is a need to enlighten people in the Member States as to the dangers of smoking much more obviously than at present .
We as parents and guardians have to get involved too .
This agreement is important for the international fur trade , and it also is of immense interest in the Nordic regions with regard to the protection of animals .
Mr Pimenta has now stated the agreement is a bad one .
This is something I really want to stress .
I think the agreement is an important step towards improved conditions for the trapping of fur animals .
The agreement would provide for EU investigation into snaring methods currently in use within its borders , which will go a long way to improve the welfare of animals .
The Committee on External Economic Relations , which also cares for the wellbeing of animals , and for whom I now speak as draftsman of the opinion , considers it absolutely vital that the Community fulfills its international obligations and that a possible new WTO dispute be averted .
A possible trade war would jeopardise tens of thousands of jobs , which clearly conflicts with the aims of Union employment policy .
If you ca n't get the best , take what is good .
The recommendation now being discussed has been part of the European Parliament 's decision-making process for a very long time .
The normalisation and acceptance of the status of NGOs mean , through EU agricultural development policy , strengthening cooperation and liaison between the Union and the people of the developing world .
NGOs can do a lot more in this area than official state organizations .
Expertise acquired by NGOs in the field will lend essential support to EU development cooperation , if it is used properly .
This has cost the European Community dear .
