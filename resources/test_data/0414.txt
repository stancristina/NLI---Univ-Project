However , achieving reform means reforming personnel regulations , which would require good cooperation with employee organisations , among others .
A three-year ceiling must be set for the use of funds granted , after which the funds unused would be cancelled .
Mr President , the European Union already has a quarter of a century of legislative tradition which obliges it to take equality between women and men in working life seriously .
We can state that in over a quarter of a century our societies have developed considerably in many respects and it is time to revise our view of equality between women and men at work to meet the requirements of today .
In this directive the European Union presents for the first time actions binding on Member States to prevent sexual harassment which is prevalent in the workplace .
In this respect , the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities suggests that we go a little further than the Commission originally intended .
Maternity protection also needs strengthening .
I myself am from Finland and it is often thought that Finland is a model country in terms of equal opportunities .
Research carried out into the reasons behind this found that this may be due to there being so much competition in the workplace .
This is sexual discrimination , which is banned .
I am sure that such independent bodies for equal opportunities already exist in most Member States but I would like to emphasise the importance of this issue when considering candidate countries .
I would like to emphasise that social development has brought with it new types of equality issues .
There was a great deal of discussion within the Committee on whether young men and fathers need stronger protection against sexual discrimination .
In my opinion , this is highly appropriate at a time when the equal opportunities discussion has largely moved towards looking at how men can take part in realising their family responsibilities .
Mr President , Mrs Hautala , Commissioner , I am very pleased to see that so many members have referred to the amendments relating to the position of parents - particularly young parents .
Reference has already been made here to the fact that childbearing tends to be postponed in periods of economic prosperity , and this is particularly worrying as far as young women are concerned .
Our society and our economy cannot afford not to exploit to the full the skills of its entire population .
Our society must offer all its members equal and unlimited opportunities for self-development along their chosen path .
Sexual harassment is a repugnant phenomenon .
However , there is cause to take action at European Union level only where we are unable to create sufficient legislation at national level .
A text worded clearly , accurately and in detail is one of these .
Furthermore , I would like to say that I absolutely oppose Amendment No 40 , which refers to collective action being adopted in this sector .
While I am not of the opinion that this would be a bad thing in this sector in particular , I do object in general to the collective action mechanism being brought into the European legal system .
Madam President , I would like to appeal to my colleague Mr Poettering and also everyone else who planned the successful postponement of the reading of my colleague Mr Wuori' s human rights report .
It would be a pity if the undeniable high point of the week , my colleague Mr Wuori' s report , were now suddenly to be taken away .
This is completely possible .
We have the whole morning for these two discussions .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Dybkjaer for an excellent report on a subject which is important to everyone .
If this gulf in technical know-how cannot be bridged , globalisation will already have failed from the start .
The issue does not merely involve a technical problem but the combined effects of geographical isolation , poverty and disease .
Although development cooperation in recent decades has largely been correctly targeted , the media has emphasised and public opinion has been influenced by a few sad examples of tractors rusting in the fields , in other words donations given on commercial terms without understanding the situation of the recipients or ensuring that they were prepared to receive them .
Precisely the same nightmare scenario may arise today if we do n' t take care that the information society of developing countries has a healthy foundation on which it can be based .
The PPE-DE Group would like the European Union to work to ensure that , with its help , all countries in the world are able to take part in adopting information technology and develop their societies .
On behalf of our committee I warmly thank Mr Whitehead for heading the preparation process so well that we other draftsmen were able to take part in the process .
He has done a great job .
However , I would still like to focus attention on one particular point .
As directed by the committee , I would like to propose a minor correction to this , namely that one of these representatives should come from the ranks of primary producers .
I also hope that this legislative proposal is quickly adopted and implemented .
The Gothenburg Summit must reach a quick decision on starting up this authority as otherwise the citizens ' faith in it will be undermined .
I would also like to support Mr Whitehead on the Council deciding the location having heard the views of the Commission and Parliament .
This decision should be made immediately at the Gothenburg Summit .
If we want this authority to be an authority which really gets into the work expected of it , we also have
