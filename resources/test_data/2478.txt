would refer you to the answer given to question no . 1512/99 .
We have therefore sought to make a contribution in relation to these needs .
This is precisely for the purpose of making it clear that this is a humanitarian operation , but I also think it is a good thing that the population and political circles in Serbia see that the world outside is also prepared to help in this way .
I have reported on the humanitarian aid being provided by the EU to those who require it in Serbia , and the other questions in fact lie outside the actual discussion of humanitarian aid .
The money I have mentioned is money we have in fact used .
I cannot use it again , and that was the point at issue in the question .
What we can do in relation to those in prison is to contribute to the international effort to obtain some insight into how they are being treated .
We shall use all possible channels and contacts to help them in their situation , but the great struggle for power in Serbia , for democratisation and so on is not something which - if I am to have the slightest credibility - I can assume we can sort out using these humanitarian resources .
I listened with interest to the discussion this morning about food safety and have a question to put to the Commission : is it the precautionary principle which is now to be tested by the Commission in connection with the hormone war with the USA ?
Nor did I hear the Commissioner substantiate any possible scientific proof .
Can we be certain that there will in fact be scientific proof to justify continuing with the ban on hormone-treated meat ?
The second question is this : how can one be certain that , in the forthcoming World Trade Organisation negotiations in Seattle , problems do not arise with the USA and , in general , with the negotiations concerning free trade if Europe continues to stand by what is , in my view , an unscientific ban on imports of hormone-treated meat ?
Mr President , developments in the Middle East have taken place according to the motto , " two steps forward and one step back " .
At that time , the Palestinian people and the PLO were completely marginalised .
The only people who took them even slightly seriously were the European Left .
I must point out that it was only when the right-of-centre Netanyahu lost the election that the peace process got under way again .
There is the problem of the status of Jerusalem .
There will now be the important task of keeping both parties on the track of peaceful development .
This will be a form of development in which human rights can be strengthened on both sides and in which my friends on the Israeli Left may perhaps see their dream fulfilled .
( DA ) We have voted for the proposal to have part-sessions lasting four days in which Fridays are omitted .
We should have liked the Groups in the European Parliament to have been able to agree to use Fridays for political debate , but this has not happened .
Europol personnel ( C5-90 and C5-89/1999 )
Unfortunately , the Commission ' s proposals in important areas such as agriculture and TRIPS reflect an old-fashioned trading policy designed to promote one ' s own export opportunities at the same time as retaining protectionist arrangements within the EU.
If the negotiations are to cover employees ' rights , the environment , consumer protection , investments and competition , the EU must send out a clear signal that common interests are being given priority over and against our own narrow interests .
There are also humanly created problems .
On the other hand , the tools we use to reduce emissions will have to be effective and binding , as Mrs Hassi and Mrs Wallstr√∂m emphasised .
You can certainly do that as a way of wangling lower environmental requirements for yourself , but you cannot cheat with regard to the actual effects of climate changes .
I would therefore urge the Council and the Commission to stand by the demand that at least half of the CO2 reductions are to be made on a national basis .
If we lower that 50 % level , then I think we should be considerably impairing the EU' s policy on climate change and also greatly reducing the EU' s credibility in continued negotiations on the subject .
Thank you for your answer .
The fact is , the huge power which the European Central Bank has to intervene in national financial institutions and the national banks is part and parcel of a highly cryptic system reminiscent of a nest of Chinese boxes .
In addition to this , there is Article 30 which stipulates that the contribution may be increased by the currency reserves to ten times as much , that is to say EUR 50 billion .
This is a very large sum , whether it be for Denmark or for other countries , and this maximum may , of course be established by means of a majority decision in the Council on the basis of a recommendation of the Board of Management , which also makes majority decisions , while each individual country has the voting weight to which its contribution entitles it .
It is the present culture of secrecy which is the fraudsters ' best defence .
All administration and all subsidies are nowadays dealt with by computer .
It is a very simple matter to give our citizens access to the information on the Internet .
If a company or an association wants there to be confidentiality about any subsidies it receives , then it is free to use its own resources to ensure this
