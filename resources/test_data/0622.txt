run amok without let or hindrance .
Following the disturbances that took place at the beginning of this year , there was a short period of calm in and around the Moluccan islands , but at the end of July , the violence flared up again in all its ferocity .
The Netherlands has recently started delivering ever more multilateral rather than bilateral aid , which has led to the aid no longer being recognisable .
Democratic structures are not functioning and we are on the sidelines to some extent because the international community is disregarded by the authorities in Minsk .
A climate of fear is being created .
Mr President , speaking of courage , this commendable human quality is certainly one that adorns the Belorussian lawyer Vera Stremkovskaya .
Belarus must not remain a "black hole " on the European map .
Mr President , we are now talking about the situation facing the Roma in Kosovo .
Their situation demonstrates yet again that it is taking far too long to build up the police force .
I would also urge this Parliament to endeavour to develop a coherent approach and to help to find solutions to the problem on account of the sense of responsibility we all share .
I think it is completely unacceptable for any section of the population whatsoever to be disadvantaged and persecuted .
He has certainly been successful in certain parts of former Yugoslavia .
Everyone knows that this tends to be the Serbs .
This will have to include support and a role for the Yugoslav Tribunal , since justice for all concerned is an essential prerequisite to reconciliation between the various population groups .
Of course that just cannot be allowed to happen and is every bit as unacceptable .
I would like , in due course , to hear from the Commission about what kind of European Union regulations are applicable to such shipments .
I would ask you again to see to it that we get a Dutch channel on the television again , just as we used to in the old building next door .
It may not have contained everything we could have wished for but it was still a very honourable compromise and went further than Parliament had been able to manage .
I believe that in this case there is not even an argument for taking such a line , and that we can give our full support - in the firm belief that all formal objections have been resolved - to the proposed texts , so that the fight against fraud will be something to be undertaken not just by others but also by ourselves .
" Road rage " is on the increase , which ought to make any policy maker aware that there is an urgent need for a number of measures to be drawn up and that these must be implemented in all Member States of the European Union with no concessions being made .
In my view , all road-users , regardless of how old they are , need to be made continuously aware that only if they behave properly and courteously on the roads will it be possible to bring about a reduction in the tragically high number of road traffic victims .
I have often noticed that it takes him less than 15 minutes for him to win various people over with his eloquence .
We must know what concerns the public sector and what concerns the private sector .
I feel that the course of action taken by the Council is very much against the spirit of the agreement .
We must pay this money .
The criteria for this are far too opaque to our mind .
Three rapporteurs and many draftsmen of opinions .
I fully support what the rapporteur has to say on financing the reconstruction of Kosovo .
There is less money being invested in conflict prevention .
I do not intend to call the work of these organisations into question here , but I do feel that it is appalling that Parliament is going to have to be drafted in where the granting of individual subsidies is concerned .
Accordingly , my group proposes that we should reduce this tobacco subsidy by 10 % .
The rapporteur proposes that we should go way beyond the ceiling on expenditure on external action .
The rapporteur proposes to incorporate 50 % of outstanding payments into Budget 2000 .
There is no way that we can go along with this attempt at centralism .
Mr President , firstly I would like to give my reaction to the rather na√Øve comments made by Mr Martinez about Kosovo .
Paragraph 57 relates to the allocation of additional posts to OLAF and the Veterinary Office in Dublin .
We have decided most emphatically to restrict ourselves to Category 4 and if she starts on Category 3 then I think we might run into difficulties .
If we were to provide assistance amounting to approximately 50 % of Kosovo ' s GNP - and there is a possibility of this happening if very high estimates are made - then I fear that the inflationary and other consequences for the economy would outweigh the benefits afforded by the assistance .
I would ask the Commissioner to look not just at existing needs but also at the macroeconomic consequences .
But it has since become apparent that bringing about the monetary union of eleven Member States also has its drawbacks .
However , federal states in the US benefit from automatic stabilisers coming into play via the federal budget .
The Liberals are satisfied with the ECB' s report and with the four proposals put forward by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for there to be more transparency in the bank ' s dealings .
Greater openness is a sign of strength and inspires confidence .
