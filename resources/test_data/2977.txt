If we cannot do it any other way , let us send aid by means of the Member States .
On that occasion , I pointed out that , when the hurricane struck , the Commission acted quickly in terms of initial aid .
Madam President , as a Basque MEP , I would like to express my rejection and condemnation of the terrorism and violence of ETA.
Madam President , referring to this document that he mentioned , Mr Ortuondo talks to us about centralism .
Madam President , Parliament knows , because we have said it many times and today we have explained it to some of you , that in presenting and defending an agreement in favour of freedoms and against terrorism in the Basque Country , we are defending and presenting an agreement which goes beyond the merely political field , since it is an agreement in defence of freedoms , in defence of life , in defence of pluralism .
The fact that there are internal problems in Spain resulting from the political differences between the central government and the Basque parliament does not prevent us here in the European Parliament from standing for peace and democracy and against fascism .
I would like you to be more specific , Commissioner .
( The President cut the speaker off )
At the same time we wish to draw attention to education .
What we need , however , is many small projects .
However , I would like to make two observations in relation to the debates which we have held in committee and in our group .
We know what will happen , but we do not know how to prevent it , although we want to prevent it at all costs .
I hope that these reports will help us to find the correct method , but quite honestly I am not convinced they will .
We would like to point out that we should promote the liberalisation of the economic systems of our Mediterranean partners and carry out the structural changes necessary to compete in more open markets .
The issue of North-South relations is spectacularly alive in the Mediterranean .
The two contributions presented here today , in the European Parliament , are contributions to the relaunch of the Euro-Mediterranean policy .
This message must make a genuine contribution to this renewal of the will for integration which , above all in the Maghreb , is a cause for hope at the moment and which must count on an ambitious and also generous contribution from the Union .
The financial instruments are not being used as they should and the political , economic and social development of those countries is not keeping up with the pace of horizontal cooperation , which is very necessary , nor with the modernity required today by a world which , technologically speaking , is taking giant steps forward .
On the other hand - and unfortunately - we must note , however , that sufficient means are not being made available to find an appropriate destination for this aid , since , in the period 1995-1999 , almost 30 % of the budgeted aid was not implemented .
Madam President , I would like very briefly to try to add some more specific elements , from a political point of view , to the speech which the presidency has just made .
Certain significant measures were adopted in relation to Syria .
As the presidency has clearly pointed out , we have seen some truly significant activity since 23 December of last year , and we have all been involved in an enormously active sense .
However , there is still a desire to make progress and to reach a definitive solution on Jerusalem .
Both Jordan and Egypt continue to maintain a firm and determined commitment to trying to find a negotiated and definitive solution .
That is what I can tell you at the moment .
In Taba , both sides acknowledged that they have never been so close to a final agreement , but we must be aware that the apparent euphoria must not make us blind to the real situation .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , from your speech a few minutes ago , it seems that you deserve another title : high representative for hope .
Thirdly , I come to the crucial problems that we must solve if peace is to be restored , as you yourself said Mr Solana : the return of all occupied territories and demolition of all settlements on these territories , Palestinians to have rights to parts of Jerusalem , the possibility of the return of Palestinian refugees , which perhaps causes the biggest headache of all .
We would like to think that this new model will be retained and will deliver better results than its predecessor .
Today this process can be summed up in two affirmations : firstly , we cannot lose sight of our inescapable objective , which is peace in the region , a peace which must be established and consolidated on the basis of an acceptance by all sides of the rules of international law and decisions of the UN Security Council : and , secondly , Europe must once and for all , in attempting to resolve this conflict , assume the responsibility that befits our political influence , our values and our interests .
The horrific earthquakes that have struck El Salvador or India cannot be compared with the situation of frustration and humiliation suffered by the Palestinians at the moment .
Finally , I would like to make a couple of points .
We have seen an enormous amount of suffering .
This is an
