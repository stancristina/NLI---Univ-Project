issue in the debate on the Treaty .
I would like the Commission to explain clearly which public method of hearing will be used to enable the different players - users , trade unions , NGOs , local and regional authorities etc . to make themselves heard during this consultation on the Green Paper .
In its first contribution to the Convention , in May , the Commission itself pointed out how important it is that we have legal bases for services of general interest .
Mr President , the representatives of the Lutte ouvri√®re object to the term 'service of general interest' , for using it to replace the term 'public service ' means abandoning public services and leaving services which are useful to the people to be governed solely by market forces .
Do not fall into the trap of jumping from ideology of 'all state ' to the ideology of 'all market ' .
Secondly , it states that the number of illegal immigrants coming from Hong Kong is very small .
( FR ) We have voted against the resolution on the outcome of the Copenhagen European Council because it uses the fact that most Members clearly approve of the entry into the Union of ten candidate countries from the East to slip in some paragraphs which also approve the accession process for Turkey .
Seen from a historical perspective , achieving enlargement is an issue that lies at the very heart of the European Union .
This is shamefully little , given the structural problems of almost all these countries .
What oil slicks also demonstrate , however , is the complete surrender of their sovereign role by flag States who do not ensure that their ships comply with maritime law .
Most of the 60 million people living beneath the poverty line in the EU are women .
We must therefore give priority to structural projects aimed at promoting forms of transport that respect the environment and probably at giving a greater role to the railways .
I also wish to reiterate the importance of the EU 's environmental policy .
I think that we should take into account the important role of the Convention in this .
Firstly , they are seeking recognition of their handicaps .
Diverse landscapes , high-quality products , 'green lungs' , rare species : mountain regions are and must remain diverse .
I would also like to commend the courage of civilian and international missions , which with no power to intervene but the right to report and observe , are playing a moderating and protective role .
Why should the extreme right-wing powers in Israel be worried by the friendly admonishments from the major powers every now and again when the Israeli army goes beyond certain limits ?
The result of the so-called dialogue that was undertaken is these two death sentences : those of Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup .
We could delude ourselves by saying that the delays are the result of the cumbersome nature of society , and that by repeating principles , the European Parliament will at least be able to be ahead of society .
The American Government , however , has admitted that the United Kingdom took part in aerial attacks in Al Qasidi , Al Kut , Al Basrah , ? ( The President cut off the speaker )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the united Europe , which was embarked on in Copenhagen will be an extremely diverse Europe , first of all in terms of economic and social diversity .
Above and beyond this , generally speaking , the Treaty already provides us with plenty of room for manoeuvre through framework legislation .
Why , therefore , to respond to one of their requests - and this is an option I raised with their president - do we not take inspiration from the positive experience of Article 203 of the Treaty , as intelligent use of this article enabled us to facilitate the participation of these regions in the Council itself ?
That would be impossible to manage .
Even if some have legislative competence , this would not give them greater or additional rights in relation to other regions .
Without wishing to deny that the work carried out by Mrs Swiebel is indeed considerable , I would nonetheless like to be slightly critical of this report , as I feel it has missed its opportunity and might even serve no purpose at all .
Here we have a report which could have been much anticipated by the press and feared by the Member States , which could have served as a beacon to mark our position .
This situation is absolutely intolerable , as is the withdrawal of the university degrees awarded to Jean Plantin over ten years ago .
Each year , however , when we draw up a report on human rights , when we lament the violations that have taken place , when we adopt resolutions , we only talk about third countries .
Specifically , in relation to its examination of the human rights situation , my report , like previous ones , will be based on the structure of the Charter and will highlight certain points which I will treat as my political priorities .
My report on the high-speed network and the conventional network respectively , therefore seeks to make standards more compatible by bringing the two existing directives into line with each other .
One question remains unresolved , namely funding .
I agree that we need to revitalise the rail system .
Furthermore , European Union involvement in railways represents an opportunity for the sector , not a constraint or a threat .
At the same time we are moving in the opposite direction in the rail sector , and saying that policy of dumping at any price and competition at any price is an end in itself
