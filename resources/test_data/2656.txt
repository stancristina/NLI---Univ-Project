on implementing the 'Education and training 2010' work programme because the report includes some very important passages , which I hope can find specific application in the sphere of EU policies and then be implemented in full by the Member States .
I express my support and I congratulate the rapporteur for the sensitivity she has shown in drawing up the report .
I express my support for the report by Mr Lehne .
I therefore believe that it is the duty of European institutions to establish a well-defined strategy that can make the most of existing training and mobility programmes ( such as Comenius , Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci) , while also increasing the correlation between the supply of training , competences and the demands and needs of the labour market , in order to make the necessary transition between vocational and occupational training smoother and more secure .
What kind of prospects await the younger generation ?
There is no point hiding behind good intentions and promises .
The creation of a new EU strategy for youth is of crucial importance .
At last , the European Parliament is expressing an opinion on the application of this principle , so symbolic of social and economic progress !
The assisting spouse is also granted the right to a social protection scheme on demand .
For our small and medium-sized enterprises , this means saving on administrative expenditure and profiting more quickly from the sale of new fibres .
Since it was not a codecision procedure , however , it was not possible to do very much against the opposition of some national governments .
The problem does , however , remain open for textile products coming from third countries , our trading partners .
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Moreira .
I believe that the proposed changes are positive for the outermost areas concerned .
Any measure capable of reducing the administrative procedures and burdens that weigh down agricultural producers - not to mention the local authorities concerned - and that does not compromise quality standards definitely deserves our support .
Farmers , moreover , must no longer spend their days filling in forms and declarations , but tending their fields , and thus supplying better agricultural products that comply with higher standards .
Neither must we underestimate the impact of climatic and environmental factors that are , by their very nature , hard to predict and force the farming world to face new and difficult challenges due to the global changes that are taking place .
For the reasons I have expressed above , I voted in favour of the report .
Public procurement accounts for approximately 18 % of Community GDP , and therefore has a key role to play in relaunching the economy and employment .
The report by Mrs Ranner , whom I congratulate on account of her work , sheds light not only on the differences between fines in different Member States , but also on differences surrounding the types of penalty in highlighting the unsatisfactory nature of this situation for drivers and transport enterprises .
Therefore , I believe it is essential for the Council of Europe and the European Union to consider establishing guidelines , with a clear explanation of all the effects and implications that membership will entail .
Mr President , I have now been speaking in my new capacity for two years .
However , the chosen methods and the results obtained differ between States , and we therefore need to continue working on the implementation of the Small Business Act at national level .
Mindful of the difficulties that small and medium-sized enterprises currently encounter when trying to access finances , the European Commission has closely followed developments in the sector , collaborating particularly with the European Central Bank with the aim of carrying out regular surveys of the situation .
A few days ago , the Commission also organised a high level conference where banks , risk capital funds and small and medium-sized enterprises came together ; a meeting also attended by representatives from the European Parliament .
All this is to confirm to you my personal commitment to ensure that employment in our Union can be defended by offering support to small and medium-sized enterprises .
Some banks engage in financial speculation , but fortunately , we still have a banking network where the manager knows the businessman who goes to ask for credit , and so he can trust him , and also knows that the money he invests will be reinvested in the bank , and that what happened in the United States will not happen here .
The aim of this action is to achieve at least some of these objectives , in the conviction that small and medium-sized enterprises represent the best instrument today for emerging from the crisis and - as I said at the start of my speech - for preventing the economic and financial crisis from turning into a social crisis .
In fact , the problem is , and must be , a European problem , and it cannot be left to the management of certain states .
The Energy Labelling Directive has a crucial role to play in the achievement of the EU energy efficiency target of 20 % by 2020 .

Moreover , it is also fundamental in light of our citizens ' expectations .
Organ transplants are , without a doubt , one of the most positive aspects of progress in the health field but , at the same time , they open up a whole series of problems in terms of donors ' and patients ' rights which must be dealt with from the ethical , social , legal and economic points of view
