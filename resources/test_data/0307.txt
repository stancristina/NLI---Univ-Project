In more practical terms , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the Luxembourg Council must tell us what it intends to do for the decisions taken at the Luxembourg Summit on 20-22 November to be taken into account in the 1998 budget , whose first reading before the European Parliament is due on 21 November .
We wish you good luck in this difficult but exciting task .
The historic nature of this task calls on us , I think , to refrain from taking a grocer-shop approach to the cost of that enlargement .
Mr Poos just referred to the action programme we have with Canada , which will be discussed this evening in Parliament .
It is now high time for those words to be followed up with acts .
We cannot and must not disappoint them !
That is why the 'euro crisis ' is bursting out all over .
I would mention , on this score , the exact geometry of the countries taking part in the euro , the direction to be taken by the exchange policy , the possibility of an economic government for the euro and its position vis-Ã -vis the European Central Bank .
In the European Parliament , we have often heavily criticized my country over this matter .
Mr President , I must thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Van den Broek for the information they have just given us on Albania .
From this point of view I earnestly want the Commission to show more vigilance in the use of the funds which it is mobilizing .
I think I already emphasized in my first reply to the question that these elections represented a first step .
I think you have answered your own question .
Assessment of the proposal is up to the Swedish Government and it is also up to that government to take the necessary measures in order to comply with these requirements .
This delay was designed to enable operators and employees in the sector to find solutions aimed at a 'soft ' conversion to other economic activities .
That is the whole problem .
Those amendments were rejected by the Council , so that conciliation became inevitable .
The mobility of health service personnel , an innovation some 25 years ago , is now going to increase exponentially .
In this case , the various parameters are clear enough .
I think it would greatly enhance the credibility of the European Union if it were to take specific action .
Why did the Commission not demonstrate the courage and lucidity that the public had a right to expect from it since , I would remind you , we are talking about public funds ?
The Commission , which was aware of the situation from 6 October 1995 , did not even undertake a systematic review of all the contracts concluded with the two technical assistance bureaux on which doubt was being cast .
For all those reasons , we support Mr Rosado Fernandes 's report - and , in passing , I pay tribute to his European spirit because he , as a man of the South , has thought of the producers in the North and the need to restore their premiums to the pre-1993 level .
Let us hope that Europe 's citizens will be able to put it to good use and to convince the Council that , undoubtedly , ECU 7 million is too little !
That is a major issue of the present time , and will be a focus of our future industrial development .
The impact of communications , as we well know , is constantly being reduced , and this communication - which is highly dirigistic in some respects - is singularly lacking in legal weight , as the members of the competent committee have very rightly pointed out .
People are being arrested , members of the Funcinpec or the PDLB are being executed , and anyone failing to declare explicit allegiance to Hun Sen is being persecuted .
A lot of hard work will be needed .
That is why we call upon this House to refuse to condemn Tunisia today .
Similarly , someone could explain to our Greek friends that there is a difference between anti-personnel land mines and naval mines , and again it might be appropriate to send a few experts to explain the details .
Most accidents and incidents that occur in air transport occur because of human error .
That 's all very well : the only problem is that it is doing a great deal now that it should have done three years ago .
So I believe that the questions raised by the Commission as to the representivity of its opposite numbers in the dialogue on the Union 's social policy are justified questions .
The justified desire to have a European social law must find expression through a democratic process , which is respectful of diversity and fundamental rights , and of the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization .
Mr President , I think that the production of food products and the capacity for that production should be regarded as a natural asset on the global scale , an asset that should be placed at the disposal of every citizen .
These natural assets should be managed by a body less ossified , as I see it , than the World Trade Organization , whose sole purpose is to run our planet for the benefit of the rich and to the detriment of the poor .
