The structure of the document favours a better definition and ordering of the objectives and scope of the directive .
Many of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading have been incorporated into this text , with the result that it has been noticeably improved .
Mr President , economic arguments have long prevailed in debates on this subject .
We wish here to demonstrate and express our support for the position of the Committee on the Environment because this problem also exists in southern Europe .
We should also leave the matter of maximum values for sulphur emission for negotiation with the Council , during conciliation procedures .
I do not dispute that what we are requesting here implies financial and research efforts by the oil and automobile industries .
Hence , the calculated annual costs of ESC 1 000 per motor vehicle , and ESC 1 800 per diesel vehicle may not even apply , as a result of the technological evolution leading to the production of better cars with lower consumption .
I would also like to emphasize the discrepancy between the position of the European Parliament which advocates a reduction of 25 % by the year 2002 , and the Council 's position which refers to the year 2006 .
While an improvement certainly must be made in environmental quality and its effects on public health , this must be made compatible with time frames which can be achieved on a technical level , and which can never be less than 3 to 4 years for the execution of works .
Finally , it should be emphasized that this company is one of the largest employers in most Portuguese-speaking countries , and its activities constitute an essential component of their respective economies , a fact the European Union must recognize .
During this year in which we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , we should act in harmony in order to render the mechanism of the United Nations itself effective in ensuring that human rights are respected throughout the world .
In addition , we all consider the situation in East Timor to be a priority , with the continued illegal occupation and repression exercised by Indonesia .
Mr President , if I may trespass further on your patience , I would like to draw attention to the presence in this House of our former fellow Member , Mr van Outrive , who worked so hard with us in matters relating to human rights and to whom , with his permission , I would like to extend a special greeting here .
Often , a chorus of small voices carries less weight than a single , stronger voice .
The questions submitted by some of my colleagues to the Council and to the Commission have that positive end in view .
For European agriculture not to use these techniques which are employed by its main competitors would be like taking part in a bicycle race against competitors driving cars .
It appears that this climate of violence is spawning an internal guerrilla movement which could spread to other central African countries such as Rwanda , Burundi or Uganda , causing a renewed upsurge of refugee movement .
This is the only way to obtain an accurate and continually up-dated perception of on-going developments , thereby permitting the necessary adjustment measures to be taken .
Extensive references are made to the supply of cereals under POSEIMA.
In this context , we naturally support the request for a reform of the POSEIMA programme regarding the supply of cereals , and urge that a fair mechanism for fixing cereal import subsidies should be introduced , and that inter-island transport costs should be clearly specified and quantified , as part of a series of amendments which should go hand-in-hand with the necessary allocation of the respective additional funding .
We must do all in our power to condemn this situation , and particularly what is happening to the women of Algeria , Afghanistan , and Timor , so distant and yet so close to our hearts .
They must know that they are not alone .
We express our solidarity towards the victims of this particularly extreme manifestation of discrimination which lends full weight to the designation of this day and to the struggle that gives it meaning .
The collaboration I received and the interest I observed was very gratifying .
But we hear from all sides of so many conferences to be held on the euro and tourism that this initiative by the European Parliament 's Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs has the merit , at least , of bringing to the attention of those in positions of responsibility at all levels that the tourism sector will be one of the first to use the euro .
Although tourism continues to be the most competitive sector in Europe , accounting for 60 % of the world market , its relative position has declined progressively over the last decade .
Thirdly , given the increased competition to which tourist businesses will be subject because of the transparency resulting from being able to express prices in euros , steps should be taken to assist the thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises which account for 95 % of the sector .
The conference and business sectors should be used as a means of attracting tourists and investors to the euro zone .
Mr President , I take this opportunity to extend a warm greeting to you .
Tourism , and some individual tourists , will no doubt receive debatable advantages from the introduction of the euro .
For our part , for these and other reasons , we thank Mrs Torres Marques for her work but have serious reservations regarding her optimism , her " tourism at the service of the euro ' position , and her appeal for the creation of a
