to ensure that men , women and children are born equal and can live as equals , enjoying the fundamental freedoms of human rights .
That is the message that this House must carry to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and I hope everyone in this House will support such an intention .
Madam President , firstly , I wish the Swedish Presidency every success in the knowledge that their success will certainly be Europe 's success as well .
I want to welcome the Swedish Presidency 's presentation here this afternoon as one that appears to be extremely constructive and pragmatic .
I also welcome the comments made by the Commission President , Mr Prodi .
The Swedish government has made it clear that it intends to prioritise what is known as the 3 Es during its presidency of the Union , and this relates to addressing the key problems of enlargement of the Union , employment matters and promoting environmental issues .
I would certainly welcome the intensification of the enlargement negotiations between the applicant countries and the European Union .
We should recall that the accession negotiations are broken up into nearly 40 different chapters of talks , covering every ambit of social and economic activity that is carried out by the European Union .
Presently , many of the more difficult chapters of discussions still remain unopened , and these include agricultural issues , the free movement of persons , the implementation of EU social and employment legislation and the incorporation of many EU directives and regulations in the field of environmental matters .
This is the core of the problem when it comes to the issue of enlargement of the European Union .
Applicant countries want the EU leaders to give a fixed date for the next enlargement of the Union .
However , the EU governments are seeking the conclusion of the more difficult chapters of talks between the applicant countries and the European Union before such a date can be announced .
However , the fact that EU leaders were able to agree a reform of the decision-making procedures within the EU institutions at Nice before Christmas is certainly a step in the right direction .
Applicant countries can now take solace from the fact that the EU has reformed its internal decision-making procedures so that the mechanics of the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner .
I welcome the fact that the Swedish government is going to ensure that employment and environmental matters stay at the top of the agenda during its presidency of the Union .
It is imperative that the European Union guarantees that the benefits of new information technologies are incorporated across all sectors of European industry .
Equally , it is important that there is an intensification of support for employment initiatives in urban and rural blackspots .
Finally , I hope that the European Union and the United States of America can come to an agreement in Bonn in May of this year so as to guarantee that environmental targets to reduce the effects of global warming can be reached .
Mr President , Commissioner , as you heard from our Group chairman earlier in the debate , the EPP visited Berlin last week .
Before leaving , I and some colleagues were able to visit Potsdam where of course the conference took place where President Truman , Prime Minister Churchill - bizarrely replaced by Mr Atley mid-conference - and Marshal Stalin agreed to confirm the Yalta division of Europe .
The Swedish Presidency , as we have heard during the debate , has raised high hopes that we may achieve over the next six months the restoration of a unified Europe , but I believe the time for rhetoric has passed and what we are all looking for now are results .
I wonder if four questions could be transmitted to the Swedish Presidency .
First of all , does it intend to convene a council or a special meeting to which the government representatives of the candidate countries would be invited , not only to facilitate the negotiations , but to give the important signal to the public that enlargement is not merely a political exercise , a mirage , a constantly distant objective , but that we are genuinely making the progress which is required ?
Secondly , could the bureaucratic negotiations be tempered by an understanding of the past ?
It does seem cruelly difficult in a sense that the way the enlargement process is presented is merely a question of conforming to some technical acquis , ignoring , perhaps , the specific difficulties that the Baltic Republics and other Central and Eastern European countries faced under the Soviet system .
With the timetable which we have set ourselves : does the Swedish Presidency agree that this necessitates transitional periods , and , finally , can we confirm that no new hurdles will be placed in the path of the candidate countries .
Clearly today it has been Sweden 's day .
We all very much hope that in six months ' time in Gothenburg , once again , it will not only be Sweden 's day , but Europe 's day .
Question No 3 by (H-0956/00 ) : Subject : Facilities for EU citizens in Mecca In accordance with Article 20 of the EC Treaty , every citizen of the EU is entitled to protection in third countries by the consulate of another Member State if the citizen' s own country is not represented there .
What facilities are provided by the EU for EU citizens in Mecca during the Haj ?
Mr President , I thank the Swedish representative for his reply but it does not satisfy my enquiry .
He is quite right to say that certain types of consular services are provided in Mecca during the Hajj by the UK Government for British Muslims .
