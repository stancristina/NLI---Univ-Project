Investors who invest , who provide funds , are entitled to try to discover the risks or the difficulties that may arise , just as they are entitled to try to discover which ratings are good .
That , Mr President , Commissioner , is the thrust of our questions .
On that note , I should like to say a word about ESMA , this authority that is due to be established shortly .
I also had the opportunity , on 20 April , to speak to you about this issue of credit rating agencies and their importance for the functioning of the economy and of the financial markets .
In other words , when an agency receives information enabling it to work out its credit rating on structured products , the other agencies will have the right to use that information to work out their own rating .
In addition , we will table some legislative proposals at the end of this year or at the very start of 2011 , not only to continue - I am echoing what you said , Mrs Goulard - what was begun by my predecessor with your support , which is being implemented but which is not enough , but also to achieve a greater degree of transparency so as to prevent conflicts of interest and to ensure that these ratings are greater in number , more diverse and , when it comes to sovereign risk , above reproach .
Is it sustainable ?
I , as Commissioner , am not going to start commenting in detail on each rating issued by a given rating agency .
This is a modified directive , which simplifies and clarifies the rules for issuing securities , which supports small and medium-sized enterprises , as Mr Klinz just very properly reminded us , in accessing the capital markets , and which will help to reinforce the internal capital market .
Madam President , may I once again thank each and every speaker for their approval and additional remarks .
The element of supervision was included in the supervision package , the omnibus text , and it is that text that Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo is working on , with other colleagues , while calling on us to demonstrate collective boldness .
This will help to reduce the risks .
Long-term answers involve massive investments in priority sectors , namely education , training , research and innovation , and the 2020 strategy , which will be voted on by this Parliament and , I hope , ratified by the Council .
Ladies and gentlemen , the European project is coming to a moment of truth which requires clear answers to two simple questions .
Look at the current proposals for Europe 2020 , for example .
President-in-Office of the Council , a large number of subjects are currently blocked because of a problem between Parliament , which wants to continue applying the Community method , and the Council , which does not want to go in this direction .
European Earth observation programme ( GMES ) ( 2011-2013 ) ( 4 .
I voted in favour of the draft Council decision authorising enhanced cooperation for 14 European Union Member States , including France , in the area of cross-border divorce .
The draconian application of neoliberal policies advocated by the Commission has already plunged more than 20 % of the Estonian population into extreme poverty .
As reaffirmed by the European Transparency Initiative , citizens have the right to know how their taxes are being spent .
I voted resolutely for the adoption of this text , which not only represents an advance in the area of defence rights , but also an historic adoption , in that it is the first European measure in criminal law adopted under the codecision procedure .
It is no longer acceptable that we can propose an oral translation instead of a written translation .
The first is that a driver who is tired constitutes a danger on the road .
Regulating the working time of self-employed drivers seems to us to be contrary to freedom of enterprise and to the very status of self-employed .
Legislation that is as heavy and as convoluted as this regulatory proposal will not do the consumer any favours .
We must not endanger our wine sector , which is already subject to a detailed regulatory system .
I am very pleased with the result of the vote on the Sommer report .
However , I fear that due to binding commitments made and respected by the Member States , these objectives will not be achieved .
Although monetary policy is united around the euro , unfortunately , each Member State continues to conduct its own economic policy , quite often without taking into account its neighbour 's reforms , or sometimes even 'falsifying ' its public accounts .
It is essential for the European Parliament to reflect in advance on the challenges to come and to draw up its budgetary priorities .
Parliament 's joint resolution condemns the attack and demands an international inquiry and the lifting of the blockade , but tomorrow , Parliament will demand that justice is done .
With whom ?
If we do not do that , there will be no order in the region .
The European Union has implemented a number of instruments in this area , and I am glad that they are examined closely in the report , including in the light of Parliament 's new competences in this area .
We have ruined national rail companies by separating infrastructures and transport services , passengers and freight , operation and safety .
Mr President , I agree with the content and conclusions in the report by my colleague and friend Mr Romeva i Rueda , and I welcome the collective work that has been done on this report .
