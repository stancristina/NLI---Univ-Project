their respective executives .
It is also the case that Mr Costa , in these proposed amendments to the Regulation presented by the Commission , which is now established as a framework Regulation while the contributions made by means of commitology and the application of experience are assessed , has improved – I believe – those aspects that were most necessary : those which introduce the concern and interests of the parties involved , both from the point of view of the Member States and from the point of view of the airlines and airports , and also the aspects which have not yet been dealt with in relation to funding and which are so dear to Mr Costa’s heart , who has made great progress in relation to them .
It seemed natural to the Spanish to overcome our historical backwardness and to allow ourselves to be led by our Europeanism , opting clearly for an integrated system such as the ERTMS , which represents the future of the railways .
We must also guarantee that women participate in the decision-making , representative and advisory bodies of the communities dedicated to inshore fishing .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality calls for greater recognition of the work of these women and for solutions to the specific problems stemming from that work to be found .     .
I do not believe that the agreement adopted in Coreper and which is going to be presented to the Council of Ministers offers all of the measures that this Parliament called for in the Casa report on the European Fisheries Fund ( EFP) , in which there were many more measures which would undoubtedly make the renewal and modernisation of small-scale fisheries much more flexible .     .
Properly regulated inshore fishing is an essential factor in the conservation of the ecosystem .
Afterwards is always too late .     Mr President , we note that there is a problem on the voting list : it suggests that , if Amendment 91 is adopted , Amendment 12 lapses , when in reality they are two complementary amendments , an a ) and a b ) .
Furthermore , it is a much more flexible and open programme than previous ones and it has enthusiastically introduced the humanities , historical heritage and other aspects of culture .
Furthermore , the basic Regulation for this COM allows Member States , in relation to wine-making practices and treatments , to impose stricter national conditions in order to ensure that the characteristics of their quality wines are maintained .
If that had been the case , the Commission on Agriculture and Rural Development may not have chosen to deal with this issue by means of the simplified procedure .
This is clearly not the situation that the international community wanted to see in Timor .
The case of Sonj Nam , who has been tortured and sentenced to death , despite repeated calls for the case to be reviewed with greater guarantees , is just one example of this , as previous speakers have mentioned .
However , we need to use the extensive possibilities offered by the current Treaties .
Diversity , a source of mutual openness and wealth , is the genuine meaning of European unity and a genuine counter-balance to the homogenising tendencies of globalisation .     Mr President , this afternoon the decision will be made as to whether , finally , the citizens of Catalonia , the Basque Country and Galicia will be able to address the European Parliament in their respective mother tongues .
I hope that the letters from the Presidents of the Parliaments of Catalonia and Galicia which have been addressed to the Presidency will help to win the respect and support of those people who have opposed what will be a great step forward in terms of bringing more than 11 million speakers of those languages closer to the European Union .
As the representative of the Commission has said , each national authority is theoretically responsible for supervision , but , when the company collapsed , neither the Irish authorities nor the German authorities were able to do anything , because the company ’s subsidiaries and branches in their respective countries were closed at that point .
In some European countries their participation is equivalent to around a third of their savings and in others a fifth .
This is a time of very significant changes .
I would call upon the Commission and the European Parliament , before taking the measures proposed , to carry out a study of their economic impact on all regions and to pay particular attention to regions with structural disadvantages due to natural , geographical and permanent conditions , as in the case of the islands .     .
With regard to access to information , perhaps the most important thing is the agreement reached on the basis of Regulation 1049 .
We are all aware of the origin and the raison d’être of the European Union , which is founded upon the same moral strength as that Spanish Constitution , the moral strength of people joining together , the moral strength of unity , so that our recent past will not repeat itself , so that no more world wars will emerge on European soil , no more wars , no more dictatorships , no more communist regimes and no more civil wars like the one we suffered in Spain .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , following the discussions in the Council last December on the financial perspective and now on the Regulations on the funds , we have begun to fear that certain governments wish to call into question the most visible and successful of the European policies : the cohesion policy .
