Despite this , since for a variety of financial reasons some ceiling has to be set , this ceiling should cover present actual production by our cotton growers , the system of aid should be maintained , institutional prices of cotton should be adjusted in the light of official data concerning average Community inflation between 1995 and 2000 , aid should be paid directly to cotton producers through their cooperative associations , without the intervention of private ginning undertakings , after studying the most suitable procedure , and Annex B of the regulation , which determines increases and reductions in the minimum producer price on the basis of quality characteristics , should be included in the new regulation .
We want to call on Parliament to stand by the side of farmers so that people stay in the countryside and so that , at the end of the day , our farmers can survive .
Another point worth noting in the case of the subject at issue is the fact that Community cotton production falls far below its actual requirements , barely covering around 35 % of demand .
The report finds a way round this in a compromise proposal - a judicious , moderate , perfectly realistic proposal - calling on the Commission to recognise this state of affairs by introducing national guaranteed quantities of unginned cotton of 1 200 000 tonnes for Greece , 350 000 tonnes for Spain and 1 500 tonnes for each of the other Member States .
We therefore need to : increase the guaranteed quantity , so that it matches actual production .
The Commission has a serious responsibility here , because the 1989 restrictive support measures started in essence in 1996 , with certain exceptions for programmes which had already begun .
With shocking cynicism , the rapporteur proposes full liberalisation of the market and deregulation .
Labour relations are being dismantled , the social security system is under threat and the working classes are being condemned yet again to poverty and social exclusion , allegedly in order to increase employment .
It is contradictory , ironic , hypocritical and provocative to workers to propose that the way to combat unemployment is to strengthen the competitiveness of companies through reduced labour costs , full liberalisation and flexibility of the labour market and atypical forms of work .
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report .
I appreciate the fact that , for the first time , Mr Solana appeared not as the evil oracle from Euripides ' ancient Greek tragedy Iphigenia , but as the good oracle .
In this sense , because stability , development and cooperation must be our prime considerations , this is the basic thrust of this motion .
This motion , which defines a wide framework which can be used as a political framework for the next round of developments in the area , gives us the prospect of doing so and we should all support it .
And that is not all , this decision by the Opera harps back to an age when the sciences and arts were only open to men and it is an insult to all female artists and scientists .
( The President cut the speaker off )
The first concerned the bombings in Iraq .
I read a report in the press about an unacceptable pre-election intervention by the High Representative of the CFSP , Mr Solana , in connection with Moldavia ; taking account of the results of the election - in which the people of Moldavia voted freely and gave a huge majority to the Communists - I wished to raise the question of this unacceptable stand .
Mr President , the quantum leap made in telecommunications over recent years might , under different circumstances , have brought about a commensurate improvement in everyone 's quality of life .
As a result , the whole telecommunications sector , which was once a public-sector service and which was developed using public funds , has already been handed over to the private sector .
This being the case , the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the directives .
The very same members who are passionately in favour of extending the European Union to Turkey , which occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus 25 years ago and continues to occupy it 25 years later .
It is disgraceful , having two sets of standards , two yardsticks .
The subject matter of this report is , as I am sure you realise , a real hot potato which has divided public opinion in numerous Member States of the European Union .
Rightly or wrongly , I do not intend to go into this now , but that is the fact of the matter .
Obviously , I agree that safety has absolute priority over profitability and supply and that the nuclear industry must strictly abide by international transport regulations .
First , the report stresses that the European Union should make an effort to reduce the volume and distance that radioactive material is transported .
Having legislation is not enough ; it must be complied with .
This , too , is highlighted in the report .
It responds to the needs of all sides , while remaining within the bounds of the possibilities and balances offered by the common agricultural policy .
The dates on which the current regime expires have been brought into line with the deadlines agreed in Berlin .
The highest level of export refunds allowed by the WTO is the 2000-2001 level .
So we are delighted to give our support to the Daul report .
In order to avoid the social tensions which directly applying such pioneering measures would provoke , the Commission 's chosen method is to apply them gradually , until such time as they can all be applied , without respite
