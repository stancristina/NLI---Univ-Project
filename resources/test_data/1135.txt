or - worse - to fraud , it is the duty of Parliament to correct them .
We must also make sure that we find a mechanism within this system to make sure that we take account not only of the reports that are submitted by members of the Budgetary Control Committee , but also those by members of other parliamentary committees .
In postponing the discharge , we have set out clear points that we expect the Commission to act upon .
Never again will we accept the situation where we cannot get to the bottom of a case , because documents have gone missing .
Clear lines of responsibility must be established so that if problems occur , disciplinary action will follow .
Never again will we accept a situation where misconduct or a bad administrator will be judged by his or her peers .
We expect an external element to be included , as advised by the Committee of Independent Experts .
These are just two examples of how the Commission can improve its act in the short term without waiting to implement all the recommendations of the White Paper .
There is a question to answer as to whether the current Commission should or can take responsibility for the mistakes and problems of the past Commission .
Let us not forget that here we are considering the discharge for 1998 .
If we took this to its logical conclusion , it would mean that Parliament could only judge a sitting Commission during three years of its tenure .
That is why it is clear that we must address systems failures rather than attack individuals or individual Commissioners who may no longer be involved .
We do not want witch-hunts .
We want answers as to how best we spend European taxpayers ' money .
I would like to turn very briefly to the other reports that we have considered in committee , and first of all to the Kuhne report on the European Parliament .
Mr Kuhne has done an excellent job as rapporteur for the Parliament discharge .
There is no doubt that there have been vast improvements in Parliament 's performance .
Our financial control system does not have the quantity of payments that the Commission has and therefore things are more manageable .
We have had everlasting problems , of course , with the buildings , often through no fault of our own but because decisions have been imposed on us by the Council .
If the Council had any concern about budget control , we certainly would not be sitting in this building right now .
There has been a great deal of talk about a report on political group expenditure .
The fact is that our committee has not seen this report .
It has still not been published officially , and therefore it is difficult for us to comment on it .
But transparency is a principle that we must hold dear in this context .
I am delighted that Mrs RÃ¼hle has done such a great job on the EDF report .
Mr Mulder has done a great job as well , displaying his usual wizardry with the EAGGF accounts .
We support Mr Casaca in his approach , although we did not expect the Commission to support us on that of course .
We certainly do not expect the Council to support our position on the Casaca Report .
We are voting for postponement on many accounts .
The important reports , of course , will come next .
We hope that we will be able to develop a better approach in the next part of this discharge procedure .
It is important that we find a new way of doing it .
Thank you , Mr President , for all your kind support over the years for the Budgetary Control Committee .
It is always greatly appreciated .
Mr President , a few years ago discharges in this House used to be perfunctory debates , certainly not held on Tuesday mornings .
But we now have a wider remit to discuss this subject . and over the last few years it has been realised that discharge is a very important part of the life of the European Union .
Under Article 276( 2 ) , the EC Treaty requires the Commission to submit to Parliament any necessary information on the execution of expenditure and operation of the financial control systems .
Article 276( 3 ) of the Treaty requires the Commission to take all appropriate steps to act on Parliament ' s observations concerning execution of expenditure .
It should not be any surprise to outside observers , or those in the system , that as Parliament has become more authoritative in ensuring the democratic accountability of the institutions , it will not be simply fobbed off with a lack of reply to questions which have been asked , however far they go back into the past .
I congratulate all the rapporteurs on the discharges before the House this morning .
I have a few comments on Mr Kuhne ' s and Mrs Stauner ' s reports .
Firstly , on the question of the Parliament discharge .
There has been significant progress on a number of issues outstanding but it is clear from Mr Kuhne ' s report today that there are still a number of issues to be clarified : the question of the calls for tender ; the issue of the financing plan for buildings ; the question of the security service for this House here , and not least the question which is raised under paragraph 15 of the Kuhne report , concerning personnel policy .
Here it states and I quote : "deplores most strongly the residual impression left by these cases , whereby it would appear that favouritism plays a significant role in the granting of appointments to high-grade posts within the administration of Parliament "
