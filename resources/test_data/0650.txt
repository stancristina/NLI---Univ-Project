( EL ) The EU may have tried to create the impression at the ?U-Latin America Summit that it is different from the USA , but there is little to choose between them .
In addition , it clearly supports government anti-grass roots measures in Argentina and fears that it will break its IMF fetters .
The EU has nothing to offer the people of Latin America , given that there is not one area in which it counterbalances the USA .
In an attempt to turn the situation around , the report proposes reducing the budget for the first pillar on the basis of "eco-conditionality " criteria , in other words , using ecological pretexts to cut subsidies and transfer headings to the second pillar in order to maintain budgetary prudence .
We shall vote against the report and stand by small and medium-sized farmers in their fight to overturn everything which the rapporteur takes as given and tries to put a spin on and the anti-farming policy which is wiping out and bankrupting European farmers with mathematical precision .
Shipowners in the port were seen directing the attack by the special forces and several dozen injured people were treated as common criminals , just for defending their basic rights .
Mr President , despite a few positive points , this motion to amend the Rules of Procedure basically represents yet another restriction on Members ' rights and powers of speech .
Now there is a motion to abolish the urgent and topical procedure , to make it even harder to set up political groups , to extend the system of voting on reports without debate in plenary , to prevent small groups from tabling amendments which garner less than 10 % of the vote in committee and to prevent groups from tabling amendments which ...

I should also like to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for adopting almost all the proposals tabled by the Committee on Culture .
Our committee feels that measures to prevent and combat social exclusion in education and culture must be firmly anchored in the public sector .
It also calls for measures to be taken to combat illiteracy , ensuring a mastery of the mother tongue and the learning of other languages .
As the Committee on Culture points out , we need to implement specific actions in the fight against social exclusion if we are to make any headway before we next address this issue .
First and foremost , this draft report reaffirms the political will to take combined action against exclusion at European Union level expressed at previous summits .
Indeed , the more vociferously we clamour for an integrated approach , the greater our responsibility to overcome the obstacles to implementing it .
Generally speaking , although the different Member States are trying to move away from political measures scattered across various sectors and towards an integrated approach , suitable mechanisms are lacking and the agencies responsible appear unwilling to get their act together .
That is the only way we shall increase our credibility in the fight against social insecurity , which is one of the main reasons the far-right is gaining in popularity .
We do not want , during the second design stage of national plans to combat exclusion , to have to spend yet more time on the basic challenges of and principles behind non-exclusion policies ; we want to examine the measures needed to convert all these principles into operational plans , the success rate of the new methods and the potential for monitoring specific added value .
The debate has clearly illustrated how important it is for us to work together on all three basic policies , economic policy , employment policy and social policy , that is , how important this isosceles triangle is if we are to have balanced results in all the Member States and in the European Union as a whole .
In Europe we are talking about relative poverty but , still , we should not forget that over 65 million people in Europe are dangerously close to the poverty line , nor should we overlook the wider issue of exclusion defined by new demands in the information society .
The second question is : can the European Union act - under the Treaties and by dividing responsibilities at European and national level ?
But I am certain that , by applying the method of open coordination , which does not impose legal frameworks , we have already reaped important initial results .
Countries which have never had national action plans are now presenting organised national action plans .
I think that your report has a specific contribution to make and there are a number of points , the most important points , on which I completely agree and it is these points , I think , that should be discussed at the round table scheduled for October , during the Danish Presidency .
During the Danish Presidency , we shall be evaluating national action plans on poverty to date and discussing preparations for future plans , as I said , at the round table in October .
Of course , we must not forget the very important work carried out - and which will continue during the second half of the year - on the subject of indicators , following approval of the initial 18 indicators at the Laeken Summit last December .
( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we shall , I think , wrap up the parliamentary procedure to establish a European Maritime Safety Agency .
Finally , it demanded that the evaluation report on the agency 's activities be carried out by external experts .
The new elements introduced by the Council in the proposal for a regulation include the rewording
