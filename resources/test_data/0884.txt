indeed help to prevent the disease from spreading .
Parliament’s procedure for approving the Commission now has a framework of standards establishing greater fairness in the Commissioner-designate hearings in the parliamentary committees and greater consistency in the final assessment , which is currently overseen jointly by the Conference of Presidents and the Conference of Committee Chairs .
As you are aware , the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats was not keen for this debate to take place this evening .
I feel that the Commission will make use of that precedent , and Mr Frattini can rest assured that Parliament , for its part , will also make use of it .
Although they introduce some improvements to the regulation proposed by the Commission , Parliament’s proposals do nothing to tackle the market stranglehold that the practice of patenting drugs confers on the multinational pharmaceutical corporations , which is the key issue at stake here .
Although I feel that we have yet to find ideal solutions , I applaud the efforts made in the proposal for a resolution before us .
The report covers a range of measures aimed at preventing human infection , and we accordingly voted in favour .     .
These considerations aside , I trust that the Commission and the Council will take due heed of the adopted proposals to protect public health .     .
I therefore voted in favour of the report .     .
Attempting to impose such a restriction on the new Member States when two countries , Denmark and the UK, have an opt-out clause and another , Sweden , has decided not to join , is tantamount to discrimination .
I also welcome the fact that , in this specific case , this includes cross-border neighbourhoods outside the EU.
The regulation on the introduction of the euro has proved to be a sound legal framework during the change-over period in the context of the adoption of the euro as a single currency in all current euro area countries .
The original idea behind establishing a minimum rate was to create a band with a maximum rate that would be harmonised to a single rate of VAT throughout the Community .
The majority has sought to pull the wool over people’s eyes , by asserting that development can only happen by liberalising trade , within the framework of the capitalist onslaught , when in fact what has happened is that poverty has become worse , along with inequality around the world , a trend that will only get worse , as the United Nations Development Programme has warned , if we continue further down the current path of liberalisation policies .
While it would be unwise to sing along to their tune , we also need to understand the origin of that discontent , because politics cannot be done by turning one’s back on reality .
Only an unhealthy obsession with federalism and neoliberalism would lead Parliament’s majority to persist with this idea , even after the defeats in France and the Netherlands blocking the adoption of the so-called European Constitution .
Community measures covering competitiveness in the area of maritime transport must take account of the appearance of new maritime nations , such as China , Korea and Taiwan .
It should be borne in mind that , were this measure to end suddenly , prices could rise .
On this occasion , the US multinational has just announced the closure of one of its units , the Linhó cable-making factory , which had employed 1 200 people and is now pressuring the remaining 300 to take redundancy .
Once again , a mindset has taken hold that oddly views every concession as a victory , in reference to each increasingly damaging proposal .     .
The promotion of equal opportunities is a crucial factor in achieving a more cohesive , competitive and dynamic society , and a means of reaping the benefits of diversity .
Workers are currently facing a concerted onslaught against their social rights and gains – an onslaught that is promoted at EU level by means of awareness-raising and propaganda , and by means of the containment measures that are put forward – and the actual impact of the capitalist onslaught will be felt .
The EU now has legislation in the field of combating discrimination , yet many citizens do not know that such legislation exists or know little about it .
I have always feared that promoting international years or days for one cause or another might in fact have a detrimental effect , in that they only succeed in offloading ignorance of the problem onto other days and years .
These proposals are aimed at extending to Denmark the provisions of the Eurodac system and the procedure for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application .
The activities of the different fleets of the Member States operating under the fisheries agreements and protocols between the EU and third countries should not be interrupted for administrative reasons , such as the lengthy negotiations and the legal ratification procedures to which those agreements are subject .
I welcome the report before us for two reasons .
The goodwill and good intentions underpinning the programme under discussion are naturally worthy of my support .
I voted in favour of this report , which forms part of a balanced approach to environmental protection , consumer protection and the promotion of energy efficiency .
The final proposal acknowledges the key role that the public sector can play in this area , for example by setting up energy efficiency pilot projects , awarding public contracts , establishing energy efficiency criteria and , in its investments , offering incentives for meeting energy efficiency improvement targets .
In areas such as this , the emphasis should , to my mind , be placed on efficiency and common sense .
