I refer not only to the jobs linked to cultivation of the crops , but also to jobs dependent on the processing industry , jobs in the service industries and in general to the wealth created in rural areas .
Before I conclude , I should like to call on the Commissioner to provide a clear explanation of the importance of Community cotton production in the global market .
When all is said and done , the fundamental objective of agricultural aid is to provide people in rural areas with a reasonable income .
I put a specific question to the Commission yesterday and received a reply today .
I believe the Commission does actually know this .
Commissioner , producers are up in arms in Extremadura , the region I represent .
Despite all of this , there is now a proposal for total decoupling of the most labour-intensive CMO.
The war amounted to a confrontation between ethnic groups .
A delegation from the Committee on Development and Cooperation visited Burundi between 22 and 27 June of last year .
The last of the AMIB soldiers arrived in Burundi last Sunday .
The programme also aimed to facilitate justice and reconciliation .
We also encourage neighbouring countries to support the peace process in Burundi .
This compromise was based on three key ideas , which have been this Parliament’s banner over the last ten years : achieving greater democracy , achieving greater efficiency and achieving greater transparency .
And we said this at the last meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference , and it has been accepted by the Italian Presidency as well and , while I was preparing this speech , Mr President , I received a note from the Ansa agency in which Mr Tremonti , President-in-Office of ECOFIN , says , and I will read in Italian : [ We believe it is essential that the text prepared by the Convention should be approved just as it is] .
We therefore believe to be timely , and we welcome , the proposal the Commission is making with this Regulation , which amends and updates those which have been in force up until now .
Throughout these long months of parliamentary negotiation we have held talks with numerous governments involved , with their ambassadors here in Brussels , and with many , many NGOs which work both in Asia and Latin America .
The Socialist Group supports the existence of two differentiated regulations out of coherence with a long journey which is now culminating ; because we believe that Latin America and Asia deserve to be treated at least equally with the other developing regions and , in this regard , both political representatives and representatives of civil society of the two regions have demonstrated to us their desire for their own regulations and programmes ; because we are convinced that the benefits for the populations of both regions , the ultimate objective of the regulations , will be much greater than the administrative difficulties the Commission is afraid of at the end of the day , these difficulties will be limited to a healthy division into two of the current ALA Committee and a reallocation of staff ; and finally , because we profoundly respect our own legislative capacity .
As Mrs Sauquillo said , in order to be coherent with the existing budgetary requirements and also in order to give Latin America and Asia the same treatment as other regions and , therefore , to prevent any form of discrimination .
I wanted to refer to the comment made by Mr Wijkman with regard to the votes by means of which the Committee on Development and Cooperation’s proposal was approved , which were 26 in favour and 2 abstentions .
Nevertheless , the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport voted on and rejected the amendments by the Committee on Budgets on these two aspects , using the argument that it contradicted the other elements of the report .
Returning to substance of the proposals , I would like to focus on two aspects : co-financing and degressivity , which are the issues that have raised most problems .
I would like to stress that it was not a question of seeking harmonisation , but of applying that principle of equal treatment .
I will refer firstly to the report on the youth programme and I would like to say that I believe it to be very positive because it proposes , amongst other things , bringing the European Union 's institutions closer to young people , and I believe that this is absolutely correct because we must not forget that they are the future of Europe and it is they who must know us best .
I would like to point out that in this very Parliament we recently approved a resolution on the European Union 's information and communication strategy , and that Recital N stated that immigration policy and respect for human rights were considered a priority within the Union’s information policy , and furthermore called on the Commission to make its offices in the countries in which immigration originates partly an antenna for informing these countries of the means for legal access to Europe and of the dangers involved in illegal immigration .
These levels will reach their peak when , at the beginning of 2004 , the European arrest warrant enters into force , if things go to plan and despite certain difficulties which appear to remain in certain Member States .
And , although the idiosyncrasies of each European society and their own legal cultures must be seen as reasons for this resistance , it is also the case that the criminal process is a system which imposes limits on the State , which is a measure of the quality of that State in terms of the Rule of Law and respect
