, Mr Vendrell .
A number of EU Member States are making valuable contributions to this work .
The Council is also alert to the large need for aid of various kinds which has been highlighted on many sides of this Chamber and which is perhaps greater than first assumed , partly because of the large number of refugees who have returned .
Aid is also an important tool in our efforts to strengthen the transitional government at the expense of the local warlords .
Finally , the issue of the situation of women in Afghanistan was raised on quite a few sides of the Chamber .
As Mrs Izquierdo Rojo said , it is a question of replacing burkas with driving licences .
Commissioner Patten will no doubt also say a little about this .
In an overall assessment of the situation in Afghanistan and of the efforts by the international community , it is important to keep a sense of proportion .
As many have pointed out , there are serious problems in Afghanistan today .
Compared with the situation less than a year ago , the conditions under which ordinary Afghans live have improved no end .
In view of the circumstances , there was reason to fear the worst .
Thousands of Europeans , soldiers , police , emergency aid workers and officials are now making invaluable efforts to help Afghanistan get back on its feet .
Many had to lose their lives .
On the contrary , we owe it to them to point out the major results that have been achieved .
Only very few are obtaining asylum in our countries , because it is now safe in Afghanistan , in any case in large areas of the country .
In this connection , it is a question of acting in accordance with the declaration from the Seville Summit and making vigorous efforts to facilitate repatriation .
That is something we owe to Afghanistan and to those people who are now taking the courageous step of returning .
Since its first summit six years ago , ASEM has been characterised by ever broader and more fruitful cooperation in a range of areas of common interest to Europe and Asia .
The number of meetings has also increased .
There are more than two billion people living in the ASEM countries .
The Asian ASEM countries form the EU 's second largest trading partner .
A successful summit at the end of this month is therefore a high priority for the Danish EU Presidency .
These are : 1 ) political dialogue , 2 ) economic cooperation and 3 ) social , cultural and educational issues .
Moreover , the forthcoming summit will include , as an innovation , an informal breakfast debate under the heading , ' Dialogue Between Cultures and Civilisations ' .
The idea is that the political dialogue should be based on the new international situation following 11 September , and it will involve a debate on the new challenges we face in terms of security policy .
It is first and foremost a question of how , in the context of ASEM cooperation , we can unite in combating international terrorism , as well as other transnational threats such as the drugs trade , money laundering and illegal migration .
Among the matters to which we must attach importance are the fight against poverty and better access to education .
The political dialogue traditionally involves an exchange of opinions about development in the two regions .
Other subjects might include EU enlargement and the development of cooperation under ASEAN+3 .
The current efforts to promote trade , investment and economic cooperation may , for example , be continued by working towards the implementation of the objectives formulated in the two ASEM economic action programmes , the Trade Facilitation Action Plan ( TFAP ) and the Investment Promotion Action Plan ( IPAP ) .
It will be natural to use the ASEM process to add momentum to the Doha Development Round .
In light of the results achieved in the Doha Round , there will be the possibility of strengthened regional cooperation with a view to achieving further progress in the economic relations between the EU and the Asian ASEM partners .
ASEM 's efforts to break down barriers to trade and investment are based on proposals from high-ranking private sector business leaders via the Asia-Europe Business Forum ( AEBF ) whose tasks include that of helping improve trade relations between Asia and Europe .
In the third main area - that of social , cultural and educational issues - the general theme will be that of measures for combating the unintended consequences of globalisation .
One objective is to ensure that economic growth is reflected in progress in the social sphere that will go on to form the basis for social stability .
The discussions during the third work session will also relate to environmental issues and include a discussion of the ASEM partners ' opportunities for consolidating and developing cooperation in the environmental sphere , partly in the light of the Johannesburg summit .
By , as it were , building bridges between the European and Asian cultures and civilisations , ASEM is a forum well suited to the dialogue that is necessary in the fight against international terrorism 's attempts to split the international community .
The subjects might well be the significance of education in the efforts to promote understanding of other cultures and civilisations , the importance of equal access to information and significance of closer contacts between the nations of Europe and Asia .
I have noted with great interest the observations and recommendations by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , contained in the European Parliament 's report of 16 July 2002 on the Commission Communication on a Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships between Europe and Asia
