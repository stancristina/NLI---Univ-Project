We should give it our support .
It is to be hoped that Sweden and Denmark will agree .
Finland is a pioneer in the construction of the information society .
They thus make it possible to bring the benefits of the information society to remote areas and people who , owing to disability or some other restriction , could not otherwise access the information sources they need .
Because of this , Finnish universities are the first in the world to have linked up to a high-speed telecommunications network .
The only problem is that links within Europe are not fast enough .
The information society is a lot more than just fast communications links ; nevertheless , without fast connections people 's patience runs out .
To improve equality and cohesion it is time for Europe to invest in good , fast communication links within the Union and throughout our continent generally .
The confidence of the public and that of the national organizations has gone , and , though we may find a quick solution , the damage is going to take time to repair .
It is most important and necessary that a quick solution be found and that this code of conduct be implemented .
Can you assure us that the Council will in this case now approve this joint agreement and give it a legal basis ?
Can you give us a guarantee of that ?
Mr President , cities are too often seen in terms of black and white , either as places for the rich and privileged , or as problem areas .
Last year it was emphasized at summit conference level , no less , how Europe 's immense unemployment problem needs to be brought under control .
The spill-over effect will mean that prosperity will spread out of the cities to other regions .
Although 80 % of EU citizens live in urban areas , over half the Union budget still gets spent in rural areas .
It is easy to muse that the EU is one big rural project that ignores urban areas and urban folk alike .
Although the details contained in urban policy are ultimately the province of decision-makers in individual countries and regions , as they should be , the European Union has its own important duty to solve in particular problems that are common to all .
One unfortunately good example of urban environmental problems is the collection of waste and recycling .
Mr President , first I would like to congratulate Mrs Napoletano on a very successful report .
That is why different forms of residents ' and local democracy should be investigated and developed , and there should be greater possibilities for keeping residents informed and for them to get involved , for example , by making use of new technology .
We support with particular warmth the report 's proposed insistence on getting women involved in urban development .
Women consider the smooth flow of the working day more important than the monumental outward appearance of buildings .
Mr President , in the European Union , theory and practice differ in many matters .
Here , all our excrement gets directed untreated into the River Samme , which takes it untreated into the River Schelde , which takes it untreated into the North Sea .
According to the reply I got from the Commission to a written question , Brussels is breaking the terms of Directive 91/271/EEC , and Article 17 , in particular .
It is going on under the Commission 's very own nose .
Brussels is an environmental disaster when it comes to urban policy .
I should like to look more closely at points 13 and 14 .
Only afforestation , which concerns reverting arable land to forest or rough pasture , might possibly fall within the European Union 's sphere of activity , as might activity that sets out to prevent erosion or desertification .
At the same time , it calls on the Commission to make special proposals to enhance sustainable agriculture by developing regulations for good agricultural practice as well as functional standards for the environment and production .
I believe point 14 places too much faith in administration and bureaucracy , indeed in rules that extend to regional policy .
It is impossible to imagine that the Commission would be capable of drafting good agricultural policy for every nook and cranny of Europe .
Why should the Commission be trying to decide details such as this ?
The basic prerequisite of the common agricultural policy is a respect for the principle of subsidiarity .
Putting these into practice and monitoring the result are mainly the responsibility of the Member State .
This has worked well , as the Member State has had both the functional and economic responsibility .
It is the question of the possible continuation of dutyfree sales which interests the ordinary citizen .
At that time , Finland and Sweden , for example , were not members of the European Union .
Ending duty-free will sever this connection .
Secondly , ending duty-free will create unemployment . 40 000 people in the Union and 13 000 in Finland will lose their job .
The one hand does not know what the other is doing .
There might be a spurious element of prestige in it for the Commission and Ecofin .
But how high will the port costs be that Tallinn will levy in that case ?
Mr President , we must agree with the position of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and others that problems caused by the ending of duty-free sales should have been discussed in connection with this present topic for discussion .
I will take the liberty of wondering out loud how difficult it will be to effect and conduct proper discussions on the subject .
The EU should not be making decisions that run counter to this aim .
Finland is an island as seen from
