Not only will consumers receive far more information , but they will also , via the development of the internal market , be able to take full advantage of better pricing .
As far as the legal basis is concerned , I have always taken the view that a regulation , thanks to the swifter entry into force and its direct applicability , is a much more effective legal instrument than a directive .
In addition , it is already a commonly used form of legislation in our Community legislation .
( NL ) There are various reasons why the Deva report has not received my support .
There is particular room for improvement in measurability and reporting .
On the other hand , I do not share the rapporteur 's optimism about ethical investments by entrepreneurs and about the contribution of trade liberalisation to development , because the cheap acquisition of resources in the developing world remains an important ambition for many entrepreneurs .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is right to want to recycle at least 65 % of the weight , completely ban the use of lead , cadmium , mercury or hexavalent chromium from 2007 and to subject new packaging material to stricter requirements from 2004 .
This should also apply to military air traffic , which , particularly in France , is still able to occupy an unacceptably large part of the airspace .
This means that each airspace block can end up with a different company , although in the long run , a near-monopoly is bound to emerge and will control the lion 's share of the airspace .
( NL ) Transport links with countries outside Europe mean that means of transport which do not comply with our environmental and safety requirements are travelling on our roads , in our ports and in our airspace .
A better part of the proposal is the idea that farmers should grow more leguminous and oil-producing plants as part of a crop rotation system .
This new proposal , the Fifth Directive , does not infringe the fundamental principle of tariff freedom .
Its main purpose is to revise the four existing directives on motor insurance .
You correctly stated that the Commission was aiming to abolish the Belgian no-claims bonus system and move towards a free tariff structure .
Mr President , Commissioners , a couple of brief comments .
Mr President , I think that the Commission has made a laudable attempt at achieving greater continuity and coherence , but please allow me to say that I do not think the attempt goes far enough towards the optimum goals .
My fellow MEP Stephen Hughes has already commented on this in the context of the Ecofin Council .
I wonder whether the Commissioner understands our preference for preventive action over ex-post appeals to national or other competition authorities .
On behalf of the Commission I should now like to address those four aspects .
I am happy to clarify , though , that the study which the Commission has promised to carry out into selling below cost will take proper account of the consequences of deregulation for SMEs .
Amendments Nos 20 , 21 and 22 tabled by Mrs Patrie and Mr Lehne are now redundant since the link between taking part in a promotional game and the sale of a product is no longer possible .
Finally , I should like to inform Mr Fiori that the Commission certainly agrees that the opportunity to obtain redress must be used as quickly as possible , but the Commission thinks that in most cases this is best done by the promoter itself .
The same may also be true of other committees .
We can see that now and realise the far-reaching consequences .
Many different regulations , varying requirements and conditions , masses of provisions and long texts create a forest of rules .
After all , aid is granted only when necessary and when justified by the circumstances .
I am sure that greater flexibility and structural reforms will not suffice to solve these problems .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , you know that this report has been unanimously accepted without amendments .
The Spanish Presidency has selected violence against women as one of its priorities .
This parent becomes over-protective and exerts too much discipline .
I should also like to stress just how important Daphne is .
It requires a six-year programme containing initiatives to be taken and the instruments to be used for each initiative , such as legislation , open coordination or negotiations between social partners , and deadlines for the completion of these initiatives .
I would therefore advise the Commission to ensure that it submits its next report by the end of December , so that a useful dialogue with Parliament can be organised .
Mr President , it is time - it is now even urgent - that Mr Patten took over from Mr Blair .
In the current confusion about the West 's attitude towards Iraq , I should like to ask the Council a few questions and make some suggestions at the same time .
The launch of a European peace proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is simply incompatible with tolerating a sponsor of Palestinian terror .
But that requires that we speak with one voice and take a clear stand .
It could be very detrimental if we unilaterally adopted the same stance in the Middle East , but we can also use this stance to enlist support for a new peace initiative along with the US.
It was striking how unanimous our group was , and Mr Hans-Gert Poettering 's outline fits in perfectly with this debate .
It appears that Europe does not have all the information that the Americans have .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of
