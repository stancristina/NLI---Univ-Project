we need is the analytical resources : these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital .
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them .
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented , farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly , which resulted in their depopulation .
The present CAP , however , is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis , granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy .
This is because the 15 % increase is nominal and not real , granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2 % .
The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up , to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences .
For our part , we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes .
Commissioner , this morning President Prodi , among others , stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively , the very credibility of the European Union is on trial , and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed .
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting .
But if we are to secure the public ' s participation in this new planning , we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century .
I thank the Commissioner , and do not at all question his intentions and interventions , which adopted a positive line .
In the Sunday papers all over Greece : the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund : the Minister ' s work ; the Ministry of Agriculture : the Minister ' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications : the work of the Minister for Telecommunications ; the Ministry of Education : the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister ; the Ministry of Employment : the work of the Minister for Employment , a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary , and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework .
Will the Commission remain silent ?
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them , because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes .
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place , the specifications common to us all must be very stringent .
Mr President , first of all , we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water , but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia , aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded , have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too , making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous .
In that spirit , we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos .
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water , and that should be taken into account by this directive .
In addition , amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage .
An important element of LIFE-Nature , which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network , is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities , so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity .
In the second , LIFE-Environment strand , which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies , the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed .
Besides , we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work , which is the reason why there is broader agreement , and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution .
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection .
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken .
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems , the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States , I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion .
As many of the speakers have said , I believe a first important step has been taken .
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation ' s treaties .
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties : the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations , performances and phonograms .
Even though , as the Commission says , the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development , it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created , performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives
