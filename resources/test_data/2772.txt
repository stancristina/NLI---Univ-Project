be decided undemocratically , even in the future ?
I feel myself to be Dutch through and through , and I wish to stay that way , but our only guarantee of security and prosperity is to be together with the rest of Europe .
I should like to thank Mr van Mierlo for his philosophical and constructive speech .
How inconsistent it is to continue to support human rights violators such as Algeria and Syria , while allowing relations to cool with Turkey , towards which the Union has certain obligations and which deserves a high level of financial support .
And has the social aspect of Europe been maintained by allowing workers a say in legislation ?
Moving on to human rights , you criticize China , but it would make more sense to criticize Suriname .
This is threatening to make the Union the focus of everyone 's fears rather than their hopes , and it is a dangerous development .
Nothing is more damaging to the Union 's credibility than its continual failure to speak with one voice in international politics , for which misuse of the veto is partly to blame .
The public also urgently needs a response from the Union to the rapidly growing problems of transfrontier crime and migration .
It is a pleasant custom to wish each other all the best at the start of the year , and I wish the Dutch presidency great courage in dealing with the difficult problems that are sure to land in its lap over the next few months .
Growth with more pollution and less concern about jobs ?
I would urge the Dutch presidency to be more active on human rights and external relations .
However , we must not overlook the negative aspects associated with this , particularly the ever-widening gap between European government and its citizens .
However , we must not forget that the national parliaments form the basis for parliamentary democracy in Europe , and this is how the public sees the situation .
Majority voting also requires parliamentary control , which can no longer be applied effectively at national level , of course , since ministers can be outvoted but will still be bound by the decisions which have been taken .
I know from personal experience that this is not a new idea , and that the Minister and the presidency have the interests of democracy at heart .
Turkey 's over-reaction must not prevent us from carrying out the promises we have made to Cyprus .
Much is said about employment , but no instruments are provided for it .
A monetary union which is not also a social and ecological union and which does not create jobs could well fall victim to divisions between the governments and suspicion from the public , so as far as I am concerned , EMU can stay on hold until we have a better treaty which makes the Union more democratic and decisive , a hard enough task in itself .
Even a child could tell which countries Mr Zalm was calling hysterical .
Given that both the Union and the Netherlands Government feel so strongly about 'work , work , work ' , it is all the more incomprehensible that the Dutch presidency seems to ignore the very existence of tourism .
I am counting on you , Mr van Mierlo and Mr Patijn , not to follow Mr Bolkestein 's lead in your presidency of the Intergovernmental Conference , but to follow the Benelux memorandum instead .
Madam President , I should like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on his detailed speech concerning his country 's presidency .
Through its actions , the Serbian Government has cut itself off from Europe , and relations must remain frozen until President Milosevic concedes to every demand .
I think the European Union must not wait too long , otherwise we run the risk of allowing the Americans to seize the initiative once again .
But in the hands of pragmatic bureaucrats , all this becomes in the long run is an empty shell , an edifice , as you said in your speech .
You said that the Commission is to be made responsible for coming up with a fraud-proof passport .
Is that not simply the Netherlands Government acting in its own interests ?
Mr President , the conciliation procedure on distance selling has , to my mind , produced an excellent result .
More and more use is being made of existing and also new technologies .
Also , where payment is made in advance , Parliament wishes the money to be reimbursed if the corresponding service is not provided .
What we did manage to achieve - and I also say this to my colleague Mr Herman - is that we now have an undertaking from the Council with regard to the Green Paper on financial services , so that where there are gaps , there will be further scope for legislation .
It is not that I wish to spare this sector , but the fact is that the special nature of financial transactions is incompatible with the general character of this directive .
The crucial point for us is naturally that products or ingredients which are modified must now be labelled .
You were unhappy that we in the PPE Group did that .
We have learned some good lessons from the BSE affair .
Mr President , the debate we are holding today is , as we know , the final chapter in a long series of negotiations .
So there is only one alternative - to allow them - and then the question arises of the extent to which we have to measure out this freedom .
The aim of the objective is to improve the services which handle cross-border credit transfers by making them more efficient .
