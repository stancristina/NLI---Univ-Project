The proposal that has now been made is , in the opinion of our group , a good one , and our group supports it , and no more amendments to it are needed .
The main issue here is that summer time is applied in all Member States and that the date it starts and the date it ends remain uniform throughout the EU.
Harmonisation is necessary only in connection with the practice of summer time starting and ending at the same time in each of the Member States .
The greatest concerns are mainly to do with the welfare of animals and the working conditions of farmers .
Long , light evenings also mean opportunities for extended leisure time .
However , I would like to focus attention on this ritual of changing the clocks every spring and autumn , the purpose of which may be controversial .
Farmers have told me that the welfare of dairy cattle is a priority , and their protection is also important for milk production .
Additional stress should not now be caused them through having them deviate from their normal rhythm .
An additional problem is that not only is the natural rhythm of animals disturbed , but people ' s alertness , which is partly dependent on daylight , is also affected .
It is also questionable as to whether summer time should end just before November .
I am by no means totally opposed to summer time , as it also has its advantages .
Nevertheless , I would ask the Commission to deliver a critical assessment of whether summer time is necessary in the future .
But that is something politicians fortunately cannot make decisions about .
Mrs Haug and the Committee on Budgets have taken account of the proposals by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
If necessary , the matter of payment appropriations must be examined in the supplementary budget in 2001 .
I am grateful for the investment in sustainable transport , but it has to be said that transport and tourism appropriations are little more than token gestures .
In the years to come we will need considerably more in these areas .
The effective use of resources will serve to improve the employment situation , particularly via SMEs and new technology .
That does not mean , however , that things have been easy .
It is a positive step , as far as culture is concerned , that the financing of multiannual programmes , i .e .
It is important that the Union should serve the needs of its citizens well .
In the budget there is direct financing for European culture networks .
But the rules for financing are not yet working properly .
The modest sums involved must be spent well and fairly .
The same goes for Mr Wynn , the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , for the splendidly accomplished conciliatory work he has done and for his constructive leadership of the committee .
This means that great restraint has been shown in the use of funds in the other categories .
This makes just 1.056 % of GNP , which must be considered very low as the ceiling for the financial perspective is 1.11 % .
This , however , conceals a danger .
For that reason , Parliament ' s concern that the problem of arrears will have to be dealt with is a justified one , and that is why there has been a very real need for a joint declaration by Parliament and the Council .
However , it is unfortunate that Parliament once again had to fight with regard to funds for the West Balkans .
This shows that in future there must be better use of personnel resources .
With these observations , my group is prepared to adopt the draft budget .
Mr President , according to a press report , the initial comment by the Finnish Prime Minister , Paavo Lipponen , after Nice was : " This agreement must be remade " .
No one at the meeting spoke for Europe .
Almost every country brought its own internal political problems to the meeting .
The candidate countries were thus presented with a very bad example , which must have astonished the whole region , from Tallinn to Prague and Budapest .
It is obviously a positive matter that enlargement can now go ahead .
After enlargement , meetings like Nice and the IGCs as they are at present will be impossible ; integration will either really make headway or simply fall apart .
The difference between politicians and statesmen is that politicians know well enough what people want today , while statesmen know what they will actually want twenty years from now .
The war in Chechnya is a case in point , and , for example , this labour legislation now under discussion will reduce employees ' rights quite drastically .
This is the first strategy on Russia in our history .
Multi-faceted cooperation will help to stabilise conditions in Russia .
The result will finally be more human rights , which we all desire .
We have already laid the foundations of a period of cooperation with Russia during which the political leadership has changed .
I , myself , suggest that energy should be made the driving force behind this important project , as that is something we need , that is where the money is , and since we have the money , we can also spend it on the infrastructure , on hospitals , environmental issues and so on .
Do you intend to support a project such as this , Commissioner Patten ?
The benefit to the whole and the individual will become one in the long run .
Are we also prepared to discriminate against the poor banana producers of Latin America , because these countries do
