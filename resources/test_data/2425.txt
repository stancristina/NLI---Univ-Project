However , those consular services are not available to Muslims from other EU Member States who would be there under the same terms and conditions operated by the Saudi authorities as UK Muslims .
It seems a little bizarre that whilst we are supposed to have equal representation and treatment for all EU citizens , in circumstances like the one I have described , there is unequal treatment and unequal representation for EU citizens .
Could the Swedish minister please assure us that he will take up this matter and examine circumstances in which this kind of unequal treatment takes place , to ensure that regardless of religion or nationality people receive the same treatment from consular services by individual Member States ?
Mr President , may I also welcome the Presidency-in-Office .
I appreciate the answer but I do have to ask , with the knowledge that of course Aung San Suu Kyi has been under virtual house arrest now for about 120 days : how can you suggest that a prisoner is able to carry out a meaningful dialogue or negotiation with her jailer ?
That is my first question .
Secondly , should not she and the NLD actually be offered basic freedoms before we are prepared to embrace the SPDC in this way ?
You say that the troika will have access to areas and to as many individuals as it wants .
Are you imposing conditions on this troika visit , which would mean that they are absolutely obligated to give that kind of access ?
Finally , just one last sceptical comment : in 1994 Aung San Suu Kyi did have some negotiation with the SLORC , as they were called then , and they said all the time that she was being far too inflexible , this woman is impossible to deal with because she keeps asking us to respect the results of the 1990 election .
I wonder whether you are concerned that they might be still playing games with the European Union and the international community and they will again say : "look , this woman is impossible . "
Thank you for that very comprehensive answer .
As you know , the next ministerial meeting between the EU and the ASEAN countries is due to take place in Europe .
At the moment we have a ban against travel into any of the EU Member States by any member of the military regime in Burma and their families .
They will , therefore , not be able to take part in that meeting .
ASEAN countries are pressuring the Union to lift that ban .
Can I have your assurance that you will not give in to such pressure ?
Thank you for your response and also for giving us a few more moments .
I am delighted that you have been so realistic as to describe the cuts as drastic , because that is all they can be described as .
However , I also realise that it is necessary to have cuts in order to ensure that we have sufficient resources for this generation and , indeed , future generations .
I refer to your comments on recovery plans .
I would ask you to assure us that you will make every effort to ensure that when the recovery plans are being discussed it is not only the scientists but also the stakeholders and the fishermen who will be involved in these discussions .
All the fishermen I know are realists and they realise that it is necessary to have closed areas to protect the breeding grounds .
In short , can you give us an assurance that you will make an effort to have the fishermen involved in any recovery plans ?
.
Mr President , I have been given a very generous eight minutes on my report here in front of this packed Chamber this evening - I suspect that is because many people find this report quite technical and detailed .
Whilst drawing up the second liberalisation package in 1989 , the Council and the Commission agreed that Community air transport policy had to address the harmonisation of the regulatory framework applicable to civil aviation .
Subsequently , Council Regulation 3922/91 was established in which the technical requirements , known as Joint Aviation Requirements , formulated by the JAA , were given the force of law within the Community .
It is against this background that the Joint Aviation Requirements , known as JAR-OPS , agreed by the JAA in 1995 , are now being transposed into European Union law .
This in itself has proved to be a difficult exercise .
But the Community has committed itself to adopting harmonised safety requirements for the operation of aircraft .
In this regard , the JAR-OPS 1 Regulation constitutes a good basis from which we can work , with minimum changes , in order to amend the appropriate regulations .
However , there are areas in which Parliament needs to act .
Firstly , in regard to cabin crew .
Operators should have the responsibility for training , but this should be done on a harmonised basis , with a distinct , uniform , European-wide certification system which would be accepted by all Member States .
There is no doubt in my mind that in most cases the operators are best qualified to organise training .
But this should not preclude other qualified organisations from having the possibility to do training , providing , of course , that all training is approved by the National Civil Aviation Authorities .
In addition , the cabin crew directive should now be incorporated into this regulation .
Secondly , the difficult issue of flight time limitation was not addressed by the Commission .
The relevant part , known as Subpart Q , is missing .
This is nonsensical , because you cannot have a directive which purports to
