Since colleagues have feared that my approach means that anyone may take an authority to court , I wish to stress that just the opposite is the case .
It is precisely the Commission 's version which - in setting demanding obligations for the authority - would achieve this result .
The opportunity to express an opinion will not automatically imply the right of appeal .
Authorities will face uncommon difficulties in establishing whom a matter concerns ; this includes all civic organisations , which according to the Commission 's proposal are always interested parties .
My proposal was unusual in that it would have simultaneously benefited citizens who genuinely wish to participate , and also the authorities dealing with the matter and those players whose project was in question .
Fortunately many other matters which are important from the point of view of the Aarhus convention have been received positively .
I have , first and foremost , wished to streamline practice by standardising the regulations concerning processing with regard to the various directives .
In the Commission 's proposal the modes of procedure vary slightly , and as a result it is difficult to know what one should do in any particular case .
In particular , this applies to Item 5 of Article 6 , and Article 8 , of the Aarhus Convention .
It has happened many times so I urge you to see that the quality of interpretation is improved as soon as possible .
It is justified because IT studies have a key place in the EU' s strategy .
The second new feature is connected with sport , which still does not have a legal basis in the Union .
The third new matter in our Committee ' s budget is the EUR 1 million appropriation for establishing a centre for monitoring cultural co-operation .
I am very disappointed with the work of the Committee on Budgets in item A-3042 , which concerns the funding of European cultural organisations .
We in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport had done a lot of work in connection with this point .
We , above all , tried to assess how money might be used in the best possible way from the point of view of European culture .
Parliament cannot act as if it were in a 'grab as grab ca n' type of wrestling contest , in which the most unscrupulous party of all is the victor .
At the same time I wish to thank Terence Wynn , as chairman of the Committee on Budgets , who has proved a competent leader in the work of the current year .
The strengthening of the policy on the northern dimension in the budget ' s explanatory statement may also be regarded as a positive move .
The handling of the budget is based very much on last year ' s financial statements , which showed a surplus of EUR 11 billion .
For that reason , we now have to pay special attention to improving administration and not producing such large estimates for expenditure .
At present they stand at more than EUR 60 billion .
It will increase efficiency and the importance of personal responsibility .
The Commission and the Council are proposing EUR 125 million for the Moroccan fishing agreement , although this agreement is not forthcoming .
This is clearly a matter of a concealed reserve which , indeed , contravenes the Financial Regulation .
As a counterweight , it is being proposed that a flexible instrument should be used to modernise the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets .
We , as liberals , like participating in joint agreements to carry through the budget in Parliament , but we cannot be party to this idea .
These appropriations take up a totally unreasonable amount of Parliament ' s time in relation to their importance .
We particularly support Mrs Buitenweg ' s recommendations concerning discipline in Parliament ' s budget , as mentioned in her report .
They remain beneath the ceiling we , ourselves , set , that is to say 20 % of all administrative costs , even though it includes the costs relating to enlargement .
Around the destroyed unit a nuclear shelter was constructed hastily , given the conditions , to halt the spread of the pollution .
The preliminary estimate of the cost of the project for the period 1998 - 2005 was around USD 758 million .
This sum was sufficient for the first stage of the Shelter Implementation Plan .
The European Union at the start financed the shelter work with a payment of USD 100 million , which was pledged at the Denver Summit in 1997 .
A second pledging conference was held in Berlin in July 2000 to organise a final contribution to the scheme .
The matter before us is thus Parliament ' s opinion on the adoption of this regulation .
Consequently , the fund still lacks money , as the estimate of costs is rather higher , totalling at least USD 720 - 750 million .
If this were to apply , the decisions could not be taken at present in the way the Commission and the Council have proposed .
However , I support the Commission ' s proposal to set aside EUR 100 million for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund as this project ' s implementation is of vital importance to the people of the European Union and their safety .
Clearly , it will be difficult to use these funds as people will be working in difficult conditions in which there is a huge number of international players and where the situation is to some extent still vague in the administration of the Confederation of Independent States .
Mr President , in this second reading I would like to present a legal report that is broad in scale .
I would like to thank my
