What means and chances do we the European Union have and what means do you intend to use to ensure that this unlawful Act is also repealed by Congress ?
We must formulate a common policy of dialogue with the pro-democracy forces in Iran .
The people want prosperity and social security , but the massive military investment causes the region many problems .
The background to this story was a report on drugs and on a drugs deal involving the name of Mrs Ciller , which suggests close contacts here with organized crime in Turkey ; so we have to ask what policy the European Union is pursuing here .
It really is a scandal for any civilized country just to stand by and watch even though it knows the extent of the misery in that country .
They would have filled a whole book .
Nor should we forget that without Nairobi airport , we would have faced very very great difficulties in carrying out certain measures .
The Commission chose Article 130( 3 ) as the legal basis , i .e . , the 'industry ' title of the Treaty .
In recent budgetary procedures the Council sought considerable cuts in energy policy sectors .
Otherwise it will only be paying it lip service .
We consider it crucial to harmonize the framework conditions , an aspect for which the Commission made no provision at all in its proposal but which the EPP Group proposed in committee and which was fortunately incorporated .
We have long known that we will make much more headway in the medium term with CO2 -free renewable energy technology than with nuclear technology .
I am anxious to point out that I never signed those amendments .
As an Austrian Member , however , I find it extremely important that EU assistance should henceforth be used primarily to fight unemployment and indeed that the creation of jobs be made our foremost priority .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to begin by congratulating my colleague Riitta Myller on a truly outstanding report .
It is at those borders that the widest prosperity gaps are to be found , and it is there that the bulk of our work will have to be done .
Interregional cooperation must take more account of economic aspects , of social , environmental and planning policies , because people in border areas find it hard to understand why good health care is available on their side of the border but not on the other side , why the planners , for example , have designated their side of the border as an economic development area , whereas on the other side , perhaps little more than half a mile away , the land may be designated as a green belt with strict measures to protect the natural environment .
Speed is now of the essence if the hopes of the regions are not to be dashed .
The aim of a united , socially and economically harmonized and permanently peaceful Europe is far less likely to be achieved by centralist strong-arm tactics than by sustained , far-reaching voluntary cross-border and interregional cooperation .
This presupposes a good control system .
All regions in Europe continue to need European Community initiatives .
The European Union needs to do more in three core areas while strictly observing the principle of subsidiarity .
I can associate myself entirely with what Mr Medina Ortega has already said , so I shall spare the House the other two minutes of speaking time , which will be my gift to the House as a contribution to the quality of life here and as a foretaste of the working of the Holy Spirit this coming Pentecost Sunday .
Broad guidelines for economic policy must therefore be based on more than a mere restatement of the convergence criteria .
I attach particular importance to this , specifically in terms of the measures which need to be taken to create the right overall framework .
As regards the budget , I am not yet sure what the position is .
I think this must be seen as a painful truth , because everyone can cite their own examples of such mistrust , and I would refer to just a few points that serve to illustrate it .
But it must not be hedged around with so many provisos that the central idea of majority decision-making is undermined and overlayered by the principle of unanimity , thereby choking the whole apparatus .
The so-called communitization of elements of the third pillar is a pig in a poke , because the introduction of the qualified majority principle is not coupled with codecision powers for the European Parliament and competence for the European Court of Justice .
In my opinion , there is a much greater danger of the House ending up like Sancho Panza - who was content simply to complain , to hang back eating his lunch , and to stretch himself out under the trees .
What has been said about the decision-making process is important too .
It should be dear to us too , in the light of the increasingly bitter social divisions in our countries .
Mr President , following what the Commissioner has said today , I really must make the point once again that we have more than 20 million people out of work in Europe , with one in five young people unemployed and unable to find work , and I have to say that the Commission 's recommendation for the broad economic policy guidelines can only be described as toothless .
In my view , the single market and the free movement of capital , rather than monetary union , are the factors that require us to think harder about tax harmonization , and ultimately to adopt measures that will promote it
