.
On the question of the size of the European Parliament , we have also found a point of equilibrium , based on to a minimum number of Members for each Member State .
Every state will , of course , have to make a sacrifice following enlargement , but a minimum number will be guaranteed , with digressive proportionality thereafter .
So the report is balanced and I think can be welcomed .
It is ambitious .
Some people are saying : ' The IGC will never agree to this point or to that point ' .
But we are not in this Parliament trying to guess the outcome of the IGC ; we are trying to encourage it to move in a particular direction , in a more ambitious direction , to make sure that we actually have a Union capable of functioning effectively when we enlarge to nearly 30 Member States .
That is essential for our future .
Mr President , just before the formal sitting you interrupted this vote very suddenly .
It rather surprised me , and I am sure many other Members of the House , who during the formal sitting expressed their surprise at the way in which the vote was interrupted .
We have just seen the first vote after the formal sitting fail to secure a qualified majority by only a handful of votes .
Does that not demonstrate what we were talking about and the point Mrs Roth-Behrendt has raised ?
When we have qualified majority votes they should not be interrupted in any way by the formal sitting .
There were eight votes to go .
I can inform you , on the basis of my experience , that you could have completed that in three minutes .
It is ridiculous that we are now proceeding with qualified majority votes when Members have not been given a reasonable amount of time to come back into the Chamber .
I hope you could address that issue , Mr President .
Mr President , I am delighted this resolution has been adopted by Parliament in recognition of the problem that exists with additionality .
I represent Wales which , due to the practices of the UK Government , has not received , and will not receive , what the EU intends to be spent on combating poverty over and above normal government spending , even with Objective I status in the current programme period .
As Commissioner Barnier has stated , it is as important to comply with the spirit of additionality as with the letter of the law .
The Commissioner also endorsed the statement by Commissioner Liikanen that in future the Commission would be particularly attentive to the spending figures put forward by the Member States when there is evidence of reduced expenditure in a given region or regions .
I trust now that the Member States will comply with the wishes of Parliament and the Commission in this matter to ensure that the effective targeting of structural funds at the poorest regions is not undermined .
- The EPLP delegation voted in favour of the compromise resolution on additionality because we believe that the principle of additionality is one of the core fundamental pillars of the structural funds reforms , for which I was Parliament ' s rapporteur .
However , I believe that parts of this resolution , rather than bringing clarity to the rules , will only serve to confuse the general public and in particular funding operators .
Paragraph A continues to confuse the principle of additionality with the separate but equally important principle of co-financing .
Paragraph G is inaccurate .
There is no regulatory requirement to check additionality on an annual basis , but as stated in the regulation , simplification requires three checks on additionality during the programming period .
It is inappropriate for Members to try with this resolution to rewrite regulations which were agreed unanimously by this Parliament and will be up for review in 2006 .
More disappointing is the naked party political games which British Members Mr Davies , Mr Bradbourn and Mrs Evans have attempted in this resolution .
This will not serve the best interests of our poorest communities , with deliberate misinformation and hijacking this debate for narrow party political advantage .
Our real goal must be to plan and give our support to the successful implementation of these funds to improve the life prospects of people in our poorest regions .
My party is committed to this goal and will work with other parties in a constructive and positive way to achieve this .

- I welcome Mr Bowe ' s report as a balanced and considered approach to the important subject of the release into the environment of GMOs .
The three key issues covered in Mr Bowe ' s report are : environmental liability , antibiotics and gene transfer .
On environmental liability I tend to take the Commission ' s view that this is best dealt with through horizontal legislation .
On antibiotics I would be in favour of a ban on the use in GMOs of genes conferring antibiotic resistance .
As far as gene transfer is concerned I believe measures must be foreseen in the new Directive to control the release of GMOs which can outcross with other plants .
A strong Directive which deals with concerns about the environment and the health risks of GMOs could go a long way to ensure we realise the potential benefits from GMOs and avoid the pitfalls .
- Madam President , I wholeheartedly applaud the efforts of my Labour colleague , David Bowe , to put forward measures to control the release of GMOs into the environment .
With such fast-changing science and a host of possible unknown effects , it is important to protect Europe ' s people and our environment
