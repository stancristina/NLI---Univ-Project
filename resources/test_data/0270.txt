What we have to do today is to work out whether we Europeans are willing and able to take on the responsibility , and hence also the costs in terms of money and personnel , and move forwards , for instance as regards peace missions .
I must emphasise the fact that the PKK was included on this list at the moment when it had unilaterally started to respect the human rights of the Turkish people far more than Turkey itself .
One of these has already been mentioned .
The current new wording of the provisions of the Wieland report relating to Article 24 of the proposal for a directive on the specifications referred to in Annex 1 , section 7 , as the report was amended following ? ( The President cut the speaker off )
It seems obvious to me , however , that this may lead to interference by one State in the legal arrangements of another State , unjustly restricting its sovereignty .
Mr President , we are talking about an eagerly awaited and sensitive report which , if approved with certain basic amendments tabled by the PPE , may genuinely contribute to resolving a very serious problem .
Lastly , what is really needed to achieve these objectives is a commitment to enhance cooperation among Member States in the field of justice .
While it is true that concentrations have developed the economic systems of certain countries , which , through their tried and tested stability , have been able to benefit from the opportunities they bring , it is also true that concentrations should be able to favour initiatives to strengthen international support , which must aim at introducing reforms to encourage integration in world trade .
Parliament clearly seems to share the Commission 's objective , which is to strengthen the legislative arsenal for controlling concentrations .
The draft regulation will naturally be made available for public consultation .
The European Union has employment policies , the Member States have employment policies and the Commission and I myself are all for the strengthening of employment policies .
I thank Parliament once again for this latest contribution to our efforts to refine the competition instrument .
Secondly , in my own view and in the opinion of the Socialist Group , the amendments tabled are superfluous and run counter to the spirit of unity which characterised the vote on the Communication in committee .
Secondly , the focus of the report is on legal restrictions on racist and xenophobic beliefs and not on the actions motivated by racism and xenophobia .
Combating hunger in the world is not just a competition to see who can show the most solidarity , it is a fight against the desperation which is driving millions of people to pursue their dream of a better life elsewhere .
We were unable to tackle the issue for a long time , not least because the situation did not allow it .
We must , of course , endeavour to put forward a solution based on respect for the country 's integrity , although the decision-makers will have to decide whether to give some of the regions of the country specific forms of autonomy .
Another serious problem is health : there is a health crisis in this country which requires an urgent response .
If , as I think , these are the key goals for the Nairobi Conference , it is essential that the conference takes place without delay , before the month is out if possible , for that will allow the European Union to launch aid programmes .
The authors of the resolution call for assistance from the international community , of course , which is essential , although they also point out that armed clashes have claimed many more civilian victims in recent weeks .
Our document welcomes the initiative to organise a conference , although it is impossible to know as yet whether all the parties will agree to sit down at the same table .
In this regard , I feel that the peace initiative described by Commissioner Diamantopoulou is a way out of at least the worst phase of the Somali crisis .
With reference not to January , when the crisis started , but to the fact that I have been trying to get this resolution debated for over two months with little success , I feel that the very nature of urgent debates must be reviewed .
There is something else I would point out to Mr Medina Ortega , and that is that , rightly or wrongly , where Argentina leads other countries follow : it is seen as an example .
This is the situation , what is happening at this time , even as we speak , in Tunisia .
Mr President , today is an important anniversary for the Vietnam war , not what is usually referred to as the Vietnam War but the war which is taking place day after day in Vietnam against democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , the war being waged against the citizens of Vietnam , against the Buddhist monks , against the leaders of movements opposed to the Vietnamese regime .
Near Cassino , there is a small hamlet with 2000 residents , San Pietro in Fine , which was razed to the ground at the famous Battle of Cassino during the Second World War .
No government or country must be allowed to suppress it .
We have never called into question any decision taken by a national parliament , for we recognise that national parliaments act in local contexts which are nothing to do with Europe .
I would start by mentioning that a Single Sky is being achieved thanks to the unambiguous support of the European Parliament , which it had already declared in a resolution in July 2000 , and thanks to the support of
