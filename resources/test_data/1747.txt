of moves to give this policy a legal basis at last .
Furthermore , as far as possible supplies should be purchased in the region or elsewhere in other developing countries .
And of course we are seeing the results of that .
The Council position also fails to take sufficient account of how to target specific groups , but nevertheless we think that the position is deserving of our support , and Mrs Baldi 's report certainly is too .
Secondly , if a Member makes more than one return journey in a working week he receives for the extra journeys an allowance for the travelling expenses actually incurred .
It says : ' Within the scope of application of this Treaty , and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein , any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited ' .
That is normally allowed once the item under discussion on the agenda has been dealt with .
The item under discussion on the agenda was the speech by Mr Martens , who referred to a Belga report but also mentioned statements .
Welcome Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Santer on putting such a high priority on unemployment .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the purpose of the Barcelona initiative is to promote security and stability in the area of the Mediterranean Sea , the south flank of the European Union - stability which may benefit both the Union and the North African countries .
Above all to approve it in order to avoid even the slightest risk of seeing Morocco slide down into an Algerian situation .
It must be discussed with the national authorities .
But that would amount to toying with human rights criteria by the Council Assembly whereas the Council of Europe 's most important task is to put human rights to the test .
We are also glad that the Political Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe supports this proposal .
I hope the content of the European Parliament 's resolution will cause our colleagues there to think again .
Compliance with Croatia 's application might moreover act as a precedent with regard to Bosnia and what is left of Yugoslavia .
To some extent when it comes to enlarging the European Union we are a little dependent on the policy they follow .
It is understandable that they are prepared to not work in a fraudulently elected parliament .
On behalf of my Group I should like to say this with regard to those political conclusions : President Berisha must declare the result of the elections void , and not only in the four districts just mentioned , and he must organize fresh elections according to internationally valid standards .
We must take that into account .
Help with legislation , training and extra contact are all matters in which we can take care that such pitiful things as the abortive or half-abortive elections in Albania can no longer take place .
That is a very great pity because then it cannot be seen just where Parliament 's main criticisms of this action programme lie .
So after the pan-European transport conference in Helsinki next year the Commission will have to draw up a new action programme and lay down clearer priorities .
Finally Mr Parodi is to be congratulated on the extensive piece of work he has put before us .
But that must not entail covert sector support .
A different approach according to the target group is desirable .
It started off in 1991 under the second framework programme .
The experts say so themselves .
After that it took a further eight months before the evaluation report was sent to the European Parliament and then only in three languages - one more assault on the principle that every European citizen should be able to read documents in his or her own language .
Nevertheless there was no adjustment .
Sustainable mobility can be achieved only if the proper strategies are developed .
In 1994 when the period envisaged had expired , a further ECU 8 million was spent on extra appropriations in order to ensure that a number of projects within EURET were continued .
Even before there was any mention of an information society the universities already had EUARN ( European Academic Research Network ) .
It has kept the internal market intact by preventing individual countries from erecting national barriers .
By bringing an action before a Court of Justice whose powers it wishes to see curtailed , by resisting measures which it supports and by being politically rescued by the faceless Brussels bureaucrats , the British Government shows how very much British diplomacy has tied itself in a knot .
Each of us , as politicians is faced with a choice .
They have left the conservative party to join the only British party which consistently follows a pro-European line .
( Applause ) Mr President , in everyday life if not in European politics the penalty for blackmail is imprisonment .
Perhaps because it was then thought that the Americans and Argentineans were perhaps right , in other words , and I should be glad to have an answer from the Commissioner , as to whether the EU has not been negligent in only now proclaiming the British export ban .
A good example here is the UK, whose schools have made much more progress in using information technologies than those in other EU countries .
The Council has proposed a transitional period of three years for the directive instead of the two proposed by Parliament , which allows ample scope , especially when you consider that fridges can easily last 20 to 25 years .
Firms must make best use of the rapid developments in data processing to ensure smooth links with the other forms of transport used in each case .
