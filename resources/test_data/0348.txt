In spite of this serious criticism and these serious misgivings , I naturally recommend that we vote in favour of China ' s membership .
I cannot see any real problems with Taiwan ' s accession to the WTO .
The agricultural sector is , moreover , well protected from competition from foreign imports .
The fact that the EU also subsidises tobacco cultivation is particularly anomalous .
Costa Neves Report ( A5-0330/2001 )
Three years of drought have made the supply situation untenable .
I have therefore supported Amendments 2 and 3 in the vote on the resolution concerning the European Council ' s informal meeting in Ghent .
Poos Report ( A5-0308/2001 )
That does not however mean that we in any way support supranationalism within the areas of the second pillar .
We are critical of Mr Adam ' s report on the common organisation of the market in sheep meat and goat meat .
According to our original timetable , to which the Conference of Presidents had agreed , it was to be debated during the November II part-session .
On this point , as on many others , the groups are extremely divided .
Mr President , as has been pointed out , this report is , of course , a consequence of the quite arduous work done on the report on Article 255 of the EC Treaty , which concerns public access to documents and on which we voted on 3 May .
In the same way as we did then , we must now take the lead in the work aimed at taking a further step forward .
Let us interpret Article 255 as generously as possible and the concept of a 'document ' as broadly as possible .
I hope that they will nonetheless be adopted in practice .
Mr President , the extension of Europol ' s mandate is not some new issue that has arisen after 11 September .
It is , however , self-evident that , right now , there is a particularly great need for such an extension .
They might like to reflect upon the consequences of Europol ' s having 388 employees to cover a population larger than the United States ' s , while the FBI has 27 000 employees .
The human rights we have laid down both in the European Convention and in the European Union ' s Charter of Fundamental Rights are a characteristically European feature of which we should be proud and which we should also be sure to maintain .
The fact that crime statistics are being gathered is naturally welcome .
It should not , of course , be interpreted in that way .
Presumably , it is economic madness .
That is absurd !
Mr President , as rapporteur , allow me to explain .
We are also concerned with extending the aid to Bosnia , Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
We need a little time in which to obtain the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and we need to have a discussion on the whole budget for the Balkans for 2002 in connection with the conciliation prior to the second reading of the budget next week .
( Parliament agreed to urgent procedure ) President .
That concludes the vote .
Generally speaking , e-mail advertisements involve inconvenience for the consumer , partly because it takes time to open and delete advertising communications .
In the final vote , I therefore choose to support the report , irrespective of what transpires with regard to the aforesaid issue .
The proposals put forward by the report do not however solve these problems .
If TV companies were to be forced to adjust their programming in the interests of European cinema , this would constitute an infringement of their freedom .
Our experience from Sweden shows that tendering can be very good .
We should be able to get rid of many of the simplistic statements about tendering .
I want to express my thanks to Mr Jarzembowski who , as rapporteur , has come up with many criticisms of the Commission ' s proposal .
Pilotage must not therefore be regarded in terms of the same economic criteria as ordinary production , but from a safety perspective .
I am in favour of self-financed ports .
I want to see quality and efficiency brought about through ports ' preparing their own development programmes instead of being subjected to extensive forms of control from Brussels .
I would thank the Commission very much for its exhaustive and constructive answer .
Is this view correct ?
I believe that all the Member States are likely to be prepared to approve this quickly .
I believe we can find a good way of dealing with this issue .
The Commission must therefore table its draft legislation in the course of 2002 .
We know that the human body contains measurable quantities of 350 chemicals .
These chemicals are found in a number of products , for example shampoo .
The Commission ' s White Paper , produced by the Environment and Enterprise Directorates-General , is trying to create a high degree of health and environmental protection , at the same time as maintaining the competitiveness of the European chemicals industry .
If a majority of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy voted for a proposal that goes further than the Commission ' s and shows how an effective , open and consumer-friendly control of chemicals should look in the future , that is completely in line with , and receives strong political support from , the European Council Summit in June when the conclusions drawn by the 15 Member States were significantly stricter and more far-reaching than the Commission ' s proposal .
I therefore believe that we should stick to the compromise achieved
