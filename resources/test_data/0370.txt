We are therefore entitled to ask why there are so few blood donors .
Of course , we must distinguish between remuneration for blood as such and reimbursement of costs incurred in order to give blood : refreshments and snacks , reimbursement of transport costs , and time taken from work to give blood .
Having said this , Parliament , in its vote of September 2001 , also wanted this proposal to cover the two sister substances , octabromodiphenyl ether and decabromodiphenyl ether .
In conclusion , and I shall go back to my footballing metaphor , whereas the Commission , in its initial proposal , only gave half a red card to pentabromodiphenyl ether , Parliament and the Council , as fair , impartial referees , give two red cards to pentabromodiphenyl ether and octabromodiphenyl ether and a yellow card to decabromodiphenyl ether , as the essential aim is to reconcile citizens ' immediate safety from fire hazards with the more long-term benefits in the field of public health and the environment .
We must welcome the fact that , ultimately , nothing has compromised the conclusion of your work at this late stage .
I therefore believe that we should make a gesture towards our partners : send a sign of respect and openness , demonstrate , in particular , that we do not view the acquis as set in stone , when reality reveals its limitations or contradictions in one area or another .
This Cold-War approach is , I believe , completely outmoded .
I would also like to say that the shift of emphasis towards the East must not make us forget the South - I know that this point was made in the Copenhagen declaration - and must not make us forget our responsibilities either - I am taking advantage of the fact that the three Presidents are here to remind them of this - towards the outermost regions , because the borders of the European Union are , at present , the borders of these regions , of Spain , France and Portugal .
I therefore urge you , President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Haarder , to investigate along with Mr Vitorino , ways , in the context of the Chechen issue , of implementing what is provided under Article 14( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union .
My second point relates to the conditions governing the entry into force of the future European Constitution .
There is another section of the summit results which deserves our attention , namely that relating to the European security and defence policy .
Look at how much progress has been made over the last 50 years !
It is true that the two sides have committed to continue negotiations with a view to reaching a global settlement before the end of February ; it is true that there is still the opportunity to bring down the last wall in Europe .
We condemn the over-scrupulous nature of the text , however , and particularly the lengthy timeframe given to manufacturers to apply this directive .
What we are waiting for is the Council to give us appropriate answers to these specific questions .
Then the disastrous social consequences are so difficult to quantify .
I am not telling you to do this in two minutes flat , but to start thinking about it , because , as usual , it will come to pass , as the result of the next disaster or the next crisis , in the same way that the European arrest warrant and many other measures have been introduced .
Although we are able to welcome the proposals made by the Commission , the same does not apply to the decisions reached by the Council .
There is another issue that concerns me as well , Commissioner , that of the 'brain drain ' affecting the countries of the South .
With regard to the readmission clauses , the Union reaffirmed its commitment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions at the Tampere Summit .
Mr President , Parliament today appears to have become aware of the problems related to mass , illegal immigration that Europe has been experiencing for 30 years .
It is high time to realise that the sacrosanct principle of laissez-faire and laissez-passer spells disaster for Europe .
We need a global approach , this has been pointed out .
Approval of these instruments is very important , because it paves the way for the full implementation of the Treaty of Nice , which provides for the development of the second stage subject to qualified majority .
It would be impossible to expect immediate effects from a sustainable development policy of the kind that we apply in our relations with third countries .
The decision on the list of visas was taken two years ago .
It is also the first time that such a clear message has been sent to our citizens , showing them that the Community institutions will henceforth be concerning themselves with the social and educational potential of sport and its fundamental role in informal education .
I have noticed , during my travels throughout Europe and my conversations and meetings how popular this new initiative is already and how high the expectations are of our citizens , in our schools , in sports organisations and public authorities .
In a Europe which wants to be close to the citizens , can we continue to see sport just as a commercial activity ?
They all want to be involved and to make their contribution to the enterprise .
The history of the Community has always been consistent .
Firstly , the questions raised are very broad in scope and cannot be addressed in a debate limited to a proposal for a framework directive .
This is not true , as we can see from numerous examples .
We must address this
