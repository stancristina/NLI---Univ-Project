Women must be strengthened in their negotiating position when it comes to condom use and , without exception , given increased rights and better conditions of life .
A preventive vaccine is no doubt what we all dream of , so let us hope for a positive result .     Mr President , welcome , Commissioner Reding .
On the basis of my experience in Sweden , I am especially pleased that the EU is accepting its responsibility for ensuring that the Internet is safer for children and young people and that it will continue to be both entertaining and educational , not only for children and young people but for all who like to surf the Net and use its chat rooms .
Parents clearly need help in keeping up with developments , which is something we have also been able to offer through the EU project in Sweden by , for example , producing a handbook .
It should be noted that it is not , of course , the Court of Auditors ’ job to try to discover fraud and other crimes .
These are far and away the dominant transactions in terms of sums of money , meaning that by far the largest portion of these payments cannot be monitored by citizens .
There are reasons for helping poor EU countries , but such help should be given by means of non-earmarked transfers .
I am amazed that the inadequacies were so great , and I think that ten years without a positive auditors ’ report is unambiguous in its implications .
In recent days , two important issues have been debated here in plenary : this auditors ’ report and the issue of the EU’s financial perspectives .
In the same way , the Court of Auditors shows that limited use is made of EU money in many areas ; nonetheless , it is in precisely those areas that many wish to invest more money .
The reason for this lies in Rule 35 of the Rules of Procedure , which concerns verification of the legal basis .
We also demand an addition to the legal service’s opinion , since they themselves admit in paragraph 50 that they do not have sufficient competence to judge whether all the measures come within the framework for the legal basis .
What is more , the American Court of Auditors has written a report that sheds light upon the costs and the problems associated with biometric data , so I also question the effectiveness of the measure as such and wonder whether the Council has sufficiently investigated these matters .     Mr President , there is some confusion here .
We nonetheless wish to emphasise that we are doubtful about the proposal as such .
Even though there is no human right not to be identified , people’s rights must nonetheless be protected through clear lines of demarcation regarding how information is used , for what purposes and by whom .
Ukraine is a potential member of the EU and must therefore be assured of democratic development .
All the debates , especially the negotiations prior to the 2005 budget , have clearly shown that a prevailing parliamentary majority would like to see a considerable increase in EU expenditure and , thus , also considerably increased membership fees for Sweden .
We are nonetheless of the view that the HIV/AIDS issue should not be handled within the framework of EU cooperation .
It is not easy to interpret what will happen if the President-in-Office of the Council is listened to .
This disquiet is something that we must , of course , take seriously .
Our common Europe is not a Christian project .
Those who are opponents of Turkey argue as if Turkey was to become a member tomorrow .
By then , the EU , and Turkey too , must change .
The large Kurdish minority must be recognised and be given full linguistic , cultural and political rights .
A majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has approved this report , and I believe and hope that it will be adopted by a large majority in the vote on Wednesday .
We welcome the fact that Turkey is drawing closer to the EU and working to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria .
It must achieve a level of economic development such that full membership does not release tensions that may threaten the internal market .
To ensure grass-roots support , membership negotiations should , moreover , only be embarked upon once the issue has been debated in the Member States’ election campaigns over the next few years .
That also applies to the present Member States which have , for example , linguistic minorities that together constitute 10 % of the EU’s population .
All EU citizens need to feel welcome in an EU whose power is increasing every day .
I want a Europe for all EU citizens and not just for a portion of them , no matter how great the historic decisions we face .     Mr President , firstly I wish to thank Mr Eurlings for having successfully completed an extremely difficult task .
There is no point in even trying , so I am selecting two points in the human rights sphere that are close to my heart , especially because I sit on the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
The other area in which I should have liked to have seen stronger wordings is that of education .
Women must be allowed to go to school now if , in the future , they are to be EU citizens .
I therefore want the guidelines to send out a clear political signal worthy of the unique situation in which Europe finds itself .
We want companies that operate across the borders and even out the economic differences .
In order to achieve that , we must fully exploit
