The Commission does not propose to attack the causes , nor is it thinking of proposing any alternatives .
It does not study or propose alternatives that might pass through an increase in public investment at all levels , an increase in cooperation from the national companies in the establishment and operation of high-speed passes and in an improvement in the quality of the supply .
In fact , at the moment there is an obvious lack of justice between taking responsibility for Aids sufferers in northern countries , where anti-retrovirus medicines are available , and , at the other extreme , in the southern countries , where most sufferers do not have access to basic health care .
The first question is that of the size and access to this fund , taking into account the annual cost of treatment for tri-therapy , which is estimated at $ 10, 000 - $ 20 , 000 .
For all these reasons , we hope that the study which the Commission will undertake together with experts from the Member States and other countries that might help us will be of great assistance either to formulate a new strategy or to confirm the one we have been following .
I tried to say this in my answer to Mr Needle .
I would add that , based on past experience , the cases most representative of this situation might be , for example : the untimely and unjustified prohibition of importing products from other Member States ; measures establishing or restoring import formalities , such as licences or technical approvals ; destruction of large quantities of products from other Member States , for example , on the roads , in shopping centres or in warehouses ; or even the immobilization of products by not permitting access to the national territory or movement within it , for example , blockading means of transport at the borders , on the motorways , or at the ports or airports .
With regard to events that have occurred in the past , I should like to differentiate between two situations .
It will enter into immediate legal effect in the Member State concerned .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , no-one doubts that the new information and communication technologies can have positive effects on education and training , on changing times and the organization of work , on business modernization at the most varied levels , and consequently on people 's increased opportunities for free time and leisure .
The recommendations set out in the report drawn up by Mrs Sierra González - whom I congratulate warmly although there are no more than half a dozen of us here - the recommendations set out in the report , as I was saying , for the structural funds to play a far more substantial part in the materialization and construction of infrastructures , in education , training and research-related aspects , naturally deserve our full support .
I want to be sincere in what I say !
We need to find penalties and punish offenders .
In these terms , the Ford report is an important report for the statistics of the Committee on Government and the rapporteur , but is no of no importance whatsoever for the future of the institution . on the Lambraki report ( A4-0001/98 ) Mr President , the relocation of investments has to be seen with realism and constructively , seeking to reduce the risks and possible exploitation of the opportunities created , as is duly emphasized by the rapporteur , Mr André Sainjon , whom I wish to congratulate for that , without prejudice to the reservation made by Mr Schwaiger .
This is a requirement for the whole Union and for each of the countries , particularly for Portugal , where there is so much to be done in the field of regional development .
With regard to Madeira and the Azores , owing to the incentive policies , it has been possible not only to consolidate but in some cases to increase the industrial fabric harmoniously , enabling surplus local production , mainly tuna , mackerel and black swordfish , to be marketed , giving prospects of sustainable development to the processing companies .
As we all know , we are talking about fairly poor , ultra-peripheral regions with very low levels of income , all classified in the Objective 1 regions , as stated by Mr Correia , and we are also talking about permanent structural situations , levels of disfavour unfortunately not wiped out , not eliminated in the short term .
I hope that in the future the Commissioner present today will follow the situation of these peripheral regions attentively , as she always does , and propose special measures aimed at them , as fish is the strategic and endogenous resource for the development of these ultra-peripheral and insular regions .
On that account , we should not forget today that we all agree in 1998 on the responsibility held by the regional authorities that forgot the deep-sea fishermen in the Azores and the swordfish and mackerel fishermen in Madeira three years ago , not giving continuity to the needs of these local economic sectors along with the Commission .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , with this proposal made by the Commission and this report drawn up with the knowledge and reflection shown by Mr Medina Ortega , the door is opened to a framework of financial aid for the marketing of deep-sea fishery products from the Azores , maintaining support for the tuna industry .
The economic and social impact of fishing , particularly on employment , and the special conditions of the remoteness of the Azores region justify it .
