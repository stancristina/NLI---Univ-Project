are required to do so .
When they are asleep their electricity consumption is cut on average from 100 watts to 5 watts .
Given the number of computers in homes , schools , workplaces , etc. , you can see how the savings mount up from the good sleeping habits of those machines .
Until now , the European Union has produced its own energy efficient standards , often mandatory and the European Parliament has taken seriously its responsibility as a co-legislator to see that such standards are sufficiently stringent .
That is why there would be very serious reservations from Parliament about adopting this US energy star scheme if that were to be our only measure and especially if there were no provisions in the agreement for regular review of the results , with the objective , of course , of always being at the leading edge of the relevant technologies .
Luckily that is not the case however , and the Commission is to be given powers to negotiate improvements in the technical specifications .
And it has been made quite clear to the US authorities in a side letter to the agreement that the European Parliament , which would have been a co-legislator with the Council for similar measures at European level , will be consulted by the Commission on matters concerning technical specifications .
In the amendments to my report , we make it clear that further measures are certainly needed , including the glaringly obvious one of switching the machines off sometimes and withdrawing particularly inefficient machines from the market , either voluntarily or , if necessary , with legislation .
I am quite sure that the Council will see the wisdom of these amendments and of the regular and earlier monitoring of the energy star scheme as one , but only one , component of our energy efficient action plan .
We believe the current legal base is the correct one and we join the Commission in their suggestions .
As rapporteur , I would like to thank the Commission for their cooperation and help and of course thank my colleagues , especially Mrs Müller , who drafted a very useful opinion from the Environment Committee .
We all hope that the energy star scheme is a success and we look forward to watching computers throughout Europe going to sleep at the correct time .
Mr President , last Saturday Marie-José the last Queen of Italy and daughter of King Albert of this country died .
She was a recognised democrat and historian .
Sadly she did not live to see her exiled son and grandson allowed to return to their homeland .
Thus her funeral shamefully could not take place in Italy as they would not be permitted to attend .
This Italian constitutional article has no place in modern Europe and is in clear breach of the freedom of movement provided for under the European treaties .
I have three times attempted to gain the support of this Parliament in condemning this law .
The issue is being decided at present by the Court of Human Rights and will not go away .
I call upon the Italian government to use the opportunity afforded by the sad death of Queen Marie-José to fulfil its legal obligations to the European Union and grant the two male princes the same rights as every other Italian citizen and let them go home .
( The Minutes were approved )
Decision on urgent procedure Commissioner , you have the melancholy satisfaction of being proved right and that never makes one popular or even happy .
The very people and the very Member States who were shrugging off your warnings two years ago , who were denying you a qualified majority , as you said just a few months ago , are now clamouring for compensation and support as the beef market collapses and we face the prospect of millions of animals in store , unsellable , undisposable of over the next two years .
In the United Kingdom we see this with some sympathy .
People will say to me : Well , yes , you were first .
We were first in the whole cycle from complacency to despair and back again .
And if today the beef market is sound in Britain and beef consumption is rising , it is only because people have seen how draconian the measures need to be .
Every question I now want to ask the Commission comes from that experience .
Firstly , the extent of BSE.
What are the tests showing ?
What do the Member States themselves say ?
We see reports that some countries which claimed a year ago to be BSE-free , now anticipate up 500 cases in the course of the next year .
If Europe has fallen into line with the principle of culling animals over 30 months , is that in itself enough ?
What do the tests and the research findings say about the incidence of the disease in animals younger than 30 months .
Thirdly , what capacity do the Member States have for destroying the materials that are now being removed ?
Which Member States have the incineration capacity ?
Are some still saying that they will put this material into landfill ?
These are all serious questions , which we know you will try to answer .
We think you should go further and I would just like to echo what my friend Mr Garot said which is that Europe most of all owes you its solidarity .
Mr President , I welcome the proposals to ban the production of mechanically recovered meat from all ruminant bones of all ages .
In the UK at the moment , we have a ban on MRM from beef and also we do not have any animal going to the food chain over 30 months , but the problem is MRM beef coming in from other EU countries .
