Mr President , I must declare an interest because I am a Class I soccer referee and very active in that and have been involved in football at many levels for 18 years .
This resolution looks at the security and safety arrangements ahead of Euro 2000 so that decent football-loving supporters from across Europe can go to , watch and come away from football games this summer without fear or concern for their safety : a fairly apt thing to call for considering the recent events in Copenhagen .
Most Members will find this motion uncontentious .
However , I do understand that there are some queries about the question of the suitability of the Charleroi stadium and its ability to safely host the England versus Germany game on 17 June .
These I will tackle now because I believe these points are what people want to hear about .
I thank the BBC Watchdog Programme for providing me with details of the findings of a renowned British sports stadia expert , Dr Jim Dickey .
He found , after just a brief examination of the temporary structure above the north stand in Charleroi , that there were too many seats in the rows , the stand is too steep , the safety barriers are too low , the exits from the stand are too narrow and the stairways at the back of the stand are too wide .
This stand , like all the others , will be full to capacity on 17 June .
Meanwhile , a few miles up the road , the King Baudouin stadium , Belgium 's national stadium , and now probably one of the safest stadia in all of Europe , will lie empty that day .
I understand the regional pride of many members from Belgium and I do not question that much time is being spent by the organisers of Euro 2000 looking into the safety and security aspects of the competition .
But surely , common sense should prevail and the future of this particular fixture at its current venue should be actively re-examined .
I do hope that Members will support this motion , because this is something we can actually change for the better .
Why not look at an event beforehand and not worry about the consequences of the bad actions of a few violent people after such a football event .
Mr President , I hope there will be a great football match on 17 June between England and Germany .
Most people are looking forward to a good match and hope that it will be safe .
But , unfortunately , that is not the view of everybody .
The German police anti-hooligan task force has said that it is pretty confident there will be hooligans there .
I cannot say anything about German hooligans but I can talk about English football hooligans - I cannot say 'fans ' and even the word 'hooligan' is not strong enough for them .
There is a group of people who very definitely are planning to be there .
If you doubt me , just look at the press photographs of the problems that occurred in Copenhagen last night .
As well as the problems my colleague referred to that could occur inside the stadium at Charleroi , there is a serious problem that may occur in the streets around that stadium .
The head of the Belgian Police Federation has said that he is concerned .
We are saying now to the Belgian authorities and the European football authorities that they should choose the option of a safer ground that is available elsewhere in Belgium , and the stadium in Brussels has been cited .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after discussing all these terrible events in the world , it is certainly refreshing to consider other problems even though , on reflection , these also involve images which cannot be tolerated .
I do not believe , however , that the motion before us deals with the problem correctly .
For example , paragraph 2 of the motion is wrong .
In this paragraph Parliament expresses its concern about the fact that the Charleroi stadium , which is to host several games , in particular the England versus Germany match , does not meet the relevant Belgian safety standards .
This is wrong for several reasons .
The first is that the organisers of any game in Belgium and the promoters of any stadium must sign a public-law agreement with the municipality in which the stadium is situated .
This agreement engages the personal responsibility of the burgomaster .
Our fellow Member has spoken of regional pride .
Belgians are aware of the good and bad sides of regional pride and , as a result , the use of a stadium requires not only the signature of the burgomaster but also that of the Minister of the Interior .
It is therefore completely wrong to talk of regional rivalries .
Furthermore , everyone knows or should know that it is not the inhabitants of Charleroi who chose this game any more than the others .
Finally , in the context of Euro 2000 , there is an additional requirement that the stadium must be approved by the European Union and UEFA.
For all the stadiums which have been converted to accommodate an adequate number of visitors , UEFA has not only given its final authorisation to the process but has also been involved in the practical organisation of the stadium reviews .
I know something about this as I have worked , in my capacity as burgomaster of the town of Liege , on the preparation of a similar stadium .
To conclude , I regret to say that our colleagues are using arguments which are inaccurate and which can therefore only lead to wrong conclusions .
I am not the only one to think
