of south Asia .
With help from this Parliament , Bangladesh can share in that sense of belonging , in the wealth , the prosperity and ultimately the success that will bring .
Mr President , we very much welcome the cooperation agreement which is an affirmation of the good relations between the European Union and Bangladesh and provides a framework for their further expansion .
Article 7 of the agreement deals with regional cooperation , and I would firstly like to touch on two points which relate to Bangladesh 's regional situation and her relationship with neighbouring countries .
Although there is still some tension in border areas with India , there has been a great improvement in relations between the two countries .
Evidence of this has been the signature of the water sharing Treaty with India .
Following this there has been an interim agreement for sharing the waters of the Tista river and Indian assistance in preparing the project report on the proposed Ganges barrage which will be located on Bangladeshi territory .
The two countries have also recently begun talks on fighting floods which have deluged both countries with tragic consequences .
This cooperation is good news and to be encouraged and supported .
I have to say I do not see the same positive approach on the part of the Burmese authorities .
In fact , in the last few days , there have been troop deployments by the Burmese in support of Burmese attempts to construct a dam on the Naf river close to the Bangladesh border , sixty miles south east of Cox 's Bazar .
In the past , such actions have resulted in military action .
A particularly regrettable aspect of this activity is that anti-personnel landmines have reportedly been laid along the border by the Burmese .
Bangladesh is the only south Asian country to have signed the Ottawa Convention banning these weapons .
Deplorably , Myanmar is not a signatory to the Convention and there are indications that she has planted mines inside Bangladeshi territory including on agricultural land .
Myanmar should accede to the mine ban Treaty immediately and Bangladesh should take steps to ratify the Treaty .
I hope the Commission and Council will pursue these points in their dealings with both countries .
On a separate matter , the report describes the impact of population growth in Bangladesh on food security and economic development .
The population of 127 million is likely to grow to over 200 million by 2030 .
This represents a huge push factor for emigration including to the European Union .
Bangladesh must facilitate the re-admission of nationals who are illegally in the territory of an EU Member State .
This is recognised in the declaration attached to the cooperation agreement .
It is important that the Government of Bangladesh should take early steps to enter into negotiations with those Member States that so wish and to conclude mutually acceptable re-admission agreements .
I trust the Commission will also attach importance to this .
Madam President , we need to establish the facts in this case .
We have received certain assurances from Mr Solana but we know , and our Italian colleagues in particular will remind us of this , that it will be difficult for those whose sons have died of leukaemia to accept that assurance unreservedly .
These days we cannot easily accept death when better health and prosperity seem to have brought us so near to immortality .
We now need to reinforce Mr Solana 's assurance with repeated testing offered as widely as possible and with the maximum openness from the American authorities .
I have been asked , particularly by my colleague Lord Inglewood , who represents the area of Cumbria where test-firing of these weapons has taken place , to insist that the question as to the possible effect upon the civilian population should be taken into account when this testing is carried out .
If he is going to reply to this debate , Mr Solana might like to address that point .
There were a large number of British soldiers in the Balkan War and , of course in the Gulf , and as a British Conservative I will say this : Of course , we are concerned about the possible impact of the use of depleted uranium , but against the background of Mr Solana 's statement , we do not believe that NATO should adopt a moratorium on the use of such weapons .
We have to fight terrible wars against terrible people .
Such a moratorium could place our forces at a potential disadvantage and thereby potentially endanger more lives than the NATO forces .
As Mrs Wallstr√∂m has said : The real and immediate danger in the Balkans comes from general environmental degradation following years of neglect , corruption and war .
This is what the European Union needs to address while we monitor very carefully the results of medical testing .
In conclusion let me say that Mr Wurtz 's contribution was very revealing of the constant agenda of the left which aims to separate the European Union from the United States and would result in depriving Europe of any real influence in the world .

Mr President , I find it slightly bizarre to talk about the precautionary principle in relation to weapons , which are after all designed to be bad for your health .
The problem , of course , is that you only have to mention the word "uranium " and there is an outbreak of what can only be described as mass hysteria .
Of course , the illnesses and deaths must be investigated and I welcome the action taken by NATO member states to that end , but we have to make a judgment on the facts and the facts are very clear at the moment .
