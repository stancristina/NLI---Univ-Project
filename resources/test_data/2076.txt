this as Mr Desama would have said the same if he had been able to speak .
Our Dutch colleague , Mr van den Berg , also agrees as he asked me to say that in this case he has witnessed , in addition to a responsible attitude from the Belgians , ... ... very close cooperation with the Dutch government and it started at the very beginning and we extended this cooperation with France on account of the lessons of the World Cup and a host of other countries , 14 , I believe , including the United Kingdom , of course , because we wanted to have contacts with the countries which might send teams to Belgium .
Mr President , I will conclude by saying that the third and last point is that I think Parliament should make rules and not bother about taking chances .
Are we going to deal tomorrow or next week with the trains leaving Paddington Station ?
Mr President , there is no question in my mind that we all want to see the eradication of hooliganism in football at a European level and globally .
However , we must be careful not to do so in a manner that would restrict the enjoyment of the real supporters .
The issue must , therefore , be discussed at a European level , and we should guard against becoming embroiled in local discussions on the capacity and safety of specific stadiums , wherever they might be .
We must ask ourselves why measures taken in the past have repeatedly failed to create a culture of enjoyment in football for everybody .
I welcome the dialogue under way now between the Commission and sports and football clubs on how matters could improve .
The people who run the game are the people who , through constructive dialogue , will eventually be able to find answers to the blight of hooliganism and , it must be said , racism affecting this most popular of all sports .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I will be very brief but I rise on a matter which is dear to the hearts of most Members here .
On a number of occasions this week the Members bar has had in it visitors from outside Parliament and , actually , just members of the public .
I know a number of Members during the week have been unable to get any food .
Could we have some clarification from the Quaestors so that we can have a Members bar ?
We have a Members bar in Brussels .
I am not against taking one or two members of staff or whoever it might be into the bar , but to bring visiting groups of 20 or more into it is wrong .
I hope we can have some clarification .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I should like to move that we proceed to a vote straight away .
We had the debate on this this morning , we made our decision , let us just get on with it .
Vote - I am voting in favour of the Race Directive for the following reasons .
As a British Asian woman , I have experienced first-hand the damaging effects racism can have on people and communities .
Although there have been tremendous strides over the last few years to fight racism in all its forms , it still continues to blight people ' s lives .
For example , in my own region , the West Midlands , we have recently seen some worrying instances of racist violence .
The attack on the white partner of the world-class black athlete Ashia Hansen is a sickening example .
This report is a real breakthrough in reversing the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases .
Once the facts of the case are established , it will fall to those accused of racism to prove their innocence .
I particularly welcome the measures included in the directive which will allow individuals to take civil proceedings if they are victimised on the grounds of race .
I am also glad that the legislation takes account of the notion of "indirect discrimination " , where apparently neutral provisions can have an adverse effect on a person or a group of a particular race or ethnic origin .
Right-wing extremism is increasing , not just in Austria , but throughout Europe .
This directive provides some of the most effective anti-racism legislation that Europe has ever seen , and the most effective piece of race relations legislation to affect my own Member State since the 1976 Race Relations Act .
Minority groups must be given a greater stake in Europe .
The EU should pay more attention to their problems and aspirations .
We need to connect EU institutions to all the communities of the Union .
Europe must be inclusive , not exclusive .
We must tackle racism wherever and whenever it occurs .
The race directive is a stand against racism and a major step towards stamping it out .
- Given the worrying evidence that racism is on the rise I warmly welcome this report which aims to ensure equal treatment in the employment and social sector between persons of all ethnic backgrounds .
The rapporteur seeks to ensure a common minimum level of protection including the reversal of the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases and giving individuals the right to take civil proceedings if they are harassed or victimised on the grounds of race .
The Portuguese Presidency is to be congratulated for their readiness to put this matter on the Council ' s agenda .
Madam President , following your statement yesterday regarding the state of the air conditioning in the building , I have a slight problem in my position as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Canada .
