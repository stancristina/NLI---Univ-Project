It is a question of the EU' s making its presence felt to a much greater degree than there is a mandate for among the populations of Europe .
The point is that this House suffers from the obsession that more power to Parliament means the same thing as more democracy .
The crux of the matter is that the proposal and the reports from the Council and the Commission , as well as the motion for a resolution under consideration , contemplate a massive transfer of powers to the European Union .
In part it is about constructing a Fortress Europe , necessitated partly by the EU' s own policy , but what we are concerned with in particular here is the fact that these parts of the legal culture represent our democracies ' central nervous systems .
Co-operation between States is not working , so a supranational authority is needed .
It is a product of the fifteen Prime Ministers , but it has now come into its own , freed from supervision by the Member States , removed from national parliaments , light years from ordinary voters and tax payers , but still not subject to supervision by the EU Parliament .
Voter influence is being limited again .
The executive is again being strengthened at the expense of the legislature .
Mr Prodi promises he will listen and despatch a Commissioner every time we ask for one .
But it is Mr Prodi and the Commission itself who decide .
In the Commission itself , the directors-general have again taken power .
A lot of answers at the hearings were prepared by the old officials .
The problem was not that the Commission had covered up the misappropriations .
The Experts ' Group is therefore proposing a prosecuting authority and more supranational supervision in the Member States .
The result will be more centralism and more fiddling and , in five years ' time , a new Committee of Wise Men will be preparing a new report on increasing fraud within the EU , for it is secretiveness and centralism which give rise to fraud .
Supervision can uncover a small amount , but the solution is a radical curtailment of assignments and projects in Brussels so that , instead , the focus is upon those things that extend beyond national frontiers and can no longer be solved on a national or regional basis .
We must move in the direction of a slimmed down , open and democratic EU.
The democratic dream is that people ' s conditions of life should be equal .
I visited a number of private aid organisations .
The Commission ' s local representative had to ask about everything in Brussels because the people in Brussels were so dreadfully afraid of mistakes being made .
If the work is to be made efficient , it should be delegated .
If fraud and irregularities are there , the hammer should fall heavily upon those responsible locally .
It is therefore quite naturally unacceptable , Mr President , if the chain of command is now to be still longer , that is to say if the agency in Kosovo has to wait not only for orders from Brussels but also from Thessaloniki .
This must not happen .
We hope this does n' t cause too much damage .
Finally , Mr President , I would urge that , as far as possible , local , civil representatives of the Albanian population are relied upon , that the Albanians ' own talents are used and that they are not helped with things they can work out for themselves .
There are in fact parties which have won 80 % of the votes cast in elections .
Their leaders are there all the time .
And locally , too , there are leaders who can take over .
Mr President , I think it is only right that we should use most of this afternoon to discuss the smoking heap of ruins that the former Soviet Union has left behind .
In fact , the conflict in Dagestan has to do not only with the conflict between the Russian army and militant Islamicists from Chechnya but also with Russia ' s weakness , with oil in the Caspian Sea and with poverty in the northern Caucasus which is being increased by the lack of economic support from Moscow .
One small group consists of Chechens who are supporting the guerrilla leader Basayev in an attempt to incorporate Dagestan into Chechnya .
So the scene is set and all the ingredients are there for a tragedy of inconceivable proportions over the next few years .
They are one of the poorest republics in the Russian Federation . 80 % of young people between the ages of 18 and 35 are unemployed , and the average wage is below the Russian minimum wage .
Now , the population is receiving a greeting from Moscow in the form of bombings .
The problem is that journalists dare not travel to the place .
Nor do I think , therefore , that this Parliament is in a position to express a particularly precise opinion about this tragedy which is now unfolding .
But the resolution says what needs to be said , and the most important thing is that we now promise each other to keep a sharp eye open for any means of helping , any means of contributing to stability in this unhappy part of the world .
Mr Van Buitenen' s crime consists in having given documentation to a President of the EU Parliament .
These grounds must therefore be changed , and that is why I would ask you to put the issue on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents .
Let me first of all thank everyone for this debate .
I also think that
