flexibility in the negotiations on enlargement so that the majority of the countries can be involved in the collaborative work and participate in the next elections to the EU Parliament in 2004 .
The Treaty of Nice has been called an enlargement treaty , but it is a non-binding declaration which specifies the seats and weighting of votes in Parliament , while the binding enlargement protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam is to disappear .
Otherwise , we shall in fact end up saying yes to a treaty of enlargement , without obtaining any enlargement .
I think it is exemplary in the way it is written .
In Scandinavia , we have made a lot of progress at parliamentary level , both on the back and the front benches .
I should therefore like to say a couple of things about Denmark .
My own party has 4 female ministers at the moment and one male minister , plus a female leader of the parliamentary party and a female party chairman , and I am the only woman elected to the European Parliament .
We have fortunately never gone in for quota systems for , if that were the case , I believe that men would have begun to take advantage of the fact .
In the Scandinavian countries too , however , there are very few women in management posts , particularly at the highest level .
As was pointed out yesterday , the Swedish Prime Minister ' s delegation consisted only of men .
I personally believe that this has to do with the demands made of women in the hierarchical system .
Globalisation and ICT will pull in two different directions .
Globalisation has a concentrated structure , which is to the disadvantage of women who thoroughly lose out in the hierarchical system .
We must distinguish between those things from which we can all benefit in the Community , for example statistics that can be compared , and those areas in which we can clearly only offer each other inspiration .
Here , we are concerned with countries which may well have the legislation in place , but not the tangible arrangements , and joint aid on our part is really needed in this area .
I should like to draw your and Parliament ' s attention to a man-made disaster with which we shall be confronted in the course of the next few days .
A large number of prisoners in Turkish jails are on hunger strike , with some of them prepared to die because of the Turkish Government ' s policy towards prisoners .
Otherwise , we shall see a succession of fatalities next week , for the hunger strike has been going on for months .
Mr President , first of all a thank you to Mr Olsson for a really good report which is very much along the lines of what I think is a good proposal from the Commission .
As Mr Olsson said , it is unethical .
The definitive ban on using oestradiol stands to reason .
I also think it is important , however , that we now obtain a provisional ban on the use of the other five substances .
This would , in actual fact , be an example of a very proactive and commendable application of the precautionary principle , which I should very much like to support .
I should also like to support the rapporteur ' s view that it ought not to be possible to lift or weaken the bans without the Council ' s or Parliament ' s approval .
Let me also say finally that I find it quite incomprehensible that the American authorities should close their eyes to the risks involved in this production method .
I therefore hope that the renewed adoption of a ban on the use of this hormone-treated meat here in Europe might capture the attention both of American consumers and of the American health authorities so that we avoid having to have further discussions of this matter under the auspices of the WTO .
Denmark has a legal opt-out , meaning that we do not want to give the EU authority in the legal sphere .
If I have chosen to vote in favour of this report and its recommendations but not in favour of paragraph 5 concerning a common Public Prosecutor ' s Office for the EU , it is because we in Denmark have been afflicted in recent years by a large number of foreign criminals whom our old-fashioned judicial system and unduly lenient legislation are in no position to stop .
Since Denmark has the most indulgent legal system , criminals are flooding in on the principle of least resistance .
This EU initiative is necessary for giving an impetus to the recreation of law and order in Denmark .
We are obliged to get together with our European partners and combine our efforts at a level which gives constitutional states more power than criminals .
Some federalists are in favour of it because Eurosceptics are opposed to it .
Eurosceptics are necessarily opposed to shifting power from the national parliaments to Brussels .
In short , Nice means less democracy .
There must be an end to treaties behind closed doors .
Against this background , federalists and ' Euroroyalists ' will be able to discuss the way in which the future Europe is to be organised .
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is campaigning for open , slimmer and freer European cooperation .
We want to see the majority of all decisions taken in the Member States and in local areas .
The wealth of Europe lies in its diversity , and we cannot , for example , see any compelling need for the EU' s being able to alter a decision taken by Ã…rhus city council about the organisation of local bus services .
