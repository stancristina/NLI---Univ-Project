trade and respect for the rule of law .
We in my group believe that it is important , as the Treaty says , for us to keep the door to continued enlargement open .
That conversation must be conducted respectfully and straightforwardly , but we must also dare to stand up for the advantages of enlargement and to call attention to these .
It is they that set the pace , and we do what we can to speed things up .
This Parliament has given impetus to enlargement , and , a year ago , we stood in the Chamber in Brussels , wearing our orange scarves , and applauded President Yushchenko .
If we establish borders for Europe , they will interpret this in terms of our slamming the door in their face .
The fact is that the European Parliament has pushed this issue in the past , and we know that it is in actual fact possible to change the human rights situation by working hard and in unison .
I also share the analysis that the Council is rather weaker than had been hoped .
I hope that , in the future , the EU will adopt a unanimous and consistent approach and not be afraid to point the finger if a country with a place on the Council is guilty of seriously violating human rights .
That is because , if it acts in concert , the EU will be able to play a fantastically substantial role in the UN.
Now is the time of reckoning , and it is important not only to be able to act promptly when crises occur but also to remember too events that are not so sexy from the media’s point of view , that is to say the permanent human rights violations committed against people in somewhat forgotten , out-of-the-way places .
Resources are so limited that they are only sufficient for the purposes of cooperation , sharing good examples and disseminating information .
It is good that there would be careful monitoring to ensure that that did not happen .
However , it is in the relationship between public health and trade that Europe can make the biggest contribution in this area .
It is in these areas that the really big efforts must be made .
It has been self-evident to me that health is primarily an issue for the Member States , and I am delighted that the majority in this Chamber are of the same view .
Where health care and work in the public health field are concerned , we politicians must always regard people , even if they happen to be ill , as adults with rights and duties , including the right to control their own lives and health care .
At present , those who enjoy least freedom of movement in the EU are those who need it most , that is to say the patients .
We must have more freedom of choice and of movement .
These developments would be to the advantage of European patients .
I am , however , convinced that , within the not too distant future , we shall be health care consumers , and that is a shift in perspective that we must help bring about : victims yesterday , patients today and health care consumers tomorrow .
That would be a fantastic development that I believe would make us not only healthier but also freer .     The report recommends that the EU set up a separate Community programme in the field of health for the period 2007–2013 .
Quite a few of the objectives that the rapporteur would have the programme include for example , that of combating ill health caused by tobacco , alcohol and poor diet are ones that the Member States can pursue independently .
We are opposed to appropriating additional resources for this purpose and , on the basis of the above-noted reasoning , have chosen to vote against this report .     I think that designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs are often helpful because , in contrast to the dominance of the WTO’s trademark giants in the global market , they boost and develop local production and trade .
At the same time , account has to be taken , however , of the disadvantages of these designations .
The European Parliament’s two reports on this subject are only supplementary proposals in accordance with the consultation procedure .
We have thus chosen to vote against both reports .     We Swedish Social Democrats want to see an open EU in which solidarity is the rule and which welcomes new countries into membership on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria .
The June List is , in principle , well disposed to continued enlargement of the EU , provided that the proposed Member States share the fundamental values that constitute the basis of the EU in terms of what it stands for .
We have therefore voted against the report .     On 1 May 2004 , the EU was enlarged to include ten new Member States from Eastern and Central Europe .
However , we must also be receptive to new membership applications .
The borders cannot be closed .
I was suddenly given a very great deal of speaking time by my group and declined to use the last five minutes , even though I was offered the chance to sing a song .
We can do whatever we want : travel , study , work and set up house .
Consumers have been given access to a host of new products .
As border trade increases , so too does trade at an individual level , so people need to know what kind of goods they are buying , what to do if there is something wrong with them , how to complain and what kind of regulations exist
