, I should like to point out that I supported most of the amendments tabled by my honourable friends following discussion of my report in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
I address this report with satisfaction and joy , because I can see that the European Parliament and the European Commission are addressing such a serious issue in the same manner , with the same perception and the same approach .
However , the fact that it is a possibility , despite the fact that our scientists indicate to us that it is a very slight possibility , does not give us any justification for not preparing ourselves satisfactorily , adequately , suitably and as much as possible .
Of course , I always consider the contribution and cooperation of the European Parliament particularly important in our endeavour .
I refer to the example of the Solidarity Fund , which will help in the event of a pandemic to cover pharmaceutical requirements in terms of vaccines and anti-virals .
There is very close cooperation with the World Health Organisation .
The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products is cooperating in this sector , we are cooperating with industry , we are investing in research and we are trying to speed up the procedures and , of course , to increase the production capacity of the pharmaceutical industry .
By the end of the year , we shall be able to say that in total 16.5 % of the European population will be covered .
As regards the stockpile strategy , I agree with the committee 's view , but I would remind you that this subject was initially raised by two Member States , Belgium and France ; it was not the Commission 's proposal , it is a matter which comes within the competence of the Member States .
It would need to be with the unanimous agreement of the Member States , who would have to finance such an endeavour .
What is important now is for every Member State to accept its responsibilities and to set and cover its national targets .
As far as we as the European Commission are concerned , we shall exhaust all our practical , technical and legal potential in order to achieve the highest possible level of preparedness in the European Union .     – Mr President , I wish first to thank all my honourable friends for their opinions and then to make two comments on what I have heard .
That is why it is better that we prevent than that we cure .
No one disputes that the conventional framework of relations dates back to 1994 and cannot respond to the new geo-strategic and geo-economic circumstances .
The recent statements by the US Vice-President Nick Cheney may serve the interests of the United States , but they should have no bearing on the interests of the European Union and its Member States .
This results in higher costs of the final product to European consumers and the creation of inflation , which may reach as much as 2.5 % .
However , due to bureaucratic formalities , this system did not bring about any results , hence the need for the additional protocol of 18 December 1997 , which did not require the sentenced person 's consent .
Support for his family will be an important element in this .
Simplifying procedures , so that the transfer of sentenced persons is as flexible and with as little bureaucracy as possible , is our basic objective .
The proposal by the Member States refers only to 32 serious crimes and is based on a procedure for converting the sanction to another penalty which is compatible with the right of the executing state .
I think that this proposal is another important step towards the convergence of criminal law in the Member States of the European Union , which is an ambitious objective , but an objective which we must bear in mind , so that we can , at some point , unify criminal law .
We should not be afraid of the people of Europe .
You do not know , because Turkey does not allow you to know .
Well done .
Which country is violating Europe ?
Well done .
Which country is occupying 40 % of a country of Europe ?
In Turkey and you tolerate it .
My specific proposal is this : firstly , that if you go ahead and renew the PNR agreement on the basis of the third pillar , you only do so until 2007 .
It is a very serious proposal and it is time you started working on it .
Well done , Mr Barroso .
No Member State can meet the challenges of globalisation alone .
That is why those talking with because the Constitution is dead need to tell us how they will meet these challenges under the present circumstances .
The various Member States need to stop passing the buck to the European Union and , where they stand to benefit , claiming national successes .
This is a serious step towards the introduction of minimum criminal rules at EU level by the legislative institutions of the Union or , in other words , the 'communitisation ' of criminal law .
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the ΕU is being pushed through along with the enlargement of ΝΑΤΟ , the demand for the involvement of military forces and the concession of the sovereign rights of these countries to the audacious imperialist plans of the USA , ΝΑΤΟ and the ΕU , at the expense of the people .
Propaganda has been spread to the effect that the peoples of France and the Netherlands made a mistake and that the values of the capitalist EU come first , in other words the values of the free market and the interests of capital .
