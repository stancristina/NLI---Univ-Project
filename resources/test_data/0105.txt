There is still a lot to be done , however .
This directive complements another one which we approved not long ago , the directive on the protection of personal data and privacy in general .
In fact the amended Commission proposal to Parliament and Council dates from 1994 , thus there are four years between the initial proposal and the amended proposal .
If a phone call is made from Paris to London , there is no reason why one law should be applied in Paris and another in London .
Lastly , we believe that good work has been achieved .
The general directive on the protection of personal data came into force between the first and second readings , which makes this directive a sectoral directive , geared more to the management of these data in the specific field of communications than to actual protection , in relation to which constant reference is made - it could not be otherwise - to the general directive .
Everyone knows - and this was made perfectly clear at the hearing we held in the Committee on Transport and Tourism - that Eurocontrol was unable to fulfil its commitments to guarantee a harmonised air traffic control system in Europe because many of the Member States withdrew the supranational powers they had granted to the organisation in the past .
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Cornelissen for his superb work in drafting this report and , as usual with him , in everything he does .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , I think that a strategic plan should be submitted urgently with a view to achieving the harmonisation of air traffic management and to ensuring that this management remains within the transEuropean transport network , since these objectives are impossible to achieve on the basis of the content of the White Paper because , as the rapporteur believes , the White Paper does not contain any practical measures or action programmes .
When providing a public service , more extensive transport networks should be considered and planned , in which peripheral regions and rural areas are included ; these are perhaps less spectacular but of vital importance to the inhabitants .
We see it every year in the blatantly political outcome of the TACs .
Quite apart from the legal questions that raises , it was politically out of order and has proved to be a mistake .
Thank you again for being here , Madam Commissioner , and for shedding so much light on these matters .
Thus the lack of a multi-species TAC system forces some Community fleets to throw species of legal size back into the sea because they do not have a quota .
Finally , a third factor casts doubt on the current validity of the principle of relative stability as a constant of the common fisheries policy : the fact that markets for fish have been completely liberalized , frontiers no longer exist in the Union for marketing fish , and yet extremely rigid national barriers are still in place in terms of access to Community resources for Community fleets .
If we toughen and enforce control we will enormously reduce this serious problem of catching young fish .
Frustration at the narrow range of the decisions taken and the postponement of the most important ones , and uneasiness because , in my view , some of the decisions are inexplicable .
Uneasiness , Madam Commissioner , because the Commission 's letter freezing structural aid represents a sweeping measure with the same impact on Member States which , as Mrs Fraga says , have strictly complied with the reduction objectives of the MAGP and those who have ignored them .
She always gets straight to the point .
Perhaps this has to do with the application of later agreements , but we need more information to appreciate the consequences for our fishermen .
It is important that we develop this socio-economic potential .
Once the economic function of the forest is recognized as well as its environmental function , and once subsidiarity is taken into account , I think we need to be capable , at European level , of creating a scenario appropriate to investment in a forestry sector where ownership is extremely widespread and that means creating a dynamic climate for forestry investment , increasing the use of wood and its derivatives , a natural renewable material .
I would like to highlight the fact that the merit of the Thomas report is to examine a sector which not only has a commercial value , as stated in the report , but also has an impact on the environment and the countryside as a whole , with very different incidence across the European Union .
Secondly I want to mention the deadlock in the Council - I suppose the communication from the Commission is intended to break that deadlock - as regards those aspects of the statutes of companies , associations , cooperatives and mutual societies that have to do with worker information , consultation and participation .
Hence the need to approve these regulations and the funds to help implement them , expressed by the chairman of the Committee on the Environment .
But questions need to be put to the Commission , and some suggestions may also be in order .
But greater effort and cooperation between the Member States is still needed , because although there has been a reduction in the area burned , the number of forest fires has actually doubled since 1986 , and there are days - this statistic ought to be on the front page of the newspapers - when two fires break out every minute in Europe .
This debate and resolution come at a time when very disturbing statements are being made inside the European Union and feeding a climate of
