Only when the cost is integrated is the actual environmental cost integrated into the price .
An individual system for new waste benefits those manufacturers that use the best materials and construct those products that are simplest to recycle .
We obviously support the objectives of an increase in both the proportion of collected products and the proportion of the collected products which it will be possible to recycle .
We also think that it needs to be possible right now for individual countries to make tougher demands upon this type of product .
Mr President , I too want to join the chorus of people offering congratulations but perhaps also extend the congratulations to our own shadow rapporteur , Mrs Van Brempt , who has done some truly excellent and demanding work .
They are being given the opportunity to continue to develop their ecodesigns and to manufacture their products in ways that are more in accordance with environmental considerations than the ways used by many other companies .
Flame retardants and their residues can be found in mother ' s milk in places as far away as Greenland , among the Inuit , where the levels are more often than not much higher than those recommended by the WHO .
We also know that people can experience other types of disorder , such as weight loss , as a result of ingesting these substances and in spite of never having asked to have them in their bodies .
I think that this fits in extremely badly with what we are to be discussing this afternoon , that is to say sustainable development .
Mr President , an error has crept into the printed Swedish version of Amendment No 5 .
We Moderates consider this directive to be urgently needed for protecting the environment .
We have interpreted it as follows : the financing referred to in Paragraph 2 applies to scrapping in quite general terms .
With the above interpretation , we voted in favour of the report .
Are you going to touch upon the issue of energy conservation ?
I am just mentioning some of the areas you touched upon at the most recent Summit .
I am pleasantly surprised that the President of the Commission mentions both political leadership - which I consider to be one of the most important aspects - and the local level .
What does that mean for the European Union ' s activities when it comes to the ways in which we trade , create investments etc ?
I must nonetheless regret the fact that the proposal comes only a few weeks before the Gothenburg Summit , which is why a real dialogue with all the parties possessing an interest in this issue is now impossible .
The EU' s activities in a long list of areas - trade policy , fisheries policy , energy policy etc - naturally have consequences for the situations in other countries .
Dark clouds are nonetheless visible on UNICEF' s horizon because of the decision not to elect the United States to the Commission for Human Rights .
We must have intelligent sanctions .
We must support education , in particular , together with the rights-based approach you talked about .
I think that overheating in the Irish economy demonstrates the problems of having one currency and one economic policy in countries with very different economic conditions .
I also think it is obvious that , in future discussions , we must take this into account when we look at the need to develop the discussion on European governance .
I think the World Bank has other systems , but it is precisely the management of the IMF that ought to be able to meet and coordinate their efforts .
In Sweden and Finland , we already have legislation requiring all employers to prepare annual equality plans , including plans for securing equal pay for work of equal value .
Mr President , Commissioner , I support what the rapporteur said about the importance of losing no time in getting this package approved .
Ice classification must also be taken into account in this context .
There are two interesting factors in this context .
The second factor is that the Erika had been approved by an Italian classification society .
There has been a lack of supervision of classification societies .
Such a system would have placed a number of question marks over this particular classification company and certainly over a number of others , too .
The Ievoli Sun was only eleven years old and fitted with a double hull .
A normal life has not been possible for the Palestinians for a long time and conditions are getting worse all the time .
The Palestinian Authority is in deep financial crisis since the Israeli transfer payments were halted and normal economic activities ceased in the area .
Violence in the form of mortar fire , car bombs and suicide bombings is increasingly affecting Israel .
Quite simply , the security situation has got worse .
Therefore the peace process must continue .
No one dares to show an example of reconciliation or flexibility as it is feared that this will be seen as weakness .
The EU welcomes and supports the Mitchell Commission ' s report and proposals , as it does the Egyptian-Jordanian peace initiative , which is based on agreements in which Israel took part .
Both the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative and the Mitchell Report demand a freeze on all settlements .
The Mitchell Report also suggests that the Israelis should consider withdrawing from controversial and vulnerable settlements .
The EU has encouraged Israel to start to withdraw from its settlements .
The EU has defined its positions on the issue in the Berlin Declaration of March 1999 and in the New York Declaration of 12 September 2000 .
These now have to be concluded and a solution found based
