The fact that the Council found cause to make a declaration in this case must naturally be seen in the light of the following .
The situation was so acute that there was an increased risk of war .
The Council has been very much involved in the international work to encourage de-escalation , and in this connection the Council saw the election in Pakistan and the provincial elections in the Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir as an important step along the way towards an improvement in the situation .
It is in the light of this hope for the future that the Council 's declaration is to be seen .
I would ask Mr Cushnahan to believe this and take comfort from it , and I would like to assure him that Mr Cushnahan 's criticism has not been weakened in any way by the fact that the Council said what it said .
So can we not now allow each other this : that there is a need for election observers , that there is a need for independent reports which draw attention to everything that is not as it should be .
I have mentioned five major points of criticism here , but at the same time in such a crisis-ridden region of the world there is a need for the Council to attempt to find something to hold on to in terms of a little bit of progress which can provide a hope of peace and which at any rate provides a hope of avoiding war .
I feel strongly that it is possible to work towards both - both towards complete democracy and towards pragmatic attempts to improve the opportunities for peace .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Council has been asked to make a statement on the subject of social dialogue and the tripartite social summit .
Close contact based on reciprocal trust between the public authorities and the parties of the labour market at European , national and local level is of crucial importance for strengthening economic progress , prosperity and social integration in Europe .
The Laeken European Council and the Barcelona European Council concluded that such a social summit should be held prior to each spring summit .
The Danish Presidency gave the proposal high priority and worked towards a rapid resolution .
The Presidency wishes to work towards a position being taken at the Council summit on 3 December on how the efforts towards establishing the social summit are to continue .
However , there is nothing to prevent the social summits being held on an informal basis without the basis of a decision , as has been the case to date .
I hope that this answers the question of what the Council intends to do to establish the social summit .
The issue of consultation with Parliament has not yet been discussed by the Council .
I would like to end by thanking Parliament for having raised the issue of social dialogue and the tripartite social summit .
I hope that we will have a good discussion and I can assure you that the Danish Presidency will take care to include the points of view put forward today in its further deliberations .
Mr President , we make no secret of the fact that there is a certain amount of disagreement concerning the legal basis for these activities .
Indeed , it was supported by everyone both in Laeken and in Barcelona , so there is no disagreement on that .
In brief , I can say that the Commission proposes to use Article 202 as the legal basis .
It merely refers to the articles in the Treaty that specify the measures which the Council can take .
And according to the Council 's Legal Service , that does not provide a legal basis .
And when the Commission proposes that the summit should consist of the Council 's presidency at Head of State and Government level , the Council 's Legal Service believes that the Council (employment , social policy and health and consumer protection ) is not able to make a decision on the introduction of a summit at Head of State and Government level .
Neither does the Council 's Legal Service agree with the Commission 's proposal that the results of the summit - which is to take place the day before the European Council - are to be presented to the European Council in the form of a report .
Moreover , Article 2 sets out time periods for drawing up the provisional agenda of the European Council and the submission of contributions to the discussions and these time periods are not complied with under the proposal .
It simply requires some further discussion .
But let us see whether we can make any progress with it .
Sometimes you want to ask the lawyers if they cannot try to reach agreement before letting us politicians know , but that is probably easier said than done .
These were a couple of issues .
I can assure Mr Ettl that we are not wasting time .
However , until we find a correct formal solution we may have to continue with informal summits , that is , follow the informal procedure .
I do not want to start a major legal debate here in Parliament .
However , we are prepared to continue the more informal dialogue until a solution can be found .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to have this chance to discuss the expansion of the Lamfalussy procedure to include all financial services .
The European Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has raised some issues concerning the restructured FSPG and the European Parliament 's participation in the discussions on policy in the financial
