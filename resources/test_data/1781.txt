.
I trust that Parliament will be equally convinced when it comes to vote .
The wording that has now been adopted for Article 18 and Annex VII to some extent takes account of our concerns , but we are not completely happy with this as things stand .
I am deliberately not talking about giving priority to rail , but it would already be a great step forward if we could create a level playing field between road and rail .
It seems to me that referring to subsidiarity in this context is too simplistic .
Nevertheless , we have not let ourselves be influenced by the urgency of the Council 's timetable , and we are very pleased that we are able to give this subject rather more attention today .
If we do not at long last collaborate closely , the next crisis could be fatal for us .
But we trust that , in coming years , this debate will be held in the autumn of each year preceding the year to which the programme being debated relates , as agreed .
We want Stockholm , then Gothenburg , and finally Laeken under the Belgian Presidency to send out signals in this direction , so that this sort of conference can start work in 2002 .
Mr President of the Commission , I call on you to conduct a public information campaign , so that we can convince our voters back home that the European Union needs to enlarge and that it is in the historic interest of Europe to do so .
It is just , Mr President , that when your Vice-President , Mr Barnier , states during a recent discussion in committee that we should propose a sort of forum for the post-Nice process in which everyone is involved - members of parliament , civil society - then I say no , not if this forum is in lieu of a convention .
Here too you must make a clear , unequivocal statement in support of Parliament .
I admit that .
It is not enough to depict this year as a full-blown discussion forum involving the civil society , which Mr Swoboda rightly criticised in his analysis .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , I have three brief comments to make .
It is creeping intergovernmentalism - encouraged by the Council - which led Europe into the Nice impasse and on this , President Prodi , we are the Commission 's natural allies .
But we need a common concept .
I really would urge you - and I have read everything that you have proposed very carefully - to check if any of the subjects within the framework of a sensible division of powers are perhaps not absolutely necessary .
What exactly is good governance ?
We are opposed to extending the list of exceptions ; some of the contentious points can perhaps be resolved between the parties , because we too are keen to find a satisfactory solution which we can all live with .
After 18 months of deliberation in the Council .
At the same time , however , we must guarantee wide public access in the interest of cultural diversity .
That is a directive for a citizens ' Europe .
I think that there is every reason to offer a separate regulation for public radio .
In both areas there are huge opportunities , but there also risks which must be contained by suitable legislation .
We have not clarified the question of exports of GMOs to non Member States .
Fast action is called for .
Unsold beef , the lack of consumer confidence and escalating costs are a highly explosive mixture which could decimate beef-farming and agricultural policy .
With all due respect for the ethical aspects , with all due sympathy for those who say that it is a tragedy to destroy the cattle , we must not delude ourselves .
Now to Mrs Roth-Behrendt 's question as to whether we should change over from quotas to direct payments .
Mr President , Commissioner , now that the Greens are finally in clover , does it not make sense to choose the much easier path through the whole complicated premium structure by going for a climate-related grassland premium and forgetting the rest ?
Since these are national measures , national assistance rules apply .
This means that the truth must be told about what is written on the outside of a product .
The question of removing risk material and , more importantly , the question of whether the meat is from animals which were tested and whether the country in question guarantees that the animals were not fed with feedingstuffs containing meat and bonemeal are clear and this must be implemented accordingly .
This means that tests are carried out before storage , and above all each Member State can make its own decision .
There has been a great deal of discussion about this request , and it is evident that the somewhat more complicated wording now found in the text is more to the liking of those representing the Council than the very clear requirement which the European Parliament had originally formulated .
The European Parliament has set a very successful example through its input into legislation reducing emissions from motor cars , with the introduction of EURO III and IV , and also emissions from both light and heavy commercial vehicles , with a view to improving air quality in Europe 's cities and sensitive environmental areas .
Mr Goodwill and I have built in a slightly longer lead time for certain smaller manufacturers who would have particular problems in converting their production lines .
Because at first reading the Commission brought forward a proposal comprising over 100 pages of detailed regulations , and during the first reading debate all the groups agreed to reject the directive for reasons of principle .
