the Maastricht Treaty , monetary union and the convergence criteria .
If you do not and my fears become a reality in the Member States , while you continue to insist that only a monetary free market can ensure the future of the people of Europe , it could mean the end of the European ideal as far as the public is concerned , which is the very worst thing that could happen .
Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs recommends not .
The Maastricht Treaty expressly provides for this possibility in Article 103a( 2 ) , but no action has yet been taken under it .
I would therefore call on the Commission to undertake to develop a proposal under Article 103a( 2 ) and to forward it to Parliament and the Council .
The stability pact will continue to have a destabilizing effect as long as there is no budgetary equilibrium , since Member States with large deficits are required to pay substantial fines .
Balance of payments assistance is an artificial device which may help efforts in the short term , but cannot offer a structural solution if that is what is required .
In other words , there is a price to pay .
For the countries which have opted out , the facility should be available only until they meet the criteria : beyond that point , our solidarity with them should extend as far as their solidarity with the rest .
Mr President , a few weeks ago we read headlines in all the newspapers about how far Europe was lagging behind America and Japan .
At international business meetings , the word Europe is only ever mentioned as an example of how not to do things .
The miracle is no longer working in Germany : in fact , it is not happening at all .
Our share of the world market can never grow as quickly as the market itself , and the newly industrialized nations are too big to enter the world economic stage unnoticed .
He is right to say that we can only maintain our social model and thus our standard of living if we can rely on an industrial sector that is in a position to compete .
Finally , we are also looking forward to having the results of the pilot projects that the Commission has launched , which the Industry Ministers are to examine on 24 April .
That is why I am rather reluctant to give quantitative estimates .
Here too I must ask for your understanding .
Has the Commission assessed these various control methods and , in particular , what are the implications for the payment of compensation , which is partly to come from European funds ?
On a point of order , Mr President , I regret the fact that although Question Time is clearly divided into three parts , you fail to keep to this and the third part keeps disappearing .
The main thing - and I am always glad to see the Commissioner here so that I can pass on my thoughts in person - is that all directives dealing with bankruptcy , such as this one , show just how urgently we need to harmonize bankruptcy law .
The second point I would like to make is that we unfortunately had the wrong idea about the monitoring report .
First point : accessibility .
Mr President , I am only here to say bravo , Christine !
For example the fact that in the European Parliament 's budget many of the appropriations earmarked for information were axed simply because the necessary decisions were not taken in time to have those appropriations made .
As Mr Wynn has indicated , a number of rapporteurs have been busy on the various parts of the budget and I have addressed the whole issue of the structural funds .
Commissioner Liikanen finally helped me out on that after I had waited one and a half months , though that was not his fault .
It is all the graver in that the European Union keeps telling the outside world how serious it is about combating fraud and irregularities .
And I am confident that the measures taken will get things back on track .
A fraud level of 23.5 % in1994 was cut in 1995 to 10 % of that .
At the same time we can demand that they respect human rights , a condition of the agreement .
But more is needed to get the peace process going again .
Notably , an important opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations was not considered at the proper time by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and that is a pity .
I agree with the European Commission and the Council that recognition of a licence suspension or withdrawal comes under the responsibilities of the third pillar and is thus outside the scope of this proposal .
That will ensure confidence not only internationally but also locally , Mr President-in-Office .
It is quite curious that we do not yet have a common visa policy although I hope that the IGC will move forward at least on this point .
And I am talking just of Strasbourg , not of Milan , Amsterdam , The Hague or Paris where it is much , much worse .
That is why we are debating this subject here today .
These 200 billion ECU are incurred by the damage which motor traffic causes to agriculture , water quality and public health .
The reduction in ozone-creating substances which the Commission proposes will mean that only 37 % of the territory of the European Union will meet the standard laid down by WHO .
There is after all talk of a very precarious interplay between vehicles and available fuels .
We cannot afford to duck our responsibilities here .
