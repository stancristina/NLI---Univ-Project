We consider that the focus on Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism should now be mirrored by equal interest in the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue ; this dialogue is crucial for relations between the West and the Islamic world , an issue we feel to be as important today as Eastern Europe has been in the past .
We wish to confirm our conviction that there is no incompatibility between a strong European undertaking and equally strong transatlantic solidarity .
There are at least two lines of action that we intend to promote : firstly , restoring a relationship of greater trust with Israel with a view to broader and more structured mutual cooperation , and , secondly , implementing the plan - already launched by Italy at European Councils and G8 Summits - for rebuilding the Palestinian economy , which could act as a tangible , effective incentive in negotiations between the parties .
We will endeavour to work on these points , focusing on the mobilisation of adequate financial resources , the gradual implementation of a common readmission policy and the integrated management of external borders .
My hope is that , during the Italian Presidency and looking onwards to the Irish Presidency , we shall succeed , with the cooperation of all those involved and with the particular help of the new Member States , in restoring to our institutional giant something of its lightness and its original energy .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights will be enshrined in the Constitutional Treaty .
A permanent presidency of the European Council is likely to bring overlapping and conflicts with the Commission .
As we push on with enlargement , we also need to fully implement the pre-accession strategy for the candidate countries .
We are preparing a number of proposals along these lines for Parliament and the Council to consider and develop .
Perhaps the clearest example of this fact is the relationship between the United States and the European Union in the field of international trade .
Competition from our trading partners and the ageing of our population make such reforms extremely urgent .
Secondly , at the Brussels European Council last March , I raised the issue on behalf of the Commission of the need to give fresh impetus to completing the infrastructure necessary for European development and for supporting research , increasing spending to reach our target of 3 % of the Union 's GDP , as , moreover , is provided for in the goals we ourselves set at Lisbon .
Approval of these measures in the course of the Italian Presidency will help to improve the Union 's economic and social outlook .
Lastly , the Commission has fulfilled its responsibility to launch a wide-ranging internal debate on the post-2006 Financial Perspective .
In the autumn , we will be presenting our political project for the enlarged and reformed European Union for discussion at the December European Council under the Italian Presidency .
For vision , because we really are laying the foundations for the Europe of decades to come , and we cannot accept short-term solutions that merely respond to the - albeit difficult - current economic climate .
However , we realise that just continually protesting will not suffice : we prefer to act .
We must recapture the spirit of the Delors plan and two powerful principles contained in the Commission 's White Paper on Transport Policy , which I am afraid we sometimes all appear to disregard : investments must serve not just to fill Europe with infrastructure but to promote economic and social cohesion too .
Italy is second only to Spain when it comes to breaches of environment legislation .
President Prodi , in a sector in which the Union has genuine competences and international responsibilities , we fear that the unnecessarily complicated infringement procedure is no longer sufficient , and that by maintaining an excessively tolerant attitude and giving more consideration to the details of form than to substance we are in serious danger of helping to render Community legislation on the environment completely ineffective .
We must adopt an initiative , and we will support you if you do so , with a view to convening a regional conference for the Caucasus in which all the current conflicts can be addressed without fail .
Mr President , a constantly-changing society demands from politics new debates , the ability to take rapid decisions and , above all , the willingness to reflect deeply , with full knowledge of the facts , on the geopolitical and different economic and cultural situations which , in some respects , contribute to the ever-widening gap between north and south and between citizens .
The urgency of the migration issue demands an overall view .
In this connection , a more effective European food safety policy becomes particularly important in order to safeguard the quality of products and to protect their origins , thus safeguarding the citizens ' health , which is the Union 's main asset .
We therefore call for the drawing up of rules to stop a tool which exists to facilitate communication between citizens being transformed into a tool for use by those who violate the laws of the national states of the Union .
On 7 June , Mr Berlusconi , in Jerusalem , you said , and I quote : ' In the future , Europe must include Israel .
Similarly , as regards Turkey , we have always heard Russia , Turkey and Israel specified .
This is Christian Europe !
We Radicals applauded !
If you comply with these two requests then we will be more than content .
As far as the rest is concerned , I wish you and us all luck .
Europe has chosen Rome to be the venue for the signing of the first Constitution : this is a political result of great significance , an historic act of recognition for Italy and for its freely elected government .
Mr
