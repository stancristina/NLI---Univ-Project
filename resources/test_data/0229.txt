It is incomprehensible that the committees should be short of staff to carry out preparatory work at the same time as legislation work has increased .
Parliament must be capable of high standards in its treatment of matters , as , otherwise , the Commission and the Council will become too overbearing and above all because the quality of legislation will otherwise suffer .
We are very enthusiastic about this report and have adopted it unanimously .
A good scenario would be one which gave rise to a pilot project for Russia and our whole next enlargement process .
Our trade would increase and people would be able to move freely .
A bad scenario would be one in which the gap in living standards grows wider , creating unrest within the Union , whereas unrest is now to be found outside the Union .
This is therefore a scenario we do not wish to see , although it must be borne in mind that now is a time of opportunity for us , if Russia 's new administration understands that .
Russia has a lot of problems and one is that relations between Russia and the United States of America have been of very little benefit to the Russian people , who do not really understand the situation .
The age of eloquent diplomacy is over for good .
The Community , whose basic intentions were by nature political in the views of its founding fathers , started by using economic measures .
For example , it is not possible to create a fully functional internal market without strengthening the political Union .
Community decision-making must be able to retain its natural flexibility .
For that reason we should focus on mechanisms with which we can resolve such conflicts .
In the debate on competence some are looking for a way to transfer competence back to the Member States , which would be a step backwards for integration .
This is the sort of sentiment , often expressed in the spirit of the principle of subsidiarity , that we must not be taken in by .
Madam President , today we have before us reports that are among the most important this week .
The draft report is rather pessimistic in its assessment of developments to date .
We , nevertheless , have to take care that we do not try to respond to exponential negative development with a linearly developing policy , in which case we would always be lagging behind reality .
Partnership projects are built on the principle that good models are easy to copy .
The social , economic and ecological development of societies and democratisation are closely connected as we have seen many times in adverse situations .
However , there are good examples too .
Similarly , we must make a consistent effort to prevent social and ecological dumping in global markets with reference to the rules agreed in the WTO .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr Miranda , who is presenting a report that has the significant aim of strengthening consensus between the EU and the UN and agreeing an approach that will produce the best return on the resources used .
The report quite rightly reminds us that progress in partnership and above all in the attainment of goals is only achieved to any significant degree on the basis of careful analysis .
It is not enough , however , to assess the results achieved so far in the partnership , which are obviously extremely important also .
In fact , we are remarkably unaware of those values , which have also served as the basis of the EU 's own development from a Europe that in many ways had been knocked about by wars to the world 's leading political and commercial player .
If I may use commercial language , the UN is actually a brand .
The EU and its Member States are making significant use of resources in matters of development .
One such way of making the use of resources more efficient would obviously be common representation in the UN and its special organisations .
From 2004 , when the number of EU members will be much greater than now , this will be more essential than ever .
Nothing else will do .
I am especially pleased with the principles written in the report by Mrs Rodr√≠gues Ramos , according to which , in the future it must also be possible to carry out agriculture in all the existing and future areas of the EU.
Everyone talks about it but it has not yet been decided how it can be realised .
It is true that in existing EU policy , too much money is distributed to large farms and even also to the most productive areas in the European Union without the EU guiding the use of this funding to promote structural or sustainable development .
Therefore , modulation should also be a way for funding to be reallocated for use by the EU as a whole for the sake of food quality and safety .
Fortunately we did not wait for this draft to stagger in as otherwise the other directives would also have been late too .
Unlike paper-based advertising , this is often at the expense of the recipient .
I also support several other compromises .
This , ladies and gentlemen , is about the fact that business on the Internet must be safe and that health information must be able to be stored on it reliably .
Security has become a major issue on the Internet , and therefore , as presented in the e-Europe 2005 programme , we need a network security unit which monitors security but also respects civil rights on the net .
A precondition for obtaining the support of our citizens is that our environmental work is transparent
