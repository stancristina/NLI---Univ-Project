So I am convinced that greater regional participation in the planning , monitoring , implementation and evaluation of these funds will help improve and optimize them , and that this improvement will include the deepening of the environmental aspect of cohesion policies .
We must give the committees monitoring work in progress greater power , and increase cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and NGOs .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mrs OomenRuijten , not only on her excellent assessment of the Commission proposal that we are discussing today , but also on her ability to look ahead .
In this context , the Commission proposal seeks to extend the possibility of choosing between the unemployment systems of the Member State of employment and the Member State of residence to frontier workers .
I should like to end , Mr President , by congratulating the rapporteur and underlining the fact that this report represents a major step forward in the promotion of workers ' rights - promoting the mobility of EU workers - and in the completion of the internal market .
Why should a private pension fund be more viable than a state social security scheme ?
Achieving a high level of employment will strengthen the prospects for state social protection .
All the rest is mere rhetoric and populism .
But we all know that price is not the only factor to determine the competitiveness of a product : there is also quality , design , innovation , and so on .
However , I regret to say that I am unable to support the report by Parliament 's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , because at the present time , I cannot endorse a report which seeks to transfer the Member States ' funding responsibilities to the European Union .
It is rare that so many Members speak on an issue of concern to us : in this case the future of European social welfare systems , which have many points in common - as previous speakers have pointed out - in the sense that all the Member States have some kind of state and collective provision for social protection and income support for those citizens who need it most .
To date , Parliament has set up two committees of inquiry : one into fraud in the Community transit system , and the other into BSE.
I hope that as Members read this report , they will take note of any shortcomings it may have , so that these can be reviewed and rectified before its publication .
Consequently , whatever flaws it may have - and , of course , your rapporteur acknowledges those flaws - they are the responsibility of the members of the Committee of Inquiry as a whole .
As a number of scientific experts explained to our committee , at some point the British Government relaxed the rules governing this process , with the effect that the meal was not completely sterilized .
Indeed , although Commission officials carried out 37 veterinary inspections in the UK between 1990 and 1994 , none of those checks was on BSE.
However , the European Community itself does not abide by the principle of the separation of powers - and it has even been said that if the European Community asked to join the European Community , it could not be accepted because it does not abide by that principle .
The European Parliament is accusing the Commission of weakness .
At that point , and for some time afterwards , the Commission displayed tremendous weakness .
Consequently , the citizens of the Community are now calling for increased transparency and information .
As for the present Commission , there is the unacceptable lifting of the embargo on gelatine , and its attempts to conceal the truth and shift its own responsibilities onto Parliament when the latter decided to carry out this inquiry .
While recognizing the good intentions of those who are confusing the past and the future in their resolutions and threatening to table a motion of censure in a few months ' time - in November , so they say - we profoundly disagree with their approach , which is not in keeping with the European Parliament 's basic duty to exercise control , or with the priority of tabling an unconditional motion of censure , without any strings attached .
Mr Santer , the seriousness of the Commission 's failings in its handling of the BSE affair , and the risks to public health which they produced , are clearly demonstrated by the Committee of Inquiry 's report .
The fact is that the extent of the committee 's recommendations was made necessary by the scale of the responsibilities incurred by the Commission , the Council and , of course , the British Government .
The effects of the mishandling of the BSE crisis are irreversible , and the seriousness of the Commission 's failings in its handling of the affair , and the risks to public health to which they gave rise , are clearly demonstrated by the Committee of Inquiry 's report .
That is why my group supported the tabling of a censure motion .
We are currently engaged in a long and momentous political debate , in which I shall endeavour not to repeat what has already been said .
We are dealing with an issue which we now know affects human health , and in respect of which neither silent support , nor giving a free rein - or turning a blind eye - nor political alliances are acceptable .
We all know how the College of Commissioners works , and if it has failed to abide by the interinstitutional agreement - as it has done - which requires it to make such documents available , it may be
