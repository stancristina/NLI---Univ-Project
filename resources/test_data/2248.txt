I think it is a very good thing for our citizens to know where they can obtain satisfaction .
So it is fair to say that this is an important directive which will improve the freedom of movement in goods and services in the Community .
In the name of Parliament and the voters we represent I call on Member States to comply as swiftly as possible with the requirements contained in this directive which serves the best interest of all citizens and businesses in Europe .
My thanks to Mr Manzella for stressing that the delegation on Latin America needs to address this report .
Mr Marín knows that better than anyone , the San José dialogue .
Cooperation was one-sided in the form of development cooperation .
The Commission statement is a beginning .
The Union must continue to foster regional integration on economic and other matters and must maintain contacts with these regions .
Cooperation on preventive diplomacy , peacekeeping and the like are matters for the world community .
Because most of the governments in this region do not see the importance of this at all .
In Guatemala , for example , a trade union organization was banned outright by the authorities only last year .
I hope this report of Mr Carnero 's will be favourably received by the Commission .
According to some estimates there are usually 60 to 70 extra planes in the air as a result of the congestion .
If policy remains unchanged , with increased fragmentation of Europe 's airspace , the consequences will be disastrous .
How are we to prevent a veto by one Member State from obstructing implementation by another Member State ?
So this proposal certainly means progress .
Whilst the benefits of freedom of movement for individuals , goods and services were formerly perceived as self-evident , it is the drawbacks which now seem to be receiving an increasingly high profile .
From the economic , ecological and social points of view it is absolutely vital that public transport should play a more prominent role .
It would be a good thing if the initiative were taken to assemble comparable data and see if more comparability can be brought into quantities which are currently often not comparable .
Secondly , how far does the 'duty ' to provide public services and public transport go ?
There is a clear insinuation here against the integrity of the President of Parliament .
Although expectations were not all that high prior to the start of this conference , the outcome may be deemed surprising .
Fortunately a clash between rich and poor nations was avoided by the decision that the ILO is the only organization in which the question of social standards can be dealt with and that trade measures are not the right way to impose these standards .
A lot more will have to be done at WTO level to combine policy on the environment , social standards and development policy to further liberalization .
I think that is a wise decision , if only to preserve the unity of the European Parliament over this procedure .
It is a step along the road to reciprocal liberalization , but it is also a step along the way towards stability in the region .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , first and foremost I should perhaps convey to you my best and heartfelt wishes for a successful social year in 1997 and a happy outcome to the IGC.
Already during the debate on the 1995-1996 social action programme Parliament pressed in Mr Hughes ' report for all directives concerning worker participation which were currently blocked to be unblocked .
The Union must ensure that social dialogue is and remains an essential element in our European social model .
I shall thus be happy to support the EPP Group 's Amendment No 2 on behalf of my own Group .
We are very much in favour of it .
That is one thing .
The second thing is that we must take account of the two main corporate systems in Europe , namely the monistic and the dualist systems , and we must find appropriate forms for them .
I am actually very glad we have produced this opinion before his committee has started work .
It is the view of my Group , and my own view too , that this kind of shopping around will ultimately leads to a downward spiral in the quality of terms of employment and workers ' rights .
I thus think that European cofinancing of research into the quality of the forests is a good thing .
Now most of the money is already going not into observation via the systematic network , but into model and demonstration projects .
Mr President , I am very pleased that at least the Council is present .
Because that is basically what we want : we want to have good cooperation between the Member States so that the common customs tariff functions .
My sole question to the Commission is : will it stand firm , possibly even going to court to make the Council accountable for a failure of the internal market system as it now stands to function ?
We can do a lot to help here , to ensure that the independence of these countries is established once and for all , that democracy , a very new concept there , is developed , that constitutional rule becomes the norm , that human rights are upheld and a civil society becomes possible .
Mr Schwaiger has already touched on the economic aspects .
Mr President , once again we are fortunate in being able to benefit from the expertise of Hélène Carrère d'Encausse .
The role of neighbouring countries which relapse into a centuries-old reflex of power politics is naturally not conductive to stability .
The effectiveness of collective
