I am extremely pleased with your reply , which is what we would have liked to have heard from the Austrian Presidency , which gave a completely unintelligent reply last month .
I really think this is a good start .
As previously mentioned , the matter has already been discussed in the Council , but I would like to mention something that was also touched on by Mr Metten , namely that there can be extenuating circumstances in connection with state aids .
I would like to emphasise that aid should be given during periods of restructuring , and that it should always be temporary .
So some of our competition money could well be used for development rather than aid .
I realise that Mr Van Miert does not have so many people at his disposal , but I hope that it will be a good and effective simplification .
I think that is a good thing , which could make this more effective and transparent and improve legal certainty .
I also think it is good for countering national bureaucracy and bad faith .
It is very difficult for a country to admit that it has made a mistake .
We have had a lot of cases in shipbuilding , but as politicians we must all commit ourselves to looking forward .
I also believe that , year by year , we should look at how it can be improved .
I would therefore like to wish the Commissioner and the Commission good luck in future , and point out that Parliament supports the Commission in this area .
Mr President , there is a difference between blame and accountability .
The Europe of Nations Group does not have an opinion about who is to blame .
We are voting to censure the college because the whole Commission is accountable and must accept responsibility for the fact that so much has gone wrong and will continue to go wrong .
If the political leadership does not accept accountability , then there is no accountability .
The budget would then become a matter of helping oneself .
Mr Santer is a prisoner in his own fortress .
The Director of Personnel is a prisoner .
Mr Santer reacted firmly when he should not have done , but he was not firm when he should have been .
Instead , he ought to sack the people who do not give the elected representatives what they ask for .

Mr President , I shall be very brief .
On all the main points , I agree with the views expressed by my Swedish colleagues , Mr Sj√∂stedt and Mrs Lindholm .
There are two trends in the two proposals we are considering which are decisive for our group , for me personally and for the movement I represent in Denmark .
We must oppose the trend to communitarise criminal law and all other areas of law , including police cooperation - in other words , the transfer of the third pillar to the first .
It is an alarming development which runs counter to national legal traditions , especially the Danish one , which I support .
Mr President , I find it deeply depressing when animal welfare is only taken really seriously in this Parliament when it is a question of fox trapping or seal hunting and when it is indigenous populations who have to pay the price with their own welfare , which is sometimes even more precarious than that of the animals .
This is somewhat illogical when what really disrupts the welfare of the hens is that they cannot satisfy the particular egg-laying needs which are natural to them .
We should be more ambitious than that .
In order to minimise the disadvantages for the egg producers , we could pay transitional premiums for a switch to alternative production systems .
Neither the Commission paper nor the Kindermann report contained proposals for such a ban .
I can therefore only urge everyone to support the amendments which seek to achieve this .
As a next-best solution , the Commission 's proposal for compulsory labelling of the production system used should be welcomed .
But that is only possible if the market is transparent .
All eggs should be fresh .
In Denmark , a labelling scheme of this kind specifying the production system was recently introduced , and there was a marked shift in consumer choice , since it was then clear which eggs were from battery hens .
The committee 's proposal that labelling should also include egg products is a good step in the direction of better consumer information , and the proposal that the new minimum requirements should also apply to imports from third countries needs to be supported .
Mr President , as regards the Kindermann report on battery hens , I wish to say that we Danish Social Democrats are in favour of anything that will lead to the abolition of battery farming .
There is in fact a powerful desire among consumers for free-range poultry farming of various kinds .
I think it is our task to help bring agricultural production up to date and not cling to old production methods which do not take account of animal welfare .
It is not happening fast enough , in our opinion , but it is a partial victory that the amendments seeking to abolish this method of production over the next ten years have been adopted .
If there are too many military resources , military expenditure should be reduced .
Madam President , the June Movement supports minimum taxes on energy , but the money must remain in the national treasuries and not provide new revenue for the EU.
The June Movement also insists on representing those who have no voting rights , those who will come after us .
If the border between Denmark and Germany is
