Does it give value for money ?
Mr President , I also wish to begin by thanking the Commission and Mr Whitehead for the work that has been done .
It is also necessary to change our consumer behaviour , and the small consumer organisations are very important in this context .
The third is whether pensions are sufficiently up-to-date to cope with the new situation , characterised by atypical jobs and more and more women in the labour market .
We have tried to stick to our task at EU level , namely that of setting up objectives for the common strategy we are to have at EU level .
It is important for economic development that we have sustainable pensions systems .
That applies especially to those countries that are involved in cooperation in connection with the euro , but also to other countries , so that we obtain sustainable economic development .
Pensions systems still reveal a lack of equality .
That means that the Lisbon process is the most important thing in this connection .
It is therefore important for us to link these aims to the Lisbon process and to the employment and economic guidelines and for us to take a global view .
We must show solidarity with future generations .
We are today working less than we did thirty years ago .
We must change working life in such a way that people can remain actively in work and not be excluded from it .
In my own country of Sweden , which has been singled out as a model in certain quarters , we have moved in the direction of a capitalisation of pensions arrangements and of greater dependency upon the capital markets .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work .
Just as the Commissioner says , the long period required for discussing this issue shows how important it is for us to obtain a sensible decision-making procedure .
It must be possible to take decisions on such rules and charges by qualified majority voting .
As is well known , this is an extremely sensitive issue .
The EU 's and the Member States ' task in the energy sphere is to formulate requirements concerning safety and the environment , to check that the requirements are being complied with and to promote research and development in the energy sphere , aimed at replacing fossil-based energy production with environmentally friendly energy sources .
Now , we are obtaining competition and freedom of choice and , Mr Katiforis , sound protection of investors .
That would just be more expensive .
It would reduce liquidity on the market and increase costs .
- ( SV ) The currently applicable European Patent Convention is interpreted differently from one Member State to another .
We concur with the huge criticism that has been directed against making the concept of the patent too wide , something that would be downright damaging and mean that the wealth of invention would be reduced .
- ( SV ) The draft European Convention and Parliament 's opinion are generally sound .
The European Parliament cannot be the only parliamentary body for the common foreign and security policy .
The draft Constitution 's arrangements for the Commission are unsound .
The requirement of unanimity should not , as proposed in the opinion , be generally abolished in the cases of foreign and security policy and tax policy .
No exact time should be given for the end of the Intergovernmental Conference .
- ( SV ) We have chosen to abstain from voting in the final vote on the aforementioned report .
We have supported the Convention method which , in a unique way , has changed the method of drafting the EU 's treaties .
The EU must be limited and effective .
That also means that we are doubtful about Article I-24.4 of the draft Constitution .
We are seeking a lively dialogue and see no intrinsic value in the Intergovernmental Conference 's being concluded during the autumn .
We want every country , in the future too , each to have its own Commissioner , of equal standing and with voting rights .
A new state requires a constitution , a common currency , a common court of justice and a common defence .
Until now , we have in actual fact completely dominated as actors in the WTO but , by setting the agenda ourselves , we have given the developing countries the feeling of being excluded and of having been ridden roughshod over .
It is important for us to acquire a new map of world trade .
Clear progress has been made , and the trend is towards a more open attitude which will hopefully also lead to people making better use of their rights .
Otherwise , it will be impossible for people to acquaint themselves with such a process .
Paragraph 16 , which talks about a harmonisation of the legislation on open government in the Member States ' administrations , worries me a little .
Mr President , certainly there have been shortcomings - a great many of them - in the area of transparency .
We all know this , but it has probably not percolated right down through the organisation and to the people .
I should like to thank him .
Certain areas really must be discussed .
A first step may perhaps be for a time limit partially to be imposed upon secrecy .
There is clearly now at last an increasing interest in EU issues around Europe .
At the last meeting of the interinstitutional committee , we discussed possibly producing material showing the successful work that has been done and the opportunities available to the public .
