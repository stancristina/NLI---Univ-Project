Madam President , as you might expect , given that until tomorrow morning the Technical Group of Independent Members will still be in existence , we will ask for a vote and to that end , we will ask for an immediate announcement that tomorrow morning , the Chamber will give an opinion on the matter .
And I would also like our Parliament itself to take its cue from the Wise Men' s report .
A little self-criticism then !
It has been said that there are 90 recommendations .
As was the case last spring in the Balkans , so today in East Timor democratic will is being trampled underfoot and this is causing great suffering and poses a serious risk to peace .
Until we are able to put a stop to this situation , I think we should hang our heads in shame .
I also hope that your vote tomorrow will mark a new beginning in relations between our two institutions , because if there is a favourable vote , it means that after all these months , we can finally get down to work .
The Commission intends to become much more open .
And the new Commission will be putting much more effort into communicating properly with the citizens of Europe , giving them open access to information .
This should provide a unifying element in the policy formulation process .
We come from different countries .
This is why enlarging the EU is such a tremendous challenge .
It requires a comprehensive strategy setting out how , over the next 25 years we are going to enlarge the European Union to 15 , 20 , 25 or even 30 Member States .
The more we enlarge , the harder it will be to say what effectively needs to be dealt with at a European level and what needs to be dealt with at a lower level .
The people of the Balkans have to resolve their conflicts themselves before they can enter the European Union .
All of us - the European Union , the applicant countries and our neighbours in the wider Europe - must work together towards our common destiny : a wider European area offering peace , stability and prosperity to all .
Let me now turn to the second immediate challenge facing us : the imminent Intergovernmental Conference .
So we cannot afford to settle for a minimal reform that fails to equip us with an effective and efficient decision-making apparatus .
Growth is back , even if it is not yet uniformly spread , but the signs are good .
We cannot afford to miss this opportunity , as we have too often done in the past .
This is not the place to list the structural reforms needed : they have already been outlined in many Commission reports .
We must now start to put them into practice .
Encouraging the use and development of information technologies will therefore be a priority for the new Commission .
First , because it is more effective to address long-term issues through concerted European strategies - such as those aimed at European employment - than at purely national or local level , even though this level is necessary too .
You represent the different European political families in all their diversity and complexity .
A new European Parliament .
Mr President , Mr President-designate , ladies and gentlemen , this new chapter in our history requires us to be here today for this discussion on the crisis in transparency and the crisis in the functioning of the Commission .
The euro is a tool , an intermediate stage .
This is the basic process that we can either speed up or slow down .
I know that there is a great deal of work to do .
I hope that this framework will bring about a return to the strategic partnership between Parliament and the Commission , albeit respecting their different functions .
I refer to pursuing national interests to the detriment of common interests , and that goes for the Commission , and also Parliament , although in a different way .
In conclusion , if the European citizens do not receive convincing replies at a supranational level , it will be difficult to curb their feelings of detachment and alienation from the institutions , which will seem distant , incomprehensible and also costly .
Indeed , the Commission appears to be continuing along the same path as the previous Commission .
I am struck by the Commission ' s lack of useful and original discussions on culture , mass communication and artistic and cultural production , with regard to which Europe is showing a distrust and a stubborn resistance to the influence of the United States .
We invite him to pursue this avenue , thereby taking the path to reducing bureaucracy .
The events that led the previous Commission to step down must never happen again .
One of the more delicate and immediate tasks is to regain people ' s confidence , as you , Mr President , said in your report , to bridge the gap made apparent by the poor turnout at the elections .
Mr President-designate of the Commission , we welcomed your report on the enlargement of the European Union , institutional reform , the consolidation and economic growth of the entire Union , as well as sustainable development for the creation of jobs .
Yesterday , you read both the first and second part in the House .
In our political opinion , the Commission ' s programme is very important in that it intends to build on past triumphs and strengthen the commitment to peace , security , stability , employment and the well-being of all Europeans , but also people from other nearby countries , to the East and South .
The picture you painted of politics and
