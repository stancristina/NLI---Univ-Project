At the same time , the scope of the directive is substantially extended to cover , for example , the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industry , foodstuffs , etc .
If it is estimated that some 4 % of those are linked to working conditions , this signifies that some 700 workers contract an occupational cancer each year in Finland .
At European Union level that would represent tens of thousands of cases of occupational cancer every year .
It wished to endorse the approach to the improvement of the working environment adopted by the Commission in its proposal .
In drawing up its amendments , Parliament showed great responsibility , taking into account both the need for better protection of workers and the technological limits to that protection , so as not to pose too great a threat to the economic and production activities of the SMUs .
It always poses a risk .
In the case of benzene , the fixing of a biological limit value would be particularly important , since recent studies have shown that the absorption of benzene through the skin , for example in car repair workshops , represents the main form of exposure to that substance .
The proposal amending the directive on the protection of workers against carcinogens nevertheless constitutes a step forward as regards the protection of the health of workers .
However , in view of the arguments I outlined above , I regard it as my duty to retable the amendments which Parliament adopted at first reading and which the Committee on the Environment adopted unanimously .
Unfortunately , this has not been the case .
Even the Commission 's original proposal , which , in my opinion , took proper account of industry and its needs , goes too far for the Council 's taste .
This is highly regrettable , since it shows quite clearly that the Council wishes to hedge on this issue .
I have heard , for example , that a proposal is likely to be submitted in the very near future on arsenic , as referred to by the Commissioner .
This is precisely the reason why it should be dealt with under the codecision procedure .
Mrs Randzio-Plath 's report deserves praise in particular for pointing out that at present demand is weak in the European Union .
She points out that investments should not be treated in the same way as consumer spending , which does not give rise to innovations or foster future development .
This is indeed an idea which should be taken into account in the Maastricht criteria .
It is absurd to make savings today in areas which will later give rise to very substantial costs both for us and society .
Half the budget is accounted for by agricultural subsidies .
Personally I would say that until such time as the thinking behind the Union 's entire economic policy has been clarified , and while that policy offers no genuine prospects for the future , it is a somehwhat brave step .
Mr President , to justify this unusual request , may I point out that yesterday we heard the statement by Commissioner Bjerregaard , but unfortunately Commissioner Flynn was not present .
The answers gave rise to some confusion and now Commissioner Flynn and other members of the Commission can provide further explanations .
( Parliament approved the adjournment of the vote on the second reading on the common position adopted by the Council until noon on Wednesday )
I should like to draw attention to two points : first of all , it is clear that we are about to abandon the principle of prudence , which should be the main principle guiding politicians in the European Union .
I dare not imagine where this will lead us in the future , when the pressure will be even stronger .
Secondly , I should like to draw attention to the public 's right to be informed of decisions which the Commission takes concerning genetic engineering .
I have been trying in vain for three weeks to obtain from the Finnish authorities documents concerning the authorization place transgenic maize on the market .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his answer , which suggests that things are moving in the right direction .
For that reason , I should like to ask the Commission whether it intends at least to examine the possibility of halting these shipments and creating the requisite slaughter capacity in the European Union , taking into account religious slaughtering methods ?
Mr President , in my opinion it is undeniable that the current situation with regard to resale rights in respect of works of art is unsatisfactory and is causing distortions of competition on the modern art market .
A further cause of inequality is the situation of visual artists by comparison with other artists whose right to payment of royalties for repeated uses of their works is guaranteed everywhere .
This is why I support the reduction in the threshold value to ECU 500 , as proposed by the Committee on Culture , and a higher level of compensation in the lowest price category , since this would help and encourage new young artists .
This harmonization must be carried out in such a way as to encourage artists and the arts in general .
I would ask you , Mr President , to give Commissioner Flynn the floor so that we can all hear his important statement .
I withdraw it , since Commissioner Flynn has stated that the Commission is prepared to adopt as it stands the proposal put forward by the Greens for the period from 1998 .
Madame President , first of all I should like to thank all my colleagues for their excellent cooperation .
It is he who , in
