Mrs Theato expressly said that the open frontiers facilitate criminal activities .
The Schengen Agreement is a catastrophe for probity , but who has created Schengen ?
We do not believe that more solutions at Community level can improve the fight against crime because the efforts will be characterised by just as much indifference , slovenliness and secrecy as the EU' s administration in general .
We welcome negotiations between the Member States concerning uniform legislation in the area of crime , but we shall not submit our countries to a federal EU prosecution authority .
We have voted for the introduction of new instruments that will provide substantially better protection of the Community ' s funds .
This unit is to head investigations and ease prosecution proceedings in the national courts .
Such a prosecuting authority under OLAF is necessary because experience shows that far too often no prosecution follows from OLAF' s work .
Unfortunately inter-state cooperation is not sufficient .
There are still five Member States that have not ratified the Convention for the protection of the EU' s financial interests of 1995 , for example .
At the moment , the Member States do not do enough to combat fraud involving EU funds .
Here prosecution is often problematic .
There are major differences as regards the definition of illegal acts and penalties as well as with regard to procedure , rules on evidence and the authority of the prosecuting authority to carry out checks .
It is to be feared that the problem will become worse with the removal of the borders that has given organised crime even greater freedom of movement .
Consequently , we must establish the necessary instruments for more effective combating of fraud involving EU funds as soon as possible .
Mr Commissioner , I can understand that you do not wish to change your decision despite the fact that ten Member States are against such a duty .
I disagree with you on this matter just as much as I agreed with you this afternoon concerning the Korean shipbuilding policy .
I can however understand the fact that you still disagree with me , so I probably have nothing to gain from putting the question to you one more time , but I believe that you should take account of the fact that ten Member States are against such a duty .
Mr President , the environment and public health are like a complex machine with many functions that we monitor and check in order to be able to intervene to make sure that things do not go wrong .
We must not wait until several or all of the warning lights are lit .
This is the precautionary principle in practice .
However , this is not how it works in the case of public health .
In my opinion , the precautionary principle is quite simply about the law and not least the duty to intervene with sufficient and necessary resources on the basis of a suspicion or a probable suspicion that a substance or a process may cause irreparable damage to the environment and health .
Amongst other things , the Commission proposes that the benefits and costs associated with action or failure to act in an area are to be investigated .
An analysis of the pros and cons is an absurd concept bearing in mind the idea behind the precautionary principle , namely to be able to react to a product before we fully know all the advantages and disadvantages .
After all , if we know all the risks , costs , etc. , then there is no need for the precautionary principle .
Risk management and enforcement of the precautionary principle are not the responsibility of experts , but a general political responsibility and matter and the Commission ' s communication does not give politicians sufficient incentive to live up to this responsibility .
The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the proposal for a common market arrangement for bananas .
We do not believe that banana producers should be given more assistance .
The existing arrangement is inadequate and should be changed so as to conform to the WTO provisions .
For us it is crucial that the assistance given to fair trade bananas be maintained and that the incentive for cultivating bananas in a sustainable manner be strengthened further .
We naturally support these elements , since they are cornerstones of Social Democrat policy .
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the joint resolution on the result of the European Council ' s Summit in Nice , which took place from 7 to 11 December 2000 .
This aim was achieved in Nice , and seen in this light the summit was a success .
We warned against this on repeated occasions and the events in Nice show with all the clarity one could ask for that a substantially broader agenda could have resulted in no result whatsoever being achieved this year , with catastrophic consequences for enlargement .
On this point , too , we believe that a satisfactory result has been achieved .
However , we note that the formal opportunities for achieving qualified majority voting have been restricted and that qualified majority voting has been introduced only in a limited number of areas .
There is thus a real risk that it will become more difficult to implement essential legislation on the environment , consumer protection and the working environment , and we strongly recommend the states to demonstrate responsibility and to make the decision-making procedures in the Council more efficient .
We believe that it is important to take plenty of time and find a form worthy of modern , practical EU cooperation , and that a power game such as was played out in Nice must not prevail .
