Today , this is all but impossible .
Fishing is now subject to a dual requirement : the ecological requirement to preserve fish stocks and the political and social requirement to maintain the economic activities of the maritime fishing sector .
Madam President , I also support the report by Mr Souchet and am extremely sorry to see the pollution caused by the oil tanker in Galicia .
This Parliament report on the reform of the CFP remedies some of the shortcomings in the Commission proposal , but is remiss with regard to others .
The first is that fleet modernisation is in itself a priority matter , because otherwise the Community fleet will become uncompetitive : where Portugal is concerned , 40 % of our fleet is over 25 years old and therefore , unless it receives support , it will be unviable .
Instead , we are seeing the dissipation of Commission initiatives to approximate legislation , in which efforts to prosecute crime are tempered by the protection of individual values .
Because , Madam President , the electors do not want crime to go unpunished , specifically international crime , for the sake of the judicial sovereignty of each Member State .
The problems that this initiative raises , as the rapporteur has said , are mainly concerned with the idea of extended powers of confiscation which consist essentially of extending confiscation measures to property which is not linked to the crime for which the person has been convicted , permitting confiscation of property belonging to a convicted person if the person cannot prove that he obtained the property through legitimate means , and permitting confiscation of property belonging to the spouse of the convicted person .
I have some doubts about the amendment the rapporteur has just mentioned , which demands that Member States avoid a reversal of the burden of proof in their legislation .
As for the second Danish initiative for a framework decision on the execution in the European Union of confiscation orders , this second initiative deals , as Mr Marinho has just said , with the mutual recognition and execution of confiscation orders in the European Union .
The initial text as you have mentioned confused judicial authorities , courts and judges .
I am referring , first of all , to the Nice Summit , at which the European Heads of State and Government undertook to reform the Community institutions , in the aim of ensuring that these are adapted to a Europe that is enlarged by a further twelve countries .
As one Hungarian Member stated this morning , we can only regret the fact that the Communist dictatorship that subjugated these countries for more than forty years prevented them from participating in the marvellous adventure of European integration from the very beginning .
This comes as no surprise .
Mr President , the enlargement of the European Union from 2004 constitutes an historic milestone in the construction of Europe , something that we all sincerely welcome , for several reasons .
We must also bear in mind , however , that some regions of the current European Union of 15 are also very poor , and hence the European Union cannot at the same time abandon the policy of economic and social cohesion that it has been pursuing for these countries for some years ; secondly , it must be noted that doubling the number of farmers , with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria , will require the common agricultural policy to be vastly simplified , and will also require a reduction in aid for all farmers , both future and present , following the new funding limits for the CAP laid down by the Brussels European Council of 25 October .
The Commission has recently presented a proposal for a European return programme .
The time has now come for the Council to decide .
We are now preparing a report on the financial allocations for partnerships with third countries aimed at tackling illegal immigration .
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said , we intend to bring forward proposals concerning common procedural guarantees in criminal procedures .
An example of this is the current situation in Portugal .
Consequently , not only have the financial resources laid down in Agenda 2000 for barely six candidate countries not been increased , despite the fact that ten were accepted for accession ; the Commission proposal of EUR 25 billion has also been reduced to EUR 23 billion in the structural policy , and what makes this worse is that , under the CAP , they are attempting to divide between 25 members funds that currently serve 15 , without even correcting the current injustices in the way this is shared out , earmarking only 25 % of direct aid for the first year , excluding small farmers , and this is something we cannot accept .
.
On the same theme , I regret the fact that the Brok report does not affirm and recommend a serious basic compromise with regard to these new future Member States : the last revision of the Treaties before the accession of these countries was undertaken in Nice and no new revision of the Treaties will take place until at least the first set of new Member States is able to participate in it , with full rights and with sufficient time for debate and reflection .
Such an extension is justified by the persistent disadvantages of these territories and by the consequent need to adopt measures that compensate for these conditions .
I therefore regret the fact that this proposal for a framework decision is intended to regulate only the private and not the public sector , especially given that national legislations are still not harmonised - there are , for example four Member States that have still
