I believe , however , that in this case the worst was able to be prevented .
I do not know if a member of the public should be obliged to pay for the government doing what it is expected to do anyway .
Finally , I would like to cite a case .
I would just like to say that this directive is now being tested as regards whether we have a sufficiently broad definition for environmental information .
Madam President , Prime Minister Rasmussen , Commissioner Verheugen , after the Copenhagen Summit there is every reason to congratulate and thank Denmark , and above all her Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister , Mr MÃ¸ller , and former Member , Mr Holter , on and for the smooth and steady advance of the Danish presidential term from start to finish , but mainly on account of their success in the enlargement negotiations that required such precision .
Many sceptics along the way must have aroused justified anger in you .
Russia has not become a new neighbour with enlargement , but an incomparably more important one none the less .
The border will lengthen by hundreds of kilometres in 2004 .
These are Belarus , Ukraine and Moldavia .
After that we can initiate private business interaction on a new level with the Russians and start investing in Russia .
An example of the injustice and corruption that still reign supreme is the necessity to terminate the TIR cargo system agreement with Russia , as it simply does not work there : drivers of freight have had to be prepared for the most diverse range of charges , to grease palms , rather than engines .
Another Commissioner could focus , for the sake of balance , on developing real content for cooperation in the Mediterranean region .
If one of Russia 's neighbouring countries , including my own , had a Commissioner specially qualified to offer support when problems arise and when positive developments start to take place , the EU could be involved as a background power in talks in quite a different way than is the case now .
This is good for both Russia and the EU.
You have done some really excellent work for many years now to promote sport and physical education .
The positive role of physical exercise as a basis for mental and physical well-being is now becoming common knowledge throughout Europe .
Exercise can help keep a nation 's major economic problems in check .
An enormous amount of lost working time could have been prevented through exercise .
Schools in many Member States organise important optional activities after the school day has officially finished .
Afternoon sports programmes help children satisfy their natural desire and need for exercise .
It is ridiculous that sports projects in the legal basis have to be hidden away under other articles , as there is not one for sport .
Mr President , in drafting her report , my colleague , Mrs Joke Swiebel , has chosen a very exacting working method .
She levels her criticisms regarding failures in the area of human rights directly at countries that are mentioned by name .
Unfortunately , this has not entirely been the case here .
There has been such a right in existence in Finland , however , since 1931 .
Around 80 % do their military service and a little over 10 % are excused .
The reason why in Finland the period of time spent doing non-military service is longer is that those concerned are obliged to work eight hours a day , during a normal working week , whilst those doing military service are on duty 24 hours a day .
I think that in the future it will be the task of the Finnish Parliament to get the balance right .
In Finland we still remember all too well how important a conscripted army is for the country 's independence .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group I should firstly like to thank all the rapporteurs involved in the railway package .
Now such areas as the promotion of competition in both freight and passenger transport services , increased interoperability and improvements in safety are huge challenges which really do require swift action to be taken .
This railway package will enable us to promote the competitiveness of the European railways , and improved competitiveness will mean that companies and the public will have the chance to utilise a more environment-friendly form of transport .
At the same time congestion can be relieved and short flights replaced by railway transport services , which will result in a better balance between transport operators .
As shadow rapporteur , I have followed Mr Savary 's drafting of the report closely .
Our group believes , however , that the same principle should be followed regarding the composition of the Agency 's administrative board as that which applies to the Maritime Safety Agency .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Markov , for drawing up this report .
From the point of view of the transport sector it is also essential to improve the social status of drivers and the esteem they are held in .
The Commission proposal , however , was badly drafted .
The proposal would increase inflexibility and lead to practices that would be difficult to monitor and which would cause the sector to incur additional costs .
Our group is proposing that we reject the Commission proposal and ask the Commission to carry out a thorough study of the need to change current rest periods , taking digital tachographs into account .
More effective monitoring will lead to better results than if the provisions are merely made more stringent on paper .
Recently , actually since the autumn , it has been
