If hygiene legislation is inadequate in this area it will have to be amended .
Opening up the European Union to new members will increase stability and wellbeing on the continent we share .
In the talks , therefore , the principle of differentiation must be applied .
Its political and macro-economic benefits will be greater than the additional costs the Member States will incur .
Estonia ' s rapid progress in preparing for membership is especially positive for Finland .
Our neighbouring country has struggled with determination over the last decade to meet the criteria of membership .
Furthermore , the economic transition process has been a positive one .
We must extend our study , on the one hand , not only to matters of binding agreements , but also to instruments other than those intended specifically for military purposes , voluntary disarmament , conversion , and making the work of the police and customs authorities more effective , and , on the other hand , the applicant countries just mentioned by Mr Wiersma .
It is only by complementary action such as this that we can move towards a more sustainable security in Europe and the world , one that is founded on disarmament and stability .
It was given attention , for example , in Lisbon last March at the summit there , in which matters of employment , social participation and the information society were focused on .
The greatest credit goes to the rapporteur for an approach based on the point of view of the public and the practical problems involved .
When it comes to student and teacher mobility , experience shows that the real problems of mobility are not found so much in the area of educational administration , but with the social , tax and immigration authorities .
Regarding our own problems in the education sector , we cannot steer away from the difficulties there are in approving study credits .
Students are still pretty much dependent on the good will of the lecturers .
I am very glad that the rapporteur pays attention in his report to the opportunities for nationals of countries applying for membership to be included in the recommendations on mobility .
What is also important in this report is the attention given to the equal treatment of those who are the most disadvantaged , for example , the disabled .
This is , of course , no surprise , as we know that Secretary of State Péry is also extremely active in these matters in France .
I know that in this we are getting into a very sensitive area as we are stepping into what is almost like the Member States ' areas of competence .
We could perhaps say that as the Commission has begun to ensure there is equal representation of men and women in its own committees and expert groups it will perhaps not be such a very big step from there to what Mrs Dybkjær said , dare we say it , that we should work on the assumption that both women and men should represent the European Union at a higher level too , such as at summit conferences .
However , this should have been incorporated in the Charter quite naturally - in a modern society such as ours - but this work will certainly have to be continued and gone into in greater detail .
This will also perhaps serve as an answer for Mrs Swiebel , who was demanding that we must be able to define clear targets and that results must be able to be measured .
It would appear that it is getting harder for young families to take advantage of the rights that have been guaranteed them by law , as competition in the job market has become so fierce .
The fact is , in Denmark , women suspect that the whole European integration project threatens the rights and levels of welfare women have achieved there .
This , I think , presents quite a challenge for both the Commission and the Council .
Mr President , in my opinion , Robert J. Evans ' s report is very important and I voted in favour of it .
Studies by the European Commission show that needless red tape is causing problems for students from other EU countries .
In Spain students are required to deposit - in a Spanish bank account , note - special sums of money that act as a guarantee in order to rent accommodation .
European rights of citizenship do not seem to carry much weight in this situation .
It is manifestly clear from the justification for the amendment that the purpose is also to interfere in provisions on age that apply in Member States , which , in any case , are fully justified for reasons of psychological development , and they do not have any kind of impact in the job market .
In addition , the wording proposed by the committee reconfirms the vitality of the individual culture and customs of small , immigrant communities , among others .
Mr President , the European Investment Bank grants loans to non-EU countries , guaranteed by the European Union .
The loans are not guaranteed one hundred percent and the Council decided in December 1999 to guarantee just 65 % of the final total for loans for the period 2000-2007 .
For the rest the bank must itself obtain other forms of security or cover the risk itself .
There is a special Guarantee Fund in the Union budget for loans from the EIB .
Technically 9 % of the sum for EIB loans should be transferred from the reserve into the Guarantee Fund , a figure representing 65 % of the nominal value of the loans .
These loans are granted on political grounds to the EU' s humble partners and they are guaranteed one hundred percent by
