The mutual damage inflicted across the Atlantic over the past few days has benefited neither the Iraqi population nor international security .
Is the Council also intending to raise the Kurdish question , a crucial factor in the Iraq crisis , with Turkey at these deliberations ?
I would therefore make an urgent plea to the governments of Great Britain , Spain and Italy to stop playing the role of yes men to the United States and to at last seize the very real chances we still have to disarm Iraq by peaceful means .
This is a man who has used poison gas on rebel Kurdish villages , thereby killing thousands of men , women and children .
But the position of France , Germany and Belgium in this as dissidents in the European camp is terribly worrying .
The question to which the European population would like to hear an answer from its leaders goes without saying .
We should encourage the Security Council to take decisions that do what has to be done in Iraq , but in such a way that the cure is not worse than the disease .
And in those same four years around two million illegals have entered Europe .
We need to get real ; now is the time to act .
Mr President , the annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice seems to be in large measure directed at the future and not the year 2002 .
Following on from this , it remains for the Council to concern itself less with prestige and to spend more time on working to achieve results .
It imposes a prohibition or restriction on the use of certain conventional weapons that are deemed to cause excessive injury or that do not discriminate between military and civilian targets .
You will understand that I would really like to hear from the current President-in-Office of the Council why Greece is actually waiting before signing this important Convention .
That is why it is important that the European Union also targets these groups with its policy and puts the topic on the agenda for the next meeting on the Ottawa Convention .
Is war without violation of human rights possible ?
Our respect for international treaties must not be allowed to degenerate into misuse of this field of the law for political purposes .
After all , facile censure ultimately undermines the support for the principles of combat .
The EU wants to do something about this urgent state of affairs .
An important part of it has to do with mentality and taking responsibility , which is why I am pleased that the point of view of our group has been given a much better place in the text to be voted on tomorrow and by that I mean that there is more emphasis on the importance of education , information , counselling and personal responsibility and the special role of the family .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I , too , would like to start by sincerely thanking Mrs Sandb√¶k for her splendid effort , defending an important issue , that is women 's freedom over their own bodies , being boss of your own belly as we say in the Netherlands and for emphasising the importance of prevention and education .
A second point concerns the anti-abortion actions being conducted in relation to this issue .
I eagerly await your response .
But in any case we know that very many women would like more children than the average 1.4 per family that , for example , is reached in Belgium .
But I was talking about the social implications .
In view of the spread of AIDS , it has to be said that all our resources are insufficient at the moment .
Does the definition of the World Health Organisation apply ?
The 13 % caused by so-called 'unsafe abortion ' can also be brought down , through more compassionate counselling of women with unwanted pregnancies .
I refer to Uganda and Zambia .
In the real world , drugs have always been a fact of life . ' and that is the way things are .
It puts social workers in touch with users , and it also helps assess the dangerous substances that are available on the market .
For these reasons , in 1999 the same resolution called for everything to be done to give priority to protecting children under the age of 18 and to reduce the number of drug-related deaths .
I am quoting the British Medical Journal of 23 November 2002 .
The policy of harm reduction does not work , as it has been shown that the overload caused by users increases again after a while and the provision of free methadone seems only to result in additional addiction .
In the Netherlands there are fortunately examples of so-called hopeless cases who , with the right motivation , have been helped to achieve a drug-free existence .
The Commission has opted for a policy of risk reduction or damage limitation .
We do not , however , have to strive towards a uniform approach , although we must be willing to learn from one another .
Young people and children in my country currently do not know where they stand .
I would also like to thank Mrs Stihler very much for her excellent report , and also the Commissioner who I hope will soon present the report from the Member States , as he promised a moment ago .
That is why we have such a problem with advertising .
Mr President , people who have to do without a part of their body as a result of an accident or an operation are generally happy that these days there are ways of restoring their lost functions .
In cases in which they cannot be restored ,
