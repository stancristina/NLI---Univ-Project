Union and who is now responsible for managing the closure of Guantánamo .
We have always said that we wanted the Guantánamo prison to be closed , as it was clearly contrary to the most fundamental human rights .
Madam President , Mr López Garrido , Commissioner , I would first of all like to point out that the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo on various occasions through various resolutions .
There are , however , still 50 that are not going to be released because there is not sufficient proof to take them into custody but the risk that they actually pose has forced the United States Government to decide that they should not be released .
With regard to an allusion made by Mr Scholz to the Guantánamo Bay situation and the possibility of its territorial status being changed , this is an issue that arises from the international treaty of 1903 between the United States and Cuba .
The European Union and the United States have worked very thoroughly on this issue .
I think that this is very clear when we look at the measures that President Obama has adopted .
I believe that this is something that needs to be pointed out .
This matter has been mentioned in some of the speeches , for example , by Mrs Hautala and Mr Czarnecki : the subject of victims .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour for me to be here on behalf of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council .
I must say that the Council is still awaiting a proposal from the Commission on the position that the European Union should adopt regarding the documents and proposals submitted to the Conference of the Parties to be debated and , if appropriate , adopted .
The European Union must ensure that the Convention continues to be an essential instrument for contributing to the conservation and sustainable management of precious wild flora and fauna resources .
Regarding this issue , we have heard a variety of opinions based on a variety of arguments .
Our work in this respect will follow the line of the renewed consensus on enlargement approved at the December 2006 European Council and the Council conclusions of 8 December 2009 , which have also been endorsed by the European Council .
You are already aware of them but I would like to highlight a number of points .
The agreement was signed on 4 November in Stockholm and ratified by the Croatian Parliament on 20 November .
It is undoubtedly a prospect , a real prospect , but it is not an automatic right .
The European Parliament , as you know , has taken note of these Council conclusions of 8 December 2009 .
Moreover , 19 December saw the entry into force of the visa-free regime , in accordance with the Schengen system , for citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
It is important - and I want to say this at the outset - that we continue the negotiations with Turkey , that we keep the process on track .
There is a contrast between , on the one hand , the process of democratic initiative , as the Turkish Government calls it , and , on the other , some worrying decisions such as the recent decision by the Constitutional Court concerning the ban on a political party , which has also been mentioned here and is a very sensitive topic .
We have also planned a series of political dialogue meetings at ministerial level , between political leaders , that will enable us to look at our relations in the wider international context .
I entirely agree with Mr Cashman when he said that the treatment of minorities is what singles a country out , and not its treatment of the majority , although that is important as well .
However , we still have work to do ; there are shortcomings in the legal area , for example , as Mrs Serracchiani pointed out .
At the moment therefore , I do not think we can say precisely when this conflict will be resolved ; nevertheless , I can certainly say that the Spanish Presidency joins in congratulating Prime Minister Gruevski and Prime Minister Papandreou on renewing a direct dialogue .
The protection of human rights and the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria is a subject that has been mentioned in many speeches and which is clearly referred to in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's report ; and it has to be said that Turkey must make more effort in this area .
It goes without saying that resolving the Cyprus issue would eliminate this obstacle , or all of the obstacles , or at least some of the obstacles that might hinder Turkey 's progress towards accession and , whatever happens , it would send out an important , positive signal to the region as a whole , with reconciliation as the basic objective , as Mr Howitt so rightly put it .
In any case , Madam President , the Presidency 's position on negotiations with Turkey is absolutely clear .
At the summit , developed countries did not recognise the climate debt they owe to developing countries , nor did they show regret for the harmful consequences of the market mechanisms in place ( carbon trading ) .
For that reason , I voted in favour of subjecting the inclusion of the bluefin tuna in CITES Appendix I to the following conditions , as was finally approved : amendment of Council Regulation (EC ) No 338/97 introducing a general derogation for domestic trade ; financial support from the European Union for the vessel owners that are affected ; and tightening of controls and penalties to combat illegal , unregulated fishing
