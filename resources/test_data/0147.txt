It is necessary to incorporate new data such as the daily and weekly ceiling , the number of driving hours , unloading and loading time , which is an integral part of the long-distance driver 's work .
In Belgium they can .
Otherwise , how can we establish financial sanctions for Member States whose long-distance drivers block the roads in order to have their legitimate claims heard ?
Mr President , it is impossible to consider the van Dijk report today .
This text is the symbol of a fortress Europe , inward-looking and deaf to the distress calls of the victims of war , repression or misery .
Today , people are perhaps going to die in France .
Without directing this at anyone here , honouring your father and mother is an element which Christians should hold dear , even if they are democrats .
Mr President , Mr Oostlander 's report contains a number of positive points and proposals , particularly where it calls for tolerance towards different religions and cultures , where it warns us against mixtures of religions and fundamentalist deviations of these religions , and where it recommends measures to deprive religious extremists of favourable ground in Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Oostlander report calls for the following remarks from my group .
Mr President , this is not a matter of any sort of discredit to the rapporteur , but is rather a plea to tackle the threats posed to our rule of law in an appropriate context and manner .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , everyone acknowledges the predominant position of the textile and clothing industry in the European Union , which is important in economic and commercial terms , but also , and above all , in terms of jobs .
I seriously think we should use the European Social Fund to redirect them to the services sector , which is taking off .
I expect a greater degree of transparency .
Its function in formulating decisions regarding the coordination of economic policies or defining major economic policy guidelines leads it naturally to consider all economic and social data , with reference to all the instruments of economic and social policy .
What we need is policy coordination and policy coordination implies supra-national power .
Consequently , the difference between the old customs duties which have been in force since 1st January 1996 , and the new reduced duties will be refunded to ACP exporters .
We must put an end to the social and environmental dumping seen today .
This is a major problem because it leads us to the question of the integration of Islam in societies that understand the concept of the separation between things spiritual and things temporal ; "render unto Caesar that which is Caesar 's and unto God that which is God 's ' is not a precept that prevails in Islamic societies .
We cannot , at one and the same time , play the welfare game and continue to trade with countries where children and political prisoners are made to work under conditions of virtual slavery .
Nevertheless , defining the individual features common to all Member States in order to secure a uniform electoral procedure for the European elections is a tough one that calls for a particular degree of tact and skill .
To conclude , I must express a certain regret , Mr President .
Mr President , the report by the Committee on Institutional Affairs concerning the procedure for selecting European Members of Parliament , contains two dubious innovations .
How odd .
Mr President , drawing up a draft electoral procedure for electing European Members of Parliament is a long-winded process and many reports have pursued that same line without success .
Suffered , Mr President , through witnessing the extent to which the Council has once again demonstrated its shortsightedness by skimping - there is no other word - on the funding required to implement an initiative that , as we saw during the trial phase , very much lived up to young people 's expectations .
When I was a boy scout , we called this a " good deed ' .
I believe the choice is a bad one and I will give you two examples which , in my opinion , are glaringly obvious .
Firstly when talking about harmonization between the Member States , we are also talking about the risk of levelling down .
Parliament had long called for this .
In selecting the diseases which might be covered by the network , we have managed to avoid establishing arbitrary criteria and we have raised recognition of the need to record not only the clinical but also the microbiological characteristics of the diseases in question .
This is looking at the problem from the wrong angle .
If only we could mobilize ourselves around employment as we have done around the euro .
Thirdly , the Serbs would have done better to endeavour to reverse the flow of immigrants and to repopulate their land rather than wanting to reduce the Catholic people of Croatia to living within the area visible from Zaghreb cathedral 's bell tower , according to the cynical expression of one of their belligerent leaders .
Mr President , I would like to propose that this report be referred back to committee , pursuant to Rule 129 .
Unanimity is required with regard to its objectives : encouraging solidarity through the promotion of a voluntary service for young people aged 18 to 25 , -encouraging the participation of young people in the construction of Europe through youth exchanges and , finally , -encouraging a spirit of enterprise and creativity amongst young people .This being so , as a member of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , it is my duty to highlight the deplorable attitude of the Council of Ministers who ,
