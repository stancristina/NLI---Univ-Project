On behalf of the Liberal group , therefore , I support the amendment under discussion .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for answering the question and I would like to say that we are of course looking forward to receiving more specific proposals regarding which initiatives are to be put into practice , and I am delighted that this is taking place before the summer recess , because I think it is important to follow up on this matter right now while we are discussing the euro .
For the sake of EU citizens and in the interests of the taxpayer , I believe it is important to come up with specific initiatives to prove that any initiatives are being started at all in this area , and this is , after all , one of the areas in which we urgently need to change the way decisions are made .
Thus , my question is actually more of an appeal to the Commissioner to ensure that specific mandates are given .
At that time , these plans were rejected in Denmark .
Today , almost all the proposals of the Tindemans report have been adopted .
According to the Danish Foreign Minister , Niels Helveg Petersen , this is " a blast from the past ' .
In the same way , the Danish government will eventually vote in favour of joint armed forces if Denmark votes " Yes ' to the Amsterdam Treaty - otherwise , that would be the first time a government had remained unmoved .
It suggests a gradual build-up in line with the Amsterdam Treaty .
The Union can send troops anywhere and at any time , for any purpose .
The limitation is neither legally nor geographically defined .
The only limitation is political , since unanimity is required for the dispatch of troops .
The Danish derogation expressly permits other States to continue with their joint armed forces .
As we can see , the Tindemans report is not simply a paper explaining what is happening .
I hope Mr Tindemans will come to Denmark before the referendum and explain whether he is indeed - in the words of Mr Helveg - simply a 'blast from the past ' .
One reason many Danes are contemplating voting ' No ' is because they feel the system is closed , bureaucratic and undemocratic .
The European Parliament is much more open than the majority of national parliaments .
The Commission is surely no more bureaucratic than other state bureaucracies .
However , that does not mean we can rest on our laurels .
Interinstitutional agreements are often a good idea in our quest for more openness and democracy in the EU.
This is social dialogue .
Preferably , we should not get involved .
Now there is some hope of really speeding up the negotiations .
In short , I am voting in favour of the rapporteur 's excellent report because of the many positive elements it contains and because we must never stop investigating how to make the EU more open and democratic .
Mr President , there is a lot of discussion about drawing our citizens closer to the EU and its institutions , but this is surely just as much a matter of the institutions , the European Parliament included , coming out to meet citizens and learning what priorities they place on the various interests .
The institutions must make themselves more transparent , easier to comprehend and perhaps a bit less boring .
As we discussed here earlier this morning , that is also important for democracy .
What we need is a personal dialogue .
Forthcoming policy in the area of information will have to mean taking citizens seriously and treating individual countries with sensitivity .
Mr President , the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media wishes to coordinate visiting and information policy for EU institutions .
A certain degree of coordination and exchange of ideas may be fine , but we should remember that the institutions are independent units .
When visitors come here , they obviously often say they are going 'down to the EU' , but there is no need for us to confirm that all the peas are from the same pod .
In this matter , our only responsibility is to the European Parliament .
The others will manage just fine .
For example , our committee meetings are open compared to those of the national parliaments .
I have often asked the administrative management of the House to make proper rooms available for visitors .
We must find space for them , and that might well be some meeting room where the parties can set up their stands and computers .
On the one hand , we must provide information about ourselves , and resources have been set aside for this , but beyond that , we must also be accessible to the representatives of the public , including the press .
It seems utterly idiotic for us , in a democratically elected Parliament , to have any interest whatsoever in restricting press access to our official meetings .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like to say that a lot of Members are sick and tired of the behaviour of a certain Member .
I would like to ask you to proceed .
The matter is too serious for us to waste time on tomfoolery .
It is positively excellent .
My question to the Commissioner is , can a seed firm now have its analyses carried out in any recognized laboratory anywhere in Europe - that is , not only in that particular country 's own state controlled laboratories , as certain countries are claiming ?
I must distance myself somewhat from Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf 's statements , because if we want a
