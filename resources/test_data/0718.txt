years is not long enough to see progress .
The third point concerns interest for the Structural Funds .
I wish to look at only a few key points , but I should like to extend my sincere thanks to all the rapporteurs .
The rapporteur deserves our thanks for highlighting the difference between the technical and political aspects .
This has demonstrated the importance of checks and the need to extend their scope significantly , so that the Member States , too , can be made aware of their own responsibility .
With these points in mind , I would congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Wynn , on his clear report on the implementation of the European Development Funds in the 1994 financial year , and in particular on the proposal to refuse to grant discharge to the Commission in this respect .
In conclusion , I should simply like to make a point which I think has been neglected this year - that just as we have been looking at expenditure , we must also consider revenue .
I am glad to hear you confirm that the Commission attaches special importance to this project .
That is very important to us as Liberals .
So in my view there is no need to enter the names of medicines to which the cardholder has shown no reaction .
My first amendment was intended as an improvement , but the motion was so disastrously mistranslated that the German text says something quite different to the French and Italian versions .
Each country has its own system , and all of them work more or less effectively .
I believe we have the opportunity here to reaffirm that we are most definitely in favour of research but that the limit is reached when people start to be exploited as sources of raw material .
The fact is , of course , that the European Union pursues an unfathomable policy , its words speaking of transparency but its actions of secrecy .
The European Parliament and the Oostlander report have made this point very clearly .
The present report by Mr Oostlander has been long awaited , not only by us .
To make it quite clear once again to many people , let me say that we are not discussing the accession of the central and eastern European countries today but are reviewing the progress made with these preparations and identifying the tasks that still have to be accomplished .
We know that this will not be free of charge , but the cost of non-accession , the cost of instability in Europe and the cost of separate development would be far , far higher .
If they pursue such a policy , they will be faced with a huge employment crisis .
The purpose of this , however , is not to demonstrate that the whole thing is too expensive but on the contrary to seek ways of achieving our political objectives , in other words enlargement , while bearing in mind that such schemes depend on popular support in both the European Union and the applicant countries .
At any rate , I stand by my opinion and call for the vote to be taken first on the amendment tabled by the Green Group in the European Parliament and then on our amendment .
That , sadly , is the stark summary of developments since the Chernobyl reactor accident , for the RBMK-type reactors , fifteen in number , which are universally acknowledged to be unsafe , are still operating , in particular No 1 Reactor and No 3 Reactor at Chernobyl .
But we also know that the Ukraine is one of the most energy-intensive countries in the world .
The sum of ECU 550 million has already been pumped in from the PHARE and TACIS programmes .
I had not really expected you simply to declare your support for something on which , as far as I know , we all agree , but rather to tell us where the money is to come from to implement this memorandum of understanding or , for example , what sort of timetable is likely to be necessary so that the two Chernobyl reactors can be decommissioned .
I did not negotiate it , nor am I the Ukrainian Government , but anyone who seeks to tamper with it must know that he is giving others an excuse to make the whole thing fail .
Innumerable people became ill .
I now ask the Council whether its policy on Slovakia is changing as regards the talks on Union membership .
It is about our present and our future .
That is why Belarus is pursuing a policy of rehabilitation , has cut social welfare and has legalized resettlement , and the whole thing is supported by TACIS aid , which is promoting economic development in highly irradiated areas .
Mr President-in-Office , your answers have been excellent , but I am afraid the same cannot be said of the situation itself .
I would agree that even in Britain , not all the animals are sick , and not all their meat is bad .
Mr President , I have to say that I do not share the view that intervention should be abandoned for British beef , or that this would be possible .
I have already indicated that this ban is unfortunately not always obeyed , but to bring the producer before the courts for that reason seems impossible to me , in legal terms .
I would like to point out that I have already answered this question too .
The market is predominantly structured around SMEs , since the range of different applications for biocidal products makes it possible to cater for individual markets .
It is high time that we established European rules on the marketing of these products
