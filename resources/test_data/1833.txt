continues to be a high priority for the Union , so that the Union can become a more efficient partner of the United States .
This was our position in 1995 and it remains our position today .
The New Transatlantic Agenda provides the most extensive framework for cooperation with the United States .
What we need is not more meetings but perhaps to focus our attention more .
Over and above what is being said about differences , there is very often ignorance on both sides of the Atlantic about the essential and specific work being carried out jointly in order to combat terrorism .
Finally , the transatlantic legislative dialogue is an exceptionally important element in transatlantic relations .
No more cooperation frameworks are needed .
In her question , the honourable Member touches on certain points on which the Council would comment as follows : In its Athens declaration of 16 April 2003 , the European Council reiterated the values on which the European Union is based and confirmed its intention to continue to defend fundamental human rights , both inside and outside the European Union .
The proposal for a Council directive on short-term residents ' permits granted to victims of organised illegal immigration or people trafficking who are working with the competent authorities is the focus of the Council 's attention .
Despite the fact that there is no new question , I should like to point out that all the efforts being made at Council level and on the part of the European Commission to develop the policy to combat illegal immigration and organised crime either at a general level or in the case of specific countries , I refer to the Balkans and to other countries too , obviously also has as one of its basic reference points the phenomenon raised by the honourable Member .
Decisions have been taken one step at a time over recent months , as they were during the previous Presidency .
The Extraordinary Council on Employment , Social Policy , Health and Consumer Affairs held on 6 May 2003 approved conclusions in which , having carefully examined the situation regarding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , both inside the European Union and world-wide , and the different measures taken to address it , confirmed the importance of a quick assessment of the situation and review of future action .
Cooperation should also be developed with other partners , such as airline companies .
The Council reviewed the situation and developments at its meeting on 2 June 2003 , took note of the Commission 's progress report on recent developments in connection with SARS and exchanged views on the current situation .
Thank you , Mr President .
The Ukraine is an important strategic partner and will soon become a neighbouring country of the ?U.
The Union is dealing positively with Ukraine 's European aims , but underlines that the development of relations between the ? U and the Ukraine depends , among other things , on the favourable outcome of continuing internal reforms .
However , a great deal still needs to be done .
Within these frameworks , policies and important structural reforms are still outstanding .
Within the framework of this initiative , a clear action programme is defined as regards medium-term neighbourly relations with the Union , with a view to promoting policies for political rapprochement and the gradual joint completion of social and economic structures and increasing political , economic and cultural momentum , on the basis of common values .
By promoting economic cooperation as a means of preventing conflict , this organisation seeks to resolve conflicts peacefully on the basis of the principles of the OSCE.
However , I hope that the honourable Member understands that institution building also has to do with internal efforts by each country to respond to the needs of reform .
As far as the Caucasus is concerned , the Presidency has noted the particular importance of the countries in the Caucasus and the need for us to develop our cooperation and our relations with these countries .
As you know , we have no knowledge of the fate of certain journalists in the Ukraine .
I cannot proceed to evaluate efforts by the Ukraine in relation to the World Trade Organisation .
The Council welcomes the agreement which has finally been reached between the Member States of the European Space Agency and which also puts an end to the Agency 's difficulties to date as regards the cofinancing of the Galileo programme , thereby making it possible to continue the programme and allay the concerns of the partners that have proceeded to make , and will continue to make , important investments in time , manpower and financial resources for studies , designs and programmes at the pre-development stage .
As this obstacle has been removed , I should like to ask the honourable President-in-Office to tell us what he calculates will be the amount invested in Galileo , if all the Member States of the European Union will take part in it and in what proportion , when the procedure to promote implementation will commence and when he calculates that it will start to provide its services , which is the most important , and if they will be of only European and/or worldwide range .
These are Commission issues .
I agree with Article 1 , paragraph 6 of common position 2001/931/CFSP on the application of special measures to combat terrorism .
The names of persons , groups and agencies included on the list are re-examined by the Council at regular intervals of at least every six months , in order to confirm that there are reasons for their inclusion on this list .
The Council has judged , on the basis of an evaluation of all the factors , that this organisation should be included on the list
