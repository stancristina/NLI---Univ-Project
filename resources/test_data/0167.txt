However , I must say that there is a little schizophrenia going on .
I am worried that the report contains a double message .
In paragraph 19 , for example , we are , I think , directly intervening in Iran 's internal affairs , given the past pattern , the lack of faith in even in the most straightforward people in Iran , who look at the United States , Great Britain and the European Union and suspect that they are about to come and impose their control again .
As with any other country , we only have the right to insist on our own terms , based on the principles of the European Union and European culture , as the basis for meetings and discussion , but not for intervention if Khatami behaves or the clerics do not .
If we are careful , I think that these steps , which are important to both sides , can be taken .
Nonetheless , I think that we have finally done so in a most satisfactory manner , which has gone beyond all our expectations .
We must not forget that this is a vital sector of our economy , a sector which employs tens of thousands of workers throughout Europe and one of our priorities must be to protect it .
So clear , efficient measures are being taken for all the classes of tanker which have concerned us and I am happy to say that today we have achieved something which did in fact appear to be beyond reach just a short time ago .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a member of the Conciliation Committee , I am delighted that we have achieved a positive result and can now press on and apply effective measures to protect our seas and our shipping industry .
Clearly , the catalyst behind this successful outcome , or at least one part of it , was the International Maritime Organisation , which took the right stand thanks to the initiative taken by the Member States of the Union .
Maybe the lack of political unification is to blame for this degree of cowardice .
We have left a black hole in the Balkans .
Mr President , the writing on the wall states quite clearly that the Laeken Summit has bolstered a European Union in which big business takes precedence over the interests of the workers and the people in general .
Continuing and developing the unprecedented wave of protest which surrounded Laeken is our only hope and our only way out .
This is not the time to judge whether or not we have finally achieved our aim ; that will depend on the degree to which the proposals tabled by the Convention find their way into the new Treaties , which is why the Convention needs to table specific institutional proposals , assuming of course that it reaches an agreement .
However , just so that our fellow citizens know where they stand , the Convention will not table a draft Treaty , it will table a draft Constitutional Treaty .
It would have been more fitting to allow a body made up mainly of members of parliament to elect its own chairman .
The chairman of our group , Mr Wurtz , has written to the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi .
Mr President , you are quite right ; the Rules of Procedure do say that you can use electronic voting .
Otherwise we all know how everyone else has voted and it is impossible to hold a secret ballot .
The amendments to the social and environmental criteria , which have to be evaluated in tandem , do not impose any new obligations or costs on companies ; they merely state the obvious , i .e . that we need to respect the acquis communautaire when it comes to protecting work and the environment .
Meeting minimum labour standards in international conventions is one of the fundamental obligations of the developed countries in the European Union .
Finally , I call on the Commission to include other means in procurement by electronic means , not just the electronic auctions which are held on the market .
It was drafted together with the European Space Agency and proposes three lines of approach : strengthening the foundation for space activities , enhancing scientific knowledge and reaping the benefits for markets and society .
The second line of approach is a perfectly natural one , in that space is an ideal place for carrying out research which cannot be carried out on earth , such as astronomic research into radiation which cannot penetrate the earth 's atmosphere , research under conditions of zero gravity etc .
It is highly significant , in my view , that the committee report emphasizes in the very first paragraph that space activities should only be intended for peaceful purposes .
I call on all my fellow Members to keep to the Commission text .
I also propose that they adopt Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 4 from Mr Souladakis ' s opinion .
May I also point out that , in my personal opinion , certain aspects of the proposed GMES programme involve strategic activities .
The committee report notes the role of the European Space Agency and proposes that it be integrated into the European Union in the long term , but without losing its independence .
Finally , I should like to raise the subject of funding .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today 's debate is important to the future of the European Union 's space policy .
However , it notes that the CFSP is dealt with as an economic and development issue rather than as a defence and safety issue , with all that implies for Europe .
First , there is a medley of
