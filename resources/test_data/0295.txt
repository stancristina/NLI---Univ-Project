I would like to take this opportunity to endorse the aims of the European partnership envisaged by the European Commission in order to combat cancer more effectively , whether it be in terms of the importance of prevention and early detection , the creation of a new cancer prevention model or , above all , a reduction in the inequalities within the Member States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me first of all thank you for doing me the honour of inviting me to speak in plenary .
Last year we lent more than EUR 12 billion to the banks for small and medium-sized enterprises .
The Commission also proposes that EUR 2 billion that was set aside be allocated to projects contributing to the fight against climate change .
I am told that the Member States are against it .
When we see the energy investments that you were funding in 2009 , three quarters went towards 19th - and 20th-century technologies and only one quarter towards renewable energy .
Mrs Auconie gave a very specific example of this participation , and I am grateful for her words of support in this regard .
As far as Basel III is concerned , I would simply say to Mr RÃ¼big that we are following the work closely .
We might also mention , yet again , the disputes over some scarce natural resources , in particular the fertile land situated in that region , as well as climate change , which also exacerbates the factors that I have just mentioned .
Some have been waiting to be tried for 10 years .
Why is Nigeria in this situation ?
I voted against , and did so for one reason which in my opinion is crucially important : during the European elections of June 2009 , most of the Member States believed it very probable that the Treaty of Lisbon would be ratified imminently .
It also sets an unfortunate precedent .
This issue demonstrates just how necessary it is for us to provide ourselves in future with a uniform method of appointing MEPs by direct universal suffrage , with this reform to be carried out by means of a convention .
As usual , under the cover of a preliminary consultation , it will be those lobbies that are the most influential or effective , but not necessarily representative of the industry , that will prevail , to say nothing of the dogma of beneficial competition for all .
Even though health is the responsibility of each Member State , we have everything to gain from adopting a global approach to cancer prevention and treatment , and that is what I am supporting here .
Thus , without even waiting for any scientific assessment , an absolute precautionary principle should be applied to cope with the worst possible scenarios in terms of the possible impact of so-called global warming on ecosystems , but also on habitable areas , industrial facilities , and so on .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , at a time when circumstances dictate the need for exceptionally responsive policies , the subject on which I am going to speak to you shows that perseverance is also a virtue .
At their request , the new directive enables them to take 14 weeks ' leave .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission and , in particular , Commissioner Barnier , for whom I am standing in this evening , have monitored very closely the preparation of Parliament 's own-initiative report on new developments in public procurement and the debate concerning the amendments .
As you know , the Commission has proposed a 12-point action plan to support the Millennium Development Goals .
Therefore , we must endeavour to find a way of monitoring those resources and ensuring that they are used for development purposes .
The Commission will shortly scrutinise the extent to which and the way in which these new provisions of the treaty can be used to improve the implementation of the social rules in road transport .
We must take precautions in the area of data protection for all citizens , whoever they may be .
The question was also asked as to why we should apply degressivity , why we do not opt for quantities such as those applied thus far to the Azores for sugar .
The aim of this ambitious text is to encourage the construction/renovation of buildings according to standards that are more environmentally friendly since they are more energy efficient .
These texts also stipulate that energy saving must be a fundamental element in the renovation of buildings .
The ball is in the Commission 's court , but as the budgetary authority , the European Parliament must use its powers and reserve itself the right to ask the European Court of Auditors to proceed with a detailed audit of the management of the project and of the financial impact that a failure would have on the EU budget .
The latter must always have priority .
Finally , the adaptation of educational models to the new professions of the green economy or the digital economy is a major challenge for education in Europe .
Maternity leave must be guaranteed in all the Member States and for all women , regardless of their employment .
In my opinion , before adopting the mandatory 'made in' indication on the labels of clothes sold in Europe , we should have first made sure that the draft regulation on 'made in' labelling included all the necessary guarantees , in particular , in its methods of implementation .
These exemptions will help the outermost regions .
I am therefore abstaining on this text as a sign of goodwill for the progress made in the intentions shown .
The only long-term guarantee for public services is real European legislation , not judicial decisions , however well-founded they
