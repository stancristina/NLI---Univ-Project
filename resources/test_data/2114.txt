It must stand for reconciliation and for the good , and not for the deaths of innocent people , as in the case of the suicide bombing in Haifa .     Mr President , it is easy to condemn suicide attacks , but what should we do if we were in the same situation ?
Now , Israel is building a wall of shame .
Saddam Hussein was toppled because he was suspected of having weapons of mass destruction .
We know that Israel is built entirely upon racist oppression .
What are we doing ?
We are not even breaking off trade relations .
A quarter of that period has elapsed .
Let us try to prevent such an occurrence .     As a consequence of the decline in the telecommunications sector and the tough competition surrounding launchers , the European space industry is now in such a serious economic position that its survival is threatened .
The Commission wishes to assure itself that there will be no distortion of competition in the common market .
The rapporteur believed , therefore , that the Commission should not be given the same powers of investigation in the matter of concentrations between undertakings as in the matter of cartels .
The new partnership will hopefully lead partly to more sustainable fisheries that take account of third countries ’ local needs and partly to these countries ’ having the opportunity in the future to exercise control over their fisheries themselves .     – Mr President , last week , there were presidential elections in Azerbaijan .
News is now emerging that thousands of opposition members have been imprisoned .
I say this as a friend of Azerbaijan .
Forestry production in southern Spain and northern Scandinavia cannot be compared with each other .
Finland and Sweden together account for 40 % of European forestry production , and that is the backbone of the biggest export business in these countries .
Responsibility at local level is best .
It is thus unsatisfactory in terms of legal certainty for the new directive not to contain simple and clear information , either .
Support for Amendment No 76 means yes to a simple , clear and , so too , legally certain definition .
We believe that the basic conditions within the EU are so different that it is questionable what added value such a Community policy would have .
In spite of this , the programme adopted by the European Parliament means that the monitoring of forestry , biodiversity and forest fires is being centralised .
In Sweden and Finland , forestry is the most important industry economically and cannot be a European matter .
We do not believe that there is any reason for centralising forestry .
We do not believe that a forestry policy needs to be developed at EU level .
That is because we believe that the definition of bathing water must be simple and clear and afford as little room for interpretation as possible .
That would place unreasonable demands upon the local authorities , which would then also have to take samples in connection with various sports , which might also have much longer seasons than the actual bathing season .
It is not , however , important that the EU should have a directive regulating the quality of bathing water .
That is an example of the EU’s being unnecessarily detailed in regulating matters that are not even cross-border in nature .
How are these ill thought-out , centralist and expensive EU rules to operate in purely practical terms , and how are they to be funded , in a country like Sweden with its 95 000 lakes and hundreds of miles of coast ?
It is essential , in this connection , to emphasise the important role played by Eurostat in monetary union .
I should like to draw attention to some of the recommendations presented in what is known as the Sapir report , which observes very correctly that the EU budget is out-of-date .
Action should also be taken to benefit such enterprises .
I interpret this as indicating that this work will now be entering a more intensive phase and that it will result in a good many practical measures .
Through this measure , the ability to monitor the age of purchasers would all but disappear , and it would become considerably more difficult to deduct the correct alcohol tax .
I nonetheless wish to point out to Mrs Dybkjær that the view that the European Union should become a very strong military power is not shared by everyone present in this Assembly .
That is partly why we are standing here today with a report such as this to discuss .
I should like to hear more about the subject addressed by Mrs Smet in paragraph 17 concerning women’s participation in the agreement process .
I also support her proposals , for example when it comes to our not being able to accept the Commission ’s deciding alone which substances constitute sweeteners .
In our Amendment No 4 , we want the Commission to present a report regarding a re-evaluation of the authorisation granted in respect of the sweetener aspartame .
There is comprehensive criticism from independent experts who question the fact that the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF ) has given the green light to aspartame .
There is a recently written report from Spain showing that aspartame formaldehyde accumulates in cells , something that may destroy DNA and , for example , cause liver or brain damage , especially in the case of people vulnerable to such damage .
I wonder what the people of Europe think of an organisation that , summit after summit , continues to take decisions with which the Heads of Government do not even get their own ministers to comply .
I believe it is important for the summits to be fundamentally reformed so that people regain
