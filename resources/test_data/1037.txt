the fact that the Council decision is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the EU and does not apply to Denmark , cf . the Protocol on Denmark’s Position .     The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Voggenhuber’s report ( A5-227/2004 ) on fundamental rights in the EU.
We believe that the EU must be able to monitor a Member State for a period in the event of fundamental rights in the EU being violated .
It contains a series of criticisms , and it is only right that these areas should have been pointed out .
A lot has happened in the last twelve to eighteen months .
I think it good that , last year , we had a regulation introduced to the effect that , in future , the Commission should report on a quarterly basis to the Committee on Budgetary Control .
What is quite excellent is that we have now had the opportunity to evaluate the progress made , but there are still major issues and problems to be solved by the Commission concerning the accounting system .
I hope that , here in Parliament today , Commissioner Schreyer will promise to go on giving impetus to the reform process , even if it takes place in the middle of the changeover to a new Commission .
I think he has prepared a constructive report .
I think it will be good if we can put together a majority establishing that our travel expenses should be calculated as per account rendered .
Finally , I should like to conclude with a couple of words about political accountability .
I think it is at the consultations that are to take place when the new Parliament assembles that we should put our energies into getting some principles governing Commissioners ’ political accountability adopted .
That was not , however , the case , of course .
It is difficult , not to say impossible , to comment on the approval procedure for the 2002 accounts in the space of one minute .
This year again , I see , however , that there are many shortcomings in the Commission ’s financial administration , that an unreasonable proportion of taxpayers ’ money has , this year again , been used without the necessary guidance and control and that a very large amount of money has disappeared through fraud , misappropriation and downright theft .
This year again , we are receiving assurances that everything is on the right track , but we know that that is not the case .
This House bears a heavy responsibility by closing its eyes and voting in favour of approving accounts that should not be approved .
If you will permit a final word of thanks , I would take this opportunity to thank Mrs Theato for her excellent chairmanship of the committee .
It is perfectly possible to have responsibility without being to blame .
We merely insist that the Commission itself apportion responsibility .
We can then take note of any explanation .
It is as simple as that .
We have no desire to see particular heads on a plate .
I should like to see who dares vote in favour of that logic .
In 1997 , the recognised accountancy firm , Lloyd , estimated annual fraud at eight billion euros .
The figures may be much worse , since there is no supervisory authority with a complete overview .
As a Member of this Parliament for 25 years , I have requested basic information concerning the use of EU funds and never obtained serious answers , for example about the distribution of agricultural aid or the number of working parties and their participants .
If we refuse to approve the accounts , Mr Prodi and his colleagues will have the opportunity to put their own house in order .
We should free them , reject the accounts and say where political accountability lies .     – Mr President , I give such a reduction in journey time my wholehearted support .
As far as I am concerned , eight hours must be the absolute maximum .     – Mr President , I hope that I am not disturbing too many of the private conversations that are going on .
I wish to state , however , that transatlantic cooperation must be strengthened and expanded for the benefit of the US , of the EU and of the whole world .
This cooperation is currently being put to the test in the fight against terrorism .
Consequently , this topic must be high up on the agenda of the EU/US Summit , where a far-sighted common framework and action plan for the fight against terrorism should be established .
In this connection , I would once again draw attention to the prisoners being held at the Guantánamo Bay naval base , who have a right to a fair trial .
We must strengthen and expand our cooperation but , as friends of the US , we must also be able to speak out when we disagree with the US Government .
We must also stand firm in our assertion that fundamental rights must be respected in this matter .
As regards the attitude to the situation in the Middle East , we must also speak out against the latest pronouncements by President Bush .
Any change to the boundaries dating back to before 1967 can only be recognised if it is the result of negotiation between the two parties .
It is not something that Mr Sharon and President Bush can decide between them .
Once again , yesterday , we heard in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy about the Geneva initiative for peace in the Middle East , a highly commendable initiative that should be brought into the discussion .
