Either way , we must express our concern at the lack of depth and substance , by contrast with similar documents drawn up by our allies .     . ‘Doping ’ in sport is a multifaceted public health issue that concerns everyone , especially those directly involved – sportsmen and sportswomen .
We acknowledge the importance of this Committee on Culture and Education initiative on the convention on protecting the diversity of cultural goods and artistic expression , given the importance of preserving and promoting cultural diversity and on the current negotiations at Unesco , particularly during the current fresh round of talks at the World Trade Organisation , which , under pressure from the large financial and economic groups , would prefer to liberalise all markets and put almost everything up for sale .
In so doing , we must always ensure that creative freedom , one of the prerequisites of such diversity , is not undermined .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when we called for this debate , we were naturally counting on Parliament’s commitment , and , at this point , I should like to express my appreciation to all of the political groups for Parliament’s show of solidarity .
Immediate action is also needed to prevent a repeat of the devastating fires of two years ago , which were partly caused by a dry period , albeit not even approaching the scale of this one .
I should also like to say how pleased I am to have had the opportunity to table this joint proposal , endorsed by the main political groups in Parliament .
After all , as Mr Borg rightly pointed out , the request is for advance payments and derogations from the rules of various regulations that would , in such circumstances , be impossible to comply with , whereby farmers will not be penalised , and for the granting of state aid to be authorised , especially for small farmers .
The situation for farming is giving cause for concern .
We have therefore proposed an amendment emphasising the need to introduce practical measures to support local authorities in the parts of Portugal worst affected by the drought , whilst ensuring that the European Solidarity Fund is activated fairly .
Firstly , state aid ; the Commission should authorise the Portuguese Government to grant state aid to support farmers who have lost their livelihoods , supporting the acquisition of animal feed and investment in water collection and distribution , and facilitating the restructuring of farmers ’ bank debts ; secondly , to make advance payment of premiums to which farmers are entitled – in full , not just in part , Commissioner ; thirdly , to facilitate the transfer of cereal from Community intervention stocks arising from the surpluses in some Member States ; fourthly , to grant derogations from various Community regulations , to which you referred , Commissioner , thereby authorising grazing in set-aside zones or on land planted with cereals already affected by the drought ; fifthly , to release funds and mobilise resources to prevent a high number of forest fires this summer following the drought ; sixthly , to look into the possibility of drawing on the European Solidarity Fund on such occasions ; and seventhly , to reaffirm European positions on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol .
No matter what the regulation says , this is the reality of the situation and this is why solidarity is a key word to use here , too .
It is crucial that support for the forests in the south of the Iberian Peninsula be maintained and that that support be stepped up in relation to the alternatives .
Our civilisation , and my country in particular , continues to waste a great deal of water and this must change .
The figures are clear .
I mention the areas that are worst affected by the enlargement and that , in theory , became wealthy overnight due to the well-documented statistical effect .
I naturally thank the Commission for all of the proposals that it has tabled here today as emergency solutions , yet as many Members of this House have said , what we need are practical proposals , some of which are on the table and simply need the Commission ’s approval .     – Mr President , you are aware of the biblical story in which a people wandered in the desert for 40 years .
In Ethiopia , I discovered that there is a fourth world , a place where the people walk , walk and walk , because walking is a way of surviving , but I have never seen anything like the Tindouf camps .
We came home and they stayed there .
The Member States , and in particular those on the Security Council , must not continue to overlook the nub of the issue .
What kind of anger is being passed on to new generations of Sahrawis in the Tindouf refugee camps involved in the resistance in occupied Sahara , if they are not taken from the arms of fundamentalist radicals , if the EU , the United States , the Arab world and the rest of the international community denies them an outlet for resolving their conflict , thereby condemning them to impotent despair in the face of injustice , violence and destitution ?
Secondly , the spectre of double standards looms large over the report .
Can there be any doubt that Israel’s pursuit of both the fence and the settlements mortgages any lasting solution for peace and human rights in the region , or that the result of the notion of pre-emptive war is , tragically , there for all to see in Iraq ?
It was clear to me that the Venezuelan Government had had difficulty in gaining access to the media , in
