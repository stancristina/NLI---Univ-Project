invest in , or trade with , developing countries , but we believe that such a code of conduct should be laid down within the framework of the WTO 's and the World Bank 's work and not be restricted only to companies within the EU.
As you said , our thoughts go first and foremost to her family , husband and two sons .
She was an unusual politician of the very best kind : one day she was at the UN , the next day she was meeting other foreign ministers , and the day after that she was standing in the market square with immigrants to Sweden or engaged in a discussion with school pupils .
It was a privilege to be able to work with Anna .
It is by doing the same thing that we honour Anna 's memory best of all .
As a Scandinavian , I usually only say thank you when there really is cause for doing so .
That is why we feel such solidarity with our friends in Galicia .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would ask the Commission to devote special attention to Port State Control in the forthcoming progress report on the candidate countries .
I therefore hope that the forthcoming progress report will support this .
The EU cannot attend to this alone .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , energy is among the key issues for the EU.
Does Europe need common rules governing oil supplies , together with increased coordination ?
My report makes an attempt to balance these conflicting requirements .
Through a range of amendments , I have tried to find that balance between the Member States and the common interest that is required if we are to achieve a solution that can work well for the oil market and in terms of the needs of the various countries .
The proposal for enabling oil reserves to be released , even if there is no physical shortage , may appear sound at first glance , but it is clear , where this too is concerned , that such an arrangement would entail large problems and risks .
I therefore reject the Commission 's proposal to facilitate the release of oil reserves , even where there is no physical shortage .
The committee has adopted a number of amendments that balance Community and national interests .
This is about the way in which responsibility for security stocks is organised .
My amendment is aimed at giving the Member States the opportunity to choose the methods they consider best suit their own countries , without attendant disadvantages for other Member States .
There are quite a few reasons for objecting to this .
Madam President , if Parliament were to adopt this report on the proposal for a directive , including the proposed changes , we should , as a result , also have to cancel a number of previous directives , namely directives 68/414/EEC , 98/93/EC and 73/238/EEC .
All of us want European asylum and refugee policy to be based upon humanitarianism and legal certainty .
Most of us want to see regulated immigration and an asylum policy that offers protection and sanctuary to those who are persecuted or tortured or whose lives or health are in danger .
Nor can it mean treating people who make their way to our part of the world as second-class citizens , moving them around and assembling them in camps outside the borders of the EU.
The list of European safe third states includes the current 15 EU Member States and the 12 accession countries , as well as Norway , Iceland and Switzerland .
Romania and Bulgaria would not be covered by the Dublin II Regulation until the Council had made a decision 'at a later date ' ( Article 6 . 2 of the proposal ) .
The committee points out that , respecting the subsidiarity principle , any criteria for drawing up a list of safe third states must be seen as minimum standards , which allow the Member States to enforce higher standards .
My remarks about whether a common list really is desirable - which is something I very much question - are of a personal nature .
What is the situation regarding this matter ?
We therefore support its main features and have also clearly expressed our support for the amounts proposed by the Commission .
We are also concerned about the problems and irregularities in connection with Eurostat and therefore want the European Parliament to ask for 25 % of the appropriations to Eurostat 's administrative expenditure to be placed in Title 31 ( 'Reserves ' ) until the Commission has given Parliament sufficient assurance that the problems have been solved and that the people responsible have been identified and appropriately penalised .
We also want to call upon the Commission to ensure that additional funds for the information campaign concerning the euro are available if further needs should arise , for example as a consequence of referendums in any of those countries that do not at present have the euro .
Mr President , Commissioner , as a Scandinavian , I do not usually go in for flowery language , but I wish to thank Mr Whitehead and the Commission 's officials for the intensive work done so that we might quickly have this proposal turned into a reality .
We have all worked in a spirit of how important it is to strengthen the consumer organisations and reinforce the objectives of consumer work .
It is for the new Europe that we are developing the consumer area .
In Parliament 's amendments , we indicate the importance of genuinely integrating consumer issues into other areas .
The next issues must be those of mobile telephone conversations , price fixing or the ways in which billing operates in different countries .
