India’s problem .
The situation is worse than that .
They are untouchable , detested by the other population groups and at the bottom of the pile socially .
In reality , they have no rights , and they do the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs .
It is they who , in industry and agriculture , work with chemicals so poisonous as to be banned in most of the world .
In factories , they stand bare-footed in acid baths and colour our textiles .
What is more , the EU deals in Indian products without asking candid questions about how they were made .
It is a nasty business for India , but it is almost more awkward for Europe , which is well aware of what is happening .
Often , we ourselves have sold them the dangerous products .
The Dalits have no voice and no trade union .
The problem needs to be on the EU’s agenda , and it is disgraceful that it is not clearly included in this report .
It must be emphasised that the Danish Social Democrats would prefer to see comprehensive , compulsory modulation .
It must be emphasised , however , that compulsory modulation - involving the long-term abolition of direct subsidies - continues to be the objective .
Otherwise , we could soon be voted down in this House .
That is , of course , what the Commission has done , for example , with its communication on music rights .
Parliament had adopted one position , which the Commission did not like .
The Commission then turned to matters relating to the abuse of monopolies and adopted a communication instead of rules , which it would perhaps never have been possible to adopt .
In that way , we can make it known whether we want to have binding rules or a cocktail of communications and of decisions by the European Court of Justice .
As far as I know , the parliaments have not , however , responded once .
On Monday and Tuesday , the national parliaments will come together for the COSAC meeting in Helsinki and they should not miss the opportunity to put some order into the jungle of laws from Brussels .
With colour-coding like that , it would be very easy for the Commission to see at a glance what is wanted .
Mr President , tomorrow our Heads of State or Government will meet at a summit in Brussels where they will resuscitate the dead Constitution .
Let us have that report now , Mrs Lehtomäki .
How has the French Government responded following the French voters ' rejection of the Constitution ?
How has the Dutch Government responded following the 62 % 'no ' vote in the Netherlands ?
This text will then be smuggled in by means of national ratifications .
Another route could also be taken , and people 's protests listened to .
Why not hold direct elections to constitute a new Convention with the task of writing a democratic Constitution and an alternative cooperation agreement between European democracies and then put both proposals to referendums on the same day in all the EU Member States ?
If we were to start by deciding that the outcome would have to be voted on in all the countries in which such votes were possible , the authors would be obliged to draw up a text capable of being adopted .
We should then be able to agree on a text that could ...
It is this delegation 's view that the amendment is incompatible with the regulations currently in force , for which reason we have felt obliged to vote against it .
The delegation wishes , nonetheless , to stress its support for a gradual general reduction in EU agricultural aid without the possibility of differential treatment for different Member States .
The Danish Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen , Mrs Thomsen , Mrs Schaldemose , Mr Jørgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against Amendment 2 , tabled by Mr Tomczak and Mr Bonde of the Independence and Democracy Group .
Nonetheless , it is the view of the delegation of Danish Members of the PSE Group that there is a need for a reform of the rules governing travel expenses so that , in future , they are paid out in amounts corresponding to costs actually incurred .
In this context , the delegation is pleased that with the new statutes will come new rules under which , from 2009 onwards , travel expenses will be covered in amounts corresponding to costs actually incurred .
The Danish Liberal Party believes in reforming agricultural aid , but does not believe that this is the way to achieve such a reform , nor that the report on the annual budget is the place to state one 's desire for proposals to that effect .
The Danish Liberal Party also believes in reforming travel allowances , so that reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded .
Mr Bonde 's proposal is contrary to the statute currently in force and may therefore be regarded as poorly thought through .
A number of ethical amendments have been tabled that are quite superfluous and that , at best , muddy the waters where this matter is concerned .
The principle governing the donation of tissue and stem cells for no payment has already been settled in the Directive on Tissue and Stem Cells .
We support that principle , which applied before and during this vote and which will apply after it .
The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have voted in favour of Amendment 43 , tabled by Mr Guidoni , Mr Holm , Mr Pafilis , Mr Remek and Mrs Figueiredo on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left .
