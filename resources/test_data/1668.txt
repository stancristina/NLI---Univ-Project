is committed , during its six months in office , to the values of the protection of human rights , to the fundamental freedoms , and also , to echo what Mr Geremek said , to what is generally termed ‘human security ’ – the striving for health , the campaign against weapons and rearmament .
Something else said on the subject of European foreign policy was that we should concentrate primarily on our own neighbours .
Israel and the Palestinian Autonomous Authority have again been reminded of the obligations imposed on them by the Roadmap , and , in taking this line , the Quartet has received substantial backing from the Council , which also expects of the newly-elected Palestinian Legislative Council that it will endorse a government committed to the principles of a peaceful and negotiated solution to the conflict with Israel founded upon agreements already reached and on the Roadmap , to the rule of law , to reforms and to proper management of its finances .
It is worthy of note that the USA , before the elections , made it known that there had to be talks with Hamas , despite its being on the list of terrorist organisations .
We can continue counting on him as a partner , for the new government neither will nor can alter the constitution that is coming into force .
Polls show that there is a slight majority in favour of peace with Israel .
I very much hope that funds will be transferred soon , because they would cover a good proportion of the salaries of the Palestinian Authority employees and would also provide much-needed income for the families .
Since there is no point in taking political action if it remains without any effect on people where they live , the Council has altered some practical details of its policy in order to make it really effective , particularly in stepping up dialogue with the peaceful opposition , which has given a very warm welcome to these close contacts .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for this opportunity to explain the Council 's opinion on this important issue , the statement of assurance ( DAS ) to be issued by the European Court of Auditors on the management of the Community budget .
The Member States and the Commission need to optimise the effectiveness , economy and efficiency of current control systems .
It requests the Commission to provide it with a report on solutions for problems common to several Member States .
Some of you perhaps take the view that the Council should have gone a step further , and I can well understand that .
It is a matter of certainty that the Council will take on its share of responsibility , which it has no intention of abdicating .
I am delighted , Commissioner , that the Commission has put forward a very ambitious timetable , that the prospective study laid down in the directive has now been commissioned , and that , on the basis of this prospective study , we will then be in a position to take further decisions .
Many thanks to all those who helped me produce this report .
What is left to justify the restriction of competition by a regulated reserved sector ?
I would ask you to be very strict on these issues , because I , as a European , want the decisions we make in Europe actually to be implemented .
The ninth point I want to make is that the checks must be carried out not only on the road but also on the company ’s premises .
I hope that the digital tachograph will soon be introduced and that the Member States will make the driver cards available , so that we will then have made some progress in bringing a bit more social justice , safety and fair competition onto the European Union’s roads .     .
Making these things capable of being checked – so that both the driver and the person doing the checking know what is coming to them – is , as I see it , a really important advance .
Mr President , our adoption today of the regulation on driving and rest times will without doubt be a step forward in that the daily minimum will be increased , the maximum permitted driving time reduced , the digital tachograph introduced with the intention that manipulations be prevented and it be made possible to check the past 28 days , and , not least , the length of the journey – in terms both of distance and the time taken on it – to the place of assignment will now be counted as working time .
The fact is that the need for checks on driving times to take into account also the other periods of time when the driver was working is actually pretty much self-evident and ought really to be blindingly obvious .
Now , though , it turns out that some Member States have still not got this organised , so perhaps you might consider hauling them before the courts .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wonder how familiar the people of Thuringia are with the European regulation on driving times and rest periods .
We should , however , be under no illusions about the fact that the conversion to digital will achieve its object only if what has been announced – the more frequent checks , including on the vehicle’s roadworthiness – actually happen .
The decision to bring about uniform social standards in European road transport is , in general terms , the right one to take , but , when I consider the improvements I initially hoped to see to the conditions of lorry drivers , this result really does bring us down to earth
