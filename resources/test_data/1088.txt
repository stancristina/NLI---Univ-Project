On this subject in particular I can tell you that my colleagues responsible for these areas , especially as regards external assistance , are analysing the topic so that in accordance with the criteria and comments that I set out earlier we can reach the best possible solution to use the bank ' s funds in the most efficient way .
All Union policies have to respond to this aim , helping improve competitiveness in the most backward regions and helping create more jobs and more skilled ones .
In the report under discussion there are enough generic references to the United States model and phrases that have become the canon of right-wing economics that they cannot be accepted uncritically by those of us who try to keep a balance between broad economic objectives and building fairer societies .
Of course there are .
When we analyse the employment figures , it is quite clear what results have been achieved .
We can mention public investment , as some of you have done .
It is not a matter of balance between the various policies : it is more a synergy between different policies , which in the end should enable us to achieve the desired results .
It is true that indicators are not goals in themselves , but are tools that should enable us to make progress and interpret reality more globally and accurately .
But it is also true that a smaller number of indicators would make it much more difficult to interpret the reality we are trying to understand .
The Commission has taken the initiative , for instance , with the economic interviews held once a year , the basic aim of which is to analyse the European economic situation specifically in this global world and in comparison with the context in those countries that serve as a reference for our situation .
A different problem is that of enlargement , which is also clearly referred to : the European Union economy must not only take this essential element into account , but our whole design must also be based on the consideration that the Union will enlarge in a relatively short time .
This should certainly make us more competitive and will benefit users and make it possible to improve the quality of services of general interest .
It is easy to highlight the progress that has been made in general terms , but it is rather more complex to point out how these advances in each of our countries , or in each of our regions , can be compared with the others .
The Commission also thanks him for his support for Articles 42 and 308 of the Treaty as suitable legal bases for this objective .
The proposals made by Mrs Lambert , whom we thank for her support , are very useful since they clarify the Commission ' s original proposal and make it more specific .
To sum up , therefore , we can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 7 , but we cannot accept Amendments Nos 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 and 13 .
I believe this question is so serious that it requires some special action .
The Spanish Government , through the Civil Guard , has implemented an information system to prevent shipwrecks in the Straits , at a cost of 13 600 million pesetas , for which Spain has requested European Union funding .
This is also the context of the interim agreement dealing with the economic and commercial aspects of the Global Agreement , the aim of which was to allow negotiations to begin as soon as possible for the liberalisation of the commercial aspects of Community competence included in the Global Agreement .
There we hope to see a separation of powers and guarantees that governments will alternate in power , and we are sure that the necessary interrelationship between economic modernisation and political modernisation will increasingly prosper .
Mr President , our Group supports and appreciates the report by Ms Lucas as a positive contribution to the proposal made by the Council regarding the Joint Council meeting and its development .
First , this text mentions the Mexican constitution at least eight times , arguing that if Mexico signs the agreement with the European Union this will supposedly violate that country ' s supreme charter .
I must also mention that in 1999 the democracy clause was included in this agreement .
It is essential to distinguish between the disinterested humanitarian aiding of illegal immigration and the activities of criminal networks as laid down in Article 27 of the Schengen Convention .
Lastly , I should like to point out that the Member States need to be aware that certain regions of the European Union are particularly affected by illegal immigration , and because of their geographical position they are having to shoulder much of the burden imposed by the immigration policies , so budget lines should be developed to allow compensatory payments , which will increase solidarity within the European Union in this area .
This is because profit or financial benefit , as for example happens in Spanish criminal law , is an aggravating circumstance but it is not the essential component in characterising the crime of trafficking in human beings .
What I see is that with initiatives like this one they will not only revitalise it , they will bombard it .
Mr President , I should first like to thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for being so very open and receptive to contributions from my group .
Consequently , the European Research Area is one of the key concerns of the present College of Commissioners .
We wish you success , Commissioner , because your success in this field will be Parliament ' s success and the European Union ' s success too .
It is
