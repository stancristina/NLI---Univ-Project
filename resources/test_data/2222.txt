special situation .
This would mean that at present those investment costs would represent only one-twentieth of the public investment costs under the current system .
Mr President , the drafting of this report has been a long , laborious process .
This stemmed from the fact that I had to consider whether the European Community had acceded to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine , whether it is in a position to accede to the Convention or not and what the Community 's position is under this Convention which is the responsibility of the Council of Europe and which is being drawn up by that body .
The explanatory statement to my report illustrates the problems inherent in the Community 's position as a possible party to the Convention .
The Community 's admittance at this early stage would have been important not only from the point of view of the Community but also in terms of the Convention itself .
The Convention on Bioethics has been in preparation in the Council of Europe since 1990 , in other words for some six years .
The issue is one of drawing a moral and ethical line between the new possibilities and dangers stemming from the rapid developments in medicine and biology .
The Convention defines how far that development can go , what is generally acceptable and what is not .
The fundamental aim is to protect the dignity of the individual from the violations made possible by the development of knowledge .
Abortion and euthanasia have been left outside the scope of the Convention , even though the latter , among others , is increasingly becoming a subject for public discussion as the population ages .
It is important to note , however , that the Convention lays down minimum protection standards for the citizens of countries acceding to it .
It should be noted that the matters dealt with in the Bioethics Convention affect all citizens .
Unless they are kept properly informed , citizens feel threatened by the ever more rapid developments in this area .
It is therefore important that the European Parliament , which represents the people of the Union and which has an important role to play in the allocation of research funding , should consider and discuss standards for the areas of biology , biotechnology and medicine which are based on respect for human dignity .
It also highlights the need for ethical committees dealing with medicine and medical research to be set up on the basis of fully democratic principles .
The Liberal Group does not want to see overly tight restrictions .
This view is clearly illustrated by Amendments 11 , 12 and 14 , tabled by our group .
Finally , may I draw your attention to the first section of the report in which the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights calls on the Commission , as the guardian of the Treaties , to consider whether the Treaties allow for accession to the Convention .
Great caution is necessary in dealing with genetic material .
However , arbitrary limitations should not be placed on discovering the origins of diseases and disabilities , and on curing and preventing them .
What tests are being referred to ?
If the proposed wording were adopted , would many existing tests have to be discontinued ?
For example a predisposition to adult ( I I type ) diabetes is highly hereditary as is a predisposition to many other diseases .
However , this form of diabetes is not regarded as life-threatening although if untreated it can , like many other diseases , lead to premature death .
They have caused a great deal of suffering , and much still remains to be done .
Would it be permitted today ?
Fortunately it was permitted then .
I hope that Parliament will not adopt the first sentence of point 12.10 but will adopt , for example , Mr Pelttari 's amendment instead .
I wished to deal only with the recruitment of officials into A grades because I know that the low proportion of women among these officials ( only 15 % ) has been an uncomfortable fact for the Commission and that it is this situation which must be changed first .
We must go on thinking .
The question of age limits is extremely tricky .
When the next joint competition is held for 15 Member States there may be even more applicants and even fewer posts available .
It is however notable that there is not necessarily any direct correlation between the age limit and equality between the sexes .
This is because in these societies the position of young women is clearly completely equal .
I should like to state that my aim has been to make the Court of Auditors ' position easier .
We are prepared to help it in this matter .
It is up to the Court of Auditors ' what it writes in its own report .
It is to the advantage of both sides that there should be no errors of fact either in the report or in the comments .
They decide what they write , but it is of course important to them to be able to avoid errors of fact in advance .
It is also good that the European Parliament is taking up a position on this matter .
In this connection it is important to take account of the common European ethical viewpoints and the respect of human dignity , because biotechnology combines both ethical and economic interests .
At the same time it also generally reflects the views of my own EPP Group .
The European Union cannot accede to this convention as a legal entity , but this could still be changed , for example at the IGC.
In my opinion the Parliament should stress this possibility , as Mr Pelttari mentioned in his speech today .
