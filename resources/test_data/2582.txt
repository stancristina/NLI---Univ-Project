Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan , where I live , 90 % said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day .
Mr President , the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations , based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe , for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent .
Mr President , Commissioner , no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry , particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002 .
A subsequent regulation , Regulation 1448 , adopted , not by chance , in 1999 , permitted certain exemptions , in particular for special cases .
The time period will elapse on 31 May next , to be precise , when the Commission will present a proposal .
Moreover , with regard to the protection of coastal areas , which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish , we hope for tighter controls , which , in our opinion , should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea .
In order to make it easier for the Commission and the Member States to get hold of reliable evidence , an Israeli peace movement published a list of companies established in the settlements , and a Palestinian NGO prepared and presented the customs services of the various Member States with unequivocal proof attesting to the State of origin of a range of products coming from the occupied territories and traded on domestic Community markets .
I have to say that I am satisfied with Commissioner Vitorino ' s response : I feel that , on the whole , his speech did respond to the points raised in the question .
We are being cruel to be kind .
We need a completely different system .
In Lisbon , very simply , we will have to decide whether Europe will be able to regain its leading role in the economic and technological worlds , relinquished long ago .
The challenges awaiting us in Lisbon are therefore very simple : we must meet the challenge of technology by regaining lost ground in the areas of knowledge and technical skills , especially retraining technologies .
I have to say that I am extremely concerned by the fact that the income discrepancies in European society are constantly widening instead of diminishing : this aspect of the social divide is of fundamental importance and must be taken into due consideration if we want to avoid the complete disintegration of society in the near future .
I am confident that in Lisbon we will be able to take a step forwards , pooling benchmarking experiments and proposals on this major issue .
We must mobilise individual citizens , local authorities , national governments , businesses and trade unions .
We must disseminate best practice in all fields and endeavour to advance it at European level .
However , this is the first time in many years that a strategic objective has been put forward , and I feel that it is extremely important : to transform the Union into an economic area based on innovation and knowledge , in order to boost economic growth , achieve full employment in proper jobs and bring about social cohesion .
Lisbon must be remembered , not only for its excellent preparatory document , but as a Summit which , at the start of the new millennium , will mark a significant turnaround for economic growth , employment and social cohesion in Europe .
It is not yet single because of the delays in public and private services ; it is not single because of the delays in achieving transparency and in introducing the use of modern technologies to make the markets fully functional in terms of information technology and , therefore , in terms of efficiency .
Therefore , our responsibility is both economic and social .
With regard to what Mr Guterres has said about Internet access in every school , on the network connecting all the peripheral areas , this is not an obligation which can be left exclusively to the market because , quite simply , the market does not operate like this and , on the other hand , without this we will not attain the new and requisite targets for production development .
Now , let us please endeavour to make good the deficit of the future and give the coming generations a sense of direction , in the knowledge that we are working together , slowly but surely , to achieve something which will last .
We are able to give it credibility precisely because the Portuguese Presidency has teased out the threads of unification and woven these together to form a tapestry .
There has been acknowledgement of my strong commitment to enlargement from various quarters , but the Commission ' s commitment to allaying the fears of public opinion regarding this project has also been recognised .
Of course , and I am not saying this because I am here , in the presence of Parliament , but because it seems particularly important , we have placed particular emphasis on Parliament ' s responsibilities in the codecision procedure .
We have touched on all the major points , including the environment , health , energy , transport and consumer protection , in addition to the major issue of justice .
The line we are taking is very clear .
We must make every possible effort , because if we do not salvage our environmental policy and do so dramatically , it will be almost
