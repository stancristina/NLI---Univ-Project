What is more , only EUR 1 million were received by the final beneficiaries of this programme .
The Court has analysed the follow-up given to its previous observations .
It is the opinion of the Court that the accounts for 2001 reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation of the Communities .
Take the common agricultural policy , where the declarations submitted by the beneficiaries of subsidies have not improved compared with previous years .
The Court recommends simplifying the systems for reimbursing expenditure and introducing more effective sanction mechanisms .
However , in some respects the debate has suffered from a lack of precision and balance .
For years the Court has been drawing attention to these defects , and at last its observations appear to have elicited some response .
Secondly , the Council has adopted a new Financial Regulation which the Court considers generally appropriate .
The plan should provide more detail on issues such as the monitoring of internal control standards and the reform of SINCOM.
However , it will take more time to achieve the excellent and exemplary administration we all want to see .
A similar thing is also happening in the case of agricultural policy .
I would like to congratulate Mr Fabra Vall√©s once again .
Furthermore , issues relating to the DAS have been mentioned .
If only !
Mr Staes asked me a question about the case of Mrs N. All I can say about this is that , from the moment OLAF arrived at the Court of Auditors , all doors were left open to them , the cupboards unlocked and the computers switched on so that they could look at whatever they want .
I believe we should all be worried .
And do you know why ?
What I can say , and we should all agree on this , is that I believe there has been a mistake in the procedure ; there has been a procedural error .
With regard to the contents of OLAF 's report , until there is a response from the Solicitor-General , the affair is sub judice , and there is therefore nothing more to say .
I must say that I consider the behaviour over recent weeks of the Commission and the Council in relation to issues which are not only subject to negotiation with the enlargement countries , but which affect our daily life and the essence of Parliament , to be entirely unacceptable .
Then , if the negotiations with Rumania and Bulgaria are concluded at the same time , there will be another modification ; if it is not at the same time , there will be two modifications .
And finally , and I will end here , I still have hope because , as Alfonso X the Wise , a philosopher king , said , 'if God had consulted me on the day of the Creation , I would have given him some useful advice ' .
I have been faced with an open and systematic accusation ; this morning , in a press conference , three parliamentary group presidents have publicly accused the Socialist Group of blocking the Statute .
It is not true , for example , that this system of allowances has been created to compensate the Iberians .
I am grateful for the letter you have written and I have one hope , Mr President , because I believe that you also take this approach .
Mr President , the Prestige disaster in Galicia has the consequences of a natural disaster , but in truth it is a political disaster .
Mr President , I hope not to take up my five minutes , but I am not very good at controlling myself in this regard .
Effectively , only the larger scale sections of the fleet would survive and the small-scale fleet , which generates most employment , would be heading for extinction .
The Commission has presented two difficult , complex and very restrictive proposals on , for example , cod fishing .
I would like to thank my fellow Members for the debate , the President , Mr Stevenson , for handling this whole difficult issue , and express my group 's support for Mr Varela 's report .
The framework Regulation stipulates the sum of EUR 4 million ; the Commission , however , in the preliminary draft budget , states that only EUR 1 million , held in reserve , will be allocated to this action .
It also calculates the total additional sums required during the 2003-2006 period to be EUR 271.6 million .
The Committee on Budgets considers that financing the new action is incompatible with the maximum limit under Heading 2 of the current financial perspective and that it will therefore only be possible to make available the EUR 32 million already laid down for the 2003 budget by mobilising additional appropriations using the instruments provided for by the interinstitutional agreement .
We are facing a European problem , which requires a European solution .
Europe will become a reality when it is sensitive to the problems faced by its citizens .
We in Europe must leave behind politics with a small 'p ' and pointless discussions .
I shall end , ladies and gentlemen , with the slogan that thousands of Galicians adopted at a mass demonstration last Sunday : 'Nunca mais ' ['Never again'] .
Why can a boat 12 metres long receive funding , while a boat of 13 metres cannot ?
The fisheries sector is not asking for more money , but only the amounts that were promised , under the promised conditions .
We must make the conservation of fish compatible with the conservation of fishermen , and at difficult times , such as Galicia is going through at the moment , and may go through in future , we must
