dimension to this work and the questions for oral answer put to the Commission by Mr Brok and Mr Miranda offer guidelines that are of major importance .
We can leave behind us a world without mines .
It is tragic when the civil population suffers as a result of its leaders ' lack of skills and experience .
The Ottawa Convention , which restricts the use of mines , is a very worthwhile endeavour .
The EU' s aid programme is necessary and I fully back it .
Although I am in favour of ending the misuse of mines , I do wish to raise the issue of the problems that Finland has in this connection .
Ladies and gentlemen , just look at Finland .
We must fall back on the old Roman truth : the best way to keep the peace is to prepare for war .
The mines are an essential part of Finland ' s defences .
All the mines in Finland are safely stored and are not exported to other countries .
Furthermore , all the mines are easy to remove in the wake of any conflict .
In practice , this means removing mines with Finnish equipment , providing assistance for victims , and the destruction of mine stores .
This must , nonetheless , come about in such a way that one ' s own country ' s security is not compromised as a result of political pressures .
At the time it was decided to look into how Finland might be a party to the Ottawa Convention in 2006 and replace anti-personnel mines with other defence methods by the end of 2010 .
As party to the convention , Finland complies with the regulations in the amended Mine Protocol in the Convention on Conventional Weapons 1996 , which came into force in December 1998 .
Finland herself is responsible for her credible defence arrangement .
Finland has never engaged in the export of anti-personnel mines and none have been manufactured in the country since 1981 .
All the mines are in storage .
Finland is one of the unfortunately few countries in the world that sign and ratify international agreements only when they can meet the conditions they contain to the last letter .
Finland is aiming to become party to the Ottawa Convention in 2006 and replace anti-personnel mines with other military systems by the end of 2010 .
Defence expenditure in Finland has traditionally been amongst the lowest in Europe .
Or can someone tell me how anti-personnel mines could be used in an attack ?
They play a major role in the Finnish defence strategy .
Still to be examined are questions of financing , replacement systems and methods , and the effects of solutions on the development of defence doctrine .
I wish to state that I voted against Mrs Van Lancker ' s report .
I repeat , 'prevent ' .
At Lisbon the mainly socialist leaders of the EU governments declared aloud their aim to make Europe the world ' s most dynamic and competitive economy .
If Mrs Van Lancker ' s proposals are adopted we shall definitely be stepping back light years in terms of our ability to achieve the important , ambitious and indispensable aims of Lisbon .
According to Mrs Van Lancker , working hours in Europe must be shortened significantly , the body of EU socio-political legislation must be increased substantially , the levels of social protection in Europe must be raised massively , the power of the Trade Union movement increased and supranational labour market negotiations made possible , labour organisations must be given greater rights to be heard , and socio-political influence must be a priority in all sectors of the economy , in competition policy and in public procurements .
Mr President , the rapporteur should be congratulated on the excellent work that was done so intelligently .
This must be the starting point for any action we take .
The profile that crises have assumed in the last few decades has decidedly changed .
The UN , which was originally established to respond to conflicts between states , is seeking once again to get a grip on managing the increasingly common crises taking place internally in countries .
The trend worldwide would appear to be that more and more conflicts have a religious dimension : Kosovo , Chechnya , southern Sudan , Northern Ireland , East Timor , Sri Lanka , Nigeria , Kashmir and , one of the worst in recent times , the Moluccas , in Indonesia .
But in these countries religious tensions have been used for political purposes .
The EU would also have to put pressure on governments , determinedly and systematically , to allow international human rights observers access to countries at war to conduct an impartial , neutral study of conflicts .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for having reliably compiled all our views producing an excellent piece of work .
The subject of emissions trading entered the debate on climate as part of the so-called flexible mechanisms .
As the EU has been a leading force in these international discussions until now , we must all certainly hope that this position of leadership will be kept up , and we place our trust in the Commission in this .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market therefore also welcomes the Commission ' s Green Paper and the fact that a framework directive is to be drafted based upon it .
It is very important that emission trading are one of various ways to solve the problem , the most important of which are financial control mechanisms .
Mr President , the two reports by Mr Moreira da Silva under discussion will be important while the Community prepares for the meeting next June of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol .
