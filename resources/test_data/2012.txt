the beginning , with the European Parliament deciding to do so only later .
The carbon economy must be a reality throughout the world and not only in Europe .
If , however , we wish to be credible partners in the eyes of the developing countries and if we wish to narrow the shocking divide between living conditions in the two hemispheres , we must also take action on training and education , on debt relief and funding for the poorest countries , on eradicating trade barriers and on gradually eliminating our subsidies to agriculture , fisheries and energy .
This lack of protection abroad is due to the absence of any international harmonisation of international rights and it is regrettable that the WIPO Diplomatic Conference , held in December 2000 , ended without a final agreement being reached on this matter .
Only those who believe they can control this type of phenomenon with bureaucratic measures could adopt such a position .
Almost three decades have passed since the fall of Saigon and since the reasons which , according to some people , could justify limitations on human rights , freedom and democracy have no longer applied .
In our view , the Commission must draw up an action plan and a precise and realistic timetable for the Vietnamese authorities to undertake urgent and fundamental reforms , release political prisoners , authorise freedom of worship and rescind recent initiatives that introduce further restrictions to freedom of information , such as access to satellite television .
For that reason , I was unable to take the floor just now .
In any case , we must be aware - and the blame lies with certain Member States of the European Union and with this House - that , over and above the proposals for double hulls , which we support , there are no political and legislative measures either in place or envisaged capable of preventing a fresh disaster if a new Prestige case were to occur .
We have now reached the final stage in our joint effort to reform the European employment strategy .
As regards cohesion and inclusion , we must tackle increasing social inequalities and persistent regional disparities .
A more stable set of guidelines covering the period up to 2010 , with a mid-term review in 2006 , should help us to respond to both short- and longer-term challenges .
Emphasis on results also demands that more importance is placed on the recommendations to the Member States .
Adaptability requires a good balance between flexibility and security in the labour market .
We must transform undeclared work into regular employment .
Let me now address the views of this Parliament .
Parliament fought hard to include a reference on the need to reduce unemployment .
Concerning a higher profile for the entrepreneurship priority , the Commission very much welcomes Parliament 's comments that the scope of the entrepreneurship guidelines should be widened to cover support for all SMEs , rather than just new start-ups .
However , it is important to stress that the success of the new European employment strategy ultimately relies on improved delivery and better governance .
The revised guidelines present concrete objectives , priorities and targets and strengthen the delivery and governance of the strategy as a whole .
This will have negative effects on employment , which will fall by 0.1 % , causing a rise in unemployment , which will reach an average of 8.8 % .
The present situation , however , demanded much more .
Reference to the Pact and compliance with its provisions is thus crucial to European employment strategy .
Furthermore , the battle against undeclared work should be joined with renewed vigour , reducing labour costs and making the creation of new jobs less burdensome .
.
We would like to recognise the efforts made by the Belgian , Spanish , Danish and now the Greek presidencies to launch these agreements following the decision taken by the European Council after the events of 11 September 2001 .
The Greek minister also discussed a number of these concerns in the debate that took place in plenary last month on the EU-US agreements .
Regarding protection against the death penalty , the draft extradition agreement compares with the strongest anti-death penalty clauses that can be found in existing bilateral treaties , whether an agreement with a Member State or one with a candidate country .
It is also my deep conviction that the European Convention will conclude positively on the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future constitution , thus giving it a legally binding and constitutional status .
Finally , regarding data protection provisions , the relevant provision in the draft mutual legal assistance agreement with the United States is modelled on the two most recent European texts : the European Union 's Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters of 2000 and the Council of Europe 's Convention on Cybercrime .
This attitude is incomprehensible , since we are dealing with something which is going to have a direct impact on the fundamental rights of our citizens .
Fourthly , there should be an explicit reference to Article 6( 1 ) of the Treaty on European Union , as well as to the European Charter on Fundamental Rights .
Therefore , I will just try to clarify some of the points raised and give the Commission 's opinion on those points .
This means that , acting in accordance with their international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights , Member States will refuse extradition where the death penalty is concerned .
When it comes to the European arrest warrant as such , I can even agree with Parliament .
So we are not changing the legal system of the European Union .
Finally , on the matter of special courts
