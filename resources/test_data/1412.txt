in mind that Community Law - directives and regulations - is often not complied with , it seems to us all the more unlikely that voluntary agreements will be complied with .
In short , Parliament ' s main concerns have been taken up , if not in an immediate and radical manner , at least to the extent that a commitment has been given to adopt decisions on this issue in the future .
It will take me just 20 seconds to express my gratitude to all the members of the Conciliation Committee : to Mr Provan , to Mrs Jackson , who also participated , and to the members of the Commission and the Council with whom we worked in order to reach an agreement on the report .
We therefore hope that you will be receptive to this request because , otherwise , we should bear in mind that all the projects , all the development plans for the rail networks affected by these specifications , would be subject to difficult conditions , and this would have a negative effect , since it would create uncertainty in relation to the planned investment programmes themselves .
For this reason , the transport of passengers and goods by rail has been suffering for decades .
It is possible to revitalise the railway , as certain projects that have already been undertaken demonstrate .
Nevertheless , a mishap like this reminds us , despite its trivial nature , of the need to give utmost priority to the constant control and improvement of the procedures in an installation such as the Sellafield reprocessing plant .
We therefore propose greater adaptability and flexibility in the labour market .
This is not an issue we can go into today , but I wanted to make those points .
The problem of full employment is patently one of our primary concerns .
This is something we have regularly stressed .
I would like to raise a point here which seems to me to be essential .
Firstly , with regard to the interinstitutional agreement , which has been of concern to the Commission , and secondly , the problems of greater coordination in the face of greater subsidiarity .
Lastly , I would like to point out that something has been raised which may seem contradictory between those who argue for greater coordination of economic policies and those who argue for greater subsidiarity in the way these policies are applied .
We would ask that the projections they make in the medium and long term take account of different scenarios relating to the development of interest rates , demographic development and other variables affecting the stability of our accounts in the long term .
These include , firstly , labour reform , which we discussed earlier .
This is the way to tackle the problem at source , and not only its effects .
I would like to conclude by arguing - and I believe this is one of the conclusions we must draw from Mr Pom√©s Ruiz ' s report - for greater coordination between the Member States with regard to the implementation of these programmes .
The Commission must judge them , but it is not our job to give instructions on this point .
These are instruments of a permanent nature which have the same characteristics in each of the Member States .
I said that I wanted to make a couple of additional comments on two points that have been raised concerning issues which are not strictly related to this report , but with the previous report .
In my view , in Amendment No 4 , it would make more sense to adopt a more positive approach with regard to the Greek government ' s future obligations than it would to adopt an approach which raises doubts as to its capacity to fulfil its obligations .
It is most enlightening to compare the two reports presented by our colleague , Mr Savary , even if these documents have different legal bases .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Goebbels for his report and also the various participants in this debate .
I would like to talk about some of the points which have been mentioned today , given the concern about the Greek model .
We must not forget that Belgium and Italy have benefited from the fall in debt resulting from the reduction in interest rates , which is due , in particular , to the approximation of the interest rates of their Central Banks with those of the European Central Bank .
At the moment , the harmonised CPI , in the case of Greece , stands at 2.1 % , a drop of 0.7 % on the March figure ; this is a better situation , for example , than certain countries of the monetary union , such as Belgium , Spain , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg and Finland .
I am convinced that all of that will happen , and the Greek Government has committed itself to ensuring that it does .
It is obliged to comply with it .
Secondly , the funds made available through the cancellation of debt must be used for human development funds , particularly for investment in health and education .
By uniting the actions of debtors and creditors in a global strategy aimed at the elimination of poverty , it is possible that we will achieve objective 15 of the Copenhagen Summit on social development , which is an objective which we fully identify with .
However , we shall continue with our agenda .
Nevertheless , what the Commission does is take funds intended for agriculture , and which have already been approved under Agenda 2000 , at the Berlin Summit , as if there were a surplus , and divert them to foreign policy
