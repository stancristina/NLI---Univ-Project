Mr President , before taking part in this debate , I reread a very interesting document , the text of a complaint lodged with the Court of Justice in 1996 by the French farmers ' association Syndicat agricole français de la coordination rurale and by Philippe de Villiers against the Commission , which the plaintiffs accused of mismanaging the BSE crisis , putting the principle of the free movement of goods before public health and failing to apply the precautionary principle .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we now know that the use of certain substances in livestock can have very dangerous effects on the human organism .
Let us not fool ourselves .
The first year of implementation of the programme shows that this wish has been fulfilled .
If the experiment bears fruit , we shall launch more initiatives for the promotion of the publishing trade in its role as a carrier of culture .
For various reasons , it is not possible to devote a special year to books and reading , but I believe we should sit down together and think about a books and reading day or week or month , which could be staged some time after the start of 2002 .
For this reason we have voted against these two reports .
Breathing fresh life into this Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is becoming a matter of urgency .
Point 21 is particularly revealing in this respect and speaks of "encouraging liberalisation of the Mediterranean partners ' economic systems and implementing the structural reforms required to enable them to compete on more open markets . "
The fight against drug trafficking and the real drug barons demands radical measures , specifically resolute and effective action against the laundering of profits from trafficking and the introduction of a Tobin tax on movements of capital , which , by redistributing such income , would help to satisfy the needs of the entire Colombian people .
In conclusion , we believe that if such a debate is to be held in Parliament , it must be organised in a serious and efficient manner .
In protecting ourselves against these coffin ships , we are also showing our concern for the protection of the marine environment as well as shipboard living and working conditions .
The method adopted was to lay down "technical specifications for interoperability " for each rail subsystem in conjunction with rail companies , infrastructure managers and manufacturers .
What conclusions do you draw from such assessments ?
If you do , furthermore , take on board the proposal from our fellow Member , Klaus Hänsch , the proposals you presented this morning should enable us to re-establish the natural complicity which there should be between both our institutions in order to have successful dialogue within the institutional triangle .
The issue of the political clout of the European Union in the world and the issue of solidarity , or what I prefer to call the issue of the social model , are indeed critical matters on which we must again find the resolve to live together within the European Union .
The Commission has the right of initiative and must present proposals .
How , for example , do you plan to use the new European Industrial Relations Observatory , to be operated by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin , which this great House , the European Parliament , was so dedicated to creating ?
Until now we have worked in perfect agreement , and that includes with our liberal friends .
We shall have to go much further to respond to the democratic demands of the working citizens of Europe .
The fact is , however , that the perfect agreement that has been reached between conservatives , Labour Party members , liberals and socialists , on the end of this derogation period is based on the fact that , as the report itself says , " the possibilities for derogation [are ] sufficient in order to provide the necessary flexibility " and this will not therefore have "adverse effects on employment opportunities for young people " .
It goes without saying that these national disparities represent a considerable obstacle to the development of rail transport in Europe , despite the many advantages offered by this less polluting form of transport .
We shall vote in favour of this report since it is important to promote the interoperability of the trans-European rail system .
This time , I took the advice of Mr Fatuzzo the sailor .
In 10 years , almost 150 bulk carriers have sunk , causing 800 deaths .
There will also be reports dealing with your safety as well . "
However , the recent disasters involving the Erika and Ievoli Sun vessels have shown that the even best resolutions are worthless unless we provide ourselves with the means to apply them and to have them applied .
We also oppose those who pretend to deplore the effects of restructurings on society yet who do nothing to propose the slightest binding measure to prevent them .
The conditions in which these goods are produced are not being questioned either ; yet , to produce goods , we need creative artists and authors .
The information society is no more than a snare and we are indulgently allowing it to be used here in an attempt to confiscate the most timeless and most precious thing we can own - intellectual property .
This new context is constantly changing and raises many questions and concerns .
Commissioner , you said that the European Union was unable to compensate farmers for their losses .
I would like to know what the Commission intends to do about this .
The notorious lack of any requirement for traceability is a source of provocation to all the people who wish , quite legitimately ,
