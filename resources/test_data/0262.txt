real challenge of the new millennium : preventing conflicts , finding a non-military solution to the crisis and , most importantly , combating terrorism .
You see , the greater the possibility of seeing Europe united in terms of foreign policy , of making our foreign policy practical reality , the more successful Europe ' s internal politics will be .
I am thinking , rather , of the extremely tangible progress made in the field of honesty : the courage and honesty of a President who is able to condemn the corruption present in his own country .
Mr Lamassoure has painted an objective , clear picture of the country but , despite some positive elements , he does not hide his concern that Turkey might regress to a state which is worse than the current situation .
It is necessary to remember the past in order to do better in the future .
At last , as of today , we are on the way to more stringent legislation , to a code of procedure which has the merit of courageously placing safety above all other concerns , including economic and financial concerns .
We must therefore vote with conviction for the infrastructure funding to speed up the procedure involved in rebuilding the Brenner rail tunnel and the Fr√©jus rail tunnel , and move road vehicles onto trains , with benefits for the safety of those who travel and also for the surrounding environment .
It will certainly be a shock , but I hope to be able to vote for it again next time .
All ports are important , like the port of Marseille and those on the other coasts of Europe , which is the union of countries that has the largest number of seafaring people .
These pensioners deserve to go to Heaven , as all pensioners do , but it would be better if their pensions arrived while they were still alive !
Given these conditions , I believe the promotion of the European Union as a political entity is the principal task we need to address .
To achieve this goal , it must issue itself a momentous challenge : to turn words into deeds and initiate 'enhanced cooperation ' in the sphere of a political Europe .
We are Europe !
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we cannot begin a debate on this subject without remembering the ten latest victims claimed by the St Gotthard tunnel , and Mr Fischler was quite right to pay tribute to them , but we must also remember that , this very morning , yet another incident took place in the Petit St Bernard tunnel .
Quite rightly , therefore , people have started discussing the subject of the Mont Blanc tunnel , particularly in the last couple of days , and proposals have been made to try to prevent the tunnel from reopening and thus protect the land around it .
I must say that I totally disagree with this proposal , although I understand the legitimate aspirations of those living in a particular area to protect their environment .
It goes without saying that , in addition to the environmental damage , there is also the economic damage that we have a duty to consider here : during the two and a half years that it has been closed , it has been calculated that Italy alone has lost EUR 1 500 million , and the Val d ' Aosta region will have seen its own regional gross domestic product fall by 10 % .
I shall end , Mr President , by reminding the House that there is a new proposal that might help : the Aosta-Martigny rail link , which starts in Milan , is not one of the European priorities but could be included if France and Italy take the matter up .
I believe that all these events should serve to make it clear that extreme positions on both sides are useless .
We want rail tunnels : we want the Turin-Lyon tunnel ; we also want the Aosta-Martigny tunnel , this rail project that may acquire vital , decisive importance .
This is the only way we can prevent further disasters .
We should also adopt any other provisions that will help distribute commercial vehicle journeys evenly among the all-too-few road tunnels linking Italy to Europe .
Well then , I am frankly disappointed by the presence , with all due respect to her , of the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister , Mrs Durant , whose remit is transport , not war , and though she will , I am sure , have a dramatic speech from the Presidency to read out to us .
That means that , as often happens in these cases , the decision we take with our vote will not be taken into any account by the Council .
Since the setting-up of Europol , the European Parliament has pointed out the need to supervise it .
We should also note that Europol officials benefit from immunity that is so wide-ranging that it is like a guarantee of impunity , protecting them with regard to the judicial control which can be exercised at national level .
The momentum to implement the necessary measures has repeatedly faltered in the face of often short-sighted resistance on the part of the governments .
The first stipulates that Europol ' s mandate may be extended to all serious forms of organised crime already listed in the Annex to the Convention in accordance with the priorities established by the Council upon the proposal of Europol ' s management board .
They firmly reiterate the opinion , often expressed by Parliament , that it is becoming increasingly necessary to communitise the instruments of judicial cooperation and to consolidate the judicial and democratic control of these instruments , which are , in fact , quite vital
