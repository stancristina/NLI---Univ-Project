's meeting at the Japanese parliament , where Prime Minister Abe stated very clearly that Japan would not respond by developing nuclear weapons .
North Korea is a poor country , where most of the population go hungry and do not enjoy the living conditions we would all wish them to have ; yet their government goes on spending millions of dollars on an arms race and on achieving a nuclear capability of which it has no need whatsoever for the development and well-being of its people .
As the High Representative just said , not only does it threaten regional stability in north-east Asia , it also constitutes the latest in a series of challenges by Kim Jong-il to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime .
I am pleased that we will have an opportunity to discuss the EU 's response at the General Affairs Council next week .
It is still a little early to say what action we should take , although various options are on the table .
Perhaps NAIADES inspires us , and perhaps the Commissioner should take note and appoint two women coordinators for NAIADES.
We are therefore pleased to be able to include ourselves in this European project .
In the report on logistics , which I hope to be able to present to this House , I will clearly also include Mrs Wortmann-Kool 's proposals on improving logistical aspects and innovation and technological progress for reducing operational costs . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , in the two and a half years that I have been an MEP , this must the third time , or perhaps there have been more , that we have had to discuss human rights violations in Tibet , and I fear that it will not be the last .
The Court of Auditors plays its role , often with little cooperation from the Member States and their national control institutions .
The guiding principle of our report will be good financial management .
I believe that progress on the promotion , defence and knowledge of this linguistic diversity must be supported by the Member States by means of active policies for promoting and defending languages in education and in the more social realm , including in the media , and the promotion of the learning of at least two foreign languages , with a view to facilitating knowledge of other cultures , promoting mobility and increasing awareness amongst the European citizens .
Finally , within the Community institutions , it must be possible for communication between the citizens and the Union to be carried out in their mother tongues .
Promoting multilingualism in Europe therefore means wealth and progress .
We will probably not be able to go much further at the moment .
With regard to the other amendments , there are still certain issues outstanding , such as the issue of representatives at customs .
In short , Mr President , we are in agreement with Mrs Fourtou 's report ; I believe that we could reach an agreement very quickly amongst the three institutions in order to approve the two reports , and we hope that this Parliament will approve the amendments from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs without any great difficulty . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , the Commission has made a great effort to adapt the internal system for bananas to changing circumstances .
We do not know what has happened with the efforts that the President of this Parliament promised to make a year ago now , but if he has done anything , then its results are plain to see .
Many of us believe that that is right .
One of the outstanding tasks is precisely the one we are discussing today : opening up passenger services by rail to the common European area .
We also want to encourage private initiative to invest in the development of railways and , to that end , we propose that framework agreements on the award of rail services may last for fifteen years , and more in cases of large investments in specialised infrastructures that present an annual repayment plan that justify that exceptional duration .
A statement of a general nature is not sufficient , since it affects many aspects of the internal market .
As Mrs Wallis has said , there are currently thousands of people , or hundreds of thousands of people , crossing national borders , and I believe that Mr Frattini was right on another issue , and that is that we should not just focus on cross-border accidents or incidents , but on all of those cases in which , as a result of a series of situations - such as medical treatment or accommodation - a person suffers damages in one country and the problem of limitations arises in another country .
What we are doing is asking the Commission to look into the possibility of presenting a report , and I believe that at this stage we should restrict ourselves to the first part of the resolution .
In short , I believe that Mr Lehne 's proposal is a good one .
This instrument must serve to exploit as far as possible the benefits and possibilities that the globalisation of data and services offer to governments , to private enterprise , to universities , to society as a whole and , most importantly , to the citizens .
Although it is true that there are many , shall we say , differing opinions on this matter , we would like to make a concrete proposal , and that is to work on the basis of the proposal which was presented and approved within the United Nations on the proposal of the then Secretary-General Kofi Annan , in turn on the proposal of the High-Level Group .
