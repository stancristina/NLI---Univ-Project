political mediator between the Russians , who are incapable of coming up with a political solution , and the Chechens , who cannot extricate themselves from terrorism .
Having radically and unanimously condemned terrorism , it is now for us to speak out equally clearly on the roots of these appalling outbreaks of violence , on the results of the much-vaunted war on terrorism , which was launched in order to curb them , and on the EU’s responsibilities in this crucial context .
It must also do away with the intolerable immunity granted to the Sharon Government , which is openly defying the UN , the International Court of Justice and international law in general .
The attack on Beslan immerses us in absolute horror , in the denial of humanity , into the age of barbarism , and we cannot help but feel sickened at the sight of parents put to death in front of their children , or at the sight of children being used as human shields at windows .
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for having , with his customary subtlety and frankness , invited us to cross the somewhat simplistic gulfs between Atlanticism and anti-Americanism , between unilateralism and multilateralism .
Finally , I believe that it is now time to call an international conference in support of the political transition and to facilitate the restructuring of Iraq .
As the violence spirals , we are becoming unable to distinguish between victim and executioner , confusing resistance fighters with terrorists , the unfortunate fate of soldiers killed in action with that of civilian victims of what we euphemistically describe as excessive force .
Of the four recommendations that we made at that time , the Commission accepted three : to push for the restoration of a balanced budget only during periods of growth ; to tolerate reasonable deficits during periods when growth is poor ; to lay down monetary and budgetary rules as part of the governance of democratically debated broad economic policy guidelines .
Commissioner , you really do have my warmest congratulations , because the Finance and Economy Ministers have said that they regard your communication as a good basis on which to work .
The debate must break out of this enclosure , for if it does not , economic policies , which are , in the final analysis , a matter for the collective choice of societies for the good of their peoples , will not be placed in the public arena .
Whilst one must welcome the fact that the Eurogroup has a permanent chairman in the shape of Mr Junker , it nonetheless remains the case that a chairman simply presides over meetings and does not make decisions .
Non-compliance with the Pact on the part of a growing number of Member States is clearly a serious breach of good budgetary behaviour .
Let me say at this point that I am answering on behalf of my colleague Mr Vitorino , who asked me to convey his apologies , but I should like to make it clear that , alongside Mr Vitorino , I have followed recent Council debates on the draft Constitution , on behalf of my colleague Mr Barnier .
Lastly , Parliament and the Commission , along with the Council , may decide to hold another version of the ‘Springtime of Europe ’ initiative , which had reached numerous young people ; schools are asked to arrange information meetings on their premises .
The problem with a referendum , however , is that while it is the most democratic process , it is also , by its nature , the most likely to be used for the wrong objective .
Accordingly , the proposal to hold the vote in all EU countries during the same period , namely 5 to 8 May 2005 , should enable us to employ certain symbols in the cause of adoption : the symbol of unity of place – an entire European Union expressing its opinion at the same time , as opposed to 25 countries voting one after another ; the symbol of the unity of one text – one joint answer to one joint question ; the symbol of the unity of time – the whole Union voting at the same time , from Thursday 5 to Sunday 8 , whilst complying with national traditions of polls held either during the week or on a Sunday ; and lastly , the symbol of 8 May 2005 , the 60th anniversary of the last conflict that set us against one another .
We did not allocate EUR 1.5 million to the preliminary draft Budget for 2005 in order to reduce the projects , but because , at the time the preliminary draft Budget was being drawn up , we were still too uncertain of the eventual outcome .
I will close , Mr President , by expressing the wish that this meeting in Amsterdam might be able to shed as much light as possible on what would make for an effective partnership between Parliament , the Council and the Commission in winning the battle on the information front ; I would suggest that it would be objectivity and truthfulness , for I have confidence in Europe and am convinced that truthful information will be likely to win widespread public support .     I am particularly disappointed by the answer given by the Council , as we know we are bringing pressure to bear on the United States and on Russia , but today we know that we have certain means at our disposal , including conditions relating to the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in the agreements with the Member States .
Only dialogue and information will make it possible to move public opinion forward .
I would very much like all Members to vote for it as it stands
