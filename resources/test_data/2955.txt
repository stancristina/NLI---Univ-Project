70 % of the arable land while more than seven million black Zimbabweans scratch a living from overcrowded communal areas .
We condemn the violence but we also see that black Zimbabweans have a compelling case .
This makes President Mugabe ' s refusal to proceed with the lawful land redistribution programme even more deplorable .
It is a fearsomely difficult problem when Mugabe will not negotiate .
But I call on the UK Government to do all they can to persuade Zimbabwe to set up an independent arbitration board fully representative of the landless people and , once it is set up , perhaps with the assistance of the Commonwealth , to resume financial aid as soon as possible .
The British Government must recognise the moral debt owed for crimes of slavery and colonialism and continue to do all in its power to support a peaceful and progressive settlement to the land issues in Zimbabwe .
Mr President , the story of Zimbabwe is one of hope turning to despair - hope that in 1980 Zimbabwe could have realised its full potential and become a leading country in Africa ; despair now because the father of the nation has reduced his creation from being one of the richest and most educated of African countries to being one of the poorest .
It is a truly remarkable achievement and a case study of mismanagement in recent history .
I am sure Mr Mugabe ' s place in history books is now secured for all the wrong reasons .
Today the country is suffering from 50 % unemployment and 60 % inflation ; he is spending USD 1 million a day on a foreign adventure in the Congo ; the foreign exchange reserves have gone and the World Bank has suspended funding on projects .
I was astonished to hear the speech just given by my colleague from the Greens .
Yet out of despair comes resolution , determination and hope .
The country is one of the most educated in Africa and the European Union should be proud of its role in helping to set up that educational support structure in the past 20 years .
It has a functioning civic institution and culture .
Elections are due and voter rolls are being prepared but those voter rolls must be verified before the election .
The opposition parties want more transparency .
Twenty people have been killed and more than 1 200 farms illegally occupied .
Mr Mugabe has lost control of the country , presiding over lawlessness and corruption .
On 24 June elections are going to be held .
Yesterday , the Commonwealth Secretary-General said that it is still possible to have free elections .
The future of the country lies with the young people of Zimbabwe .
They demand the elections .
They must be given a chance .
It is their future .
One thing we must do is to change the culture that is prevalent in Africa today that the winner takes all .
We must stop this winner-takes-all culture that every African country has , and I mean every country .
We must be seen to have free and fair elections and to demonstrate that they have been fair and free .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I attend Question Time nearly every time and every time the first question or two are from our colleagues in the Greek Communists and , in particular , Mr Alavanos .
You will notice that the date on this question is 30 March 2000 , which was two weeks before the last part-session .
Therefore , in my view , it should not have been number one on the list but should have been on the last part-session ' s list of questions .
There seems to be some system whereby Mr Alavanos and his colleagues always get the first and second questions , and they always attack Turkey .
I should like you to investigate why this should be .
Question No 3 by (H-0365/00 ) : Subject : EU-Jordan Association Agreement Would the Council please list those Member States which have still to ratify the EU-Jordan Association Agreement and advise what level of priority it is giving to encouraging them to speed up the process ?
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying how delighted I am that the presidency is prepared to put some pressure on the governments which , in turn , I hope will put pressure on their parliaments to proceed with ratification .
It is quite shaming that after well over six months there are eight Member States still to ratify .
The Jordanians are particularly sensitive to the slow pace of progress .
Commissioner Patten is determined to reinvigorate the whole Barcelona process and the European-Mediterranean relationship .
I hope that the Council will follow that lead and ensure that this is transmitted down through the governments to the Member State parliaments .
Could he give me some assurance that the Council gives Mr Patten its full support in what he is trying to do in the Mediterranean area ?
Mr President , I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply and I am pleased that work is under way and in fact , near finalisation .
Hopefully , it will not be too long before we have details of the proposals .
I am also pleased that the President-in-Office has recognised that the engine of growth in the economy are the SMEs providing 70 % of the jobs .
Therefore , it is blindingly obvious that SMEs will play an important role if we are to resolve the very high unemployment problems that we have generally in the Union and specifically in various regions of the Union .
I did ask a specific question about fisheries .
Of course , fisheries by their very nature create much-needed jobs in coastal regions of the Union
