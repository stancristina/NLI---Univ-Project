Mr President , I voted against the Haug report on the budget guidelines for the 2001 budgetary procedure for reasons which may seem futile to the other Members present , but which hold great importance for me , for I was elected to this Parliament to represent the Pensioners ' Party and I intend to do everything possible , and the impossible as well , to draw attention to the requests , needs and requirements of the elderly .
However , allow me to say that it does not go far enough for me or the Pensioners ' Party .
Mr President , I read the Turmes report on electricity very carefully and I voted for it .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , ladies and gentlemen , as Mr Gama said , the recent Lisbon Summit was a great success for Europe .
It was certainly a turning point .
The Commission also made a decisive contribution to this success , for the conclusions are significantly similar to the contents of the preliminary synthesis document which we drew up in preparation for the Council .
The Commission was asked to develop a benchmarking strategy to define best practice and to guarantee both the development of the necessary infrastructures and the availability of the necessary funds .
I would just like to mention some of the items on our agenda : firstly , we are going to draw up new legislative proposals , in particular regarding the legal framework for e-commerce - which has become extremely urgent due to the inadequacy of the present framework for e-commerce - and for procurement ; secondly , we are going to introduce benchmarking in all the stages of the "open coordination " process in the areas of research , enterprise policy and social exclusion ; thirdly , we are going to present our communication , entitled " A new European social agenda " , which will serve as the basis for the Nice Summit organised by the French Presidency ; finally , we are going to prepare for the spring Councils by producing an annual synthesis of economic and social progress which will be a sort of general report on the economic and social situation in Europe .
At that meeting I raised the point of the European Union ' s political responsibility for the Balkan region , and stressed that our entire credibility is at stake .
To sum up , Madam President , I would like to thank this House for its valuable contribution to the Lisbon Summit and for all it did to ensure the Council ' s success .
The few days - hours even - which separated the two debates revealed a wealth of differences : when we talk of a new Europe , an innovative Europe , we must not forget that , across the water , there is a terrible situation in Africa which is out of control .
When the means of distributing the most basic , simple wealth changes , the entire economy changes as well .
The significance of Lisbon lies in the fact that , when we are united in our action , this boosts the productivity of the system .
This is clearly the way to overcome the problems experienced even by some of the larger European countries in recent months such as a shortage of young engineers and the need to import Internet engineers from the third world .
Finally , we need a little bit of luck as well , for perception of this recovery is necessary for all these initiatives to be effective .
This is my maiden speech in this Chamber .
Parliament has tried to tackle this issue several times in the past , apparently without ever achieving tangible results .
Has the Commission already received from the Member States applications by producers for chocolate of this kind to be included in the register of certificates of specific character ?
It plays a secondary role , as do all those who are not part of a national government .
The issues on which we agree are as follows : systematic extension , not extension on a case by case basis , of the majority vote to the Council ; codecision ; the urgent need to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding and to extend the possibility of recourse to the Court beyond the economic sphere ; the provisions on closer cooperation and so forth .
We are , however , very critical of the reduction of the constitution issue to a mere technical operation separating the Treaties into two parts , which , apart from anything else , would be very similar .
Most importantly , in the same way as the 1984 Spinelli Treaty , this report does not live up to the challenge of being a milestone , a clear , unambiguous indication of where we want to be with those who wish to be there .
We must do everything possible to reduce the number of vehicles carrying dangerous goods along the roads of Europe to a minimum .
I have heard on the grapevine that a gene is being discovered which prolongs human life , and I am a little concerned that we may be placing too many restrictions on science and the use of genetically modified organisms .
Let us place photographs of our citizens inside all the bureaucratic files with which the States fill our offices .
There are two alternatives : either the founding countries of the Community change direction , or else , slowly but surely , we will be forced to abandon all hope .
Madam President , the fact that I am addressing Commissioner Barnier in this Chamber , with whom I have often had the opportunity for discussion in smaller meetings , gives me a positive feeling about tomorrow ' s debate , but my view of the medium - and long-term progress of European development
