they at least want to make sure that the external damage caused is made as invisible as possible .
It may be possible to live with silicone breasts if they are periodically replaced with new material .
And what for ?
In this context , we should be offering facilities to help drug addicts kick their habit .
Both points of view get in the way of proper information and the achievement of good health .
Nor should Parliament urge Member States to 'concentrate on promoting and securing acceptance of the image of women as they actually are ' .
I would like to remind you that when the European Union realised that we had fallen behind in the area of the information society , your predecessor Mr Bangemann brought into being a platform that encouraged European Member States to catch up .
That does , however , give us in the European Union a responsibility , in our cooperation with Kazakhstan , to talk about each other 's position as good friends , and that is what is now a cause for concern .
True friends tell each other the truth ; we must be able to do this in this relationship .
One day later , on Sunday 2 February , a police officer accompanied by a colleague and two drunken 'witnesses ' disrupted the morning service of the non-registered Baptist community in Leninogorsk .
We cannot , however , have a situation where we in the European Parliament systematically want more sanctions than any of the Member States to which we belong , if the whole Council , which is again , incidentally , absent , does not intervene and does not opt for an unambiguous solution .
Not even a Convention will help bring one about .
Fortunately our Parliament is consistent , or at least most of the parties are , and we must keep it that way .
The situation in Zimbabwe once again calls for an urgent debate .
Against this sinister background , it is absolutely shocking that France has now invited this dictator to the Franco-African Summit conference in Paris .
I am very pleased that we will be voting on this issue this week , because it is clear that information is already being passed on to the United States .
You will understand that I am not at all opposed to the liberalisation of port services , but I too would like to lodge my objection to the paranoid way in which the French army insists on protecting our parliament building against possible demonstrators at the moment .
The European Union is also one of the biggest exporters of services in the world , so it is also an important matter of self-interest .
Commissioner Reding provided a very convincing argument for not making a new proposal for the audio-visual sector .
I therefore think that it should also benefit developing countries .
On the one hand , the so-called FSC arrangement , the favourable tax legislation for American exporters which must now be reviewed thanks to the WTO statement , and on the other hand , the alarming reports that American draft legislation is being prepared that will limit the tax benefits of subsidiaries of non-US companies .
These negotiations are certainly more than crucial for Europe .
The European Union is the biggest exporter of commercial services in the world , accounting for 26 % of worldwide trade in services , as opposed to 22 % in the United States and 7 % in Japan .
The trade in services in the European Union therefore accounts for more than two-thirds of our gross foreign product and jobs .
I therefore support my colleague Mr Nicholas Clegg 's plea for change during the Convention .
In exchange for a limited number of questions , particularly concerning the mobility of labour from southern Member States , Europe wants to liberalise a number of sectors including some that we do not want to liberalise .
We are also rightly making rules that create a framework for the free circulation of services and we are rightly including specific aspects of ports .
That is something we urgently need .
Secondly , one of the reasons why the people who are protesting at the moment are angry is the fact that a number of amendments we are trying to introduce , relating amongst other things to authorisation , licences and Article 13 on self-handling , have been declared inadmissible .
It is their dedication and their professional knowledge that make our ports fast , competitive and in particular safe handling organisations .
Mr President , it is not for a procedural motion , it is for a personal fact .
The present directive got off to a messy start , but we now finally have a good document on the table .
I therefore do not support Amendment No 13 in which self-handling is again toned down - in a definition , would you believe .
Important points such as the provisions on transparency , the duration of licences , new ports and arrangements concerning the compensation that service providers have to pay when buying themselves out of a contract period , are in my opinion plain and clear .
I have a couple of amendments that make it possible for self-handlers to unload cargo both on the ship and on the quay .
Mr President , today it has once again become clear how far decision-making in the European Union is from the reality of the people it concerns .
The main aim is to cut labour costs even further .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the International Labour Organisation has found it necessary to behave in a regulatory way in respect of port labour , precisely because port labour has so much to do with safety and because this is an area where social dumping has occurred
