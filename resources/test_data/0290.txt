a large market .
It is important to achieve a more social Europe , therefore to have more European social legislation .
But we regard this transfer as very dangerous , for it would deprive the national parliaments of any right of inspection in regard to future WTO negotiations on these areas that are vital to the life of our societies .
As for the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the only reason the meeting of Heads of State and Government signed it was in order to be seen to make a statement .
In other words , the philosopher 's stone of closer cooperation , which would allow the rule of unanimity and the right of veto , which protects national interests , to be circumvented on the sly , would achieve the amazing feat of violating the principle of equality between states , excluding minority nations from key issues , thus opening up cracks in the democratic foundations of European integration , making the European institutions even less transparent and spreading confusion , if not disarray , within the Council and the Commission .
At a time when our European Union is becoming bogged down in rampant nationalism and threatened by more or less cleverly camouflaged fascistic attitudes , we needed and we need a breath of fresh air .
Olivier Duhamel and his report together achieve this very ably .
Everything has been done to stage a sanitised debate between supporters of federalism and supporters of sovereignty .
In complete agreement with the common sense of Jacques Delors ' s words , I did not vote in favour of Mr Duhamel ' s report .
This enabled them to advance at different rates and/or with different objectives .
While reluctantly accepting that in an enlarged European Union there will be a need for an 'avant-garde ' I agree with Mr Gil-Robles that there are some essential conditions that must be fulfilled : Reinforced cooperation must be developed within the institutional framework of the Union .
That is another missed opportunity .
The more progress that is made in scientific research , the more new questions are raised .
That is the strong stance our citizens expect , rather than the kind of tolerance that can end up seriously damaging consumer health .
Now that is absolutely intolerable .
The European Parliament even adds , in paragraph 6 of its resolution , the phrase " while subjecting the powers to be transferred to detailed scrutiny" , just when we thought that no powers were to be transferred .
In the name of respect for subsidiarity and effectiveness , we must give pride of place to measures taken in a national context , where independent agencies can rapidly provide genuinely scientific opinions undiluted by other considerations and the political authorities can take the necessary risk-management decisions for the benefit of the people who have given them a mandate to protect their safety .
For my part , in France , I do not need an authority in order to restore my confidence ; I trust the French Food Safety Agency and its opinions , especially in relation to mad cow disease .
If we want to make a really useful contribution to keeping or restoring peace , we need a deeper knowledge of the history , culture and even language of the country in which we are to intervene .
We must make a commitment to tell the military junta in the Ivory Coast , and all dictatorships , that we will never issue them with visas or give them protection .
A total of 77 states still see the death penalty as the appropriate response to certain crimes .
The Presidency of the European Union could also join this campaign , thereby giving inspiration and crucial backing to those who are fighting for abolition .
This aid must go on social concerns , the widows and orphans and so on .
But solutions can be found in cogeneration , based on biomass or gas .
The European Union delegation must stand firm .
As a result , this mechanism must be looked upon not as a frontline tool but , on the contrary , as an instrument complementary to other measures aimed at reducing greenhouses gases .
Focusing on research now will provide us with the means to find answers to all these questions .
So , even though there are no certainties , it is much too early to overturn the regulations on responsibility applied to this matter .
But they do not manage to sell because the powerful purchasing and distribution groups buy outside Europe - obtaining pears from Argentina and apples from Chile , New Zealand and South Africa .
But I want , above all , to congratulate Mr Jov√© Peres on the quality of his report , whose judicious proposals aim to improve even more significantly the results of this production channel for the countries of southern Europe , most notably by setting public support at 4.5 % of the value of the marketed production and by increasing it in some cases to 6 % in order to encourage producer organisations to pool their produce .
I hope , therefore , that the framework directive entitled ' A Universal Service ' , for which I was appointed rapporteur in July of last year on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , and which I now have to salvage despite the attempts of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , will enable us to redress the balance to some extent .
I was already against it back in 1981 .
The developed countries doing the polluting and the less developed or underdeveloped countries about to do so must be made aware of the situation
