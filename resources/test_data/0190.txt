I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively , with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible , not only in terms of its application , but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives .
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .

For many years I was a traitor to my country ; at least that was General Franco ' s view .
Secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people .
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence .
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State .
Therefore , Madam President , the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message , rejecting of the tiger of intolerance , xenophobia and totalitarianism , so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications , renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe ' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price .
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform .
Mr President , I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself .
We believe that , in the political design of the Union , other issues need to be dealt with .
Mr President , to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new .
That puts enlargement in danger .
We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally , which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive , which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council .
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .
However , this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results , such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency ' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competences of the Community Courts .
It is true that it is a stopgap solution , but we must rely on stopgap solutions because , at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference .
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference , let us consider just two points .
In a debate , there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said .
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached , with great difficulty , with the Council in December , according to which , when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary .
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate .
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges , but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors .
I would say the same about Amendment No 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seems to us to be basically correct .
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes .
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed , on a confidential basis , if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality , on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance .
However , I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement , which , like all agreements , is perhaps not perfect , but which , I believe , allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing .
Furthermore , behind these programmes , that is to say , the SAVE programme , which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings , and the Altener programme , which concerns renewable energy , there lies an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole .
On the one hand , it continued to refuse to accept the term " European cultural policy " or other similar terms , even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty , and it defines " Culture 2000 " simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more .
Lastly , I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual qualities , make him , in my opinion , the best possible rapporteur this report could have had .
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed , not only in the case of lead , cadmium and mercury , but also in the case of waste which
