We therefore call upon the Commission to assist Equatorial Guinea to create the necessary monitoring capacity and in this connection we refer to the cooperative approach between development cooperation and fishing as repeatedly requested by the European Parliament .
Neither seems to be fully implemented here .
The requirement to inform and consult Parliament on time is right on principle and in future blocking measures by us are no longer out of the question either .
Mr President , Mr President of the Council , Mr Commissioner , as an Austrian I am delighted to be the first speaker from my group - in fact , I come from a country which is considerably affected by the enlargement of the European Union , although I realise I am only speaking first because Klaus HÃ¤nsch arrived relatively late due to difficult circumstances and he was generous enough to allow me to speak .
No, enlargement is a chance to create a common area of welfare and security in Europe , and we must seize that chance !
The process of enlargement is becoming difficult and there are many stones in the path to enlargement which must be cleared away by the applicant countries but also by the European Union itself , which must prepare itself via the necessary institutional and political reforms for enlargement .
The Commission 's plan is however not exactly an invitation , but rather an obstacle for those who in previous decades , at the cost of great personal privation , supported the idea of a democratic Europe in the east .
It is possible for us to send out a signal that we do not want any drawing of borders in this continent .
I believe that is only too justified .
These are things which show that Hungary has really belonged to Europe from the start and therefore has a right to be accepted as soon as possible , quite apart from the fact that the Hungarian economy has a thoroughly western style and has made great progress .
Poland is a very large country , in its history , its culture , its spiritual and intellectual bases .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the impending enlargement presents the European Union with its most important challenge since its foundation .
A little more conservatism in the calculations would not have gone amiss .
Therefore , I would summarize it as follows : if lack of clarity is a feature of good policy then we shall win a prize for good policy with what we decide tomorrow !
The third question of principle is : how strong is Europe becoming ?
The courage and foresight of the 1950s ' generation of politicians consisted of making progress , not with all European states , not even with all the states in the west , but with those which were ready and able .
Farmers in the Alpine valleys form the backbone of the economic and cultural life of large areas in some Member States , including above all Austria .
This is the stated wish and aim of a democratically legal Austrian Parliament which the Austrian MEPs were requested to represent .
It is full of lies and deception !
We need a reduction in the population limit , we need a reform , just for our own sakes .
In this context let me quote an idea of the Czech President Vaclav Havel , who once wrote that it is not simply a question of Membership of the club of the wealthy but also of an acknowledgment of western civilization and an escape from the vacuum between east and west .
It is very interesting that we are now faced with a more or less concealed fight over distribution within the European Union which very much reminds me of what we have already discussed at the beginning of the 1980s .
Also the new border of the European Union means that we must build bridges to those countries who in the long term or in the foreseeable future will not get into the European Union and if in building bridges we lose sight of the Ukraine and Russia then we shall also be making a mistake .
Today we are discussing the implications of this response which , we have decided , and the others are waiting for our answers and above all for us to display our will to give this answer .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , from an economic point of view Slovakia is not one of the strongest applicant countries .
I quote this apparently minor example - perhaps not too many colleagues noticed it - because it is very indicative of the imperfection of Agenda 2000 submitted to us by the Commission .
This is shown particularly by experiences of recent years of an increasingly intensive cooperation , the formation of numerous euro regions on the eastern borders of the European Union .
We cannot on Sunday talk about jobs and on Monday be against eastward enlargement .
On the other hand in the long term the only way the situation can be helped is firstly by developing a European policy into the worldwide regulatory institutions for maritime traffic , which aims at binding , socially and environmentally supportable , clear rules and secondly puts into effect our own European guidelines for the ecological safety and social supportability of sea traffic in this , the largest economic area in the world .
It is not a question of impairing the independence of the European central bank .
Otherwise they could have made the Hennegau a better objective 2 area .
That is the financing of destruction .
Mr President , I indicated my desire to speak at the start .
Firstly - as has been stated - there is the question of further and continued education .
I would
