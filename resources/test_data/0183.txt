our detriment , but not only to the detriment of the European Union industry .
Other countries - Japan for one - are also suffering from this .
Action clearly must be taken .
It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry that he is doing all he can in this context to deal with this external threat to our industry .
The trade-barrier regulation route is perhaps an incomplete or insufficient instrument for taking action : there has to be more bilateral pressure from the European Union on Korea to press it to come up with solutions , such as pricing its ships properly and fully .
In the third report there is a list of actions proposed by the Commission but its observations are rather disappointing : to continue with monitoring , to examine industry 's complaint , to remain open to eventual proposals , to pursue efforts , to continue to encourage , to continue to work closely with the industry or to examine the possibilities of measures .
I submit that we need more than just examining possibilities and monitoring the industry situation around the world and in Europe .
In that context , it is important that the Commission reconsiders the view about extending the time period for temporary support or for permitting temporary support for shipbuilding industries in the European Union until a solution is forthcoming in talks with Korea .
Mr President , Commissioner , first may I also associate myself strongly with the remarks made by my colleague , Mr Galeote , with regard to terrorism .
I too have had some experience of that in another place .
The first point I would like to make is that the repairs to the cooling system of this submarine are already under way .
It is already happening , so let us be realistic about what options face the UK and Gibraltar authorities in dealing with it .
Let us please be realistic about the notion of lifting this submarine , waiting for weather conditions to be favourable and somehow transporting it back to the UK.
It needs to be repaired in situ .
You have just heard the Commissioner say that defence issues in general , and in particular nuclear defence issues , are a matter for national sovereignty , not for this Parliament , but that the concerns of the public in Gibraltar and the adjoining areas are a natural and legitimate cause for debate in this Parliament .
One might well ask whether the government of the United Kingdom has exercised its responsibility in that regard to keep its defence equipment properly maintained , and indeed whether people in the UK are aware that , because of this incident , and the withdrawal of other nuclear submarines , our shores are currently being defended - rumour has it - by a U-boat from Germany .
I think it is very important to keep this matter in proportion and to avoid crying wolf with alarmist statements which are not supported by the facts .
This is a technical problem with a technical solution and the sooner the repair is completed , the better it will be for all .
Mr President , I would like to join with the condolences which have been expressed already this afternoon .
Hay unas palabras españolas muy bien conocidas en mi país que son las palabras "¡No pasarán ! " .
Y el mensaje que debemos mandar de esta Cámara es simplemente a los terroristas que no pasarán nunca jamás . [ This Spanish phrase is very well known in my country "¡No pasarán ! "
( There is no way through ! ) .
The message that this House must send the terrorists is simply that there is no way through . ]
If I could pass on to this issue , which is also a very sensitive one , I was interested in Mr Patten 's response because , as I see it , the Euratom Treaty deals purely with civilian matters , not military matters , and this is a military matter .
There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty which is the transport of contaminated waste between Member States of the European Union ; but , of course , Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and any contaminated waste will go from one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom , without passing through any other Member State in the European Union .
Therefore , the Euratom Treaty does not apply .
Before us we have a green , gooey , compromise resolution and rarely in my time in the European Parliament have I seen a resolution which is more wrong , more deliberately inaccurate and more designed to scaremonger than this particular resolution we have before us .
Let us deal with the details .
The reactor is shut down .
The submarine is entirely safe .
It is a fault to the coolant circuit only .
There was no over-heating .
There was no danger and there was no contamination ; and no , the submarine was not refused permission to enter Naples because it never asked for permission to enter Naples .
What is the alternative ?
Do we see a nuclear-powered submarine being towed through the Atlantic in the middle of winter in order to return to the United Kingdom ?
I can think of no more dangerous scenario , as we have seen in relation to submarines in the former Soviet Union .
The only time we can do this is June or July , and yet the British Government said clearly that this submarine will be repaired by the end of March .
So it would be better to repair it than to try and tow it through the Atlantic .
And no , the classification of the port was not changed by some sleight of hand .
