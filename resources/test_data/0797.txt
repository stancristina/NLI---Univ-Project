policy .
There is a lack of debate about profile and portfolios and this diversity of backgrounds , and a lack of choice .
I would also like to stress this in the light of what you said today about Lithuania , a Member State that wants to join the eurozone and in respect of which comments can indeed be made if one considers the figures .
That is another important point we have raised several times , and we would like to support the Commissioner in his attempts to make improvements in that area too .
I think it very important for the sake of the Commission that we should , in future , hold firm to the idea that Member States make those statements one way or another .
That is very dangerous and something we must avoid .
Parliament should be fully involved in this .
For example , we seem to be moving towards a European tax in the form of a tax on energy and transport .
Moreover , the many programmes would be at risk of grinding to a halt .
By the same token , not enough funds are being set aside for trans-European networks , programmes such as Erasmus ( a mere 140 000 students will be placed from now on , compared to 170 000 in 2006 ) and Leonardo ( 36 000 placements compared to 50 000 ) , the seventh Research and Development Policy programme , the social agenda , the structural funds , Life + and Natura , cultural activities , external policy and our dealings with our neighbours .
In the compromise , steps are being taken to relax the ban on feeding non-ruminants animal meal , provided that animals are not fed animal meal originating from their own species .
We all know that the rapporteur dreams of a single human rights report reflecting the viewpoints of the Council , the Commission and Parliament , and that dream can , and will , become reality one day , provided that , in the short term , the Council takes Parliament’s advice seriously and in the longer term , places economic and commercial considerations second to the principle that human rights are universal and indivisible .
As Mr Szymański has already said , agreement on the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument at first reading is now within reach .
The way in which the Commission wanted to achieve this , however , would mean that , while Parliament now – thanks to 16 regulations – has codecision powers , it would soon only have an advisory role in the area of development cooperation .
We want the right of codecision on the broad outlines of policy .
As for agriculture and horticulture , it is all hands on deck , for the Council’s easy way-out , allowing countries to transfer , on a voluntary basis , 20 % of the premiums to rural development , could well prove to be a stab in the back for hard-working farmers and horticulturalists .
To my regret , I am unable to go along with the Berend and Galeote reports , although I would emphasise that this is not out of any opposition to mutual solidarity between Member States when disasters strike .
There is certainly no doubt that we , here in this Chamber , at the heart of European democracy , should support by all means available the developments towards democracy in Nepal .
I agree with all those speakers who have said that it is no solution at all to have recourse to force of arms in order to win a particular dispute .
We should instead carry on talking .
Why is this so ?
This is something I refuse to accept .
The Union is said to have been too hasty in welcoming the former Soviet satellite states into its fold .
What I wish to make clear at the outset of my speech is that the future of the Union must not be thought of in terms of ‘either …or’ : either ‘enlargement ’ or ‘deepening’ ; either Turkey or the Constitution .
The citizens have been experiencing a crisis in Europe for longer than that : division over Iraq , non-compliance with the stability pact , and the debate on financial perspectives which we resolved in the end .
No single Member State , not even the large ones , can harbour any illusions about going it alone on the world stage .
We cannot deny that the blow that both referendums caused was so great , that it is unclear even now whether the Constitution can still survive .
A few new ideas have surfaced in the past few weeks , it is true , but I would join you in doubting whether they will amount to much .
Habits set in .
In my view , two main answers or explanations can be given .
While I cannot deny that funds are sometimes misspent , and that is also the for the Court of Auditors’ , the truth is that the budget of the European Union is 20 times smaller than that of the United States , and 40 times smaller than that of all other ( national , regional and local ) governments combined .
A powerful European response is not forthcoming .
A 'board ' led by a number of Member States , or a strengthened European democracy based on an active European Commission and a fully-fledged European Parliament , which make up the essence of European democracy .
The European Union’s trade deficit – we always talk in terms of surpluses , but let us also look at the deficits – with Asia rose to EUR 100 billion , and is expected to rise even further over the next few years .
That is precisely what others do too in their reports : I am thinking of the World Competitiveness Centre ( IMD) and the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) .
