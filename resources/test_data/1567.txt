amendment of Article 6 is intended to ensure that the Commission will submit proposals for safe maximum amounts within two years .
We have also built in safeguard clauses for SMEs ; how embarrassing that we had to do that , that there are laws that need that to be done to them , for it shows up all the pious speeches for the lies they are .
Harmonised rules make for legal certainty and that is to the benefit of the businesses as much as of anyone else .
What we are now embarking on is the suppression of competition and of the market economy , and I do not think that will do our society any good .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , congratulations to Mrs Scheele on her report , which , with the amendments added , amounts to a fine dossier , and many thanks to Mrs Poli Bortone , who has certainly put a lot of work into a report that is complex and comprehensive without , alas , being in line with my way of thinking .
They want greater effectiveness in legislation and administration .
After the initial two and a half hour long debate , each minister could speak for three minutes .
Perhaps he applied for a job as the grave-digger for the European Constitution ; he certainly has every chance of getting it .
Without a Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
They did not mention terrorism .
Today we adopted our proposal for a citizens ' agenda ; the communication proposes 11 initiatives relating primarily to the internal market .
I am referring in particular to the problem of unemployment .
I would like to urge the national governments to at long last get back to telling the truth and giving the people comprehensive information , and the Commission not to dispense them from this obligation and not to be over-cautious in this regard .
What is worse than a ‘no’ vote is a ‘no’ vote that politicians do not take seriously .
All your posturing about the completion of the internal market will not help to defuse the prejudice against the new treaty , which is prompting people to spread rumours about this being a superstate , a neoliberal concept , about the unbridled centralisation and militarisation of the EU , and this ‘plan D’ is doing nothing to lay these prejudices to rest .
Finally , there is something technical to be considered : because we wanted to wrap this up at first reading , we had to ensure that the two documents – from the Council and from Parliament – were technically compatible .
The fact is that Marco Polo , as a programme , had the potential to – and indeed does – play a core role in addressing the problems to which transport gives rise , and would not only actively help improve modal shift , but also boost intermodal transport , for , this time , the focus is on inland waterways and on short-distance sea transport – which I will not call ‘motorways of the sea’ , since that always strikes me as a rather peculiar term – and we have had to accept that certain switches from one mode of transport to another are made impossible by the absence of key points and interconnection points between them .
Fourthly , we hope that the Council will adopt this regulation together with the proposal for the establishment of a one-stop shop for businesses , which will make it possible for European businesses to have less bureaucracy to deal with .     – Mr President , while I , in principle , welcome the compromise on which we have voted today , it must not be forgotten that primary responsibility for addressing the problem of obesity , especially among children , rests with the state .
Taken as a whole , the regulation also treats consumers as if they were helpless and concedes them no capacity to take decisions for themselves .
You , Mr President , will have our support if you press this point home as clearly as possible to the Council , to its General Secretariat , and also to the presidency .
Today , we discussed with Commissioner Wallström – who spoke on behalf of the whole Commission and indeed of its President – the most important matter for concern , second only to the improvement of the European Union’s political and psychological environment , which is that we should not allow there to be any doubt about the fact that the majority in the European Parliament wants the constitutional treaty to become a reality , and it wants that because we need the constitution if the European Union is to have ground rules for decisions and common values to bind us together .
You are thereby taking upon yourself a great responsibility , and I want , today , to again impress upon you what that responsibility is .
It is in the interests not only of the European Union , but also of the peoples of both candidate countries , that their accessions should not be overhasty , for , if they are , so that conditions in them are painted in the best possible light , then there is plenty of evidence from the past that it is the people in the accession countries who will end up footing the bill .
It is the Commission that is acting responsibly here .
No, that will not do .
Here , the liberals are supporting the liberal prime minister in Romania , the socialists the socialist prime minister in Bulgaria .
The crucial thing for me , however , is how these countries will enter the European Union in 2007 , whether they will somehow muddle through or slip in , or whether they will come in with their heads held high and we will be able to agree with a clear conscience .
