We only need think back to the much-feted 'green revolution ' of a few decades ago .
The European Investment Bank is already responsible for more than 5 % of all investments made in the Union , which has enabled more than 400 000 jobs to be created , specifically through the support that the bank gives to small and medium-sized enterprises .
This aim can only be achieved , however , through support for structural investments and is , consequently , unfettered by restrictions that could endanger these investments .
On behalf of Portugal 's socialist delegation , I wish to thank the House , in particular the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , for the support they have given her , which has given a serious intellectual boost to her recovery .
.
We are counting on the national authorities to provide this support and , confident that they will do so , we have given our vote to Mr Nistic√≥ 's report .
Despite the Commission 's view that its proposal is quite flexible , the fact is that the attempt to include in this report the regulation of various basic conditions of temporary work , in my opinion , falls outside Community competence and has no precedent in European legislation , thereby breaching the principle of subsidiarity .
Furthermore , equating the factors of the legal relationship of temporary work with permanent work will ultimately lead to this soon no longer being a viable possibility for companies and therefore , one less window of opportunity for many workers .
( PT ) Like all compromise texts , this motion for a resolution combines very positive recitals and conclusions , such as the references to the agreement on Kaliningrad , for example , with a dubious and rather weak speech rejecting the terrorist acts that have recently taken place in Russia and , particularly , the recent attack on the Moscow theatre by Chechen extremists .
The facts are those we saw in the social communication : the disturbing and unprecedented degree of instability in the world financial markets and the repercussions of this on the so-called 'real economy ' , with the surge in financial crises which become economic crises as a result of the 'financialisation ' of the economy , to which the gradual integration of pension schemes for private profit and the increasing volume of pension funds have largely contributed .
.
I also particularly welcome the rapporteur 's proposal to attach absolute priority to policies involving horizontal aid to help industry adjust to the Kyoto commitments .
Nevertheless , I share the opinion that the data included in this scoreboard are still not sufficient or adequate to enable a comparison to be made between the behaviour of the various Member States and the real benefits arising from State aid .
In the specific context that led to the drafting of this report , I welcome the clear reduction in State aid granted and its redirection towards horizontal objectives , such as SMEs , the environment , R&D , employment and training , which fall beyond the strict remit of economic efficiency , but promote the better preparation of economic actors and Member States for the internal market .
Although it is regrettable that no result was achieved , it should nevertheless be highlighted that we managed to improve the definition of the Clean Development Mechanism and of emissions monitoring procedures .
Secondly , the second phase of the Protocol must be set even more ambitious targets than the first phase , which represents only a tiny step forwards .
The names 'Urquiola' , ' Aegean Sea ' and ' Casou ' are , together with that of the Prestige , part of our consciousness and of our collective misfortunes .
Let us not be under any illusion : this disaster has consequences identical to those of a natural disaster , but it is really a political disaster and we know who the guilty parties are .
It was also bound to happen because of the appalling conditions in which many ships still sail , carrying dangerous and highly polluting cargoes , whilst we are hesitant and slow at European and world level about adopting rigorous and mandatory measures for prevention and guidance , confiscation and destruction .
Above all , however , we must go along with the positions of Commissioner de Palacio .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to begin , of course , by expressing my solidarity with the communities that have been affected .
Secondly , we must determine the responsibility of those who managed the crisis , in particular , we must clarify the reason why the EU as a whole was not involved in managing the risk from the very outset , given that it was known that the consequences of the accident would easily move beyond the confines of one country and would affect the entire natural heritage of Europe .
Expressing moral solidarity and demonstrating sympathy are not enough ; we must act as rapidly as possible and , as I said , adopt emergency measures .
My second observation is that we must understand that this disaster could also seriously affect the northern coast of Portugal , if not now , then later , and the European Union also needs to consider aid for Portugal to improve its resources for mobilisation , monitoring and prevention .
What is needed , perhaps , is to think about another , more fundamental type of measure to provide alternative employment for these fishermen , for example , fishing in other waters in the medium term .
Lastly , I would also reaffirm the need for a rigorous Community inquiry into the entire event , both so that we can be sure that everyone concerned acted as they should and to ensure that we have the best technical and political
