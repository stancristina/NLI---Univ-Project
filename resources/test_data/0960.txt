The mandate given at Cologne was , as has been said , a limited mandate .
The rights of the individual will never again be discussed in the same light , because now the prime right , the founding right , is the right to dignity .
Lastly , a word on incorporating the Charter .
This is now quite evident with the slump in the euro .
I believe that we must look beyond the frustrations inherent in any consensus in order to praise this Charter , rather than dwelling on what we would have liked to have seen and still envisage .
While growth continues apace , inequalities have become increasingly intolerable .
In other words , the French Presidency 's task is no easy one .
Mr President , we have just had a debate that was both interesting and productive .
A second observation .
You suggest that the Charter could provide the springboard for a future constitution , and why not .
Mr Lannoye welcomed the view that I expressed with regard to a European constitution .
She has said that the text of the Charter should not be altered one jot and that the Convention should have the final say on it .
I would add that we want to work in the complete transparency you desire , and to carry on with the regular exchanges that we have held with you since July .
This is to say that it is a major instrument in managing economic , budgetary and fiscal policy .
While it all seems purely to do with technical matters , there are nonetheless considerable political implications .
Piecyk recommendation for second reading ( A5-0232/2000 )
In two other countries ( Sweden and Finland ) , it is 14.5 metres and in five other countries ( with restricted use only in Luxembourg , the Netherlands and Austria , and unrestricted use in Belgium and Germany ) it is 15 metres .
.
Mr President , I , too , welcome this Charter , particularly the improvements made towards the end in adding " social " and " the rights to the elderly " to the Charter .
The content of this document , they say , represents a fundamental step forward for the protection of citizens ' rights in Europe , to the extent that the matter should be referred to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Nice Council should decide to enshrine it in the Treaties .
There is no doubt but that the body entrusted with drafting the Charter was made up in an original manner , but , from a legal standpoint it did not represent anything more than a Council working group .
To avoid such a pass , which would disappoint the legitimate expectations of the citizens of Europe , we had to look to an alternative solution .
On subjects as basic as women ' s rights , immigrants ' rights , the right to education , the right to accommodation , the right to employment or a decent wage , this Charter is often inadequate and occasionally retrogressive .
Firstly , because the enlargement of the European Union , as Mr Brok has just said , is not just another priority , not that I need to remind the Members of this House .
With these six countries , all the chapters of the acquis communautaire bar one , the chapter on the institutions , have been opened , though some have been closed temporarily , between 12 and 16 depending on the country , and others are still being negotiated , between 13 and 18 depending on the country .
As far as we are concerned , however , imparting a new dynamic to these negotiations means , particularly with regard to the issue of transitional periods , we shall do all we possibly can in order to make progress pragmatically .
This is , of course , a perfectly legitimate question , but it is one that must be answered quite properly and precisely .
Once again , on this point too , in agreement with the Commission , the French Presidency will strive to achieve results in two areas : firstly in the adoption of an accession partnership , which is necessary both for Turkey and for the European Union , and then the implementation of the financial regulation which will enable the European Union to honour the commitments it has made to this country , and that we would like to see adopted by the end of the year .
Last year the rural population increased by 5 % in relation to the previous year , and if we wish to bring it in line with our model , then we are simply going to well and truly kill off what is still one of the best assets this country has , not to mention the social problems we shall be inflicting on a very large part of the population .
Enlargement , as I have just said , is a historic process , a duty .
It is very important , and therefore I am pleased that the Commission is working on an information campaign which Commissioner Verheugen wishes to make both extensive and decentralised .
I need not stress , in this House , the strength of this proposal , or also the fact that it is perhaps a little risky too , with the danger of encountering certain problems here and there .
I am convinced that Cyprus ' accession could serve as a catalyst and a driving force in finding a solution to the political problem of the division of the island .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , we wish to make our contribution to this debate .
One final point , Mr President , regarding
