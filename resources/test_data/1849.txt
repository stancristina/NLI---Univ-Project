It must also underpin its function of proposing legislation , for instance by devising an internal procedure which will ensure that the subsidiarity principle is respected and by keeping a chronological record of procedures in order to reduce excessive delays in the preparation of documents .
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs calls for an overall study into the problem of the Union 's external representation both in dealing with third countries in international negotiations and in international bodies , and to consider the establishment of a common diplomatic service .
At that price , I believe , we can achieve complementarity .
In any case , that is in line with the declaration on regional policy of 10 November , an important Council and Commission policy .
I would therefore like to highlight the points which , I feel , cannot be ignored if , following the adoption of these regulations and this directive , the expected progress is to be achieved .
I will support this report and the Commission ' s amendments , but I call on the Members of Parliament to also support the amendments of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on social standards .
This powerful political signal is in our hands .
My group supports the Watts and Larrea reports .
This demands a strong political will and the financial resources to put in place even more controls .
It would be better if , faced with a proactive United States , our Parliament did not give the impression that , by systematically going for the lowest possible bid , it was soft on the issue .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , just now I heard you acknowledge that our Parliament was an effective institution .
In the interim , Minister , let us intensify technological research into marine depollution .
We have the political and economic resources to impose our choices and to ensure that they are respected .
We are taking any number of risks , including that of conciliation .
I believe that our reports contain a weakness , in that they do not sufficiently discuss the seafarers and the men on board ship .
This specifically demonstrates that , this time , we will not fall once again into the ruts of the past .
If we work from now until the Council of Ministers on 20 and 21 December , we will succeed in establishing common positions , obtained by qualified majority voting .
It is important that everybody knows what happened , as the human question , which was brought up by a number of you , is also very important .
Not only has our Parliament accelerated the legislative procedure , which was to be expected , but it has also succeeded in staying at the forefront in matters of safety by putting across principles it has recognised for a long time .
The limitations of these proposals are therefore clear .
( FR ) To unravel the chain of responsibility , to respect shipboard social standards , to re-establish the 'polluter-pays ' principle and to innovate in the field of equipment must be our top priorities .
It took a second maritime disaster , the wreck of the Ievoli Sun , to accelerate the first reading of these texts .
It is against this background that European legislation is vital .
First of all , recognition of classification societies is devolved to Member States without any prior control or harmonisation at European level .
The arraignment of the classification societies in the wake of the loss of the Erika in December 1999 recalls their vital role in evaluating and preventing the risks associated with the condition of ships .
As far as the current Nice agenda is concerned , we believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should remain a simple declaration , that the Commission should be composed of one Commissioner for each Member State , that the weighting of votes in the Council should respect the parity of the large States , that majority voting should not be extended to the most important issues , such as immigration , international negotiations on services , taxation and social security and , finally , that specific acts of cooperation should be accepted very liberally , including outside the single institutional framework .
The importance of the Social Agenda must also be highlighted so that it can be implemented speedily .
( FR ) I had no hesitation in voting against the joint resolution on the Nice European Council .
The Convention which was given the task of drawing it up foreshadows this : the sanctioning of the dominant role of influential groups and activist agencies in the construction of a federal Europe in the pipeline .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we deplored the Brok report and the report by Mrs Lalumi√®re , not only because of what they contain but also because of their subject matter , the common foreign and security policy .
.
We protest against this imperialist military policy all the more given that a declared consensus on the issue holds sway in this Chamber , with acceptance of and open support for this policy on the part of the vast majority of groups , from the extreme right to the Greens and the Socialists .
As a result , although we are not voting against this report on account of the few basic rights which it does express , we will not be voting in favour of it either .
This must come about , as the report says ' by means of a significant improvement in performance and efficiency ' , but also by means of more transparent practices .
These discriminatory practices are unacceptable .
The fact is that Community policies are reflected in moral and financial commitments to our citizens and third-country nationals
