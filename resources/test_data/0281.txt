uniform electoral system , by means of Article 12 of the 1976 Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by Direct Universal Suffrage , of which paragraph 2 , which I will read in French , since that is the text I possess , says : " Lorsque la vacance résulte de l'application des dispositions nationales en vigueur dans un État membre , celui-ci en informe le Parlement européen qui en prend acte " . [ " Where a seat falls vacant pursuant to national provisions in force in a Member State , the latter shall inform the European Parliament , which shall take note of the fact " . ] We are therefore talking about a formal and fully regulated competence .
I believe that , as well as analysing the situation , the most important thing is to look to the future .
It is true that these include projects in Objective 1 areas and cohesion countries , which has allowed the percentage of cofinancing to be greater .
I will concentrate for a moment on one of the most talked-about projects : the Brenner base-level tunnel .
I want to make this very clear .
These partnerships will be promoted in various ways .
Therefore , the remote regions , the extremely remote regions and the least developed regions must be at the heart of Community action .
Mr President , lastly , I would like to refer to the question of the intelligent management of traffic .
Turning in particular to air traffic control , the development of a common system of air safety is a fine challenge for the future .
The regulation of slot allocation must be reviewed according to specific environmental criteria , taking account of noise and emissions into the atmosphere , and specific actions should be taken in order to strengthen intermodality with other trans-European networks , especially with railways , in light of the conclusions of the report on aviation and the global environment , which considers that more than 10 % of European short-haul air traffic could change from air to rail .
Ladies and gentlemen , some of you have spoken of a common transatlantic air space , and I would like to tell you that this is a very important issue .
It is true that one trait of European liberalisation , when compared to US liberalisation , is that the granting of state aid has been authorised to support the restructuring of certain airlines .
In this regard , therefore , the situation remains as it was before that bilateral agreement between these two countries of the Union .
We must therefore try to ensure that aircraft are modernised .
Mr President , the policy on Commission appointments is , without doubt , a key element within the framework of the reform to which President Prodi is committed .
At the moment , according to the data available to us , which I am grateful for because the transparency process is a very good thing , most A1 or A2 senior officials are of the same nationality as the Commissioner , way above the German senior officials , for example .
I must tell my friends that behind every great woman there is a great man , because everybody knows that my wife is worth much more than I am .
In other areas , the directive is supported by the existing instruments intended to facilitate harmonisation and the mutual recognition of national legislations .
The common position , therefore , maintains the balance between the various general objectives and the various interests , and we have not therefore tabled any amendments .
They are currently not doing so because of the legal uncertainty involved in dealing with many different sets of legislation within Europe .
It therefore seems essential to make a genuine effort to homogenise the rules of the internal market and , at the same time , work energetically to unify the principles applied on a global level with regard to electronic commerce .
Therefore , the Commission will support these amendments in the Council and I hope they can be taken forward .
The creation of specific ad hoc committees would achieve less and would not be as effective as the current model .
By means of both reports , the Commission will have access to all the necessary budgetary information .
Perhaps I do not need to point this out .
We must remember that this debate will focus more on the contents of harmonisation than on harmonisation itself , since this harmonisation is the starting point that all parties have accepted .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group , for example , has tabled amendments which may affect the internal market .
Specifically , I think that Amendment No 6 , tabled by Mrs Thomas-Mauro , which requests that border controls be established at internal borders , is extremely dangerous .
Madam President , firstly I would like to say that , out of self-respect , we should not create false arguments amongst ourselves .
I believe that if Mr Cohn-Bendit , for example , wishes for a full debate on this question , he should support our proposal so that we can include it in the next agenda .
Since its review is not finished , and until the problem of the nut industry is resolved , an extension of these improvement plans should be reconsidered , until its correct place is found , which should be the COM in fruits , where it will be treated in a genuinely differentiated fashion .
Will it be extended ?
Mr President , we agree with the objectives pursued in the Commission ' s proposal on the new regulation on flax and hemp : to regulate and balance the markets , simplify the common agricultural policy and prevent fraud .
