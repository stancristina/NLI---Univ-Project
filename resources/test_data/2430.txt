reveals all the limitations of the Security Council in its current form and therefore the need for Europe , as a whole , to seek to change the current UN system .
That is why the avalanches which have struck various areas of this extremely important part of Europe should serve to draw our attention to these issues , which go far beyond the natural disaster , and stir us into planning for a range of measures - not only short-term and preventive measures , but ones that are designed to tackle this problem and this situation in a comprehensive way .
According to the final declaration , that future is to be based on more extensive political dialogue and the development of economic cooperation .
Adam report ( A4-0088/99 ) Mr President , the Commission congratulates the rapporteur , Mr Schwaiger , for the excellent report which Parliament is to vote on today , and thanks him for the support he has given to the Commission 's proposal .
A common currency , the convertible marka , has been adopted , a common state budget has been passed , and budgetary spending by both entities has been strictly kept within the constraints of the revenue available .
The Commission supports Amendments Nos 1 , 4 and 5 .
The Commission notes Parliament 's desire to be informed of the conditions laid down for granting this assistance in good time , and it will therefore forward a report on this as soon as possible , as is provided for in any case in the proposal .
Mr President , as I have already said , the Commission supports Amendments Nos 1 , 4 and 5 , and I have also stressed that the Commission shares the concerns voiced in many of the amendments which it has rejected but the spirit of which it will bear in mind .
Parliament approved the request for referral back to committee
We reiterate our protest about this .
Madam President , I should like to begin by taking up something said by Mr Martens , whom I normally hold in high esteem but whose reconstruction of this crisis I find unconvincing .
It is therefore very important , now that the Parliament and Commission have acted , that the Council should do likewise .
Finally , the presidency must have various tasks : not only to administer the complex structure of the EU Commission , but also to reform it from within .
Our conduct here smacks of submission to the requirements of the national governments .
It must be tackled head on , prior to enlargement , and must open the door to economic governance in the Europe of the euro .
This lesson in moral case-law could also usefully be learned by the various countries ' national political leaders , if the public is to feel at ease with politics and its institutions .
In the action plan for the single market presented at the Amsterdam European Council almost two years ago , the Commission pointed to the need to work towards a common system of taxation in the area of VAT , which would eventually replace the current transitional system , while at the same time modernising and simplifying it .
The committee has put forward an amendment on this point , stressing that in one sense this is the final extension , and at the same time calling for the definitive system to enter into force on 1 January next year .
Yes , the UN is the principal international forum in which to explore and shape the necessary responses .
Much will depend , however , on the EU Member States adopting a coherent approach at the UN over the next few years .
It is , as Mr De Melo quite rightly says in his report , that the reform carried out must be in keeping with the major changes which have occurred in modern times .
Mr President , in discussing the De Melo report , we need to distinguish between two issues : one is reform of the United Nations , which could be a matter of adapting its ageing structures to changed requirements and to geopolitical transformations on the various continents ; the other is Europe 's continuing inability to speak with one voice and act with the necessary diplomatic force .
From this point of view I wish to compliment the Commissioner , Mr Liikanen , on both his presence and his work .
I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the resignation of the Commission since I agreed with it in its entirety , especially paragraph 8 calling for an ambitious and thoroughgoing programme of radical reform , which obviously presupposes an authoritative Commission , beginning with its President .
The other merit of this new and innovative part of the Treaty is that it is fundamentally , explicitly and clearly based on protection , promotion and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
Only recently , Parliament 's role - a key role in the democratic process but also a factor of efficiency - was still being ignored .
I would say in conclusion that this report represents a call for guarantees and effectiveness .
In our opinion , the wording of this amendment is somewhat complicated : it covers various bodies , such as NGOs , which should have been handled separately .
Flooding world markets with low added-value commodities is the wrong approach , since it will be increasingly difficult to compete on such commodities with countries whose costs are lower than our own ; furthermore , as we are aware , the WTO has placed both volume and value-based ceilings on export refunds ; and lastly , we know that the new Millennium Round talks are to begin soon and should not have too many illusions .
