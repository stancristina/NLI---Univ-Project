Community carriers to make available an information leaflet , as given in the Annex that is proposed .
We cannot accept Amendment No 11 either , since the article cannot be deleted if the text still refers to specific articles of the Montreal Convention , in line , therefore , with the previous rejection .
This gave the Commission an excellent opportunity to put forward this proposal , which will replace the old regulation just in time .
We would like there to be a reasonable degree of identification between Parliament and the Commission .
There may be some conflict of opposing interests between the different transport modes - that is to be expected - but the strikingly obvious consequence of all this is that coordination between the various transport modes is still essential .
It is a fact that there are highly competent consultants who have argued , for instance , that external costs , including traffic congestion , are shooting up to account for 10 % of the gross domestic product of Europe , a figure which may be debatable but which is astounding all the same .
The Commission proposal , therefore , establishes common criteria for the granting of exemptions which apply equally to all types of inland transport .
We cannot share the approaches proposed , although we agree with the concern and need to boost the railways .
Aid for passenger services , however , under Article 73 , is regulated in the Commission regulation on public services , which proposes a complete and appropriate framework on the manner in which the public authorities can support the provision of internal passenger transport services .
In view of all these arguments , the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 16 , 18 ( second part ) , 19 , 20 , 24 , 27 , 33 , 36 , 40 , 44 , 45 and 51 .
Therefore , every possible precaution must be taken to prevent dysfunctions in specifying the types of project that the ports can have access to as a result of this classification , which I regard as provisional until up-to-date data are available , not forgetting , of course , other possible requirements such as connection to trans-European network land routes or the installation of a number of facilities .
These have been three years of effort to adopt this proposal for the inclusion of nodes in the trans-European networks .
The Transport Council will decide on this matter tomorrow and I hope it will be finally closed in a satisfactory manner .
Commissioner , we think that , although recently timid proposals have been made regarding the possibility of developing vegetable proteins , the Commission tends to insist that this is problematic on the basis of two arguments : the cost and agreements with the United States .
We have experience of the cheapest thing not being the best thing .
We always said that we would prefer no agreement to a bad agreement ; and this is what Morocco is proposing , despite the generous , reasonable offers from the European Union , which are beneficial to both parties .
This is quite legitimate , but can the European Union not guarantee better than anyone that its resources will be rationally preserved and fished responsibly ?
The Nice European Council , incidentally at the request of the Spanish Government and José María Aznar , agreed - another unprecedented thing - to support the demands and , if they failed , the negotiations and , if these did not succeed either , asked the Commission for a specific action programme , as set out in No 59 of the Nice conclusions .
It has the support of Parliament , which will actively defend the sector .
You reminded me of the responsibility of ministers , whom you said were informed at all times and had taken part in the most recent rounds of negotiations .
In your speech you talked again about another mandate .
Morocco needs access to the Community market , and the Community fisheries sector needs access to fishing grounds that it has traditionally worked in .
Soon the association agreement will have to be revised and Morocco will surely once again make demands for trade concessions that will even affect the same Community regions that are currently being seriously affected by the lack of a fisheries agreement .
As a result , it is logical that the action should be funded from the Community budget .
This is the aim of Amendment No 1 of the draft report .
Mr President , once again what most stands out to me about the Commission proposal is the imbalance between the importance that it says it attaches to certain issues and the means that it then puts in place in order to resolve them .
If we believed solely in the declarations of intent , it would seem that the Commission really does see the fisheries control policy as a top priority .
This of course includes control measures , in which the European Union is putting the credibility of its supposed commitment to sustainability of resources on the line in the eyes of the world .
Foot-and-mouth disease (RC B5-0303/2001 )
We need to use this argument in the transatlantic relations that we have with the United States .
Therefore , Mr President , I think that this resolution is necessary and that we should send it to all the bodies mentioned at the end of it .
But let us see if we can end the great hypocrisy that prevails in international politics , because the same people who go to see Mr Putin , or who sing songs to the Chinese after they have invaded Tibet , cannot throw up their hands in horror .
