Thus , within the framework of the principle that everything can be bought and sold , a market with the right to pollute has been established .
The report does not put forward the tiniest objection to the above measures , which is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it .     . – The ΕU never misses an opportunity to brag about its principles and values and to give everyone else lessons in good manners .
This is not just a legal issue , it is a deeply political issue .
We therefore need to give him credit and to note , of course , that Commissioner Fischler , who is present here , and Commissioner Diamantopoulou helped him in this .
This policy has European added value , it has visible results in the regions , especially in the regions which have problems , in the poorest regions , and it must continue .
These areas also need to be integrated into Objective 1 and to receive substantial financial coverage and , furthermore , we consider that the areas which fall victim to statistics – and here we disagree with the European Commission – should be integrated from the point of view of state aid into the provisions of Article 87 , paragraph 3a of the Treaty .
We consider that there should be special policies not only within the framework of regional policy , of cohesion policy , but also more generally in the other sectoral policies of the European Union .
Economic and social cohesion requires new ideas , inventiveness and innovative methods , not just funding .     – Mr President , especially as the former mayor of a regional island town , I too wish , from this position , to thank the outgoing Commissioner , Mr Barnier , for his efforts to serve the idea of economic and social cohesion in the Europe of the regions .
My question , Commissioner , is not difficult , but I understand the difficulty which you have in giving a specific reply .
The Forum 's report is expected to contain three main sections .
A confirmation of the principles agreed at international and European level , an analysis of the factors which hamper and the factors which contribute to the success of corporate social responsibility and a series of recommendations on corporate social responsibility for the attention of the members of the Forum or the institutions of the European Union and other agencies .
The European Parliament has been involved in the Multistakeholder Forum procedure since the outset , with the MEP Richard Howitt acting as observer .
First of all , with the Forum , the Commission wagered on the willingness and ability of the various sides to cooperate in a constructive manner and to develop a joint approach to European corporate social responsibility and , of course , the Commission will endeavour to make the maximum possible use of the results of the Forum 's discussions and report .
The Commission is therefore waiting for the specific results and , moreover , for a roadmap to be drawn up with the action which needs to be taken not only by the European Commission , but also by the members of the Forum themselves , either alone or jointly with others .
In the reply which I sent a short while ago , I express our acute concern and repeat the basic principles which we consider are of fundamental importance in managing restructuring .
We have various directives which seek to guarantee that the workers are fully involved in the decision-making procedure in the event of restructuring .
Furthermore , in 2002 , the Commission requested the opinion of the social partners on a text entitled ‘Anticipating and managing change – a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring ’ .
The social partners ' text is based on experience gleaned from certain case studies on modern restructuring conditions relating to issues of vial importance to successful change management .
Finally , we must not forget our important work on corporate social responsibility and the European Observatory for Industrial Change .
Nonetheless , the Commission does hope that it will be possible to find an acceptable solution in order to moderate the significant impact on the regions affected by this restructuring .
I must also say that this specific company , Bombardier , has 35 factories in Europe , a large number of which are , of course , closing .
I therefore request an answer so that this saga can stop in which , more importantly , the European Union appears to assent to this sort of … .     – Mr Nielson , a public debate was held in Greece a very short time ago about possibly inviting Fidel Castro to Greece within the framework of the Olympic Games .
According to the Commission proposal , the main tasks of the Centre are the collection , analysis and dissemination of transnational data on drug-related problems .
As far as the nomination of the director is concerned , the procedure should be the same as for other Community agencies , in other words a candidate should be proposed .
The selection procedure should be transparent and should attract the interest of all potential candidates .
Thank you for giving me the floor .
I should like to protest because I had requested the floor on a very serious issue .
The majority of political forces in both Greece and Cyprus consider that the Annan plan may help to resolve the Cyprus problem , especially with the prospect of the integration of a united Cyprus into the European Union .
There is a problem there , a huge problem from the past , as to whether this plan can really be applied absolutely in time , fully and reliably to all the
