The reality , however , is that the EU 's administration is such that responsibility is an entirely undefined concept .
There always seems to be a mentality that this is not our own money and that the people concerned are not held accountable in the same way as national civil servants and politicians are held accountable for the budgets in the national states .
The EU advertises itself in terms of greater democracy , greater transparency and an EU for the citizens , but the truth is that the EU is the opposite : the more EU , the less democracy , the less transparency , the less responsibility - but the citizens are too far away to find that out .
Parliament is doing the EU a disservice by , year after year , turning a blind eye to the fact that the reforms requested by the group of wise men in 1999 have still not been implemented .
The Commission can therefore take the criticism easily .
We are , however , sending the wrong signal by adopting all the accounts .
It is on this basis that some of us wish to vote against the reports concerning the Commission , the development funds and the agencies , but we will vote for the reports that recommend postponement of discharge .
When Jean-Paul Mingasson can be praised as fulsomely as he has been , praise could also be given to the employee who really deserved it .
We apologise on behalf of the Commission for the poor treatment that you have received ' .

We have voted today for an exchange of experience at intergovernmental level .
In casting our vote , we have voted to retain the basis of the Belgian initiative concerning funding via the Member States ' voluntary contributions and concerning coordination , and have thus voted against the amendment of the report that seeks to establish a secretariat controlled by the Commission and funded via the EU 's general budget .
.
The real problem , however , is the Schengen cooperation 's closure of the external borders .
In establishing Fortress Europe , we are bringing a new Iron Curtain down through Europe .
- ( DA ) Mr President , allow me to start by regretting that the Council established its policy as early as the end of February without waiting for the opinion of the European Parliament .
Although it has taken a long time to get this report through Parliament , that does not give the Council an excuse to disregard Parliament 's role in the legislative process .
It is a fact that family reunifications among third country citizens contribute between 40 and 50 % of the total number of immigrants into the EU.
At the same time , the directive gives the Member States sufficient opportunities to prevent inadvertent economic immigration .
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I have supported the proposed amendment that creates a wider definition of family and also brings third country citizens with subsidiary protection within the rules on family reunification .
I still believe that the Member States must have the opportunity to set requirements , for example in the form of a normal standard of accommodation , an income that ensures that the family can be provided for , and respect for public order and security , as well as the opportunity to establish a waiting period .
I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for a very full answer .
The reason for my question is , of course , that it is taking time to find these recognised test methods .
We should have had a method for the effects on health last year , and for the effects on the environment now in 2003-2005 .
I find this very alarming , since it means that nothing can be done .
I would like to ask about the last thing that Commissioner Wallström mentioned , namely the issue of getting hormone-disturbing substances included in the category of 'hazardous substances ' in new chemicals legislation and as an independent hazard criterion , on a par with what may be carcinogenic or mutagenic substances .
I would , however , question both the realism of the proposal and its political wisdom .
A supranational Europol is nothing less than a federal police force .
The logic behind Europol is a lesson in EU integration .
Random parts of the regulation that until now has been the responsibility of the national states are removed .
Nations are forced to lift national border controls .
Consequently , Europol is created .
Without , as mentioned previously , doubting the good intentions behind it , as a Scandinavian I am convinced that the rights of control that we have over our Danish police - and which are far from satisfactory - do however serve democracy and the rule of law far more securely than any supranational system .
As a Northerner , I say that we can do better ourselves , at least while we have not yet squandered the whole of our heritage in terms of legal culture .
Mr President , I share your and Mr Aparicio Sánchez 's concerns regarding the fact that we are discussing such a fundamental proposal so late .
It is a comprehensive report , and I know from experience that the work involved in such a report is fairly demanding .
I would also like to thank you , Commissioner Vitorino , for your great commitment to this issue .
I would also express my regret at the form of debate that we are having here in Parliament , since it excludes you from being able to answer questions here and now .
Although we have made some great progress , many questions remain unanswered , and I will mention some of them and will happily send them to you
