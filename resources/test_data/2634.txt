Accordingly , I would like to say that Mr Michaelis and Mr Proske are real shitheads – in claiming that our fellow Member said this .
Looking at the past two years , we have every reason to be satisfied and proud , even though at the time there was no lack of doomsday scenarios .
Yet the Cassandras have been proven wrong .
Both countries are working hard to tackle the remaining shortcomings to fully meet the criteria of accession .
Hence , when we last met in late April , I promised you a carefully calibrated decision that maintains the momentum of reforms up to and beyond accession .
Bulgaria and Romania have indeed undergone a monitoring process that is unprecedented in its scope and intensity .
Bulgaria needs seriously to intensify its efforts to crack down on organised crime and corruption .
It also needs to demonstrate clear evidence of results in the fight against corruption , in terms of investigations and judicial proceedings .
In the area of human rights and the rights of minorities , further efforts are needed by both Bulgaria and Romania .
As to the , our legal order , significant progress has been achieved and most of the areas are unproblematic , provided that the current pace of preparations is maintained .
Since October last year , the areas of serious concern have been brought down from 16 to 6 in Bulgaria and from 14 to 4 in Romania .
Our report specifies the safeguards and other protective measures under the existing legislation that we have at our disposal .
These safeguards could be invoked if certain limited problems persist at accession in the areas , for instance , of the internal market and justice and home affairs , where we can also establish a monitoring mechanism based on the Accession Treaty .
In agriculture , we even propose novel , stricter measures , based on the Accession Treaty That sends a strong signal that we are careful with our money .
Let me express our appreciation for the support of the European Parliament for the accession process of Bulgaria and Romania .
Mr President , it is not a question of my timetable , but of media deadlines in Bulgaria and Romania .
I would like to thank you for a very constructive and responsible debate , which also reflects the wide range of views in European civil society .
That is , of course , the role of Parliament .
Yes , some are more in favour than others and opinions differ as to the conditions , but the overall tone of the debate has been very clear and I can say that the Commission is in favour of the target and of sticking strictly to the conditions .
I fully agree with that .
We have to see that the conditions are really fulfilled , especially in the field of terrorism and the fight against corruption and organised crime .
I agree .
This is included in the Commission ’s report and both countries are fully aware of the expectations and of the remaining criteria .
We shall discuss what is expected of both Bulgaria and Romania .
Bulgaria needs to establish the integrated administration and control system in agriculture in order to implement the provisions and funding of the common agricultural policy .
This should work as a very strong incentive to redress this shortcoming .
To avoid any confusion or misunderstanding , this compels me say that in fact , in the conclusion of the Commission ’s report adopted just three hours ago , we say that by early October we shall assess whether the two countries have been able to address the remaining shortcomings and on that basis we shall adopt a position as to whether the proposed accession date can be adhered to .
This means , in clear English or other Community languages , that the Commission reserves the right to consider the use of this safeguard clause of postponement unless the shortcomings are addressed in the next five months , which is , as I said , fully achievable for both countries if they really make an effort .
This is also a matter of the famous absorption capacity of the European Union .
We have to congratulate him on a good job under very difficult conditions .
I am not about to underestimate the problems those two countries are facing , whether it be criminality , corruption , the judicial system or minorities , be they Roma or Hungarians , but we have to remember where those countries have come from .
Look at the fantastic progress Portugal has made in 20 years .
Today we must say ‘no’ to populism and ‘yes ’ to vision .
It depends on our will to build a more stable world .
We have lots of ways of monitoring safeguard clauses , even sanctions , to keep an eye on progress , but it is essential for us to support democratic forces in those countries .
Our moral duty today is to give people horizons – not borders .     As you can see , getting rid of roaming charges is one of the Commission ’s most popular initiatives .
What will the legal basis be and how will you cooperate with DG Competition on this initiative ?     .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of my group I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Böge , for the work he has done with regard to the matter now before us .
The biggest miscalculation was made by the Commission in its original proposal for economic guidelines .
It was difficult for many Members to come to terms with Mr Böge’s sense of realism at the time .
He has lost face in this process , as has Parliament as a whole .
The Commission and Parliament may in practice only be involved
