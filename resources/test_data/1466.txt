This is a good thing , of course .
It is a massive problem for the ordinary taxpayers of the EU that at least 11 % of the total approved amount should not have been paid out .
How are we supposed to explain that , year after year - and it really is year after year in this area - billions of kroner are paid out in contravention of the rules or perhaps even in a directly fraudulent way ?
The question is , however , whether this waste on a massive scale really can be reduced just through monitoring and simplifying the rules , or whether what we are dealing with is fundamental structural failings .
We support the redistribution of money from the richest to the poorest regions and countries both inside and outside the EU , but , if you read the report , the question is whether the EU has found the right way of doing this .
Is it an effective way of working for every country to pay into a system that then grants subsidies to the remotest elements in the individual countries , including the fact that these are paid by the very richest ?
Everyone knows that the longer a line , the greater the risk of loss somewhere along the way .
We Danish Social Democrats believe in the phasing out of the EU 's agricultural aid .
We , the Danish Liberal Party 's MEPs , voted in favour of the resolution on food security as we want to emphasise the importance of the EU taking global responsibility in the fight against hunger and poverty .
The Danish Liberal Party wants to see a gradual abolition of agricultural aid plus the establishment of common rules that ensure a level playing field for Europe 's farmers in terms of competition .
As others have done , I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that we , in Parliament , have been able to retain our important priorities in the second reading , too , even if we have had to make some cuts in connection with the agreement that we had with the Council .
We have succeeded in safeguarding our pilot projects and preparatory actions , which are new initiatives that are being instigated by Parliament and , on a personal note , I would like to say that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are pleased that we have succeeded in securing funds for the Baltic Sea Strategy .
Firstly , the lack of flexibility , with regard to which I would like Mr Šemeta , who is , of course , continuing in another post within the Commission , to take note of the fact that we do indeed need this mid-term review of the budget and I would like the Commission - the new Commission - to take this seriously .
Secondly , we need to look at things closely and ask ourselves whether there are any new priorities that we need to set within this framework .
Are there any programmes that are not working very well ?
We are , of course , in the position of having had resources as a result of the fact that plenty of money was allocated to agriculture to start with within the multiannual financial framework .
Now comes the moment of truth .
There is another issue that I would also like to raise , and that I would also like you to take into account in your future work , Mr Šemeta .
In my group , we do not advocate the contravention of existing agreements .
It is no good simply to be dissatisfied with the result of the established system .
It is several years now since the Kinnock reform .
It is five years since enlargement .
It is now time to review things once again .
Mr President , many fine words have been spoken regarding Mr Barroso 's new team of commissioners - and rightly so .
It has quite simply been DISCONTINUED - and that at a time when - more than ever - we need a proper , coordinated , well thought-out communication policy within the EU.
No reply has ever been received - which is perhaps a kind of answer in itself , if not a satisfactory one .
I am still waiting for an answer from Mr Barroso - preferably an answer with a proper plan for communication in the forthcoming five years .
Mr President , I do not see this in the same way as the previous speaker .
As far as I can see , it is clearly in the EU 's interest to foster as close a relationship as possible between Europe and the democratic countries of Asia , including South Korea .
For a long time , there was an imbalance in trade between Europe and South Korea because of protectionism , between the EU with its free trade and South Korea with its protectionism .
A few decades ago , South Korea was an agricultural society ; it has developed rapidly into an industrial society , with 81 % of the population now living in urban areas .
South Korea is an important ally in a strategically important area .
South Korea has to compete with the economic and military giant to the north of it , China , which is , at the same time , the country 's main trading partner .
Consequently , China is also the country 's main trade competitor .
This free trade agreement will , as has been mentioned , remove tariffs worth EUR 1.6 billion a year .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs de Brún for the excellent job she has done on updating this technical regulation on travel with pet animals within the territory of the EU.
It is necessary
