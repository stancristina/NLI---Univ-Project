In fact we shall have to take into account this doubling of the number of cities involved when we come to evaluate any proposal for a programme to carry on from Culture 2000 with effect from 2007 onwards .
First of all , that decision takes no account of the fact that , even at the time , there was a prospect of the possible accession of at least ten new Member States , and the fact that it did not do so is unacceptable .
We shall simply make the dilution and obsolescence even worse .
The other set of amendments , which comes mainly from the PPE Group , validates and sets out in detail the Commission ’s proposal which , in my opinion , makes any decision this coming autumn completely pointless .
Artists and those involved in culture are quick to point out that this event , which is mainly focused around factual matters , could devalue their work as artists , break down the relationship that there normally is with the public and result in fierce competition between cultural structures .
What is happening is England , Germany and elsewhere is marvellous .
I am sure you are aware that this was a step forwards in the construction of the Europe of education and training .
Amendment No 12 is also not acceptable in its current form .
Was it really their concern for transparency ?
The Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has chosen a different path to the signatories , because we talk about the future while others stay stuck in the past , because Europe is not built on fear , but on ambition and will .
The assessment made by that resolution is damning .
The proximity of the elections may exacerbate people’s attitudes , that is quite natural for a democrat : the elections are not a difficult time to get through , as you seem to think .
These texts are accompanied by a significant proposal for a directive on certifying locomotive drivers and crew and a proposal for a regulation on contractual quality clauses for rail freight .
They will also have the opportunity to take part in working groups on the TSIs that affect them .
I think that the date that we are reaching is not insignificant .
I think that opening up , in the sense in which we see it , in other words as purely liberal , creating competition on the networks , is not the panacea .
It is a good example of efficient and constructive cooperation between the institutions .
The Commission proposal has two main parts .
Amendments Nos 1 to 5 .     Mr President , Commissioner , the Rübig report does not pose any problems .
It has been restarted twice .
That being the case , it is clear that , despite this progress , Europe will not reach the intermediary quantitative objective : to reach an employment rate of 67 % by 2005 .
This is the subject of Amendment 5 .
We have very weak growth , increasing unemployment and an increase in disparity in income between different social groups , with no reduction in exclusion and poverty , in one of the richest regions of the world .
Our objective is the transposition of the British golden rule to European level .
We have not only deplored the European Union’s situation of profound underemployment and weak growth , but we have sought to build an economic policy at European Union level .
The Lisbon strategy chose good objectives and a good driving force , but its guidelines are still very ambiguous and it has not found the tools to work with .
In order to be convinced , we need only see that the three countries of the Union that have not adopted the euro and have preserved their monetary sovereignty are doing much better than the twelve that have chosen , within the framework of the European currency , to link their destinies and to entrust them to a veritable State Bank , a supreme bank that does not care two hoots about growth in Europe .
Can we declare , like a people’s court , that certain facts have been established – particularly for Italy or Poland – for which no evidence has been produced or presented ?
In the meantime , however , several fellow Members of other groups have informed me that they wished to be able to vote on certain paragraphs .
Furthermore , liberalisation seems to be incompatible with safety , since some countries have had to renationalise following repeated accidents .
At the end of the negotiations , Parliament accepted the Council’s refusal to include the liberalisation of rail passenger services in this directive .
Applying this policy to the curriculum vitae would once again illustrate the Commission ’s regrettable tendency to want to interfere in even the smallest details of our daily lives to the detriment of individual peculiarities and originality that are sources of mutual enrichment .     .
Solidarity between the peoples of the European Union , economic and social progress and the strengthening of cohesion feature among the European Union’s general objectives .
Procedures are important .
It is detrimental to us all .
Whether the Member States choose to support employers through inflation , that is to say by lowering purchasing power , or through budgetary austerity , that is to say by cutting back on public services , shedding jobs and freezing salaries , or through a combination of the two , it will in any case be the working classes that will pay .
There are stocks that pose a threat of proliferation , and several Phare countries , such as the former Yugoslavia , the United States , China and Russia , should be encouraged to ratify this treaty .
Several factors indicate that many sports articles are produced by subcontracting firms which
