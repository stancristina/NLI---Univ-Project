It is therefore crucial that an effective prevention policy is implemented , followed up by actions for training and information and by awareness-raising campaigns .
In this connection I would state that the situation in Portugal is cause for concern , especially in sectors such as construction , the textile industry and agriculture .
As a result of the practical solutions that have been found , of the good sense that has prevailed and of rigorous political weighting , Parliament , the citizens in general and all the Community institutions deserve our applause .
( PT ) This proposal for a regulation is extremely important , because it is intended to ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health by means of more rigorous procedures for vigilance of the market and for pharmacovigilance , in order to increase the number of medicinal products available , to complete the internal market in pharmaceutical products and , lastly , to amend the aims and working methods of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in the prospect of the enlargement of the EU.

Mr President , the attacks of 11 September 2001 , and more recently on the island of Bali , have demonstrated the unpredictability of the terrorist threat , its lethal seriousness and our vulnerability in the face of it .
Despite its generous policy , these extremists sow the seeds of hate and take advantage of the facilities made available to them by the democratic systems , organise themselves , find funding , recruit new members and plot attacks against targets on our continent and throughout the world .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments on texts that I think are somewhat ambiguous .
But this is not the case !
Unfortunately , some ambiguities in Europe today are preventing us from doing so .
The determination to eradicate terrorism and the urgent need to set up new and effective instruments to achieve this cannot , under any circumstances , disproportionately affect individual rights , freedoms and guarantees .
The fanatical hatred that leads human beings to attack others and to commit suicide is often fed by ongoing situations of injustice or humiliation .
I would just like to say on behalf of the Commission that I am sure that one can conclude from this debate that the measures that have been taken at European level and in the Member States concerning the fight against terrorism have been adopted with a strict respect for the rule of law and the characteristics of an open society .
This fact is slowly being accepted by the Member States .
The cooperation between intelligence-gathering services and police forces at European level in the fight against terrorism since 11 September can be successful .
We share Parliament 's view that we should give priority to this .
We should not minimise the ongoing debate in the United States on those key issues or leave them isolated .
The Commission can only encourage them to stick to those commitments .
We clearly stated our concern about the low level of protection given to our individual freedoms against this threat , about the security of communications sent and received by our businesses , and even about 'fair trade ' in the international market .
We have even seen a trend that we must definitely combat - and on this matter I must highlight the intervention by Mr Haarder in the previous debate - which is to suggest that the fight against international crime and terrorism is necessarily undertaken at the cost of our freedoms .
Bearing this in mind and taking account of the farming structure in Galicia , which is based on family ownership , with a clear focus on milk production , I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council : would the Council accept specific measures - that could also be applied to another country - that would enable Galicia to increase its production whilst temporarily maintaining the intervention price system ?
The number of executions reported in Iran has trebled in the last three years and , given these circumstances , the question is this : is the European Union going to conclude a trade agreement with Iran in the wake of these systematic breaches of human rights or not ?
This is unacceptable !
I would reiterate here the issue of the competent authority : the proposal for a regulation reveals the importance of Article 14 , which deals with the obligation on the part of the authority in this field to inform passengers of their rights .
Despite the moderate tone of the report , he makes some criticism of the European Union and the CAP , which I feel is , in some cases , unfair .
The conflict is often seen more from the point of view of the interests of certain companies operating in these countries than from the point of view of the interests of local communities .
Although it is true that tax evasion and fraud have a national dimension specific to each country , they also and increasingly have a supranational dimension rooted in the use of sophisticated techniques and schemes .
With the reserves that have been created and bearing in mind the need for the new programme to get off the ground , I support the rapporteur 's recommendation .
.
This is indeed extremely gratifying .
.
This is crucial not only as a matter of principle , as I said at the beginning of my intervention , but also as a means of helping to restore confidence in the financial markets .
I think that this must be the approach to adopt if confidence is to be restored in economic actors and this is a prerequisite for our being able to achieve a genuine area of freedom , security and justice and move towards the much
