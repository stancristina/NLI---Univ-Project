sets great store by prevention , as we have been advocating , because a potential pandemic can be avoided through prevention .
It is therefore important to bear in mind that , quite apart from the human health problems , some countries – be they EU countries or those at the source of the disease in South-East Asia – may not be able to meet the high costs involved .     .
We stand in clear opposition to any patents covering life and knowledge that we consider a universal good .
Among other aspects that we welcome is the report’s condemnation of the way in which current EU policies concentrate on the punitive side .
He also reiterated support for the proposed directive on the creation of an internal market for services and on working time .
Parliament must exert pressure on the Member States and the Commission to effect such a change , through the EU budget that it adopts .
In other words , the majority in Parliament is guilty of shameless inconsistency .
By combining bilateral and regional levels of economic and social dialogue , as well as opportunities for interaction , the Barcelona Process helps to strengthen ties and to build confidence between peoples .
He sought to bring the citizens ’ complaints to the attention of the institutions , and in some cases , managed to resolve those complaints .
It therefore strikes me as vitally important that dialogue be re-established with the citizens , whereby the powers of the institutions are explained clearly and simply .
As the motion for a resolution states , a just and lasting solution must involve putting an end to colonial rule , of which Western Sahara is a victim , and creating a sovereign , independent and viable Sahrawi state .
In Portugal , in my region of Oporto district , this tragedy was felt very deeply .
Recently , on 1 November , there was dreadful violence and repression in Ethiopia and all opposition leaders were arrested .
High levels of unemployment , inequalities in the distribution of wealth , poverty and social exclusion are also causing rising social tension , something to which we in the EU are not immune .
Universal access to high quality public services , in areas such as water supply , health , education and housing , is of fundamental importance .
It lends international legitimacy to the fight against terrorism , by setting out clearly what separates us from the terrorists , namely respect for human life and for people’s fundamental rights .
At this point , I should like to highlight two US Senate initiatives that I wholeheartedly welcome .
In practical terms , it was designed to enable them to enter the territory of the State where the Games were held without being subject to other procedures or formalities , and to hold an Identity and Accreditation Card , alongside passports or other official travel documents .
As the explanatory statement to this report rightly points out , ‘the regulation plays the important role of establishing one of the four fundamental freedoms of the EU , namely the free movement of European citizens .
In recent years , eel stocks in Europe have declined dramatically .
These are measures which , as we have been proposing , should be transposed to form part of the wider body of recovery programmes , a move that was incomprehensibly rejected by the majority in Parliament .
Our proposals aimed at changing the current neoliberal economic and monetary policies in the field of international trade , and the proposal to combat financial speculation in the world’s capital markets , whilst promoting investment and wealth creation in the real economy were thus rejected .
It agrees that the EU can make a valid contribution , through both its external and internal policies , by shaping the process of globalisation and making it fairer for all .     .
This is the spirit in which globalisation should be approached .     . – The objectives of reducing chemical damage to the environment and to health , raising awareness of the consequences of the use of chemicals , improving consumer access , gradually eliminating and replacing the least safe chemicals and banning tests on vertebrate animals all touch the lives of the citizens whom we represent in this Chamber .
As shadow rapporteur for the Committees on International Trade and Economic and Monetary Affairs , I am delighted that many examples of consensus reached on the text to be submitted for the vote have been included .
This , however , is the agreement that we have managed to reach , and is sufficiently good to warrant Parliament’s clear support .
It is also because the European institutional structure is fragmentary and in need of the integrating influence of a Constitution , which is why interim institutional agreements are required , along with a prudent and lasting organisational effort .
The effect of this is to exacerbate the unemployment problem in the areas in question – as in my country , for example , and in a number of other southern European countries – and seriously to hinder development in these areas .
There are times when the facts speak for themselves .
The fact that air accidents are , fortunately , rare in Europe does not allay our concerns about flights operated by third-country carriers wishing to use our airports , or carriers taking EU citizens outside European airspace .
The diagnosis has been made .
Mr Dimas said that the Montreal Conference will not produce all of the solutions we are looking for .
The nuclear option , which I feel is justified in certain circumstances , is only workable if accompanied by a stringent safety policy governing its use .
The EU already has extensive experience of regional policies adapted to specific geographical characteristics , albeit not always with the desired success
