has , since then , gone seriously downhill , with regard too to the common position we have obtained from the Council .
I think it is a huge problem when the Council adopts a common position that is not in accordance with current law as laid down by the Court of Justice .
The fact that the Court lays down something of which the Council takes no account is a major problem , and matters are not made any better by our also having a committee that chooses not to take account of the Court pronouncements we have .
That means that we must also be able to incorporate social and environmental considerations into public procurement .
No one is talking about disturbing the internal market .
It is in actual fact very simple , and fortunately we have a decision on this matter .
As Mr Hughes said , a curious change has , however , again crept into the amendment whereby it has been made conditional upon the aforementioned agreements being made law in the Member States .
There is no reason for interfering with the collective agreements we have in certain countries , and that is what in actual fact would be happening if the small clause in question were not removed .
I hope we can in that way support the split vote proposed by Mr Hughes .
Mr President , the climax of the Greek Presidency was a special summit involving the new nations of the West Balkans .
They will be sincerely welcome , and I am pleased that the EU Charter of Human Rights contains the recognition of the rights of ethnic minorities that is deserved by everyone in the Balkans .
The process may suddenly go very fast , because the countries concerned find it difficult to see any alternatives , given that , in practice , the EU also legislates for its neighbouring countries .
An Estonian language teacher can earn ten times as much by working in Brussels .
It will be possible for MEPs from Prague to earn 20 times as much as their colleagues in the national parliament , so it will be no fun returning over the Charles Bridge in Prague .
It is scarcely Polish farmers who are buying up Dutch land .
Why not be more flexible in introducing EU rules into the candidate countries and the new partnership countries .
There is no one in the EU who is lining up to pay subsidies to unemployed slaughterhouse workers in Poland .
The high point of the Greek Presidency was the solemn signature of the agreements to extend the EU to include ten new Member States .
It is one of the Copenhagen criteria that countries can only be accepted when they have stable parliamentary democracies .
In our case , power is not to reside with those who are elected but with people who were once elected and can now no longer be .
The national parliaments and the electorate are losing far more power than the EU is gaining , and that is not a guarantee of increased voter turn-out in the EU elections .
Ask the voters if they want to participate less in elections .
I have voted against the recommendation by the European Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market not to waive Mr Camre 's immunity .
It is possible to hold many opinions , both for and against the racism paragraph and freedom of expression .
Even Members of the Danish Parliament would have their immunity waived so that their cases might be tried before the courts .
Indeed , we would also extradite our citizens for prosecution in the United States , where the use of the death penalty cannot be ruled out .
Mr Camre is risking neither his life nor his freedom in a matter concerning racist statements .
It is a sound democratic principle that a Danish court should decide whether there has been any breach of Danish law .
It is a serious warning of the EU 's growing power over the Danish legal system that an EU institution should have the power to prevent Danish courts from carrying out those tasks that fall to them under the constitution .
In line with Mr Chirac and Mr Berlusconi , Mr Camre is hiding behind an anachronistic immunity and thereby significantly helping to undermine the constitutional state that his party chairman nowadays attacks openly .
It has , I know , in large part been an uphill struggle , with a Council and a large number of Members of this Parliament not having been interested in what might be regarded as the ideal legislation .
Firstly , I think that the limit value for labelling in the case of adventitious pollution by GMOs is still too high and , secondly , we are coming , over a period , also to accept adventitious pollution by non-authorised and unlabelled GMOs .
There will now most certainly be many instances of GMO pollution , with lengthy compensation cases in their wake .
In spite of these defects , we are in the position of not having any choice , and I too shall therefore support the outcome with which we have been presented , including Mrs Scheele 's report .
I believe we are obtaining some sensible rules on traceability .
Only time and the first cases of matters going wrong can reveal whether the rules on traceability have been secure enough .
It is quite crucial for me that the de facto moratorium should only be lifted when the system for developing and assigning unambiguous identifications of GMOs has been fully implemented , that is to say when the rules are in place and there is full traceability from day one .
In that connection , I should like to thank Mrs Wallstr√∂m for the assurances she gave in her speech .
