That is , of course , completely unacceptable .
The allies went to war to force Saddam Hussein to comply with the UN resolutions .
Once that has been done , Israel will , if appropriate , be able to build a protective wall along the Green Line , but , by then , that will be unnecessary because the Palestinian Authority will have been provided with the basis for effectively putting a stop itself to all the suicide bombings .     Mr President , firstly , I want to thank Commissioner Bolkestein very much for his very clear , and clearly worded , speech .
I am therefore very pleased with what we have heard from the Commission .
This had already been presented last year , and it is of course splendid that the Commission was , in this way , ahead of its time .
There is a need for that action plan , and there is a need for the Commission to put more resources into implementing it .
The unfortunate fact is that , on average , six to eight years elapse between a proposal’s being put forward by the Commission and its being implemented in all the Member States .
A great many financial scandals can arise during that period of time , but , in its action plan , the Commission is repeatedly alert to issues of timing .
Good corporate governance is open , transparent corporate governance .
Another important factor is that of board members ’ collective responsibility for financial , and important non-financial , decisions .
Certain companies are constructed in such a way as to cause observers to feel that they have been placed in the middle of a labyrinth , with no red thread to facilitate movement backwards or forwards .
One thing we must not forget about is having a correct balance .
The culture surrounding corporate governance is important .
It is no use putting unnecessary obstacles in the way of all the many honest companies .
Furthermore , investors must insist upon good corporate governance .
The best means of implementing everything we are now discussing is , in spite of everything , the market .
Pressure from investors is often the best incentive for sticking to the straight and narrow .
We just need to move up a gear and travel a little more quickly towards our destination .     Mr President , I am incredibly disappointed with the joint motion for a resolution .
In Iran , the critical dialogue has clearly been interpreted in such a way as to convey the impression that we in the EU are now better placed to understand and accept their oppressive regime .
Is there nothing being done by the hierocracy in Iran that can make us take seriously our own much trumpeted values of democracy and human rights and , let it be said , act in accordance with them ?
The EU should now support those forces that really want to see a pluralist and democratic Iran .
As a first step , the EU should ensure that members of the Mujahedin are not handed over to Iran and certain death , and it should , as quickly as possible , see to it that they are removed from the EU’s list of terrorists and support their demand for a referendum in Iran .     Mr President , it is the comments of my esteemed colleague , Mrs Ludford , that cause me too to request the floor .
I therefore wish to propose perhaps attempting to take action at this early stage .
I am not normally one to propose new expenditure , nor am I normally one to propose that Parliament print glossy brochures extolling its own virtues , but I should like to make an exception in this case .
Kofi Annan made an outstanding speech to us recently , and I would ask that this speech be printed , that it be printed in all the languages and that it be published in a presentable edition so that we can use it in the election campaign .
Nearly everybody clapped – for the speech at least .
To that extent , results have not been forthcoming .
At what has been termed the Berlin Summit between Chancellor Schröder , Prime Minister Blair and President Chirac , the three gentlemen proposed the creation of a new post of Deputy President of the Commission , popularly known as the post of super-Commissioner , with responsibility for coordinating all the issues relating to economic reforms of the EU.
Hopefully , we are not talking about more relaxed enforcement both of the rules governing state subsidies and of competition policy in general .
It would remove the focus from what should be done in terms , namely , of real structural reform in many Member States and more investment in research and education .
Structural reforms are about stopping the trend towards ever increasing taxation , ensuring flexible labour markets and keeping the growth of public expenditure at a sustainable level .
We must not be like Mogens Lykketoft , the leader of the opposition in Denmark , and propose introducing a penalty duty to be paid by enterprises each time they give notice to an employee over 50 years of age .
That would prevent the recruitment of older staff , make the labour market inflexible and cause the loss of jobs .
We in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party support the two reports by , respectively , Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mr Bigliardo , as adopted by the committee , but not the proposed amendments to these .     Mr President , there has been a lot of talk about involving the European Parliament in drawing up what is termed the Quick Start list .
The Court of Auditors has investigated the management system for the trans-European transport network and
