am again trying to get this House to realise the importance of changing the current rules on value added tax exemption on postal services .
The market is being liberalised at both European and national level .
The economic impact on consumers would be negligible .
They will also be able to reclaim input VAT paid , thus lowering their overall costs .
It is proposed that the weight limit for the reduced rate for standard mail be raised from 2 kg to 10 kg .
The entry into force of the directive is postponed until 2007 .
We also have suggestions regarding various organisations that deal with gifts and the like .
Other providers of postal services , according also to the Commissioner , support this proposal .
I spoke to a leading employee of Postcomm who told me that there was no reason for Royal Mail to retain this VAT exemption as it was not needed to protect either Royal Mail or the users .
Maybe we can live with this , as I myself can live with it , but it is however Europe’s consumers who have lost .
It is then that the new Europe will be built .
I do not therefore share the Commissioner’s view .
The basic conditions are so different from one Member State to the next .
On the contrary .
The two most generous benefits in Sweden – parental benefit and child allowance – are paid to everyone who has children in Sweden .
Alongside our debate on the annual changes , the modernisation of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1408/71 , which is linked to these annual changes , is also taking place .
That is my personal view .
Family benefits definitely do not have their place there .
This may be considered right or wrong , but everyone must no doubt agree that the annexes have to be based upon certain principles .
Mr Schmidt says that we have such different systems – which is true – but he also says that we could live with these different systems , that they do not affect freedom of movement and that we do not need these regulations .
Above all , we welcome the way in which it makes it clear that health care must be provided close to the patients in their local environments , because family , friends and colleagues mean such a lot in terms of rehabilitation and the quality of care .
The basic principle is to be that every producer who is an approved operator in one Member State must freely be able to establish operations in any other Member State .
These developments are a threat to patients ’ rights , and we in the European Parliament must do all we can to stop them .
This can and should , however , be developed between Member States and border regions on the basis of more practical needs instead of in accordance with the abstract principle of the organisation of the internal market .
If the Commission successfully carries out its offensive in terms of subjecting what were previously public services to the principles of the internal market , popular resistance to the EU project will , in general , rise to unguessed-at levels .
All the parties promised to work for these issues remaining within strictly national areas of legislation , without interference by the EU.
There is no obvious need for coordination .
Because the report prescribes in a very detailed way how the Member States are to organise their health care and health services , as well as care for the elderly , we have voted against it , and this in spite of the fact that we can , in principle , support a number of the proposals presented in the report , for example that concerning the right of EU citizens to health care throughout the EU.     As Liberals , we always put the individual at the heart of all political decisions .
In order to obtain the best adapted health care and health services , we believe that responsibility must lie at national , rather than EU , level .
At the same time , I wish to call attention to the fact that Ukraine is a very old nation .
Many here in the European Parliament have warm feelings towards Ukraine .
Every year , the fourth Sunday in November is a day for commemorating this genocide and this mass starvation .     – Mr President , on the night of 19 March , 23 young people died in a terrible bus accident in Konginkangas in central Finland .
I hope that , in the future , Parliament too will be able to benefit from this committee’s investigation .
That is incredibly important and , just as Mr Katiforis says , it provides the opportunity for economic growth , continued competition and more job opportunities in line with the Lisbon process , which is proving far too slow .
Where the directive on investment services and regulated markets is concerned , the rapporteur has done some exceptional work .
I recognise that Mr  Huhne and I might have gone further , but we can live with the compromises .
They provide the opportunity for continued competition between different trade centres .
I myself have had difficulty with the committee’s wanting to delete the Commission ’s proposals concerning mandatory quarterly reporting .
Now , there is a sensible compromise which , at a pinch , can be lived with : half-yearly reporting with a possible review of the directive within five years .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the EU must of course be part of the international fight against terrorism , and the conclusions from last week’s European Council also show this .
If the political will existed , it should be possible right now – before the Constitution has entered into force – to guarantee democratic scrutiny .
