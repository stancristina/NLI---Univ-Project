legacy of war .
They are the catalyst for stability , reconciliation and normalising political relations .
The less we need to focus on stability and security , the more we can channel our resources to economic and social development , which is rightly underlined in the Samuelsen report .     .
It is important , therefore , that we discuss the Western Balkans and try to improve our policies in that region .
One of the issues raised by several speakers in this debate was enlargement fatigue and I think this is a very serious challenge .
Our next steps , therefore , must be gradual and carefully and prudently managed .
We need to have a dialogue and explain this point to our citizens to ensure that the future of the Western Balkans is not held hostage by unwarranted fears .
We hope that the recent proposals by the UN facilitator , Mr Nimetz , will contribute to this objective .
This allows both republics and the State Union to make progress in their respective areas of competence .
The State Union is mainly responsible for foreign policy and security issues , while the republics are responsible for most aspects of economic policy and trade relations .
We will report on the progress of Serbia and Montenegro through this approach in the Commission ’s annual report on the stabilisation and association process this autumn .
They are chiefly weak states .
We must , therefore , find better ways of building institutions in the region , such as the approach to building Member States rightly advocated by the report of the International Commission on the Balkans , which was published yesterday .
It is of the utmost importance that the service be situated in the Commission .
We must avoid all attempts to water down the new service by placing it primarily in the Council .
Only with maximum parliamentary accountability can we be assured that Europe’s noble goals for the rest of the world are achieved .
Secondly , we need to take both an ambitious and realistic approach to European foreign policy under the new Constitution , if and when we get it .
The inclusion of mutual security guarantees in the Constitution should also be welcomed and consolidated .
We proposed European guarantees simply to complement NATO provisions with a much-needed European dimension .
They also support and consolidate decades of European political and security cooperation , which has existed outside the scope of the EU.
Do you intend to propose the same sort of package again or do you have your own proposals for amendments to this package , and what would these possible amendments be ?     Mr President , as we know , sport itself does not have sufficient resources to deal with the problem of doping .
This work is not just restricted to our continent of Europe : this is a global task .
Legislative cooperation to prevent the spread of doping substances and partnerships between the authorities are ways in which the doping problem can be effectively addressed and prevented .
It should be possible for the EU Member States to make a combined effort to strike a better balance with regard to the contributions the various countries make to the work of WADA , thus creating more effective preconditions for it to function efficiently .
The EU should not establish its own doping agency : it should join the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention and this way be closely involved in work to combat doping across Europe .
The EU should actively monitor the preparation of the convention and coordinate the views of the Member States .
A sense of proportion , however , should be maintained here .
In the midst of the debate , we should always remember that sport is a positive thing : it promotes human health and well-being .     Mr President , I wish to express my sympathy on account of the Portuguese drought and my support for the resolution .
One of our themes was climate change .
The seminar was also attended by a leading official from the Commission ’s Directorate General for Research , who had been genuinely delighted with the contact between science and politics in Parliament .
The world is not shaped in such a way that academic knowledge simply flows in the direction of politicians .
Although society engages in scientific research , legislators are often unfortunately kept in the dark when it comes to knowledge of this kind .
If we ask whether more droughts can be expected , however , they answer yes ; if heat waves are to become more frequent , they answer yes ; and if modern society will become more and more vulnerable to extreme weather phenomena , they answer yes .
The information we have now should be enough for us to take ever more effective action to avert or slow down climate change .
That is one of our principle political priorities .
We need , for example , a proper forestry strategy in this situation .
The past few years have been marked by much law-making .
For its part , I hope the Commission assumes a twofold strategy .
This approach should take due account of evolving market practices and the principle of subsidiarity .
Secondly , in its role as EU executive , the Commission should take a rigorous approach to enforcement .
However , many implementing measures have not , and transposition into national law is only beginning .
Much of this is due to the expediency and flexibility inherent in the Lamfalussy Process .
As for the convergence between supervisory practices , we need to be realistic .
One possible option is a 26th European regime for supervision of global actors .
All these options should be left open and used if the Commission thinks it is necessary .     .
