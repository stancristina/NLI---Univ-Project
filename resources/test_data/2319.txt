here .
I would ask you to reverse it so that the compromise resolution by four groups , including the two biggest groups , comes first .
Mr President , Mrs Flesch quite rightly declares an interest in matters in which she has an interest .
I suggest that such a declaration is not necessary when voting .
When Members are speaking in debate , either in committee or in plenary , they should declare an interest , but that should not prevent them from voting on a subject .
Mr President , I rise on a similar point , because I am not clear what the House has agreed to .
We have agreed to vote at 6 p.m.
What we could do is reduce the amount of speaking time for urgencies so there will be an opportunity for a debate on each of them .
It is certainly not clear to the House that we have agreed to vote on urgencies that have failed to be discussed .
Mr President , we agreed that we would take the debate on Buitenweg , not that we would spend one hour on it .
For example , I have been told that I will be speaking just after an hour into the debate , so I guess the Buitenweg debate will take probably an hour and a half at least .
It was not agreed we would reduce the time of that debate , let us be clear on that .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I refer to the comments made in a statement this morning by Mrs Fontaine regarding certain logistical problems in the building .
In the interests of transparency and information to Members , we need to know the extent of the problem of legionella .
Could you provide us with information on that ?
What procedures have been put in place ?
Has the air-conditioning system now been switched off ?
Can we therefore assume that an operation has been undertaken to disinfect the system ?
Could you confirm this and , indeed , could Parliament ' s presidency confirm that there is no problem with asbestosis which , of course , would be in breach of our own EU directive passed over a decade ago .
- The British Conservative Members decided to abstain in our vote on this report .
This should not be construed at all that we are not opposed to discrimination .
We are opposed to discrimination , we do believe in equality of treatment between men and women .
We do not accept , however , that the imposition of legal quotas is the way to achieve equality of treatment .
Quite the reverse .
We think quotas of themselves institutionalise discrimination .
We believe that women the world over and especially here in Europe are making a valuable and positive contribution to the democratic process .
We are convinced that role will develop fully and effectively without 'progressive ' or 'artificial means ' .
On the issue of making contraceptives more widely available we voted against the amendment because we believe these are issues of personal morality and conscience and not an issue where the European Union should be making a political stand .
For these reasons we voted against certain amendments and abstained on the final vote .
President , as co-rapporteur for this , Europe ' s first ever race directive , I and my party are proud to contribute to legislation which establishes common standards of protection for the victims of racial discrimination throughout our continent .
This will send a clear signal to the racist extreme right that they have no part in modern Europe and it closes the chapter of racism , anti-Semitism and xenophobia which tragically blighted our history in the century just past .
Racism is not an opinion - it is a crime .
The 24-year old black care worker set on fire in a racist attack in Britain , the 5 neo-Nazis convicted of beating two Vietnamese people in Germany , the French authorities cited by Amnesty International for torture of a Moroccan-Dutch national , all of which took place in Europe this very week are simply the most visible examples of racial discrimination which is the daily experience of black and ethnic minority Europeans in our businesses , communities and on our streets .
For example , the group from Watford in my constituency whom I met just last week , were witness to racist intimidation at a border post , which is sadly too routine even to be reported .
Let me be clear - today the European Parliament places on record our belief that this legislation will concretely tackle such racism .
The shift in the burden of proof because the discriminator holds all of the information will guarantee greater fairness in the way that complaints are heard .
The definition of indirect discrimination will enable covert action which is more pervasive , more insidious to be challenged and will permit implementation by genuinely independent bodies with sufficient funds to do their work so that our words are turned into reality .
The Commission for Racial Equality from the UK is just one example in Europe and I am pleased that some of the best lessons of the UK' s Race Relations Act alongside best practice from other Member States are being translated into European law today .
The European Parliament should be aware that the elements I have outlined are intrinsic to the legislation and that Mrs Buitenweg and myself have come to a clear understanding with the Portuguese Presidency that , in return for our cooperation in accelerating parliamentary approval , those elements will form a minimum in the final directive agreed
