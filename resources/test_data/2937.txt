It is also the only binding international agreement for nuclear disarmament .
Non-nuclear powers undertake not to acquire nuclear weapons , and the nuclear powers promise to get rid of their existing ones .
At the previous quinquennial meeting , the nuclear states undertook totally to abolish their nuclear arsenals .
Will the Council demand , then , that these commitments be complied with ?
Moreover , the United States has revised its nuclear weapons policy so as to be able to use its nuclear weapons , and not only in war but also for so-called preventive purposes .
They must embark upon serious nuclear disarmament and call a halt to any development of new nuclear weapons .
Parliament’s amendments are based essentially on the view that the Commission has exaggerated the problems of over-fishing and that a recovery plan is unnecessary .
There are tendencies for this now to spread to more countries , entailing a risk to employees ’ health and undermining safety in the workplace .
Amendment No 28 involves a long-term solution to the problem of doctors ’ hours on call being discussed in the next stage of consultation , something I supported because the result would otherwise be demands for approximately 3 000 new doctors in Sweden and an unsustainable funding situation for the county councils .     Madam President , I wish to take a rather personal line in this debate , because I believe that , whatever we say in this House , it may be perceived as offensive on all sides .
As a 25 year-old , I travelled to Belfast and saw how that city too is divided , with , in more recent times , barricades and barriers now having been built to separate Unionists and Republicans , the two population groups .
Am I saying this in order in some way to excuse what is happening in the Middle East ?
I would hope and believe that the wall and the barrier that have been built are interim solutions or measures .
One hundred and twenty suicide bombers have caused almost 900 deaths and getting on for 6 000 injured Israelis .
As good Europeans , and as good Swedes , let us try to see this issue from both sides .
I am therefore pleased about your commitment to human rights in Eritrea .
I would appeal to you to do everything you can to ensure that Dawit Isaacs returns to Sweden alive .     The European Parliament has previously expressed the view that it sees the Turkish presence in Northern Cyprus as an occupation .
Their work is , however , being sabotaged by the presence of the American forces .
That is quite revealing in terms of what is at issue here .
Finally , two prisoners died , and the journalist got an honest American doctor to state clearly in the death certificate that the cause of death was murder .
There are so many others who can make constructive efforts .
While the international community works to prevent drug abuse , Afghanistan’s illegal opium production discourages individual governments in the surrounding area from contributing financially to the reconstruction of the country .
The antidemocratic and Islamicist Taliban regime was guilty during its time in power of the most deliberate violation of women’s rights in modern times .
The third point concerns freedom of religion .
Perhaps this type of debate or , rather , series of monologues that we have in the European Parliament could be a touch more lively .
We must develop more stable , more secure and more pluralistic countries in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean .
The second thing the Commissioner said concerned the links between our financial support and behaviour at what he called grass roots level , that is to say how matters appear out in the cities , towns and villages when it comes to observing human rights .
As the Commissioner said , our relations with the Islamic world are an extremely sensitive area , both internally in the European Union and in our various Member States .
Nor am I convinced that the French or Turkish solution , in which religious symbols are to be banned in schools , is the right one .
The fundamental principles are that of the equal value of human beings , irrespective of religion , gender or ethnicity , the principle of non-discrimination and the principle whereby religion stands for non-violence , love and reconciliation .
That is why we have voted in favour of this report .
These are the consequences for the Islamic revolution in Iran of the activities of the Council of Guardians , of the legislation they have promoted and of other legislation they have prevented .
It is a tone quite different to that we heard three or four years ago when there was a lot of optimism .
I believe that responsibility for this new policy must lie with the Member States .
I wish especially to indicate the importance and significance of the public sector ’s playing an active role in such contexts , both because it is important for employment and because it consumes large portions of resources .     Mr President , when I arrived in Brussels this morning , I found I had received a letter from the World Nature Fund , saying that I should soon receive the results of the blood tests I took a few months ago , designed to ascertain which chemicals we have in our blood .
We have been presented with a series of alarming reports to the effect that different chemicals produce diseases and that they can , for example , affect our ability to have children .
I should also like to draw attention to a number of points I see as crucial improvements .
It also reduces the Member States’ opportunities to introduce more progressive legislation
