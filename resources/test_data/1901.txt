We must , however , declare that we also agree with everything that the President-in-Office , Mr Aznar , has said here today , which is that right now we have the means to overcome terrorism .
Including Europol in the Union 's institutional framework is just one example of this need .
Bravo!
Mr President , I will be very brief for I fully agree with what Chairman Wurtz has just said .
I would be grateful to the President of this House if he could send a message to the Israeli Government , protesting at the treatment suffered by Mrs Morgantini .
I do not think there is any need for this .
According to the Commission , a first-pillar instrument must be adopted which takes precedence over a third-pillar instrument .
If , however , we were to adopt a decision which was inconclusive as regards the basic approach or , worse still , if we were to adopt Amendment No 28 to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's report , which completely rejects the Commission 's proposal , we would cause the two documents to be totally inconsistent .
Even the many Community directives on the environment fail to provide sufficient protection because of failure to apply them and frequent failure to comply with them encouraged by the lack of effective penalties .
The document before us states that it aims to avoid asylum applicants being moved between States within the Union , but we harbour some doubts as to whether this can be achieved with minimal standards such as those contained in the proposal , considering , not least , the right accorded to the States to provide greater assistance for asylum applicants .
We therefore feel that the Council must introduce a 'fair and efficient ' asylum procedure and a 'clear and workable ' method including these new provisions on the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application .
Clearly , these are three very different cases and the solutions needed to regulate these situations will therefore also be very different .
In my opinion , the discharge procedure is a fundamental part of our work and is one of the distinguishing powers of our institution : the power by virtue of which we verify , year after year , that the good intentions and resolves , and also the expectations of the citizens who elected us and for whom we are responsible first and foremost , are fulfilled .
A representative of the Commission is here and has heard your speech , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten .
( IT ) Mr President , I voted for the Schmitt report because I consider it to be an extremely important report .
You will not believe this , Mr President , but at one point , the Member who was with me said : ' What a beautiful starry sky !
I propose that Mrs Lulling should be the referee and that you , Mr President , should kick off .
All those who wish to participate , please contact me at this email address : CFatuzzo@europarl.eu.int .
The Pensioners ' Party , represented by myself , voted for this report .
Support total freedom of movement for all !' , calling , in essence , for borders to be opened to all .
For example , I seem to remember that , in African countries , in developing countries of the Far East and also in countries near to us , preparations are being made to send elderly people to apply to enter Italy because there they will receive a million lire per month , providing they are over 65 years old , once their asylum application has been accepted .
Mr President , I wept in front of the Israeli soldier who was preventing us attending to a wounded Palestinian .
You forced them to strip naked and then you blindfolded them and tied their hands .
And yet we have been stopped by tanks and by your machine gun .
The policy of using suicide bombers , which , I am sad to say , is tragically no longer limited to Hamas or Jihad - organisations which , as a woman , I consider not just to be universally destructive but also to injure my rights too - must be stopped .
I wish we were all there , together with those Palestinians and those Israelis who continue to believe that the best form of security for all peoples , for all people , lies in the mutual acknowledgement of the right to exist and live in one 's own land in democracy and freedom .
It must suspend the Association Agreement with Israel for Israel has patently violated Article 2 ; there is no need for further analysis .
We will have no moral authority for any form of mediation if , most of the time , we only ever condemn one side , if we cannot show that we are making the distinction between a democratic country , the only one in the entire region , which is , moreover , committed to respecting human rights - although we do not know for how long - and a satrapy where those suspected of collaborationism are executed without even the semblance of a trial , if we do not acknowledge the fact that the Israeli army is engaged in an armed response which may be a futile mistake and which must not and , above all , cannot be the only response , but which is caused by the repeated massacres of unarmed , blameless civilians .
There is talk of economic retaliation against Israel .
There is another requirement , in addition to these .
One important development is that we have succeeded in organising a meeting , to take place tomorrow in Madrid , in which the United States , the European
