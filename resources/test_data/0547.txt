I would add , also to legalise in terms of deregulation , for here , too , the regulations are rigid and bureaucratic in granting permits and in defining those forms of work ; they are constraints which are wholly inappropriate in Europe today , which drive immigrant women , in particular , to marginalisation and illegal activities .
In my opinion , when we have recourse to a term such as 'citizenship' , either we have to define clear legal statuses , rights with corresponding duties , rights , therefore , which guarantee the new freedoms , or else the term will be likely to cause confusion .
However , I would express my concern essentially on two points .
It was with on the basis of these guidelines that the debate on the European Commission 's communication took place .
I do not feel that the multinationals are the right organisations for the task .
If we consider the situation of 40 years ago and then we look at the way things are today , we realise that the North-South divide has widened , that the gap between the poorest and richest countries is wider .
Of course , this would not mean depriving the private sector of the ultimate goal of its initiative but putting more pressure on it more than we have done thus far .
We need fresh support for development policy , support which has thus far not been forthcoming , from all the economic systems in which we live , not just from the States or public institutions .
Indeed , in 1997 , 3.5 million tonnes of highly migratory fish were caught in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian Oceans .
The economic sanctions must be eased but those on arms and technology must be tightened , at least until Iraq allows the UN inspectors free access .
Iraq is in fact rearming with chemical , biological and probably even nuclear weapons , and the danger it poses is becoming greater all the time .
The extent of the economic relations between the European Union and these countries , the need to strengthen the political role of the European Union as an autonomous and influential actor on the world stage to counter the preponderant influence of the United States , the concrete support given by the Union to all initiatives aiming at strengthening democracy , the rule of law and respect for human rights in South America means that we cannot go back on this move towards a new phase with regard to the transitional framework agreement that came into force in 1995 for Mercosur and 1999 for Chile .
Mr President , Commissioner , Representative of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the situation that is being negotiated with Mercosur and Chile lends itself to some dangerous suggestions that we should avoid , but it also offers some opportunities that this Union take and some responsibilities that it can assume .
So I must say , Mr President , that if it had not been for the liberalisation of television services I should not be here today .
I should like to underline my vote in favour with a strong , loud call for the elderly and pensioners in Europe to be granted free access to television channels , both public and private , without having to pay anything if they are not well-off , because television is a form of culture , education and also company for the elderly .
Mr Varela , on the other hand , has succeeded in obtaining nothing less than a regulation to enforce controls on fishing .
Pi√©trasanta report ( A5-0051/2001 )
Mr President , this report , which I have also voted for , is a follow-up to the previous report .
We are not against immigrants but we believe that , for an honest , responsible coexistence to work , it must be stringently controlled and regulated .
So I hope that , in these agreements and in their practical implementation , the pensioners of Mercosur will see their pension payments controlled , supervised , prompted , and speeded up and that we will get from them whatever might be useful to European pensioners .
Madam President , in effect , the issue of Parliamentary immunity is controversial , maybe because the provisions of the Treaty were written 36 years ago and it would , as I feel , be appropriate to update them .
These are actions which , in my opinion , we can in no way endorse .
Commissioner , I am somewhat concerned , not about Mr Daul 's outstanding work , but about the method .
Mr President , we must certainly tackle the issues of overproduction and high prices in the Community market , in addition to the problems caused by CMO rules .
I support the rapporteur 's basic proposal , however , to extend the current system until 2006 , in accordance with what was established at Berlin , in that I see the need to allow time for production conversion and diversification so that the , albeit necessary , measures do not lead to a drop in income for producers and cause acute social hardship in some of the afflicted areas where the product is produced .
I believe that these are not rhetorical phrases but genuine questions specific to European integration , to the integration of a Europe which we want to be institutional and political as well as economic .
Well then , the issue of communication - as you see , Commissioner , this is not a piece of make-believe but something which is innate in the nature of the relationship between the institutions and the citizens and in the will to build a Europe of the citizens as well as an institutional Europe - is closely linked to a strategy ,
