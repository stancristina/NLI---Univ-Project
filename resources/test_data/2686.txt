may be .
I am particularly pleased about the adoption of the report on EU Policy Coherence for Development and the 'Official Development Assistance plus ' concept , which is an excellent report aimed at ensuring greater respect for developing countries .
I voted for Mrs Ranner 's report , which calls on the Commission to propose minimum and maximum sentences for infringements that would be harmonised in all the Member States .
It goes right to the heart of the current debates on copyright and the Internet .
Secondly , a directive on orphan works : the objective is to create the necessary legal certainty to support the efforts to digitise our cultural heritage .
In particular , I am thinking about the question of the partially sighted .
Would the Commission accept that this fact represents a weakness in the current map and how does it feel it can be addressed ?
All of that leads me , like others , to call for more flexibility and subsidiarity if we want real social projects in these neighbourhoods .
Having said that , what measures do you intend to take in the short term to improve safety and accident prevention on offshore platforms located in our territorial waters ?
They are drilling everything they can , and at ever-increasing depths , which clearly increases the risk of accidents .
We know that hundreds of offshore drilling authorisations are granted by countries throughout the world , and if these authorisations were granted just as irresponsibly , it would pose serious problems to the entire world .
Well let us do it now !
Moreover , what is true of national budgets is also true of social and fiscal policy .
That is quite simply what the Commission must do ; it was created for that purpose .
This Council working group will meet to put forward solutions around October time or towards the end of the year .
Will it be the open method of coordination once again ?
I voted for this report and , in particular , for its provisions that follow on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009 .
This additive fulfils the four criteria in Regulation (EC ) No 1333/2008 permitting authorisation : food additives must be safe when used ( confirmed by the EFSA in its opinion of 2005 ) ; there must be a technological need for their use ( very useful as a stabiliser ) ; their use must not mislead the consumer (use limited to pre-packaged and , hence , labelled , products ) ; they must be of benefit to the consumer ( end product is stabilised ) .
Food safety and the health of European citizens are at stake .
I welcome the adoption , by a 'very close margin ' ( 370 votes , when we needed 369 ) , of this resolution , which protects consumers from the use of thrombin as a 'meat glue ' , as a food additive used to glue pieces of meat together to form a single meat-based product .
Several thousand people die each year in Europe because they have been unable to receive a transplantation in time .
This accession is not merely symbolic ; it enables the protection of the fundamental rights of EU citizens to be improved .
Yet how can this new legislation be implemented if the main states that have committed crimes of aggression since the coming into force of the Rome Statute in 2002 ( the United States and Israel ) are not required to ratify it ?
These policies entail using automatic stabilisers , in other words , in earmarking surpluses from the primary budget for debt repayment at the top of the cycle , and in allowing Member States to borrow the resources necessary for stimulus packages at the bottom of the cycle .
They do not see any need to create the tools required for economic governance , which is essential in order to strengthen the Union .
Perhaps I am being too demanding , though .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Commission , and of President Barroso , I should like to make a few comments about the 2020 strategy and echo the very interesting reports from Mr Grech and Mr Hoang Ngoc ; next , my colleagues and friends , Commissioners Hahn and Andor , will speak in turn - in this debate in which we are participating - on the other oral questions which affect other sectors : cohesion , employment , the social dimension , research and development .
We must also utilise every single resource to free up the growth potential of our economy .
Europe 2020 also means adopting reforms to be implemented within the Member States themselves .
It clearly explains that the Stability and Growth Pact criteria do need to be applied , but that if they are applied solely to expenditure , through cuts in expenditure , this will almost certainly lead to a recession .
Secondly , EU expenditure can now be financed by borrowing and , in particular , when the stabilisation and support funds are created .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to highlight the value of this report in opening up the debate , within our Parliament , on the position and role of universities in Europe .
In many EU countries , there is a growing lack of understanding among those in the university world .
What was important , for us , was to make it understood that there are strategic issues at stake here for Europe .
We must not sacrifice the long term to the short term .
Secondly , we have not , of course , ignored the conflicts which exist either in Cyprus or in the Sahara or , of course , in the Palestinian territories .
