Added value therefore comes from the joint efforts of the three institutions of the European Union – the Commission , Parliament and the Council .
It is quite clear that the more united these efforts are , the greater the political force that our actions will have and the more they will be a tangible demonstration to large criminal organisations that Europe really is united around this objective .
Mr Catania mentioned that under Italian law – and under Irish law , too – assets that organised crime used for evil purposes should be used to do good .
In January this year the Commission issued a Green Paper aimed at stimulating a transparent public debate throughout Europe , which has involved all the public and private players .
In this connection I shall say it again : Parliament , the Council and the Commission must cooperate with each other .
National competences , of course , remain unaffected .
These are the European Commission ’s major lines of action .
Do we want them to remain illegal or do we want to regularise their situations and incorporate them into a healthy labour market ?
I therefore agree with the Commission – and Mr Barrot has explained it very well – about adopting measures such as the European coordinator , so as to encourage institutional cooperation at all levels .
In this respect I shall accept Amendment 46 by Mr Costa , the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , although I must point out that the text in Italian has not been translated correctly .
I therefore fully agree with the content of the report : the TEN projects bring people closer together , reduce distances and inequalities , and eliminate borders .
Secondly , do the decisions – or rather ‘codecisions ’ – that we make actually correspond to our citizens ’ priorities , and is it really our job to fund these priorities or would it be fairer if they were funded out of national or regional budgets ?
The time has come to take the bull by the horns .
This policy needs to be made at European level because that is the only level at which it can be effective in terms of costs , procedure rationalisation and standardisation , resource sharing , objective setting and exchange of good practice .
Increasing investment at European level can surely help to improve this situation .
We have made some specific choices by increasing the amounts for youth-oriented programmes .
The Community budget , roughly amounting to a mere EUR 5 billion , is now expected to cover reconstruction in Iraq , reconstruction in Afghanistan , the tsunami emergency , humanitarian aid , strengthening democracy , protecting human rights in crisis regions , fighting poverty and destitution , cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean and the Balkans , and dozens and dozens of other major initiatives .
On top of that , it has just been announced – and rightly so – that we need to increase our aid for the reconstruction of Pakistan in the post-earthquake emergency there .
Representatives of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , that is our position .
We often say that there is bound to be a terrible tug-of-war between Parliament and the Council between first and second reading .
These challenges , from cohesion to competitiveness to external actions , can only be faced by the Union if it has sufficient financial means to do so .
Lastly , we call on the Council for greater clarity when mentioning the use of funds for the European Union special representatives .
For immigration to be a source of prosperity and development , rather than instability , there have to be stringent procedures and criteria .
Conversely , you still do not want to discuss the common energy policy , which is already contained in the Constitution , although its only use now seems to be to revive the old nuclear debate .
That would help us to achieve a real synergy between the strategic economic benefits and the environmental challenges posed by globalisation .
In addition , too little was said about the new European social model , particularly on the eve of a Summit that is supposed to be dealing precisely with that .
All that has a negative effect not only on health , pensions and public finances , but also on the prospects of growth in Europe , because we are losing dynamism .
Much must be done to create balanced growth , including the need to review – and I agree with Mr Blair here – our energy choices , and to devise financial and project instruments .
Naturally , the whole electoral process had its awkward moments , which , moreover , we had already anticipated in the preliminary statement , but there were also moments of concern , for example the arrest of Mohaqui Nasab – a journalist who edits a weekly publication on women’s rights – which was declared illegal even by the representative of the Media Commission of the Afghan authorities .
In my opinion , though , it possesses the human resources to look to the future .
I am truly convinced that the changes underway in Afghanistan are concrete , effective and real .
The role , however , carried out by the US forces is unhelpful to conflict resolution , reconciliation , and the development of Afghanistan .
On the eve of such an event , a certain nervousness is understandable .
I do not , however , consider the attitude the present government has shown up to now to be justifiable .
The international geopolitical landscape of today’s Mediterranean has certainly changed , and the ambitious project of the Barcelona Process must therefore be modified and adapted to this new international context if the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is to meet the current challenges .
One final point
