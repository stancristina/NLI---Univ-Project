impossible to make up the lost ground .
Energy is a particularly important topic at this time , as I feel that Europe must increasingly make itself heard on matters of energy .
The citizens need clearer legislation in order to be protected against such dangers as misleading advertising .
In fact , these matters are of close relevance to all of our lives , and this is why Parliament ' s role is absolutely crucial .
President Prodi , allow me to express my apprehension and alarm at the line taken in the Work Programme for 2000 , a year which you described as a decisive year , and not only because of the lack of genuinely innovative proposals contained therein .
Mr President , the report you have presented is ambitious and complex , and I will only touch on a few points .
Three : the preparatory documents .
The " short speeches " technique adopted by Parliament means that we have to view all our speeches as part of the same debate as the speeches made yesterday and last month , and I would stress that , whereas last month we laid down the general guidelines , this time our debate has been detailed , for an annual legislative programme must be detailed .
Many of you have rightly expressed the opinion that tourism is a subject which is missing , which , as has been said , is a larger employer than agriculture .
On the subject of agriculture , we cannot relinquish existing resources , which are considered to be vital for the basic subsistence of certain agricultural areas , but , on the other hand , we have foreign policy commitments , such as Kosovo and others , and there are therefore imbalances in our budget .
It is for this reason that I have continued to push for a White Paper on governability .
In February , we presented an annual report on the actions carried out in 1999 , which we would like to expand .
I feel that this is an extremely important strategy .
To return to the subject of enlargement , the Commission has taken a firm position , which is audacious but also resolute and responsible , for the objections raised are of two kinds : on the one hand , there is the desire to bring about enlargement immediately , which is a desire we share , but , on the other , there is the urgent need to specify clearly the implications of enlargement and the means by which it is to be brought about .
What is there to fear in a Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
The European Union is a civil , legal area of freedom , which is not just economic freedom but also freedom of security and justice , in a huge territory which , in the past , has been the site of repeated bloodshed .
I am referring to it as a vessel because it is obviously still only a framework .
In our opinion , however , we should be moving towards a Europe of peoples , peoples whose identity is not necessarily defined according to the present form of the Member States .
We feel that the Intergovernmental Conference is our opportunity to resolve this question , and this opportunity must not be passed up .
And yet I feel that this is the right way for us to go and that it does not in any way mean promoting that concept we all fear of a European superstate .
The working masses fought , and achieved and consolidated positive results which protected their rights , and which , at the same time , played a decisive role in the development of democracy .
It is a bitter surprise to find that there is no specific , explicit reference in this document to those social rights which are , in actual fact , the most important part of the immense democratic process which became established in Europe during the course of the century .
Question No 63 by (H-0164/00 ) : Subject : Verona-Munich railway link The project for a new Verona-Munich through railway line has been under discussion for years .
Has the Commission studied the potential environmental impact of the various projects for a Verona-Munich rail link ?
Mr President , a European delegation returning from Chechnya a few days ago reported terrible sights .
Either the European Union will be an area where rights are upheld or it will not exist at all .
I also believe that there should be greater focus on the right to privacy - and this is the subject of an amendment which we are going to table in tomorrow ' s plenary sitting .
However , it appears that we are not always completely sure which rights we are talking about and that we are introducing or we want to introduce rights which are not provided for in the Conventions or the international Treaties .
Ill-treated , ragged children are often to be seen on the streets , and this is a conscious situation calculated to arouse the pity of passers-by and to induce them to give them some money .
When we hold a debate on Austria , when we draw up a document on the Austrian situation - if Parliament judges it appropriate so to do - then we might even be able to give Baroness Ludford the task of drawing up a document which we will debate together .
This seems to me to be indicative of a cultural attitude which encourages xenophobia , for it encourages fear of globalisation , which prompts many local communities to become inward-looking and refuse dialogue , dialogue which takes identity into account .
And do we really think that the Constitutions of all of our nations are racist because their criteria are different from those espoused by Baroness Ludford
