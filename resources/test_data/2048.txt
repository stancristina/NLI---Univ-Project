to be kept informed .
We welcome this contribution .
That is why we welcome the work of the rapporteur , who succeeded in bringing together some often divergent interests .
We should try to analyse when a new approach directive can be used vis-Ã -vis old approach directives .
To give a practical example of this , in terms of energy and transport , it is not sufficient to say that liberalisation will enable us to lower prices , and , consequently , consumers and businesses will have greater access .
I hope that they will be taken into consideration in the Commission ' s next reports , particularly with regard to integration , sustainable development and the knowledge-based society .
In this respect , it is disturbing that the Council and Commission do not evaluate the social and economic impact of the large , integrated financial market or that of the launch of the euro .
Once again , I refused to approve the draft directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms , as it stands following the work of the Conciliation Committee of the Council and the European Parliament .
We have absolutely no trust in the agri-foodstuffs corporations , who are motivated solely by research and optimising profits , even at the expense of consumers ' health and the environment .
During the conciliation procedure , the European Parliament did , however , insist on clear labelling and traceability rules for GMOs , which are essential for consumers who can only take a decision about whether to buy products containing GMOs if these products are properly labelled .
I believe that it provides Parliament and the Council with a good starting point for resolving this difficult problem .
That is another reason why citizens should continue their battle for a European Union that is not just an economic , financial , cold and heartless monster .
Furthermore , I approve the attempts to establish a European basis for food supplements , given the differences in relevant national provisions .
On the other hand , we do not agree with Mr Lange , as we do not really know if he is doing this to drum up popularity or if he was hired by our competitors to discredit European manufacturers .
The objective is to promote cooperation between Member States and support their action in the area of employment .
I therefore abstained .
The best way for the European Union to force the Turkish Government to meet its commitments , a method which is lacking in hypocrisy and which does not allow a pretext for further liberal pressure , which only in any case serve the interests of free trade in Europe , would be to support the democratic opposition .
Moreover , Europe has signed up to the Kyoto Agreement which requires it to reduce its production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 8 % on average by the year 2010 .
I shall , if I may , deal with both these recommendations and the questions put by the honourable Members in the following order : first , the bank ' s operational priorities , followed by evaluation methods and , finally , external monitoring and the policy of transparency .
The initial reports were , of course , fairly critical .
Finally , with regard to the policy of transparency , we are willing to sign up to the guidelines set out in recommendation 11 .
Thus , the prospects offered in the medium term by the generalised use within Europe of new 'smart card ' type identity papers lead to a redefinition and readjustment of universal service , polarised on two vectors of change : a service level agreement and a rich content .
At the time , our question was also , of course , related to the preparations for the Nice Summit , since we hoped that decisions in favour of social policy and freedom of movement would be taken .
But if you will permit me to express this legal dispute in readily accessible terms , what is the Council after in opposing this legal base ?
The issue of freedom of movement is , as we are well aware , one of the sensitive aspects of the accession negotiations .
The need to adapt Mexico ' s constitution to bring it into line with this agreement in particular is questionable to say the least .
Some of these have been living in Europe for over twenty years .
Europol currently estimates that 500 000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union every year .
However , at that very time , at the beginning of 2004 we are due to have an intergovernmental conference that will specifically have to look into the distribution of competences between the European Union and the Member States .
Research on Internet costs could have made it possible to reduce them and finally make the Internet more democratic .
I believe it is an essential element and one that must form the basis of the ideas and proposals in the Sixth Framework Programme .
We want national programmes to be more accessible at European level .
I want to tell her that I personally will be more generous than she was when we collectively draft the Sixth Framework Research Programme .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I too want to join in the thanks to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her excellent report .
On the question of open coordination , I agree that our role still needs to be defined and the criteria need to be more clearly adjusted .
So it is in that spirit that we will need to define the new instruments more precisely .
We can only make proposals on the participation of the Union if we have real participation by the Member States .
How should we define it ?
