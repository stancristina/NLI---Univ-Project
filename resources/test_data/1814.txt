Schengen Agreement or what was Europol , for example , or any other aspect of the work which is currently part of the Third Pillar ?
My question is : Would it not be more sensible to wait until the existing agreements have been discussed in the respective Parliaments of Sweden , Norway and Iceland ?
There could be great confusion if the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into EU law before these agreements have been ratified by the respective parliaments .
I am pleased that you have not adopted a definitive position on the issue of the nickel content of coins .
Swedish one crown pieces contain a maximum of 25 percent nickel .
I am referring to the fact that government discussions are underway , and six months after they are concluded , we must commence membership negotiations with the Baltic States .
If this happens then I do not believe there is any cause for concern in the Baltics or in this House .
We must use both these methods .
I have two questions one concerned with this issue and another concerning the response given to Mr StewartClark .
That is all I wish to say about the Mosiek-Urbahn report .
In Scandinavia we currently have an over supply of capital which has definitely improved the position of our people .
Caccavale 's report also shows quite clearly the problems which face us if we wish to standardise regulations for the capital market .
This will be necessary if we really want common rules for both bankruptcy and for credit .
I also welcome point 9 of the proposal which concerns stricter regulations governing advertising .
For this reason I hope that the group 's common proposal will be accepted .
I support the proposals that have been presented .
I welcome the work by Mrs Lindholm to get EU institutions to take European Parliament resolutions seriously , resolutions where we speak in favour of equality and non discrimination , resolutions which have been repeated many times here in the House and accepted with considerable agreement .
I hope now that , not only the majority of members will vote for these amendment proposals , but all members will do so , even if the discussions in committee may suggest the opposite .
Mr President , time passes quickly , January 1 , when the free market for telecommunications services will be introduced , is fast approaching .
The market then needs to be supervised by us as elected representatives .
The most important areas to regulate are consumer safety and protection and the right for everyone in the information society to benefit from new technology .
All suppliers must be obliged to provide finance for public services .
Madam President , unfortunately we cannot totally prevent some of our citizens from committing crimes , even such serious crimes as murder .
Madam President , the European Parliament has also reason to be confident that all Member governments will be reminded of Parliament 's wishes in this resolution during the meeting with the UN Commission on Human Rights , and that they will demand a universal , all country , moratorium on execution .
At best , the events in China last night may herald a new era in the country .
Many Chinese believe that we , here in the European Parliament are pursuing a particular campaign against China .
It is therefore a campaign for human rights directed at all those who do not respect them .
Human rights are not a particular European invention .
As the leader of the Chinese Delegation I have , of course , sent a diplomatic message of regret at the passing of Mr Deng , as the death of any person is a loss for someone .
Mr President , The Iranian author Faraj Sarkouhi has been viciously attacked by the authorities in Iran .
We in Parliament find it difficult to see that this has led to any positive concrete results .
Likewise , the UN representative for Human Rights often speaks about the need for time to resolve the problems in the former Yugoslavia .
I believe that the resolution under consideration today and our continuing discussions are primarily a means of expressing Parliament 's desire to press on in its quest for further action concerning the former Yugoslavia .
Mr President , I find the report submitted by Mrs Van Lancker to be very interesting in every respect , especially as she ventures to highlight the serious problems arising from the Schengen Agreement .
For us in the Nordic countries who are opposed to membership of the Schengen Agreement this is an important argument .
The report emphasises how well this Union operates .
In addition , should the Schengen Agreement become supranational , a constitutional amendment would be required in Norway , for which at the present time there is not a sufficient majority .
Mr President , mobility is exactly what the Schengen Agreement is about , something which ought to be of general interest to the majority in this assembly .
That is why compensatory measures are required .
Following the difficulties at the committee stage , Rapporteur Van Lancker has shown a willingness to negotiate .
This would also increase the level of control for the people .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for an excellent report .
As mentioned by the rapporteur , a basic education is not enough .
Today and in the future class differences will depend much more on whether you possess knowledge or not .
Naturally prospects vary , but the objective of education is that it should be tailored to individual needs .
I say yes to a second chance , but not in a segregated system .
They should be able to participate to the greatest possible extent in mainstream education .
