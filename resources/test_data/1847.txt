reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union , the participation of all the main countries , such as the United States , the development of a strategic partnership with developing countries of crucial importance , vigorously promoting research and innovation and improving energy efficiency in the European Union .
I agree with and support this approach ; the initiatives taken by the Commission this year in the field of climate change mostly go hand in hand with Parliament 's proposal .
We address a series of new issues , such as aviation , and we also turn our attention to new technologies , such as carbon capture , which offer opportunities for taking financially efficient measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
The first of these working parties is expected to start submitting its final reports during the first half of next year .
The Communication arrives at the conclusion that , in order to reduce these emissions , the best way is to integrate the aviation sector into the Community emissions trading scheme .
Climate change and , in particular , its connections with energy and the secure supply of energy , are included in the priorities of our bilateral and multilateral contacts .
The main objective of the EU-China partnership is to develop advanced , almost zero-emission , carbon technology based on carbon capture and storage in biological formations .
The UN Climate Change Conference will start in Montreal in Canada at the end of the month and will last two weeks .
Firstly , the conference will mark the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol , with the adoption of the rules and procedures required for its application .
A small number of countries , headed by the United States , continue to be unwilling to participate in the dialogue on the future global strategy relating to climate change .
Through this dialogue , we need to find the solutions that will respond to the basic elements of the future climate strategy , as determined in the Commission 's communication earlier this year .
The motion for a resolution sends out a clear message that , in meeting this challenge , the Commission can always count on the support of the European Parliament .     – Mr President , I wanted us to talk about a very serious issue .
You are labouring in vain in your efforts , Mr Dimas , if you do not bring the Americans into the rules .
We also need to see what is going to be done by China , as the most highly populated country in the world which alone has one quarter of the world 's population .
So we need to convince the Americans if we want to avoid disastrous results .
The course which is being traced with mathematical precision is that we shall suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs .
Unfortunately , while the idea of convening the Council was not a bad idea , it suffered most in the execution .
I wonder , four and a half months later , how Mr Blair is translating these words into practice .
The British Presidency had the opportunity to write history at Hampton Court .
This proposal is dictated by the obligation for the European Community to give international commitments to Canada , Russia and the United States .
The scope of the proposed directive is truly restricted .
Furthermore , the draft directive adds to and does not subtract from existing standards on the basis of current Community legislation .
To close , I should like to stress that I shall take account of Parliament 's opinion and I shall evaluate the positions formulated both in Parliament and in the Council .
Finally , I should like to express my wish to maintain good cooperation with you in the future .     .
The proposal for a directive being debated would have filled a legal gap , given that , if we exclude the 1991 Council regulation , there is no other legislation on trapping standards at European Union level and , at national level , the existing legal framework is very restricted .
This is the historic truth that the motions for resolutions by the European Parliament try to conceal .
Napalm bombs were used for the first time in Grammo against the Greek Democratic Army and in Vietnam by the USA .
The motions for resolutions by the European Parliament not only fail to refer to any of this , they shift the responsibility to smaller states and individual sides , often with libellous accusations , in order to create pretexts for new interventions and wars and to safeguard their sovereignty .     , . – The statements by the President of Iran that ' Israel must be wiped off the map ' must be condemned .
The reasons why they hastened to issue condemnatory votes are part of their more general plans in the Middle East .
At the same time , they are using the statements as a pretext for accusing Iran of supporting 'international terrorism' , thereby defending the US policy which is threatening Iran and Syria with military intervention .
Her report reflects reality and lays down the prospects of the development strategy for Africa .
It does not concern us only in the sense of increasing aid to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015 .
Thirdly , in establishing effective coordination of humanitarian aid between the Member States and the Commission and between the Union 's bilateral policies and its development policy .
' One Africa ' is the responsibility of Africa itself , 'one Europe ' is the responsibility of Europe and 'one objective ' is our common objective .
These are issues which certainly need to be addressed by the international community because , not only is the situation not improving , it is getting constantly worse
