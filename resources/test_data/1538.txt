In respect of the fisheries budget , I note that an increase of over 27 % is proposed in the funding of international agreements .
These are the southern agreements with third countries which enable EU vessels to fish in the waters of Morocco , Mauritania , Argentina and elsewhere .
I must remind the House that these agreements currently cost EU taxpayers EUR 269 million a year and are primarily of benefit to the fishing fleets of Spain , Portugal and France .
These southern agreements are always calculated on a cash-for-fish basis while northern agreements on the other hand are arranged on a reciprocal basis .
It is this disparity between southern and northern Member States which is evident in the CAP as well as in the CFP budget .
For example , the Commission recently announced an arbitrary cut in export refunds which will cost the Scotch whisky industry around EUR 32 million a year .
Their explanation was simply that Scotch whisky is a rich industry and therefore does not require any subsidy .
Why then do we discover that it is intended to increase the subsidy to wine growers by 64.5 % next year , taking the budget to over EUR 1 billion ?
Why is the olive oil industry receiving an 8.9 % increase providing them with almost EUR 2.5 billion next year , and most shockingly of all , how on earth can we justify giving to tobacco growers an increase of 2.8 % taking their subsidies to over EUR 1 billion when we know that tobacco products kill half a million of our citizens every year .
Meanwhile , the beleaguered dairy sector with dairy farmers suffering across the EU will receive a paltry increase of funding of only 0.3 % .
Let us make sure the budget is for all EU citizens and not just for the southern EU Member States .
Thank you , Minister , for your first response during your presidency .
I am especially pleased that we are able to see Mr Richard here .
It is extremely important that the growth of our European security and defence policy commands full public support and respect , and strong and credible parliamentary scrutiny is certainly the way forward .
I am very pleased to see the President-in-Office here , as a former Member of Parliament .
Will he , in the Nice Treaty or in the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Nice at the end of the year , propose codecision between Parliament and the Council on matters of common foreign and security policy ?
This is to be the lower House , as the President of the Republic told us this morning and if we are to carry public opinion with us in security and defence matters we need a proper position .
So does he agree that codecision is the way forward in this policy area ?
Question No 3 by (H-0525/00 ) : Subject : Digital radio Does the Council agree that a political endorsement of digital radio , similar to that given to mobile telephone technology and digital television , could help to enhance confidence in the future of radio ?
Mr President , I am disappointed with that response .
The European Parliament held a hearing just a few weeks ago with representatives from the Minister 's country as well as from my own .
The point was made very strongly there by representatives of the radio industry that digital radio is one sector of media communication that is not developing as quickly and as effectively as it might do , and the feeling was that political backing was lacking .
I would like to think that the Council , were they to receive a proposal from the Commission , would behave emphatically in support of digital radio .
A problem has also arisen that various elements of the digital radio spectrum are now being allocated across Europe often quite freely , at no charge at all .
Yet that same spectrum would , of course , be very profitable if were used for telephone communications .
I wonder if can we be assured that the Council of Ministers will look very carefully at this and be sure that it does not pose any threat to the development of digital radio in Europe .
Mr President , I welcomed the Minister 's reply but I would like him to give an assurance to this House that he and the Council will not lose sight in their consideration of this problem of the 604 Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal occupation of Kuwait by Iraq and that they will keep pressing the Iraqi authorities for an explanation of the fate of these people .
Mr President , I should like to express my concern that nobody in the French presidency can read any of the European languages apart from French .
Also on this point , will the presidency confirm that under the Treaty it is the Fourteen - minus the country concerned - which would make a recommendation to suspend Austria from membership , should that be necessary ?
I am not arguing that it is necessary , but should it be necessary , could we not expect a view from the presidency over whether this particular case actually causes it some concern ?
Is it not right and proper that the same person should not be judge , jury and executioner and that the person making the accusation should not also be the minister of justice at the same time ?
Would one not criticise this kind of situation in , let us say , Zimbabwe or some other part of the world , if it arose there ?
Mr President , I asked the President-in-Office to answer my question whether Article 7 of the
