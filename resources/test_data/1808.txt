to be brief .
ECU 1 million has already been sent but it is obvious that more will have to be sent since the estimated needs are far greater than that .
In response to one Member , I should also say that , as part of Agenda 2000 , the Commission is still proposing forest protection and reforestation measures .
In addition to policing compliance , the stability of the sector must be guaranteed by introducing social and financial measures to compensate for the reduction in fishing , the current status quo must be maintained regarding access to stocks and greater transparency and fairness must be introduced into the system as regards landing , import , first point of sale , transportation and marketing of fish .
We must therefore give further consideration to monitoring measures , with a view to making them transparent , effective and fair , without forgetting that we must simultaneously implement other practical measures to guarantee the stability of the sector and the income of those who work in it .
In 1995 , Gabon approached the European Union , as did Madagascar , about concluding an agreement on tuna .
Allow me here to add , as a comment of my own , that frequently these programmes do not work because the European Union does not always have the courage to draw up reports which carefully and accurately reflect what is happening on the ground or , in this case , in the sea .
We agree overall with the rapporteur 's assessment and proposals .
The lack of funding and absence of equal treatment between vessels of different origin could give rise to suspicion and cause the regulation to be less efficiently and transparently implemented than is desirable and possible .
The three regulations in question relate to the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank , the power to impose sanctions and the statistical information to be provided by the Member States .
The 10 % level proposed by the ECB , on which interest is payable and including electronic money which is increasingly widely used , and the broader scope of its application merit our approval , as do the remaining proposals .
This explains the precautions contained in this regulation and all the provisions that it includes .
Mr President , these three reports on the European Central Bank obviously emanate from the need to regulate the activities of the new institution .
We do not question the need for reliable and timely statistical information , but the power to impose sanctions , particularly in connection with statistical information , could create a series of obligations and pressures whereby the ECB acquires new and more broad-ranging power without the necessary political and democratic constraints and limitations .
Indeed , the Commission itself concludes in its report that the overall assessment is clearly positive .
The expectations generated by the euro are prompting companies to publicise their choice as a sign of efficiency and modernity , as is occurring for instance in my country .
Police and judicial resources may be increased ; Legislation may be harmonised ; People may have illusions about the liberalisation of consumption ; Any number of conventions may be signed ; Money laundering may be more heavily sanctioned ; Drug plantations may be bombed ; Armies may be mobilised ; All this may be done !
Who is more familiar with the tragic dimension of the problems caused by drug addiction than family and neighbours ?
They have no interest in a low-income clientele of drug addicts who spend their money on drugs and merely parade the effects of their addiction .
The series of recommendations contained in the d'Ancona report certainly demonstrate a very positive endeavour to seek consensus on the issue of combating drugs .
No explicit mention whatsoever is made of tax have ns ; no explicit mention is made of financial have ns ; no mention is made of the need to consider , therefore , the possibility of lifting banking secrecy ; nothing is said about the ramifications of the euro in facilitating money laundering .
Police clampdowns are just a marginal aspect in comparison to the main issue and , have hitherto served merely as an 'aspirin' which relieves the problem but does not solve it .
On a number of previous occasions , Portugal has pioneered new legislation , having been the first to abolish capital punishment and , more recently , with its 'family laws ' .
But I also know that fraud and corruption are combated both upstream and downstream of where they occur .
We also know that today , in ' Le Monde ' , UCLAF said that the control carried out was of a metaphysical nature .
We all know that although the Committee on Budgetary Control has issued this report , the Committee on Budgets vetoed it and voted against the purchase of scanners which would make it possible to take preventive action against fraud in European ports .
It is up to the Commission to make people aware of this , it is up to the Commission not to condone , by its silence , what is happening in the Member States .
Neither the minimum necessary resources nor the basic conditions exist to combat fraud and corruption which , for their part , certainly do exist and are proliferating .
The ECHO case and the dubious manner , to say the least , in which it has been dealt with by the Commission , particularly in its relations with Parliament , have guided us to this inevitable conclusion and we therefore welcome the proposal to turn UCLAF into an independent body .
Mr President , allow me to begin by saying that this report is far more than just my own .
There are two factors that have had a particularly marked effect on the discharge procedure for 1996
