It is ourselves in the Commission , the Council and Parliament who must lay down the legislative frameworks , and not the scientific committees .
The effects of artificially produced chemicals that are discharged into the environment are clear .
One of the more unpleasant examples of this is sexual abnormalities observed in bears in the Antarctic .
The research results presented by Professor Skakkebæk of Denmark concerning the marked reduction in male sperm quality should also give rise to deep concern .
As Torben Lund so rightly stated , the precautionary principle should therefore be put at the top of the agenda .
With reference to the precautionary principle , we shall be able to introduce urgent measures with a view to avoiding possible irreversible damage to humans , animals and plants .
It is appropriate now to put practice before fine words concerning the protection of health and the environment and to make use of the principle in an area about which we still know very little .
It is the only answer to give to a concerned public .
Could we not give him a program for his computer so that he does not have to write it out every time ?
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) Report ( A5-0251/2000 ) by Mrs Rühle , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the draft ECSC operating budget for 2001 [COM ( 2000 ) 360 - C5-0340/2000 - 2000/2060(BUD) ] ( Parliament adopted the resolution) Report ( A5-0236/2000 ) by Mr Colom i Naval , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the Interinstitutional Agreement on financial statements ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) President .
I also congratulate the Chairmen of the Committees and everyone else who has actively contributed to this excellent result .
The Left party supports the idea that the work in progress for a new statute for Members should lead as quickly as possible to a solution in which refunds of travel expenses also reflect the actual costs .
The Danish Social Democrats have voted against a report that would remove the subsidies paid to the producers of processed fruit and vegetables .
Instead , we support the Commission ' s proposal that would rescind onerous administrative procedures and make the schemes simpler and more flexible .
It has proposed a minor restriction on the great 'help yourself ' buffet table that the scheme has been to date .
The agreements with third countries have very great significance for the European Union and especially for those regions with large fishing harbours .
I am thinking also of the many subsidiary businesses and service trades which are wholly or partially dependent upon fisheries .
Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party therefore support the fact that the EU' s fisheries policy embraces these many agreements with third countries .
They have been under way since the agreement expired on 30 November 1999 , and the European Union has paid compensation to the Spanish and Portuguese ship owners and fishermen .
Commissioner Fischler has stated that this monologue cannot continue .
I very much agree with the Commissioner about this .
Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party are in favour of as big an effort as possible now being made to bring the long-winded negotiation procedure to a conclusion .
We nonetheless propose an amendment to the paragraph concerning the arrangements designed to mitigate the effects of a failure to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco .
In reality , however , it is not all as simple as that .
This Assembly should give priority to establishing genuine and effective instruments for combating money laundering and professionally organised crime .
It stands to reason that , through cooperation between the countries , crime and money laundering could be better combated .
Why , then , is the Commission ' s new system thought to be needed ?
In my view , it is not clear in which areas efforts are to be concentrated , except for the fact that countries are to have a uniform method of protecting data imposed upon them .
Parliament ought not to frustrate the Council of Ministers ' initiatives and the initiatives from those countries which are most inclined to stop these crimes .
The trend should be towards establishing uniform definitions of criminal acts , and the countries ' police and judicial systems ought to cooperate .
Mr President , I shall side with the small number of dissidents in warning against the ideas , plans and projects in this stream of reports on legal policy which are up for debate today , including Mrs Gebhardt ' s report .
It is , as the report says very precisely , " a forerunner of a future European public prosecution service designed to strengthen the European Union ' s judicial dimension in relation to criminal law " , and reference is made to the drafting of EU criminal law with attendant institutions , police service , prosecution service , administration of justice , etc . which , for example , were adopted in connection with Mr Wiebenga' s report in 1999 .
Systems of criminal law are , of course , among the clearest cultural expressions of a society .
There are fifteen of them .
By incorporating - or institutionalising - these projects into the European Union ' s various bureaucracies , an élite and non-transparent system arises which is , on many points , in conflict with elementary ideals relating to democracy and legal rights .
The second point is also interesting , of course .
Interestingly enough , the heading reads : " The establishment of Eurojust as a means of upholding the rule of law . "
Has the EU become a State ?
For both these reasons , my own group cannot be
