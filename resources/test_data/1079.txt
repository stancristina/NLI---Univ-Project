budget .
This is an excellent idea .
On the other hand , it is true that nuclear safety has so far accounted for a full 13 % of TACIS appropriations .
TACIS has achieved good results in this area .
Communication delays can thus be avoided , and steps can swiftly be taken to put things right in the event of something unexpected happening .
Mr President , this matter clearly illustrates the sort of problems any future common foreign and security policy might cause for the smaller nations .
The decision was the right one .
This has led to money for the purpose having to be taken out of the TACIS aid programme , which was not originally meant for the construction of a shelter at Chernobyl .
That is why the demands of Mr Adam and the Committee on Budgets are justified .
We still lack half the money we need .
If the G7 and the EU stop paying out , where is the other half supposed to come from ?
From the Ukrainian point of view , they need energy there just like everyone else .
If Chernobyl closes down these new plants will go into production , or else the Ukraine will have to be given a massive amount of energy aid .
As Mr Adam says , Ukraine in any case sees the agreement and the new power stations as being part and parcel of the same thing .
If the Chernobyl plant is to be shut down and we give aid accordingly , we are reluctantly moving in the direction of support for nuclear power in Ukraine .
The threat of a nuclear accident is a good example of a danger that lurks outside the borders of the EU but nevertheless threatens EU Member States , which would remain defenceless against it .
The closing down of the plant at Chernobyl is part of the renewal process for the whole of Ukraine 's energy sector .
I also agree with Mr Adam that the Commission should provide resources only after the other parties to the agreement have used up their share .
Mr Sepp√§nen 's remarks on what money has been spent and whether there will be enough for the future are futile .
The funding situation will most certainly be due for review after 2005 , and I think we must share in the responsibility considering the safety risk involved for our countries .
An instance of this is provided by the Helms-Burton and D'Amato-Kennedy acts , by means of which the USA has enacted political laws .
We politicians in Europe must make political decisions and laws : that is our job .
US companies and multinationals want freedom of competition based only on making a profit , with little in the way of social and ecological responsibility .
Competition can harm or kill , so politicians must take responsibility generally and protect people and the environment .
The rules can be clarified in the form of the Agreement now being prepared , and it would be wise to approve it .
We have never supported that and we are happy to see that the euro is starting off on a very broad base .
There will certainly be problems , but we also recognize the opportunities that a single currency will provide .
We want Europe to grow , socially and ecologically , and we would like to see the euro used to enhance monetary stability on a global scale .
It appears that the extreme neo-liberalist economic ideas have become somewhat mollified , and this brings with it the hope that we really can create a social Europe .
We cannot accept that new demands are suddenly to be made on countries adopting the euro .
We do not think these are the sort of signals we should be sending out .
Another problem is that the report fails to mention the fact that economic development can happen on quite different time scales among the various regions of the Union .
Shock waves occur from time to time that put Member States in difficult situations .
And finally , monetary policy can in no way be entirely separated from economic policy .
Mr President , I share in the joy expressed here that Economic and Monetary Union will now be created on an extremely large scale , but there are three issues I would like to mention that are necessary for EMU to be a success .
The guidelines from the Luxembourg Employment Summit cannot be allowed just to stew : they must be put into action .
We have to be flexible on this point .
But I would like to express my concern regarding the talks over what sort of new conditions are going to be imposed in respect of the Stability and Growth Pact .
A common single currency will strengthen our position in the world , economically and politically .
The Bank will be independent , and no one will be able to dismiss its management , no matter what mistakes it makes .
It is absolutely vital that common European solutions are applied to any country in economic difficulties .
Hopefully , it will aid the struggle for a worldwide economy based on social fairness .
It is not enough for markets to have confidence in the euro : our nations must share that confidence , and that will come about by seeing to the needs of our citizens .
Mr von Wogau does , however , deserve to be praised for the optimism he expresses in his report regarding employment .
Mr President , the Commission 's annual report states that a long-term economic revival has begun .
Although the Commission 's annual report ignores the difficulties the crisis in Asia is causing for the European economy , the Commission has succeeded in compiling a very competent and comprehensive document
