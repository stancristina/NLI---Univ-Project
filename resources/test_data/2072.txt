First it was the economy , but that is doing rather better now .
Her lawyers were afraid for their own lives .
I have a rather different opinion on this subject .
Here too , we should see to it that , via our own channels , we do more to fight it than is already being done by the United Nations and UNICEF.
Instead , we should seek to persuade these two countries to overcome their reservations and join the other 13 countries - and this is something that I would welcome very much - in signing the Brussels declaration .
We often adopt solidarity resolutions , but we should remember that we have an obligation , in the first place , to European countries , which share our culture and history , particularly when those countries have suffered so much in recent decades .
The question was , whether the Commission would be willing to use INTERREG 2c as one fund in future , and not to let it carry on as two separate funds , INTERREG and PHARE , so as to make it easier for joint projects to be funded .
If we examine the problems as a whole , we can see that a large number of organizational , financial and personnel measures are necessary , the significance of which , in terms of the practical functioning of the social dialogue and the increasing of its effectiveness at almost all levels , must certainly not be underestimated .
I therefore invite the Council and the Commission to enter into negotiations with Parliament regarding the conclusion of an inter-institutional agreement , so that the damage can be swiftly undone .
That is the background to our demand for a separate vote on Point 16 of the Peter report , and that is why we want the section that suggests that there will be a delay to be deleted .
This is particularly important when the European Union wants to implement Community measures at national level as well .
The social partners must open up .
However , not every project that is supported by EU funds can be inspected by the Commission staff .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I can be fairly brief .
Nevertheless , I have to say that the Council must keep to the rules .
Where we do have surpluses , these are the result of imports of feed from overseas .
I would ask my group to abstain today , so that we can talk that over first .
It is estimated that world alpha acid production in 1996 was about 9000 tonnes , compared with the brewing industry 's annual requirements of some 8000 tonnes .
If there really are oligopolistic market structures , then so be it .
Mr President , today 's debate is linked almost seamlessly with Agenda 2000 , and virtually obliges us to pre-empt some of its content .
We very much hope that Poland and others will also have the opportunity to join in very soon .
Not because we wish to refuse Hungary , the Czech Republic and Romania access to the European educational programmes ; certainly not .
Goodness knows , the last-minute compromise is no cause for celebration , but it does enable us to vote in favour , provided that the funding is increased as promised .
And now we are meant to go along with the Council 's fine words and extend the programme , without having the money in our pockets .
Mr President , the employment summit is to take place in Luxembourg in a few months from now , and job creation must of course be its top priority .
By pursuing an austere and consistent budgetary policy , inflation and the budgetary deficit have been reduced .
Ladies and gentlemen - those who have stayed the course - we are behaving as if stand-by aid were real aid .
All three of them are more susceptible to Russian influence than we would like .
The text before you today contains a whole series of points that Parliament had already formulated , but which could not be of implemented , so in this instance the procedure has resulted in total victory for Parliament .
It is simply incomprehensible , therefore , that this authority is not being aggressively developed , but that the Parliament is basically dragging its way through years of conflict , in order to produce a half way acceptable programme .
Indeed , you have all emphasized that yourselves .
I hope that will become ever better understood .
But , at least , it is a beginning .
Is it , indeed , always reasonable for culture to be considered , even when the main concern is for economic aspects ?
One should preferably let culture get on by itself , and one should not try to possess it for oneself .
As for what culture and the maintenance of culture mean for jobs , I have explained this in the preceding report and have no need to repeat it .
We are aware how difficult it has been to obtain agreement in the Council , and we should not wish to endanger this compromise .
The only success one can acknowledge is that the guideline is temporary and thus - I say it quite openly - this puts a certain amount of pressure on Member States to make their postal services competitive and fit for the internal market .
I had wanted to cover a few more things , but time has run away from me .
I think conditions should not be as they are amongst private providers .
I have only accepted this solution because two important amendments were adopted by the Council : the principle of liberalization will be accepted , and a timetable will
