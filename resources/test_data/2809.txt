We must therefore ask ourselves whether the phenomenon can be allowed to continue without jeopardising our European model of agriculture .
In fact , it brings us up to date on agricultural incomes just before the application of CAP reform and the enlargement of the European Union .
What solution is there for farmers trapped between rising production costs and falling prices .
But if we want to maintain the greatest number of farmers on all the territory of the Member States in future , we will no longer be able to have this trilogy of disappearance , concentration and intensiveness .
The fight against those who pollute the sea must be more effective and be accompanied by heavy penalties , with all parties involved in the goods transportation chain having to assume their share of responsibility .
The current imbalance in the CFP , which does not take overall account of the joint objectives of conserving the resource and ensuring the continuity of fisheries , must definitely be corrected .
We were told that the regional workshop organised by the Commission was more like an information session on decisions that had already been taken than a meeting involving genuine consultation prior to any decision .
In your committee’s view , the Northern hake stock should be covered by a multiannual management plan pursuant to Article 6 of the same regulation .
I would remind you that by 2007 the Union’s population will have increased by a third .
Reform is therefore necessary , not to enable us to do everything nor to continue the ‘sprinkling ’ approach that we have adopted so far , but to enable us to meet the expectations of the public .
It should simply provide the added value that comes from coordination , which only requires slim administrations and limited resources .
According to the legislation in force for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund , the Greek authorities have to declare that these plants are operational when they submit each final report marking the end of the subsidy .
The Spanish authorities do not therefore need to wait for the Commission to give its decision before starting these projects , given that beginning the work will in no way prejudice the Commission ’s decision on whether to grant Community financing .
We should actually be aware that this project is complex and that , as is only proper , we need to examine it from the point of view of Community legislation on the environment , from the point of view of the rules and , finally , from the point of view of this rather original analysis that we wish to conduct of the entire project .
Like Mr Vallvé , the Commission believes that cross-border cooperation is a key element to European integration .
It is clear that the cities and the regions , or in France’s case the , have had difficulty in setting up cross-border cooperation programmes , given the differences in legislation that exist between the countries concerned .
Immediately after Christmas and New Year , a number of articles appeared in the French media , mentioning probable dangers .
As politicians we are not armed with scientific knowledge , yet how are we to address a crisis that may have far-reaching socio-economic consequences for entire sectors ?
As recently as the beginning of 2003 , it was Arcelor and the announcement of thousands of job losses .
Immigration is an opportunity for Europe’s future and at a time when racism and xenophobia are swooping down on us we need to say that strongly and forcefully .
That agreement was nevertheless concluded without any prior democratic debate .
It is therefore democracy and the rule of law that are threatened by the conclusion of such agreements .
It would do well , with all associations , European civil society and all parliamentarians who stand up for rights , international conventions and democracy , to really cause that outbreak to happen so that in future all decisions are taken in a spirit of parliamentary co-decision as desired in the draft Constitution .     – Mr President , as it does every year , today’s debate on questions of freedom of movement , security and justice is taking a very legal turn .
We were more consistent when we rejected the Fischler reform , proposing at the ‘rebuilding an agricultural policy in Europe ’ colloquium an agricultural model that was internally less subject to public intervention schemes , which , without export subsidies , was protected from the outside , so that remunerative domestic prices compatible with a sustainable management of nature would be set spontaneously .
We are not , of course , opposed to such a reorientation of agricultural research or to its being financed out of public funds as the rapporteur wishes .
That is why I voted against Amendment No 155 .
I support flexibility , but there must be genuine free choice , and I am not convinced that free choice currently exists .     . – The Cercas report shows what every worker already knows : the employers and the politicians who serve them , who want a workforce that will do their every bidding , want the employers to be able to set working hours as they wish , with no legal limits .
All the interconnections between these different levels are very complex .
Of course I want the barrier to disappear , but unlike some barriers which kill , it is a barrier that saves .
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Finance Minister was very evasive in his reply , saying that if people wanted to commit fraud , it was difficult to stop them , an opinion that I obviously cannot share .
In this regard , I would thank you , Commissioner , for the proposals you are putting forward , for they are a small seed planted on the long road towards regulating
