You always tell us : 'it is important , we must coordinate , I am going to coordinate ... ' .
There are enough of them .
We all know about Europe 's weaknesses : demographics , lack of future expenditure , industrial challenges , government deficit , weak economic governance .
Mr Barroso , do not play the game of saying that those who fail to vote for the Commission are against Europe .
You will have it unconditionally !
How is it acceptable that Parliament cannot give a binding opinion when the Commission changes its way of working ?
Its main task will be to demonstrate each day the added value of the European project to all our fellow European citizens .
Doubts were first instilled in December , during the Copenhagen Summit , where Europe proved itself incapable of speaking with one voice .
I voted against Mr Barroso 's Commission because it fails to meet my requirements in terms of promoting the social reforms that we must have if we are to emerge from the crisis in which we find ourselves .
I was therefore able to observe his sensitive approach to managing the work of the European Commission and the respect he shows for his fellow human beings and for the common good .
If so , which ones ?
Mr President , it is a pity that an enthusiastic majority in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality is trying hard to overload our position on the Committee 's annual report on equality between men and women in the European Union with considerations and claims that are counterproductive for women and which harm , among other things , their chances of employment .
Tax fraud is an important problem in terms of the smooth operation of the internal market and puts the Member States ' tax revenues at risk .
Furthermore , this extension dovetails perfectly with the aim of the 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
In addition , as intervention is just one part of a complex problem , it should be addressed within the framework of an integrated , multi-dimensional approach at national level , with strong partnerships and taking account of aspects relating to education , social affairs , integration , culture , health , employment , security and so forth .
The Council Directive aims to fundamentally revise the functioning of mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes , duties and other measures .
At present , while the international community is investing in establishing earthquake-proof infrastructures , I should like to highlight the fact that religious buildings have also been hit and that international funds should also be allocated to the reconstruction of churches and seminaries .
Consequently , whatever you may think about it , illegal immigrants will claim this status and this welfare , and you will grant these to them !
The Commission is called upon to take initiatives , especially on information and prevention , in order to identify the root causes of trafficking and the factors in countries of origin and destination that facilitate trafficking in human beings .
Moreover , no reference is made to the initiative of the Bolivian President Evo Morales Ayma 's People 's World Conference on Climate Change .
The Copenhagen conference was a failure .
A deduction at source on all financial transactions would be a far more effective method .
Firstly , the recommendation for paternity leave at European level .
The report also emphasises that women must have access free of charge to consultation on abortion .
That is why I voted in favour of the measures relating to the protection of these rights .
If , however , such a radical ban were to be decided on in March at the international conference in Doha , I would call on the European Commission not to block the financial compensation that the Member States might be required to pay fishermen .
These fishermen , already severely affected by the crisis , will be the main victims of such a measure made necessary by illegal fishing and clandestine industrial networks .
The scientific reports concerning the current biomass of bluefin tuna are alarmist : uncontrolled industrial-scale fishing has severely eroded stocks .
The people of Croatia do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
However , I do condemn the Euro-liberal diktat to which both the Member States of the EU and the candidate countries are subjected .
Mr President , we are recommending to our fellow Members that they vote against this report with the aim of giving the members of the Council and the Commission the opportunity to make some adjustments and thereby alter their position .
However , the very people who defended liberalisation and deregulation at any cost in the 1990s are now finding themselves in a difficult situation as well .
Now , I almost want to reverse the issue .
It is not within the context of the Lisbon Strategy , it is not within the context of an industrial policy that it was decided who , in Europe , would lose out in an open trade relationship .
I do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged .
The Council 's work has also brought to light the significantly different opinions , traditions and practices that exist .
What is more , if we do not adopt a European approach to online gambling , we will not make progress in establishing an internal market for e-commerce .
It is for this reason , moreover , that many Member States that finance sport through gaming wish also to safeguard national practices or legislation .
That would enable us to reach a definitive opinion in March .
Unfortunately for Madagascar , the human rights violations by the previous president 's regime have continued after Andry Rajeolina declared himself
