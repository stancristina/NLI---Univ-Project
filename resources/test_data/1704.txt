The problem with a report like this , however , is that it does not list its many proposals in order of priority .
Nor , I freely admit , was that the intention .
I therefore wish to propose that we assign a level of priority to our next step and that we begin with what we can do in practical terms to put these proposals into practice in connection with the civil and military tool which is being developed in the course of these very months .
It may be a very good test of what all the words regarding equality , mainstreaming , the strengthening of the role of women etc . means in practice .
The Council and the Commission ought shortly to be coming back to Parliament with a report on what could be done .
There is certainly cause for increasing understanding of the fact that rape really is an atrocity that cannot be accepted , just as we cannot accept torture either .
We could subsequently hold hearings , seminars etc . on these subjects .
If this could happen on the basis of involving women , then we might perhaps , suddenly and quite unexpectedly , have given the EU a human face in one particular area .
Mr President , Article 255 of the Treaty is now , therefore , to be implemented and , with the Cashman report , we are moving a long way in the right direction , but not far enough .
As I see it , it is one of the most important pieces of work done this year .
We drew inspiration from the Nordic models for transparency in administration , for the Nordic countries have a very long tradition of having the right of access to documents .
In the same way , we have also pointed out that openness and transparency are the best tools for solving the problems which may arise as a result of cultural and linguistic differences between the Member States , on this issue too .
All investigations have , of course , revealed the distance between the European citizen and Brussels , and people themselves think they know too little about the EU.
Now , they will be given the opportunity also to acquire some insight into circumstances which do not receive the special attention of the mass media and special interest groups and , in that way , they will be better able to participate in the open and democratic debate which is so important to confidence in the EU.
I also hope that the Council and the Commission can give us a commitment today to continuing to deal with this issue in a positive way so that we might , as quickly as possible , start making the necessary changes to the business procedures in such a way as to benefit people and the image of the institutions .
At a hearing in September in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , we learned that it takes ten years for an administration to change mentality , so the sooner we get started the better .
It is a project which may lead to citizens being placed in a position in which they are co-players and active participants and are not just spectators or like pawns in interesting , large-scale games of chess .
We should not confuse this issue with every other possible matter connected with the right of access to documents and we should not confuse it with Parliament ' s , the Commission ' s and the Council ' s internal quarrels about access to documents .
I should like to emphasise that we shall , in any case , vote in favour of as broad a definition as we possibly can of what the documents in question are .
This also means , of course , that , conversely , we want to ensure that the exceptions are as minor and as few in number as they possibly can be .
I cannot understand how it can be accepted that citizens of the European Union should have poorer rights of access to documents than citizens in some individual Member States .
That is why I think it is so crucial that citizens ' rights should not be restricted in those Member States where there is at present good access to documentation and why I think that cooperation should instead be used to increase citizens ' access in the individual Member States and , indeed , in the European Union as a whole .
If , then , we mean what we say about citizens ' rights and bringing the European Union closer to the people , then what is needed are not flashy documents and high-minded speeches but quite specific citizens ' rights .
On 13 October , it was sent to Parliament , but I have only just seen it tonight .
There is only one person - the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control - who is in a position to request information in connection with the discharge procedure .
This is scandalous , and it shows what the Commission ' s intentions were in connection with the framework agreement .
All MEPs are therefore justified in going to their groups ...
I think the report sends a powerful signal to all the EU' s institutions and to the general public .
Openness in legislative work and in public administration is , of course , crucial to our democracies being able to function .
It is therefore not enough that a system should be formally open .
The Commission ' s draft Regulation is in reality reminiscent of Hans Christian Andersen' s story of the Emperor ' s New Clothes .
Here in the European Parliament , we must adopt the role of the little boy in the story
