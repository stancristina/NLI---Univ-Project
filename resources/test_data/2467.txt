December 1999 in Helsinki .
Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party entirely support Mr Brok ' s report .
It is important to safeguard the transatlantic link and the United States ' s continued commitment to Europe .
Judging from the debate in a number of Member States , many people are clearly rather bewildered by the debate .
Those of us in the European Parliament , who represent the people of Europe , nonetheless have an additional responsibility to lead this debate and to discuss , and conduct a critical examination of , defence and security policy in the form in which it is developing .
Last summer ' s so-called Solana decision was criticised vociferously in this Chamber .
The same ideas about the greatest possible transparency were expressed in Mr Cashman' s report which we adopted with a broad majority two weeks ago in Strasbourg .
Mr President , there are three things I want to point out .
First of all , Mrs Lalumière ' s report contains a whole programme setting out how the EU is to become a military superpower within the fairly near future .
As a superpower , the EU is to be able to intervene anywhere in the world where the EU' s interests or values are threatened .
The farthest it goes in that direction is a scornful reference in paragraph 5 of the explanatory statement to 'neutral ' countries ( in inverted commas ) .
I concur with his arguments about enlargement .
I think that the present 'relationship ' is unsustainable in the long term .
In my country , Sweden , there is a Foreign Minister who demands that there should be a UN mandate for EU operations .
Otherwise , they are in danger of becoming nothing but empty words .
I am the author of that amendment , backed by a broad majority of the European Parliament ' s Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
I would ask Mr Patten and Mr Solana , together with the incoming Swedish Presidency , to take vigorous joint action against Belarus ' s anti-democratic régime .
At the same time , it would have been even better if we had acted in advance instead of reacting afterwards .
At the same time , I feel that many question marks remain .
The latest major accident resulting in oil discharges just a few weeks ago involved a double-hull tanker .
This means that not even the mandatory introduction of this type of hull will provide any kind of certain solution .
Every day we suffer two new discharges on average .
Under the MARPOL convention Sweden is not entitled to act because the vessel is no longer in Swedish waters .
The proposals that we have submitted to date will not solve this problem in the future either .
This has been demonstrated , not least , by the catastrophe involving the loss of the oil tanker Erika .
In recent years there has been a noticeable increase in the number of oil tankers in the Atlantic , the English Channel and the Baltic , as well as elsewhere , which also means an increased risk of accidents with a negative impact on the environment .
Unfortunately Russia has not responded to this request .
Ortuondo Larrea report ( A5-0342/2000 )
Where qualified majority voting is used we feel that this must be combined with power of codecision for Parliament .
Provided that the institutions of the EU are given control over the nature of the closer cooperation we would also give this our support .
It would be good if the European Parliament showed just as much enthusiasm for discussing how to go about increasing participation in parliamentary elections to the European Parliament .
To create a more democratic EU the national parliaments must be given greater influence in the work of the EU.
However , the common resolution contains a number of formulations that I cannot support .
Similarly , it is a mistake to incorporate the Charter into the Treaty .
( SV ) We welcome and support the report , which touches on many important trends in the development of the common foreign and security policy .
We feel that the conversion of the Commission ' s delegations into Community delegations risks leading to conflicts of interest with the national diplomatic delegations of the Member States .
We do not consider that there is any real threat to Europe at present ; rather , it is now high time for an active disarmament policy and civil development .
We feel that civil crisis management is a valuable instrument for preventing conflicts , something which we must unfortunately state has not been given sufficient attention in the report . 3 .
There is talk of the EU' s common interests and values as grounds for military armament .
Furthermore , freedom from alliances is not taken up at all in the report and in the explanatory statement section of the report we sense a lack of respect towards States that are neutral .
Paragraph 50 : " Considers that Petersberg tasks should in the long term be funded from the general budget of the European Communities , which would require a revision of Article 28 of the TEU and of the Financial Perspective " .
.
( SV ) I value the attempt to develop a common European security policy , but I am against the development of a common military defence force .
I therefore cannot support the report .
In my opinion such a requirement is too far-reaching .
( SV ) We would like to express our support for the report in broad terms , but have difficulty accepting the detailed rules that the report contains in certain cases - which is reflected in our voting - since this conflicts with the principle of subsidiarity
