So they need to be monitored properly .
That was a democratic decision , and I note that Mrs Dury , Mr Cot and a number of other honourable Members keep opposing it .
Throughout the week efforts have been made to block this debate .
My second question concerns written questions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Parliament is delivering its opinion on the establishment of a European Guarantee Fund just as a study by the EIF has appeared , indicating that a guarantee fund could be an ideal instrument .
There are also economic reasons .
All Parliament can do now , unfortunately , is stand and watch .
The amendment to ECU 10.5m is the absolute minimum .
Ariane is intended to promote books and reading , but the cost of books is often a major obstacle .
However , you will not be surprised to hear , Mr Monti , that a comparison immediately springs to mind with the model rights which we are also currently dealing with .
The presentation today of the Commission 's annual programme marks the outcome of the relationship of trust between the Commission and Parliament .
The second year was the year of 'doing less but doing better ' .
I sometimes wonder whether we are not too nice to one another .
I notice that nothing has been done about any of these except to organize conferences on them , and I wonder what is to become of them now .
We have been monitoring several conciliation procedures , and although they have all been different , the way some Members of the Commission have followed up Parliament 's majority amendments , such as on the novel foods dossier , has caused us great concern .
Some Members worked exceptionally well last year .
Of course , it is not the Commission but the Member States which will be ultimately responsible for the outcome of the IGC , but the Commission still has a vital role to play in explaining why it is essential for the Treaty to be amended , particularly in the areas of internal affairs , justice and foreign policy , and in helping to ensure that the general public support the necessary changes .
The Commission is still exuding far too much of an air of 'business as usual ' , even here in this debate .
It would be most welcome if it now put all its political energies into defending the general public before the Council .
If Europe does not want to miss the boat and if we really want to take the lead in the information society , then we must have all hands on deck in this sector .
Mr President , I think I can speak for my colleagues when I say that I should like to thank the President of the Commission for the answers he has given .
The Committee on Budgets will propose to the plenary that the budget for 1997 be restrictive .
We have throughout the last few years - and again this year - tried to review the issue of the classification of expenditure .
I call on the President-in-Office of the Council present here - who , on a personal basis , has always tried to be very helpful - to transmit this message to the Council so that between the first and second readings we will be able to resolve a few of the outstanding issues .
I now come to a few of the specific items which Parliament finds essential in the budget .
It seems that the Member States are hesitant to make use of the European Community obligation to finance social and economic cohesion .
We have also added the suggestion that ECU 10m should be allocated for an initiative enhancing the employment potential of the 'third system ' .
We hope there will have been progress on this point by the time of the second reading .
The Mediterranean was a priority last year .
Europe has a responsibility , although it has not at the present time , perhaps , the central responsibility .
But within the framework of our financial means we should take very clear account in the budget of the fact that the European Union is after all financing five to six times more than other forces including the United States .
I hope these messages will have been received carefully by the President-in-Office .
( Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution )
In our opinion , therefore , there is no need to have a general reserve of ECU 300 m , which is only likely to lead to institutional problems at second reading .
I can still hear everyone congratulating themselves on this , even though the amount involved was actually only 1.2 % of all expenditure under Category B1 .
While the developments I mentioned earlier are to be welcomed , this last point has meant that the agriculture budget has not been handled properly this year .
I have just done a rough calculation that the volumes we are dealing with in the European budget are the equivalent of only 0.1 to 0.25 % of the gross national product for the national budgets .
Unfortunately , thanks to a large section of the House , particularly the PPE Group - more so than the Europe of Nations Group , which is at least committed to an intergovernmental approach - the compromise we now have before us no longer sends out any clear political signal , and I therefore regard this , Parliament 's first reading of the 1997 budget , as totally unrepresentative .
I think it was Mr Giansily who reported that ECU 9 bn of the payment appropriations earmarked for the Structural Funds in previous years have been carried over .
Social policy is something which the people of Europe can identify with and which often
