Look at your groups !
We will fight on until this Parliament restores the rights and duties to the elected Members by creating a mixed group .
However , I do not agree with voting against him .
The tragic events in East Timor have shown the cowardice and opportunism of the international community .
Anybody in this House who is not familiar with Washington ' s role in the tragedies in Indonesia and Timor , from 1966 to the latest genocide unleashed by the military on 30 August , should read the analysis published today by the Washington Post and the Herald Tribune under the banner headline ' Pentagon defends Indonesian military contacts as useful ' .
This is not a piece of journalism or a summary , but the statement that was made when Ximenes Belo and Jos√© Ramos Horta were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on 11 November 1996 .
I want to point out that at this time , my indignation has nothing to do with the language that the inhabitants of East Timor speak .
In addition to the debt we have owed to East Timor for 24 years , there is the fact that , while there have been demonstrations about East Timor , we are not taking into account the political hypothesis that we must in any case once again beg the United States for the favour of possible military intervention .
Does the current Council Presidency believe ( as the European Parliament does ) that the conditions are now such that a majority of the members of the UN General Assembly will this year call for the establishment of a universal moratorium on capital punishment ?
What measures has the Council taken , or does it intend to take , with a view to ensuring that the people of North Korea may regain their freedom at the earliest opportunity , build a country where democracy and the rule of law hold sway and once again participate in the market economy ?
This is in direct contrast to the proposals put forward by the Commission itself which , in conjunction with the committee responsible , has instead envisaged the presence of a representative of each Member State .
Having heard my colleagues ' interventions , I think that we are asking a fair and legitimate question : ' What is the Member State ' s interest , which certainly cannot be a priority interest ? '
But we also need to create the conditions whereby migration in the Mediterranean will be examined in careful detail .
It must ensure the public receives as much information as possible , including via regular postings on the internet .
The Mediterranean is where the future of a new era founded on harmony , peace and international co-operation is in the balance .
In the Resolution of March 1999 on the peace process and future aid for the Middle East , the European Parliament stressed with good reason that if the Wye Plantation Accords are confirmed - as they have been - the main problems must still be resolved , including in particular the status of the refugees .
UNRWA ' s regular programme aims to help 3,500,000 Palestinians in Jordan , Syria , Lebanon , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
One last matter - while underlining the need to continue providing humanitarian aid through UNRWA , I think that the European Parliament is particularly interested in finding a fair and balanced political solution to the Palestinian refugee problem .
However , I am afraid I have made another mistake , by speaking too quickly .
So I apologise to the people who work so hard for us , the interpreters , because one of my colleagues told me that I was speaking too quickly .
The crisis in Russia gives us that opportunity .
In short , they are requesting a committee of inquiry , made up of the Council , the Commission , the European Parliament , the EIB and the EBRD which will verify how much aid was sent to Russia , which funds were used and if it was spent in the planned way .
This is the request made by my group and the other groups which have subscribed to the motion for a resolution that we are discussing today .
The European Union must consider the situation in Burma to be one of the key areas for its international action in the defence of human rights and democracy .
In the Tower building , in room 382 on the fourth floor to be exact , I saw an enormous photocopier which one person operates .
To achieve this , I think that we should improve our relations with the press and that journalists ' work should be made easier .
Madam President , I submitted a question for Question Time in accordance with Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure and I adhered to the time frame contained in Annex II A( 13 ) which stipulates , " Questions shall be tabled to the President at least one week before Question Time begins .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in recent years , and particularly in recent months , the European citizens you represent have been shocked by a succession of food safety scandals .
Europeans see food as part of their way of life and their identity .
Just suppose the newspapers were talking about a food scare .
However , all too many of the recent scares have been well-founded , so we need to tighten up our food inspection system .
It must include the production of animal feedingstuffs , which has been one of the most sensitive issues over recent months .
A European food agency could , perhaps , be modelled along the lines of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency ( EMEA ) .
This is why we are here today , because it is clear that we
