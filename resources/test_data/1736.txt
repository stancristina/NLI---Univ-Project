Nonetheless , any reservations which anyone had are no longer very important , because this text has been amended a great deal by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament and I think that it will be amended even more by plenary the day after tomorrow .
This provoked reactions from various social groups , whereas the OECD maintains that a rational opening-up of services in the Member States could create 2 500 000 new jobs and increasing European GDP accordingly by 1.8 % .
As an elected member of the European Parliament ( and not elected by some party power controlled by the persons of the new order ) , I am absolutely opposed to the philosophies reworked in the directive in question , which executes in cold blood decades of workers ' rights .
We fear the person in possession .
So let us look at the facts .
The facts are that we want our allies to have nuclear weapons and no one else .
They lead to invasion , they lead to war , they lead to death .
Of course we disagree with the autocratic model of governance in Iran , we condemn the violations of human rights , but we must all acknowledge that the Iranian people put their new political leadership into place with democratic procedures .
The European Union and the Presidency and the Commission must help to stop the threat or use of military means or preventive action against Iran .
Any differentiations expressed relate to antagonisms between imperialist countries about their share of the booty .
Any intervention with or without the consent of the Security Council will come up against a global outcry and demonstrations by the pacifist and grass-roots movement .
The people of Iran alone have the jurisdiction to resolve any serious political issues which exist in Iran .     – Madam President , Commissioner , thank you for your reply and your honesty , but you have not convinced me that the Commission is addressing the issue with the necessary seriousness for a sector which is so important to the completion of the internal market and the competitiveness of the European Union .
Planning takes time and resources .
Everyone also knows that , under the old CAP , there was far more protectionism towards Greek farming than there is under the present common agricultural policy and I greatly fear that the next common agricultural policy will be even worse .
Additional measures which we need to see to attentively and carefully are that , in times of crisis , storage and processing and promotion need to be stepped up , as do voluntary cutbacks in production .
Similarly , farmers also need protection both from the introduction of new technologies and , more importantly , from genetically modified organisms , which harbour unpredictable negative repercussions on the environment , public health and farmers ' income , as the rapporteur notes in his report .
In addition , the report accepts the incentives set by the Commission , relating mainly to reinsurance , which needs to be free or with reduced reinsurance premiums by national agencies or by introducing reinsurance premium subsidies , in order to safeguard the companies ' profitability .
Even if we accept that measures need to be introduced which will cover all the losses caused to farmers ' income by various natural disasters and commercial crises , we cannot , however , agree with these proposals , which create an additional burden on small - and medium-sized farms ; instead of improving their income , in our opinion they reduce it .     – Mr President , first I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for his report , for the proposals which he has tabled and for accepting many of the proposals tabled by the political groups and , on the other hand , I wish to thank the Commission itself and Commissioner Fischer Boel for their balanced communication in this sector and for the alternative scenarios which they present , scenarios in which each Member State , depending on the structure of their insurance systems and the peculiarities of their agriculture , can find their own level .
Above all , however , what we have to hope for , as Parliament , is that there will be a full guarantee of farmers ' incomes and of agricultural production in the European Union .
Commissioner , I should just like to mention to you a combination , as it were , of measures which are needed : reinsurance , private insurance and state insurance .
Given that Turkey is a country seeking accession to the European Union and given that this sort of behaviour is not exactly in keeping with the European profile which it likes to present , I would ask that we too , as an institution , demand similar clarification about this atrocious crime , so that we do not also give European citizens the impression that we are directed by certain centres of interest .     – Mr President , the European Union is taking all the necessary measures to combat avian influenza and rightly so .
I call for suitable measures to be taken to help poultry farmers .
This sort of stand is intolerable , given that the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia is a party with a great deal of political action , influence and recognition among the Czech people and is represented in the European Parliament by six members .
The people who planned and executed the abduction , imprisonment and trial of Slobodan Milosevic at The Hague , having refused to take measures to protect his life despite his serious health problems , brought about his extermination .
Obviously , with this problem , there can be no
