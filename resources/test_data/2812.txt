, I thank you for your interesting view .
This report was adopted by the committee with a very large majority , and I wish to thank the committee members , who tabled many good amendments to the proposal , for their very high levels of cooperation .
This principle is written into the IAEA Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste .
Although the issue is a straightforward one in principle , in practice it is not .
According to this way of thinking , nuclear spent fuel is just the same as any other good .
The members of our committee supported the rapporteur on this .
The right of Member States to ban the importation of nuclear spent fuel has now been written into the articles of the directive in Parliament’s report .
If it had merely been written into the preamble , it would not have had the same legal status : it would just be describing political will , without any legal force .
In my opinion , they should make known their reasons why Member States should deal with the disposal of nuclear spent fuel themselves , without allowing radioactive waste or spent fuel to be exported outside the Union for reprocessing or disposal .
If nuclear power is to be used , one is taking huge radioactive risks , and those risks have to be controlled in those countries which produce nuclear energy .
Mr President , Mr President and Madam Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , honourable guests , I warmly thank you for this opportunity to come and discuss the priorities and main objectives of the Finnish Presidency with the European Parliament .
It is an exacting task to discharge the responsibilities of the Presidency in the European Union , but at the same time it is a great honour and privilege , and Finland welcomes the challenge .
I would like to thank the President and all the other Members of the European Parliament who attended the meeting between the Finnish Government and Parliament in Helsinki .
As the country to hold the Presidency , we will work in close and effective cooperation with the European Parliament .
This year it is 100 years since the unicameral parliament was founded and universal suffrage established .
In Finland , the parliament is closely involved in the handling of EU affairs , and it has a lot of influence .
Perhaps this experience that we have of fruitful cooperation with our parliament has in turn made it so natural for us Finns to engage in close cooperation with the European Parliament too .
Basically , however , they have the same fundamental mission : to strengthen democracy in the Union .
As Europeans , we need to identify the historical forces of change in our time , and respond to and embrace them .
That would be disastrous , above all for the future of our children and future generations .
Our future requires us to take concrete action now , even though its effects will only be visible later on .
In recent years participation in decision-making in the Union has left something to be desired and the public are more critical about that than before .
The agreement reached on the Financial Framework and progress with the Services Directive are examples of the Union being able to take important decisions when the political will is there .
That is why its reduced legitimacy and its diminished justification and credibility in the eyes of the people must be taken seriously .
People forget that they are possible precisely on account of the Union .
The Union’s basic premise , peace and stability in Europe , is still relevant .
I was personally reminded of that on my trip to Croatia a few weeks ago : they want to join the Union so that they and their children will never again need to witness another war .
As a result , that no longer seems enough on its own to give the Union legitimacy .
That we can and must do right away on the basis of the existing Treaties .
Improved effectiveness will mean that bold decisions will need to be taken by Europe’s leaders and decision-makers .
There must also be a willingness to compromise on national points of view and consider Europe as a whole .
The Union must focus on the essential , and work effectively for it .
This added value can be achieved in the areas of welfare , security and freedom .
The growing political debate in Europe is in the interests of everyone .
Finland , as the country to hold the Presidency , will implement comprehensively the principles adopted by the European Council to increase the transparency of the Council’s work .
Sometimes practical solutions like this do more to provide genuine access to information than mere political statements .
During its Presidency , Finland will steer its resources towards better regulation , that is to say , quality of legislation , and attention to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
In the European Union we need new legislation , but we must keep existing legislation up-to-date .
The Presidency will invest time and effort in ensuring that decision-making takes careful account of the economic , social and environmental effects of legislative proposals .
Cooperation between successive Presidencies is very important for continuity .
I shall briefly mention here the issues that the Finnish Presidency intends to highlight in particular , but that does not mean that we would not attend to other matters just as diligently .
There is need for progress in all sectors .
Connected with this debate are the very real issues of the future of the Union’s Constitutional Treaty and EU enlargement .
During its Presidency , Finland will start consultations relating to the future of the Constitutional Treaty
