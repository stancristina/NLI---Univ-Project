NGOs in the environmental legislation process , has addressed this issue .
Now it is the EU that is to ensure that this legislation is implemented .
It is , however , a pity that the Commission ’s clear text on access for NGOs to the European Court of Justice has been watered down by the Council and by Parliament .
It is now not at all clear whether this access actually exists .
We hope , however , that future cases will work out in favour of the NGOs , and thus of the EU.     Mr President , I too would like to begin by thanking Mr Blokland .
You have seen eye to eye with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for a large part of the way .
There are certain areas where this piece of legislation could have been better .
They account for a large proportion of the cadmium batteries in use today .
It may also be possible not to let some of these batteries slip through the system , and for the environmental damage therefore not to be as large – if , that is , the system works .
Why should we not , then , ban these hazardous batteries ?
The capacity labelling is a good thing , particularly for consumers .
We are , of course , aware of all the advertisements for batteries – I shall not specify any product names , but there is definitely something to do with a rabbit – and the manufacturers clearly wish to give the impression that these batteries last much longer than those of their competitors .
It is also possible that they do just that , but now we will have proof of the matter , because it will now state on the packaging how much energy such a battery contains .
A further positive is that we are obliging the manufacturers to ensure that if there is a battery in an appliance it must be easy to remove .
Again , we could well have wished for an even higher figure , but we are happy to have Community rules in this area .
Our ambitions were higher than what has been achieved , but we nonetheless support the legislation , overall , on the basis of the improvements that have been achieved .     Mr President , ‘They must be stopped ! ’ So exclaimed the great young poet of my youth , Gustaf Munch-Petersen , when , as a volunteer soldier in the Spanish Civil War , he stood alone at the front while his comrades withdrew , confronted as they were by superior forces .
His action was neither defensible nor responsible and was unable to keep the plague of Fascism away from Europe .
To die fearlessly was the last poetic offering of his life .
For many here in this House , the liberation became a new occupation , involving the Iron Curtain and the Gulag .
Today , let us remember the many people – courageous and otherwise - who died .
Let us pay homage to those who , as volunteer soldiers in the Spanish Civil War , offered resistance , took part in the defence of democracy and displayed both courage and foolhardiness in underground armies established to oppose governments ’ policy of appeasing the enemies of democracy .
They are almost all dead .
As an agent working for the British , Hans had supplied the illegal drawings .
I also wish to remember a young academic who travelled all around the country in order to create the first Danish resistance movement , while the government cooperated with the German occupying power .
After the war he became a government minister and took part in the European Movement’s great congress in The Hague in 1948 , when the Council of Europe and European integration were got under way .
That being said , he voted ‘no’ in all the votes on EC and EU Treaties and initiated criticism of the EU on democratic grounds back in 1972 .
It is awarded each year to those who have shown unusual political courage and done something for people other than themselves at a time when to do so was not expedient or profitable or likely to further their careers .
We have never had difficulty finding candidates .
There are always people who show unusual political courage , and some of them have sought inspiration in the half a million volunteers and citizens of the world who travelled to Spain to say ‘ No pasarán’ .
The EU cannot become competitive by reducing wages but must instead pin its hopes on developing new technology and human capital .
I think that , in this report , we have put our finger very precisely on those areas in which Europe fails to live up to its own objectives .
Research is important , but we must also bear in mind that most European companies are not high-tech gazelle companies .
Those businesses too must also be innovative and become better at exploiting new market opportunities for new products and at devising new business processes that make better use of employees ’ potential .
I am particularly pleased about the integrated access to labour market and education policy , since it is only by combining businesses ’ conditions for innovation with social , labour market and education policy that we can create space for employees ’ creative potential .
Europe has a need for more and better investment in education .
I should also like to emphasise that I consider equality to be a crucial dimension of the EU’s Lisbon Strategy .
We cannot afford to ignore the equality perspective if we are to achieve our objectives for the competitiveness of the EU.
We simply cannot afford to ignore the research potential to be found in the female half of the population .
