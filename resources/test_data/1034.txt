year , for lack of political will .
Mr President , we see the reality of the situation all around us .
I am grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for having included all the relevant conclusions of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities in the motion for a resolution .
There is not only a problem of coherence in the various legislations on the different sectors of the financial world , but in particular there is the problem of supervising and protecting the public interest .
Great Britain is the mother of democracy and of modern capitalism .
It has been radically changed , however , by the adoption of amendments unreservedly supporting the mechanisms of capitalisation .
In several countries , powerful social movements have already opposed similar attempts .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the diversity of languages is a source of cultural wealth .
Furthermore , finally , without linguistic diversity , there is no Europe , because this is also one of the few , and perhaps the only , parliament in the world which operates in eleven languages , to the extent that occasionally we speak in this House for the purpose of being interpreted and not to be heard in the original .
Indeed , language learning is important both for personal development and for intercultural understanding , as some of you have pointed out .
First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , for his excellent work and also to express my delight at the constructive approach and the useful cooperation built up between the rapporteurs and the Members of this Parliament , between Members and my departments and also between the two institutions and the Council .
It goes without saying that the field of language learning is in constant development , which is why these studies are necessary .
Lastly , I would like to say a few words about the amendments presented in plenary .
This programme will encourage and consolidate the continuation and development of innovative actions at Community level and will help to improve the quality of the action undertaken on behalf of young people .
We will also rely on the various studies on young people , which will be financed under the Youth programme , and the study , already underway , on the status of young people and the situation of youth policy in Europe .
As we know , this system has already been attacked by the majority of operators and producers from all geographic areas .
The ACP/European Union Partnership Agreement for Development , which replaces the Lomé Convention , provides for a ten-year transition period for the ACP countries , to allow them to conform as closely as they can to WTO rules .
But the rapporteur ' s proposal is satisfactory because it defends the quota system and rejects any automatic move to an exclusively tariff-based regime .
Of course , the Union may have difficulty determining the quotas in the immediate future , but is that exercise any more difficult than agreeing on adjustments to the customs tariff in the 'tariff only ' hypothesis ?
We are giving the United States a marvellous present there !
Another four years , Mr American executioner !
We must talk about Iraq , Echelon , Serbia ; put everything on the table .
So we must resolutely set the prospect to one side by adopting the Dary report .
Commissioner , I too remember the European Union introducing a regulation in 1993 on the organisation of the market in bananas , so as to ensure protection of outlets and income for Community producers and to guarantee the exports of the ACP countries to the Community market .
After the explanations given by both Mrs Stauner and Mrs Theato , who has stated publicly in the clearest possible way that the explanatory statement is only the responsibility of the rapporteur and in no way commits the House , I consider the amendment no longer necessary , and that is why I am withdrawing it .
The rejection of Amendment No 57 , which would have removed this ambiguity , therefore leads me to abstain on the text although , I repeat , I support its main thrust as regards the IGC.
We further protest against the report 's advocacy of the militarisation of the EU.
The institutional changes envisaged with a view to the enlargement of Europe , whether relating to the composition of the Commission , the weighting of the representation of the Member States or qualified majority voting , do not answer the basic questions we face ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall about the kind of Europe we live in .
Through these excesses a majority of this Parliament has done Europe a disservice .
Their minds are under attack as well .
Let Washington ' s Nebuchadnezzar let these people go , these slaves in their own country .
We certainly cannot continue to accept this situation .
It must be remembered that the rules of war involve respect for civilians .
This involves engaging the Iraqi government , perhaps more than we are doing today , in a dialogue on the implementation of the Security Council resolutions .
These people have been in prison for months under conditions we know virtually nothing about .
There is consequently a risk that this case of the thirteen Iranian Jews will be used by one faction against another , in step with domestic conflicts .
When the more moderate elements won the last elections , we thought our call had been heard .
It also means there is a chance this resolution - expressing our indignation - might be heard in Iran , where the results of the recent elections have raised the hope of progress there on fundamental human rights
