and , lastly , to exchange best practices , in order to provide a response in line with the requirements and problems of different kinds of Internet users and the numerous types of online activities . draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety we have primarily looked at the need to guarantee equal treatment as regards health .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I take the floor to report the positive outcome in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , and it is not by chance , as our committee is accustomed to conducting in-depth examinations on equal treatment , equal opportunities and prohibiting discrimination .
Some countries , including Italy , thought they had protected themselves by signing bilateral agreements such as the recent treaty with Libya ; that is not so .
The Mediterranean is becoming a mass grave , far from the rhetorical images that describe it .
Hope is consigned to the stormy waves of the Mediterranean Sea ; rights are delivered into the hands of unscrupulous boatmen , who have become the only means , or at least the most accessible means , to enter the European Union .
Their valuable contribution has made it possible to achieve agreement at first reading .
To date , our experience with the Ecolabel has been patchy .
The principle that most interested the shadow rapporteurs and found the other institutions in agreement was the fact that the Ecolabel must not simply certify an achieved result but instead must be a dynamic tool that is continually developing , a driving force that continually pushes manufacturers and products towards higher standards of environmental quality by continuously evaluating market benchmarks and establishing new criteria on their basis .
Individual Member States must organise the competent national authorities , liaise with the European body and adopt the sustainability criteria as binding .
The exclusions to be applied to the ecological quality label for products that still contain toxic chemical substances , that are harmful to the environment , that are carcinogenic or that are damaging for reproduction are , however , clear and effective .
I call the Commission 's attention to the exemptions for toxic products : proceed with great care and great caution .
I have voted in favour of Mr Varvitsiotis 's report on the mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures .
I abstained from voting on Mr Takkula 's report on educating the children of migrants .
I do not actually believe that we need to express too much concern over the low rate of implementation of the directives in force , with particular reference to the directive on free movement , which gives rise to numerous problems relating to freedom of movement and other rights of European Union citizens , because I do not believe the picture described by Mrs Gacek reflects the actual situation in which we find ourselves .
I do in fact share the rapporteur 's belief that the finance tools available to the European Union should be modified as promptly and effectively as possible in order to face emerging challenges linked to the current economic crisis .
I voted in favour of Mr Tatarella 's report on a Community Ecolabel scheme .
I believe that this proposal fits in perfectly with the European Action Plan for Sustainable Production and Consumption and , consequently , with the general aim of developing a voluntary , integrated system that will encourage companies to improve their products with a view to improving product quality in terms not only of diet and consumer protection , but also of the environment , by achieving higher standards of energy efficiency and environment-friendliness .
I was therefore forced to vote against Mrs Buitenweg 's report on the proposal for a Council directive .
I voted against Mr Onyszkiewicz 's report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the new EU-Russia agreement .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Czech Presidency , the Commission , Mrs Niebler , as the Chairman of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , my fellow rapporteurs on this energy package , the shadow rapporteurs and the committee 's secretariat , including all its officials , for their cooperation and for the skill they have displayed in working on this issue .
It is therefore a matter of fundamental importance that we have designated the role and responsibilities of these bodies , and have given them broad powers , since the authorities have the difficult task of controlling the common energy market .
The successful outcome on this Gas Directive and the energy package as a whole once more highlights the role of Europe and its institutions in acting for European citizens .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Transport and Tourism welcomes the fact that utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations for TEN-T projects continue to be high , reaching nearly 100 % , and calls on the Member States to ensure that adequate funding is made available from national budgets to match this EU commitment .
I have worked on this dossier as the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , in full cooperation with JeanPaul Gauz√®s , the report 's author , whom I sincerely congratulate .
For this reason , I feel a pang of regret despite the excellent result obtained , because an opportunity was missed ; due to opposition from the Member States - for which the Council has a serious responsibility - the will was not there to make provision in the text for a single , European supervisory body for the ratings sector
