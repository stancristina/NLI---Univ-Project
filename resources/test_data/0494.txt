points .
This is also accepted by the Council .
This will have to be done by means of contracts and with sufficient guarantees , as in the sectors I have mentioned as examples .
Furthermore , we believe that on 1 5 we do not create security problems for the American security system .
Today we are not talking about tolls as such , but of methods for charging tolls more simply , which create fewer problems for the users and which facilitate the operation of the internal market .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank Parliament and the Conciliation Committee for the work they have done on the proposed extension of the ecopoints system .
I would insist once again that I believe that the Austrian authorities , Members of Parliament , and also , very possibly , citizens – since this is an issue which the whole of Austria is very sensitive to – would have liked even greater protection , but I believe that by means of this transitional system we are managing to maintain , despite everything , a situation of privilege – let us make this very clear – for the sake of Austria’s environmental protection .
Today we have adopted the system of electronic road tolls , which comprises the technical elements which will facilitate the establishment of a Eurovignette system and , if we all manage to agree and show flexibility , we could adopt the Eurovignette over the next three or four months , with this same Parliament and this same Commission , during the Irish Presidency .
I am not going to go into details , because the rapporteur , Mr Lisi , has explained them very well .
That is not all , however , because we must also defend the rights of passengers , of citizens .
Is it simply that they are made to wait two , three or four hours in the departure hall ?
I believe we have begun an interesting process .
In many cases , it is inevitable that flights take place at night , particularly inter-continental flights , in view of the existence of different international time zones and types of cargo .
Secondly , as I have said , we are aware of the problem of noise and international rules have been agreed within the International Civil Aviation Organisation to produce analyses and studies , to consider what solutions are available in order to reduce the acoustic impact in inhabited areas close to airports and to resolve them .
And competition in Europe is based on a series of values and one of them is this .
I am sorry , Mr Staes , but it will not be me who presents that proposal .     . – Mr Alavanos , what you have just said is absolutely right .
What you have said is absolutely right , however .
Furthermore , an important innovation in the new Council Regulation is that the contribution of autochthonous coal to the objective of energy security must be carried out within the framework of sustainable development .
The decisions relating to the granting of total aid of EUR 87 million for the Nine-Braga-Lousada-Nine lines will be adopted in the coming days .
What the Commission reproaches the Greek state for in relation to this issue is the application of the rules of the host state for cruise ships for which Regulation ( EEC ) No 3577/92 lays down the application of the rules of the flag State .
In this regard , I would like in particular to thank the rapporteur , Mr Glante , and also the other shadow rapporteurs and the other MEPs responsible , who have worked intensively on this Directive which is so important to Europe 's energy policy and , at the same time , so technically complex in many cases .
The establishment of objectives in relation to the promotion of cogeneration has been one of the fundamental issues in the debate between the Council and Parliament , and I believe that ensuring that the Member States are prepared to determine and notify their potentials is a very important step forward , and is the correct one .
Cogeneration is a very valuable instrument in terms of fulfilling these objectives and therefore this directive was timely and necessary .
I would like to point out that , as Alejo Vidal-Quadras has quite rightly pointed out , through this definition we have managed to combine and include within the concept of cogeneration the two types of cogeneration which furthermore are usually divided in accordance with European geography ; that which pursues energy efficiency in an industrial process and that which pursues it in the field of the production of heat essentially associated with the task of heating in communities .
We have moved on from statements on energy efficiency , cogeneration , the use of renewable energy sources – which were often wonderful and full of goodwill , but mere statements nonetheless – to taking measures with specific objectives in order to promote energy efficiency , cogeneration and the use of renewable energy sources in different areas and in different applications .
Let us accept therefore that – from the point of view of sustainable and participative local development – neither those people in Europe who believe that this approach may be used to encourage movements outside of the States nor the authorities of the receiving countries who are afraid of losing control over the aid which they consider to be their own are right .
I would like it if we could talk about equality between men and women one afternoon as well .
As we always reiterate , it is necessary to intensify the political message with regard to the promotion of equality between men and women , both within the Union and , above all , in the developing countries .
