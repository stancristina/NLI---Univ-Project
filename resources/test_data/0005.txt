I therefore believe action by the European Union is vital , in the shape of close collaboration between the European Commission , on humanitarian aid and development aspects , and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs , in relation to common security , collaboration with police forces and border control .
The response to the new challenges of al-Qaeda in Yemen should not , however , just consist of military pressure , but also of helping the local authorities to gain better control over the territory .
It is thus even more important to do everything possible to consolidate and strengthen the country 's new institutions and the political equilibrium which sustains them .
Iraq 's political equilibrium is essential not only for the country but also in terms of the role that Iraq can play in the region strategically , with the aim of overcoming existing conflicts and securing peace .
Unfortunately , as is often the case , it is women and children who pay the highest price .
The same unanimity was not heard when , many years ago , some people occupying these seats - including myself - denounced the dangers that mass illegal immigration would give rise to , among them , a substantial boost for the criminal organisations that utilise this labour and the risks of human trafficking and even organ trafficking .
They are all important matters , but the deafening silence regarding the fight against illegal immigration , defined as a non priority , is unmistakeable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the various political groups on their excellent work on this report , which I fully support .
Within the report , I would like to focus attention on the negotiations on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes SWIFT ( debate ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we had to give an opinion on the existing relations between the European Union and Tunisia , it could only be a positive one , including as regards the stabilisation of the region .
We are convinced that these objectives can be achieved , and it is reasonable to expect tangible progress to be made .
Europe is well acquainted with the tragedy of wars in which , for centuries , Catholics and Protestants have fought against one another , not to mention the Jewish Holocaust .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in voting in favour of the joint resolution , I am highlighting the particular seriousness of the violence carried out in Malaysia in response to an exclusively nominalistic issue .
It is precisely Egypt that is the most powerful country in the area , where Christians and Muslims must coexist peacefully in order to play a peacemaking role throughout the southern Mediterranean area .
It is a sign of commitment and willpower , but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that an announcement is all it is going to take .
The report moves towards putting forward firm proposals , and calls for a strong commitment from the European Commission and Council , so that these proposals can be implemented .
The European Union must also send out only one message internationally , and fight for the improvement of OECD standards to achieve the automatic sharing of information , instead of sharing on request .
I would just like to make two comments .
In such a context , the Commission should be considered as a government , and it is clear that this configuration would require rules that are considerably more detailed than the adjustments deservedly outlined today .
I hope , therefore , that in the next five years , the Commission will work in such a way that the word 'dignity ' will be restored to its unambiguous and true meaning .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the debate we are holding today on the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES in March is particularly important for the rational use of wild flora and fauna .
Europe has always been attentive to problems associated with the overexploitation of wild species and illegal trade in fauna and flora .
Certain passages of the resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs are also quite strict .
The proposal under examination reinforces the safety of the ETS allowances vis-Ã -vis fraudsters whilst , at the same time , reducing the administrative burden on honest businesses .
Lastly , I believe that Parliament should be fully informed of the outcome of this temporary implementation of the reverse charge mechanism .
First of all , I believed it necessary to widen the geographical perimeter of the motion to all 27 EU Member States , since the problems we intend to combat with this regulation arise throughout the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I congratulate Mr van Nistelrooij on the excellent text he proposed , which has been further improved by numerous amendments tabled within the Committee on Regional Development , allowing this measure to be extended to all the European Union Member States .
The proposal will mean we can call on more effective cooperation measures to combat fraud and tax evasion , creating a reliable , easy-to-use and effective system .
Such coordination has shown itself to be effective in the short term , and has seen an initial pledging of considerable sums by the European Commission and by individual Member States .
The Iranian authorities play a part in stirring up this dangerous climate of intolerance and intimidation towards certain European Union countries .
We must implement a policy of good governance , both within and outside the European Union , not least to oppose unfair tax competition ,
