I can inform you that 25 Scandinavian MEPs and interpreters took between 10 and 20 hours to arrive here in Strasbourg .
I hope you will convey this to our French President and tell her that our having to meet here in Strasbourg is almost intolerable and a constant strain .
I would ask her to urge Air France to retain the route and to operate it punctually so that we might avoid these constant problems in connection with our meetings .
It took me 12 hours to get to Strasbourg .
It is quite unacceptable for MEPs to have to spend time which should be devoted to political work or to their electorate at home on wondering how they will manage to get to their place of work and also on working out where they are going to spend the night .
We need some orderly arrangements if this Parliament is to continue .
I would request that the President of France be informed of the impossible working conditions to which we are exposed because Parliament meets in Strasbourg .
Mr President , I just want to say that , after 11 years as an MEP , I am familiar with the French airline concerned .
It is unacceptable that a country seeking membership of the European Union and with which negotiations to accord it pre-accession status have now been going on for 27 years can occupy an area covering 40 % of Cyprus .
We are , however , able to give discharge for the European Development Fund .
Where the general budget is concerned , I just want to highlight two serious issues , the Fléchard case and the problems surrounding ECHO 's humanitarian aid , and also to emphasise that the whole budgeting process is characterised by a lack of precision .
Budgeting is not just about coming up with a few figures .
It is just as much about designing one ' s administrative and production machinery in such a way that the objectives laid down in the budget can be achieved .
Like the ECHO case , the Fléchard case is an example of the irresponsible use of European taxpayers ' money .
The Commission knows that there are criminal activities behind these cases .
We now seem , of course , to have two spokespersons for the Commission : the official one , Commissioner Schreyer , and the unofficial one , Mrs Morgan .
In the Danish Parliament , we have a saying about the Finance Committee .
That is not the case here .
Where Parliament ' s 1998 accounts are concerned , I would note that the problem is the same as in other areas of the Union , namely an all too careless attitude to the way in which the money is used .
I should like to add that this is not a criticism I am directing at the Secretary-General , for I do not believe there is any basis for such criticism .
Rather , it is a criticism to be directed against the system itself , for this is not good enough .
The ombudsman is not entitled to receive full information ; the Court of Auditors has complained that it is unable to obtain full information ; in Parliament ' s Committee on Budgetary Control , it is a permanent topic on the agenda ; and our President , Mrs Theato , has severely criticised the new draft agreement between Parliament and the Commission , for the draft agreement will not give us the documents we are requesting , either .
My personal experience of the Commission is of encountering a good deal of beating about the bush whenever I ask for information which ought to be available .
Nor do they know if there are any problems regarding the competence of any of the participants .
Nor do we know how much is being paid out to , for example , Danisco .
Our granting discharge for 1998 is , in reality , a vote of confidence .
We are giving the Commission a chance to prove that it is different from the old Commission .
I would also take the opportunity to call for a cessation of hostilities here in Parliament .
The European project can only succeed if we show zero tolerance for fraud , nepotism and corruption .
Let us cut across party lines and national allegiances .
There are more and more people who think that we should simply forget the past and concentrate on changing the general way in which things are done , but I disagree with that view .
I do not think we have received enough in the way of admissions from the Commission when it comes to the events of the past .
We shall not forget them until they have been resolved in a proper and dignified manner .
Both Mr Patten and Mr Nielson have been very critical of the way in which development aid has been administered .
Mr Patten has said it is embarrassing for the EU and the Commission and called it the worst way of providing development aid .
For Mr Nielson , it was enough to call it a 'a pizza service without delivery ' .
He has also promised that disciplinary action will be taken if they are not in fact fulfilling these , and I am very pleased about that development , but do not imagine that we shall forget you .
If I need to mention the Special Envoys at all , it is because the Council is insisting on transferring the financing of the Special Envoys to the Council ' s administrative budget .
The problem , however , is that , in doing so , there is a loss of the inspection and the control that of course exists in the case of budget items in the Commission ' s budget .
In the
