must recognise that change is essential and that people must not be penalised in terms of their freedom of movement by unjustifiable and cumbersome administrative procedures .
I congratulate Mr Deprez on an intelligent and reasoned approach , with measures that facilitate freedom of movement for third-country nationals on Member State territories for a maximum period of three months .
This is a guarantee .
We should welcome it and therefore welcome his report .
Finally , perhaps this report will at some time enable us in this Chamber and in the Union to have a rational and reasonable debate on immigration and visa issues , decoupled from the ugliness of nationalism and xenophobia .
I welcome Mr Deprez 's report .
Madam President , thank you very much for that message of condolence , which is what I wanted to talk about concerning India .
Madam President , I rise concerning Rules 7( 1 ) , 7( 2 ) and 8( 4 ) of our Rules of Procedure to ask whether you or your services have received a communication from the British Government informing you that the Conservative Party has asked to change one of three names on its list , which would remove the name of someone elected in the East Midlands region in the European elections last June .
The change would be to remove the name of Mr William Newton Dunn and replace it with Mr Javed Arain , the fourth-ranked Conservative , who is here with us today in the public gallery .
You will no doubt know that the system of proportional representation was used for the first time in the UK in the last European elections and the people who voted in these elections voted for a party whose views they agreed with , not for an individual .
Perhaps if no communication has been forthcoming you could contact the British Government to ask for their official , legal position .
Finally , under Rule 7( 3 ) , I ask that the committee responsible , mentioned in this rule , look into the credentials of Mr Newton Dunn to see whether he has , in fact , proceeded in accordance with the Act of 20 September 1976 , as detailed in our Rules of Procedure .
Madam President , Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure says that we all sit here as individuals , not as agents of political parties and we do not take orders from outside .
( Applause from the centre and left ) The essence of democracy is that individuals have guaranteed rights against the state .
The Conservatives , I am sorry to say , are now wishing to introduce a new doctrine that political parties have power over individuals .
That is the beginning of totalitarianism and that is why I left them .
( Applause from the centre and left )
Madam President , Mr Newton Dunn is perfectly correct when he draws attention to Rule 2 , but what he forgets is that the elections in 1999 took place under proportional representation .
No elector voted for Mr Newton Dunn , or indeed for me or for Mr Heaton-Harris .
They voted for a party list and Mr Newton Dunn represented himself as fully in support of the Conservative Party , its leader and its European policy .
He has now completely abrogated that position and he is therefore denying the democratic rights of the voters of the East Midlands , over 40 % of whom voted Conservative .
I call on Mr Newton Dunn to resign .
Madam President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for the open manner in which he chose to present his report in plenary .
It is the beginning of a debate - an honest debate - that we want to be involved in as parliamentarians .
The Commissioner and Mr Hatzidakis said that regional disparities will become twice as great .
The challenge to achieve cohesion will be greater : we have an unprecedented expansion of the Union and we still have poor regions .
There is a multi-million euro question which is , to use the words of a former French Commission President : " Have we got the means to match our ambitions ? "
That is not to say that the means have to be financial , but we must also look at other policies .
It is clear that there will be a cap on budgetary contributions .
Therefore I ask you , Commissioner Barnier and your colleagues , to look at the opportunities offered by other policies , in particular the real and tangible benefits of involving the private sector in regenerating our regions .
Can you be sure , Commissioner , that an enlightened view will be taken , in particular by Mr Monti , the Commissioner responsible for competition , to ensure that we have private sector innovative approaches to reducing regional disparities across the Union ?
Mr President , the Mediterranean is the cradle of European civilisation .
The legacy of ancient Egypt , Greece and Rome shaped our culture , our literature , our very understanding of the common European heritage .
Around the Mediterranean the three monotheistic religions - Judaism , Christianity , Islam - were founded and fostered and spread throughout the known world .
Our debt to the Mediterranean is not only historical and cultural , it informs our common interest today in enlargement .
It is true that covers mainly countries from Central and Eastern Europe , but the candidate countries include the two famous Mediterranean island peoples : the Maltese and the Cypriots .
I very much hope that the Mediterranean programme and the enlargement process may be seen as complementary and not conflicting .
It is suitable that today the presidency should be manned by Mr Danielsson from Nordic Europe .
