higher than that proposed by the Commission .
The Commission is of the view that this network must ensure the necessary exchange of information between immigration liaison officers and also the coordination that the Member States must develop with third countries in order to work together in the field of European immigration policy .
Once this regulation is approved , immigration liaison officers posted to third countries must form effective networks for cooperation at local or regional level on the basis of the positive precedent set by the network established in the Western Balkans at the initiative of the United Kingdom and which has shown positive results in regulating immigration from that region to the States of the European Union .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have on several occasions expressed our concern that the Union’s external borders constitute one of the weakest links in the system for creating an area of freedom , security and justice .
We want to develop a proactive policy for legal immigration , and at the same time effectively combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings .
The Commission shares his view about the crucial importance of setting common minimum standards on procedural safeguards .
It will highlight what is seen at EU level as essential for a fair trial and it will make mutual recognition measures operate more smoothly , since Member States will be more willing to accept that other Member States have proper safeguards in place .
In the work programme for this year , there is also a Green Paper on the approximation , execution and recognition of criminal sanctions in the European Union .
This is one of the most complex issues in penal law .
This is an attempt to ensure homogenous protection throughout the Union of the individual rights of those accused , sentenced or convicted in criminal proceedings .
In this context , the PPE-DE will , of course , vote in favour of the Hernández Mollar report .     .
To Mr Turco I should like to say that I do not even dare to imagine what would have been said if I had presented the Framework Decision before seeking the opinion of this Parliament on the Green Paper : first things first !
I do not intend to subscribe to such an approach because legislation that aims to reinforce law enforcement cannot be considered purely as oppressive legislation .
I therefore believe that the European Parliament’s discharge of the budget must always allow for meaningful political debate .
There is , however , one aspect of a general nature that I believe warrants particular mention .
The passenger vehicle market in the European Union today is fragmented into fifteen completely different national segments , which creates distortions and penalties that affect not only the citizens but also the automobile industry itself .
The solutions proposed in this report focus largely on achieving this aim , although they give priority , by repeating them , to the concerns that this Parliament has expressed on several occasions ; such as concern at the emission of particulates that are harmful to the environment .
In light of this worsening socio-economic situation , measures must be adopted that are different to those used to date , because disparities have increased , cohesion has weakened and no real progress has been made as regards gender equality policy .
I repeat the need for effective measures , for mechanisms for intervention in the field of company relocations , and of the directives on Article 13 , both with regard to women’s rights in all the various areas of employment and to people with disabilities .
It is another matter altogether to get a picture of the reality to strengthen the implementation of today’s repressive immigration policies , in order to create a ‘Fortress Europe’ .
Bearing in mind that one of the consequences of the Action Plan will be a substantial increase in the production of statistics , we cannot exclude the possibility , as the rapporteur reminds us , that future budgetary rules might have to be revised .
The problem is that the current neoliberal capitalist offensive to dismantle countless social achievements affects , today as in the past , but even more harshly , working women .
The approach adopted by the rapporteur belongs to the radical feminist clique , which appears to have hijacked the committee in which this report originated .
The proposal that has been tabled clearly demonstrates the EU’s desire to confer legitimacy on its own youth policies , in which funding is only given to ‘youth superstructures ’ in an artificial attempt to promote the non-existent participation of young people in EU policies and to contribute to stifling the critical spirit of young people and of the youth movement .
I supported this report and consequently voted in favour of it .     .
This proposal is intended to establish a multiannual programme ( 2004-2008 ) for awarding grants to promote cultural organisations , in order to establish a legal base for existing grants , which were previously included in the Commission ’s administrative expenditure .
Just look , for example , at the political interpretation made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy : ‘The creation of the immigration liaison officers ’ network can be considered as a step in the direction towards the establishment of a common external service of the EU ...’ As a matter of fact , the stated aim for the activities of ‘immigration liaison officers ’ is , as the rapporteur points out , to combat illegal immigration – as the individuals responsible for implementing this policy in the countries in which this immigration originates , including the task of compiling ten categories of information that these officers will have to gather
