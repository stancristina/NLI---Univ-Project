the definition of audiovisual content to be extended to take account of media convergence .
Nevertheless , access to television services for disabled people is very important .
We are all aware of the substantial cultural and economic challenges the Television without Frontiers Directive presents for each of the Member States of the Union and the candidate countries .
I must thank Mr Perry for his work , and yet I am unsure whether or not this Directive needs to be revised .
Mr Perry , you paid a great deal of attention in your report to the question of media concentration , which can prevent the movement of non-national works .
Therefore , in addition to their contribution to diversity , cultural industries contribute significantly to the economy .
I would like to point out that since 2002 we have also been developing experimental measures designed to support the music and book industries .
In conclusion , I feel that it is now time to mobilise our efforts to ensure that the proposed UNESCO convention on cultural diversity can soon see the light of day .
We must regret , in this respect , the result of the Convention , which leaves the existing texts as they are instead of promoting aid for culture to the ranks of aid that is automatically authorised .
We voted against the report to highlight both our opposition to the Commission 's policy and its justification .
Not only does the plan aim to recognise linguistic diversity in an objective way , but also to promote it to the detriment of national languages .

When will there be a resolution to prioritise rail and piggyback transport , and moreover , one for other choices relating to national and regional development ?
Whilst fully sharing the criticism directed at the current regime as regards its serious violations of human rights , I cannot join in singling out Cuba when things remain the same in dozens of other countries with comparable regimes .
We can see that if the Charter on Fundamental Rights were to become obligatory then the Union would have , thanks to this Charter and to Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union , the right to impose real enforcement of rights , oriented , or rather disoriented - towards destroying our societies .
The European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats does not agree with the alleged progress in certain areas ( notably regarding the right to asylum ) nor the tendency to extrapolate the letter of the Charter on certain issues relating to discrimination .
Given that the annual report on fundamental rights in the EU plays a part in monitoring adherence to the Charter , the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote against this article .

Mr Lannoye and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have given us some minimal proposals , which we must quickly implement .
In light of the tragedy that people have gone through and the totally insufficient responses given to date , the establishment of a European Water Fund for the ACP countries is a good initiative .
Medicines to start with , to put an end to the deaths of over 28 000 children under five years old who die every day from illnesses that can be treated , many of them easily .
In a document in which everything or almost everything could be considered 'cultural ' , there is no clear definition of the idea of cultural works , something that opens the door to much abuse .
I am also astonished that you want the US to put pressure on Israel to respect human rights more , whilst you do not mention the pressure that the European Union could and should exert on the Palestinian Authority to stop the terrorist attacks .
When the Agreement began in 1995 , just after the process in Oslo , some regarded it as helping to build peace .
What it lacks is the political will to do so .
A wall of shame embodies the apartheid and injustice , and the Palestinian society is living a tragedy .
It happened after the junta showed its desire to not respect any of the democratic demands of its people , and this is a bad omen .
We refuse to support one or other of the camps in this rivalry , the winner of which will be one of the multinational groups and certainly not the workers in this sector , nor consumers or taxpayers .
Mr President , last week , on Wednesday , to be precise , the new office of the Church of Scientology was inaugurated in Brussels with great pomp .
Mr President , Commissioner , we must answer some questions to which a response has not yet been given .
It is a genuine decision-making aid , a tool to help decision-makers that we are calling for with the temporary committee .
Exchanges of information and ties of solidarity need to be properly developed by the parties concerned .
The passing of time has revealed new aspects of the sinking of the Prestige and we now know , for example , about the astounding quantity of fuel leaking from the tanks which , we have been told , should have been emptied .
These debates on issues of maritime safety highlight the importance of actions that are public-spirited and socially responsible .
There have been so many human tragedies and so many barely healed wounds , and this is why it is crucial to find out what decision has been taken to recover the thousands of tonnes of fuel that remain in the wreck of the Prestige .
I hope that you will be able to look beyond the political differences and agree , on this extremely important subject , to support this forward-looking initiative
