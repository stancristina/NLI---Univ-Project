On behalf of the Council , I should like to emphasise that , traditionally , the EU 's relations with Morocco have been generally sound .
It has nothing to do with what I was asked about and is an issue that the Council absolutely cannot have an opinion about .
Mr President , that is of course what I was suggesting in my first answer .
Thank you , Mr President , for briefly stating what the question is about .
Thank you , therefore , for that bit of educational guidance .
The Council cannot alter a provision in a legal act without a proposal to that effect having been tabled by the Commission .
I should also like to remind the honourable Member that it is the Commission that is to use the procedure in Article 21 of the regulation I mentioned , and that is something the Commission has already done in adopting transitional measures .
Nor has the Council received any request from a Member State along the lines referred to by the honourable Member .
I can safely say in reply that a proposal by the Commission is also , of course , required for a solution such as the one intimated here , and I do not believe that there is any Member State that has requested such a proposal .
The rules of procedure are quite clear .
Under no circumstances am I able to say any more about this , but Members of the European Parliament are of course always justified in raising matters important to them .
The implementation of arms export policies and , therefore , of the Code too continues to be the responsibility of the Member States .
The Council has not been made aware of the situation referred to by the honourable Member in his question .
In any case , the Council is not informed as to the reasons why the Member States either authorise or refuse export licences , and it is not within the Council 's area of competence in any way to set itself up as a judge of these Member States .
The information was not , however , requested in the question , and I cannot therefore offer an answer .
He might also perhaps telephone the Belgian Foreign Ministry , which I think would be obliging enough to give an answer .
Mr President , I should like to answer the three questions together .
It is emphasised that account must be taken of existing agreements between the United States and the individual Member States .
It will be up to each individual Member State to assess whether its bilateral or multilateral treaty relations with the United States can be considered adequate to make allowances for the American requests .
If a Member State were to find it necessary to change existing agreements or to enter into a new agreement with the United States , this would be done on the basis of the EU 's guiding principles .
If , in their bilateral contacts with the United States , the individual countries keep within this framework that has been set out , the Court will not be undermined .
In accordance with the EU 's guiding principles , any solution should include suitable operational provisions that ensure that people who have committed crimes that come within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court do not enjoy immunity .
Such provisions should be able to ensure that suitable investigations take place and that , if there is sufficient evidence , the national authorities take legal proceedings against people at the request of the Court .
Moreover , they will be brought to justice irrespective of whether they are Americans or Europeans .
For many years , the United States has , in close cooperation with the EU , adopted a leading role when it comes to setting up international criminal courts with a view to bringing criminal prosecutions for such crimes .
Moreover , the EU has carefully defined the category of people to whom this might apply .
Apart from such cases , any solution should , however , only cover those who , because they have been sent there by the sending state , are resident in the country that is being requested to hand someone over to the court .
This is in accordance with the Rome Statute 's very narrow definition of persons who should be included under immunity agreements .
If the alternatives are looked at , the EU approach we have just described is the best way of defending the International Criminal Court .
A simple rejection of the American proposal would , however , have had very negative consequences for transatlantic relations , and it would have endangered the absolutely vital American commitment to worldwide peacekeeping operations .
In that connection , I should like to mention that the United States has already entered into bilateral agreements with 12 countries that are unable to take a stand on the EU 's position .
With regard to what EU citizens , NGOs and legal experts think , I should like to emphasise that the Council did not discuss this subject in a vacuum and that it certainly did not reach the stated outcome in a vacuum .
The Council has also taken account of the points of view expressed by the NGOs affected .
It goes without saying that the Council has also taken full account of the views expressed by the elected representatives in the EU , both in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament .
In that connection , I should like , on behalf of the Council , to draw attention to the common position , adopted on 11 June of last year and amended on 20 June of this year .
It was a position supported by the candidate countries .
The Council
