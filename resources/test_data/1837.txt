too .
Especially with regard to the committee of inquiry , I would like to stress the fact that it should be an internationally constituted committee of enquiry and that its competences must be clearly delineated .
In its recent past , Croatia has witnessed dramatic changes for the worse and widespread corruption .
As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , I know that the members of the Committee on Budgets have criticised me and my colleagues for continually wanting more funds for the Balkans , and for having to enter into negotiations with the Council , which is not always that easy .
Mr President , these days , we cannot talk about Croatia without seeing it in the context of its neighbour Serbia , where the people are now finally throwing off the yoke of the authoritarian government clique .
In 1945 , the outside world agreed that these states should cease to exist permanently .
The damage done by the war has not yet been cleared , as we witnessed recently .
The Lisbon Summit has given us the opportunity to lend more weight to social policy ; we must seize that opportunity with both hands .
It is true that the open method of coordination , which has been used within the sphere of employment since Luxembourg , has brought fantastic new openings in fields which up to now were only subject to national authority .
We would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and , as has now been decided by the Social Affairs Council , be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty .
Needless to say , the social partners are major players when it comes to achieving this agenda , where lifelong learning is concerned for example , or the organisation of working time , and new forms of work , and we hope that they will be prepared to negotiate within all these fields .
Mr President , today we are debating social policy .
Today we are discussing social policy , as the rapporteur pointed out earlier .
I would now like to turn to the point of open coordination which I believe is crucial .
I do not share the concern expressed by quite a few fellow MEPs with regard to the re-nationalisation of policy .
It seems to me that the effect of these projects on the competitive sphere is rather minor .
I welcome the declaration of fundamental rights , but it has to be improved in order to better accommodate the citizens ' expectations , and it has to form part of a European constitutional process .
After all , they are now discussing the redistribution of power in Europe , but especially at this stage , it is vital to have a sound presidency that seeks consensus .
In addition , majority decision-making goes , by definition , hand in hand with codecision ; it is totally unacceptable to us to separate the two .
At the moment , it appears that the voice on the streets is stronger than the will for peace .
This message could also be conveyed by the French Presidency .
The humanitarian programme has been extended to include refugees and other people who have been driven out of their homes .
Secondly , the issue of the number of Commissioners .
In this proposal , economic interests have prevailed over other considerations .
My final verdict is therefore positive .
I should in any event like to urge the Commission to support Commissioner Fischler in this respect , for the best way to stay within the financial limits is not to put the future of sugar policy at risk again , at least not before 2006 .
In conclusion , the agriculture committee is of the opinion that we should remain within the confines of the Berlin Agreement , and as such , I , as draftsman of the opinion have to advise against Amendment No 206 with regard to the vote in this Parliament .
There is no doubt that Europe has to make a crucial contribution to the reconstruction of Serbia , and hence to the stabilisation of the Balkans .
So we have the means .
Once we have assured ourselves that what we budget for can actually be spent , we will subsequently need to ask ourselves whether the aid actually ends up where it is needed the most .
I am of the opinion that we need to make a mental switch .
These may be citizens who would like to see the Union develop into a federation , but also citizens who are sceptical about Europe , as demonstrated recently by the Danish population .
For this to happen , difficult choices have to be made , but unfortunately , it appears that the rapporteur is not prepared to make these choices ; instead , she has opted for the easy way out by increasing the budget .
Although the rapporteur attended the meeting of the Committee on Budgets yesterday , she failed to draw lessons from the credit transfers which were being discussed .
Programmes of the Union should therefore adopt a more neutral tone , so as to prevent one specific political hue being put across at the expense of all citizens .
I would also like to say a few things about agriculture .
The key question is , of course , how to finance this ?
I would question that , for I think that it is just as much information policy as it is social policy , and I therefore hope to return to this topic within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development shortly .
Behind each figure , behind each budget line , behind each allocation , there is a policy to be adopted , there are political goals , huge expectations and , more than anything , people
