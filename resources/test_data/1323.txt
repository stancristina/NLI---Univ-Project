We assume it will do this through dialogue with the entire social framework which is jointly responsible for such processes .
I quote : ' what is good for Europe is also good for America ' .
I must say this is very strange in a Europe which proclaims that it wants to be transparent .
Europe has laid down a legal framework for the introduction of the euro , and with that it has acquitted itself well of its most important tasks .
The principle argued for is that people should not have to pay for compulsory conversion to euros , in other words for converting their national currency into the euro and vice versa .
That is a serious figure .
Mr President , on Friday night my wife and I were invited to dinner with some friends .
More than 2 million Europeans are injured in road accidents every year , and many of them will remain permanently disabled .
Nonetheless , we would like to go a bit further .
The road , too , should and can become safer .
Could I also ask for particular attention to be paid to the opportunities offered by technological developments , such as systems which disable the start mechanism of the car when the driver has drunk too much ?
To achieve success , a joint approach is needed with sufficient popular support .
I would like to mention that in my family we are still suffering the consequences of an accident which took place in Belgium between a Dutch and a French driver .
It is on these issues that I would like to see the report sharpened up .
Mr President , we regularly express our sympathy with the victims of disasters .
This criterion could even lead to unfortunate choices being made , such as protecting working people in preference to the elderly .
The three reports on different aspects of the impending monetary union did not get my approval .
The 'enormous ' advantage will thus be largely undone .
Mr President , whereas this is an own-initiative report , could the Commissioner please comment on the fact that where we have a directive on the European driving licence , I made a proposal that we include some education on first aid in difficult circumstances like he was in this morning ; that is , to give first aid and include it in the driving licence education .
Noblesse oblige .
Trade is regulated by various WTO treaties .
Article 113 offers the Commission no explicit authority to sign the MAI on behalf of the Member States .
Madam President , there are currently approximately 1 800 bilateral agreements on direct foreign investments .
This leads to a lack of transparency and contradictions between agreements .
On important policy areas such as the environment , and in the social and cultural sphere , it could have a negative effect .
Also , will the expert group which is soon to be set up investigate the complaints thoroughly ?
We hope the Commissioner can raise the ECU 1.3 million set aside for this programme for the period 1999-2003 to ECU 14 million .
Mr President , many inside and outside this Parliament are rightly interested in the reports on enlargement .
We wish to give the political criteria sufficient prominence , the more so because , since Amsterdam , a number of clauses have been in force which apply to the Member States themselves .
This strikes me as a very normal and reasonable request , and we reiterated it with regard to the individual partnerships .
These are issues which you will have to get right both in the short , medium and long term .
No, we will have to come to a solution for the economic problems together , in mutual consultation .
It seems to me that the Commission has chosen the right priorities for the short and medium term .
We hope that the Commission will do so through dialogue and partnership , because ultimately what matters is not the interests of the present government , but the interests of the people of Slovakia .
Once again the Western governments ' prime objective appears to be to remain uninvolved .
Clearly the most important lesson from Bosnia has still not been learnt .
In the European Parliament , we have so often called for an effective European security policy .
The conflict in Kosovo is a bigger threat to international peace than the conflict in Bosnia ever was .
They wanted independence , and this is the basis of the conflict .
But I do think it contains some interesting points .
Mr President , I support your policy on this matter , but it was my group which clearly pointed out that this system as it is presently implemented by the Bureau is not right .
We all know that members of the Bureau are amongst the more experienced Members of our House and I am sure they will take their responsibility very seriously .
In this recommendation for second reading , the European Parliament proposed in Amendments Nos 4 , 5 , and 7 that as far as the registration of passengers is concerned , companies operating a railway tunnel must meet the same requirements as those operating a passenger ship .
When such a measure does not improve the safety of travel through a train tunnel , it should be omitted .
That is why I voted against Amendments Nos 4 , 5 , and 7.
It is a question of passenger safety and fair application of the rules of competition within the European Union .
I can also see a modest role for the EU with regard to the Cabrol report on pollution .
Madam President , during the discussions on the Maastricht Treaty , the war in
