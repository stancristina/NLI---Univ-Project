Europe can be both competitive and strong socially , but this will require us to make continued efforts and be prepared for change .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Council shares the Commission ’s view that the emissions trading scheme in the European Union is one of the cornerstones of the EU’s policy on climate .
As with all new schemes , emissions trading has also experienced growing pains in its initial stages .
A huge project is now underway to draft other national allocation plans .
Member States are drawing them up , and it will be the Commission ’s job to evaluate them .
In the spring this year we gained a lot of valuable experience from the reports on emissions data for 2005 .
In parallel with the process relating to the allocation plans , the Finnish Presidency will be launching a review of the Emissions Trading Directive .
We all know that , to protect the planet over the next few years , the largest developing countries have to be persuaded to agree to limit their emissions .
Until now , EU action has encouraged Americans who want their own country to be involved in global climate protection , but if we betray our commitments under Kyoto , that will be a victory for the opponents of climate protection in the United States and elsewhere .
The Commission must now show determination and insist that the Member States of the EU comply with the key criteria in emissions trading .
I appeal to the Commission not to allow this type of Finlandisation to spread .     .
For example , for us in Northern Europe yearly temperatures – whether or not it will be a cold or mild winter – and the state of the seas , lakes and rivers are highly significant , not just for energy consumption but also for energy production , and thus also for volumes of emissions .
The other Member States have not yet got quite so far , but I am very sure that they are making progress .
We are expecting the Commission ’s evaluation to materialise later this autumn , and perhaps quite soon .
We nevertheless do agree that , despite the flaws , this scheme is absolutely necessary , and should be taken in the direction of its original objective , which is that it should act as a genuine incentive for the players involved to invest in carbon-free , environmentally friendly technology .     I have to start by admiring the Commission 's capacity to answer detailed and difficult questions on SMEs in Greece .
My question is can you please guarantee to us today that you will resist the pressure that we are under from many , especially German , trade unions to further water down the Services Directive , which was the subject of such a nice compromise between the Council , the Commission and European Parliament ?     .
The Commission had hoped that the opening of accession negotiations would give a more tangible impetus to the reform process .
The Commission would also mention that the Alevi community experiences difficulties in terms of recognition of places of worship , representation in relevant state bodies as well as in compulsory religious education .
We have discussed this matter , in terms of procedure .
For instance , almost a year ago when I was in Turkey after the opening of the accession negotiations on 3 October 2005 , we had an in-depth exchange of views on the matter with the relevant committee of the Turkish Grand National Assembly .
In our view , and according to the Turkish authorities , this should be part of the so-called ninth reform package which is still pending as a whole and which should be adopted without any undue delay by the Turkish Grand National Assembly and , in part , by the Turkish Government .
We are using all the data and analysis provided by agencies such as the one he mentioned in Vienna .
We use a lot of analysis and data provided by bodies such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE , as well as agencies and other think-tanks .     .
As regards the steps taken by the Commission with the aim of facilitating the reunification of the Island and thereby ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community , the following major activities can be reported .
First , the Commission has started to implement the Council regulation that establishes an instrument of financial assistance for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community .
Our programme team responsible for the implementation of the regulation should be operational as of this month .
Within this framework , the Commission is also implementing an institution-building programme through the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange Instrument ( TAIEX ) , in order to help prepare the Turkish Cypriot community for the future application of the in that part of the island .
We have no intention of withdrawing the proposal and submitting a revised version .
In reply to the question by Mr Matsis , the return of Varosha has been linked in the past to the UN-led talks on a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem .
Therefore it is up to the parties involved to decide whether to keep this issue within the framework of the comprehensive settlement or to discuss it separately or to find a way to include it in both concepts .
We now expect both communities to approach the matter by focusing less on past injustice and more on future solutions .
I have been briefed on the results of the vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee on the Eurlings Report on Turkey .
It is clear that a possible failure by Turkey to meet its obligations as regards the implementation of the
