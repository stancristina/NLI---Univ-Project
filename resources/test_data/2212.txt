the organisation of a single security system and in relation to the transfer of powers to Abu Mazen firstly and now , to the Prime Minister designate , Abu Ala .
As well as all these aspects I have referred to , we must also encourage the entrepreneurial spirit and promote the creation of companies and a favourable climate which allows them to develop and grow ; without companies there can be no entrepreneurial fabric .
It was an important step towards filling the immense legal vacuum which represented , in my opinion , a form of discrimination against the millions of citizens who move freely about the European Union , at risk of being victims of crime , but who are faced with 15 judicial borders , which , in practice , have shown themselves to be incapable of protecting their rights .
This initiative by the European Commission and the work of Commissioner Vitorino is , in my view , the right way to achieve that .     Mr President , in view of the grave events which have taken place in Bolivia , I believe nothing could be more dangerous than to take a simplistic and demagogic view of them , since this would lead us to make serious errors in our interpretation of the situation .
I believe that the European Union , as the Commissioner quite rightly said , must appeal for moderation and good sense , so that a constructive dialogue between all the parties may be initiated in order to generate a climate of trust and understanding .
What type of representation do we have ?
Mr President , I apologise for taking such a critical tone , but I really feel hugely indignant at the moment , because it is not acceptable for our Union to be supporting this type of policy .
It is possible to establish a direct link between the abusive and unacceptable intervention of the United States , with its interference in the last electoral campaign in favour of Sánchez de Lozada and against Evo Morales , and the subsequent shameful delivery of Bolivian gas to the Americans , bringing the poorest country in America even closer to ruin .
The Socialist Group calls on the Commission to promote the best possible scientific opinions in order to provide knowledge at all times of the state of each resource in each fishing ground so that , on the basis of these rigorous scientific opinions , we can implement recovery plans , which may or may not involve drastic measures which – we must not forget – always lead to the scrapping of ships , unemployment for fishermen and other workers dependent on the fishing sector , and furthermore represent a serious blow for those European regions most dependent on fishing .
We support the idea of a recovery plan which makes it possible to re-establish the stock and my group therefore supports the idea that the highest annual change , upwards or downwards , in any total allowable catch ( TAC ) , should not exceed 15 % after the first year of application of the recovery plan .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission finally accepted the proposal we in the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats made to the effect that hake and cod should be dealt with separately and in different proposals , since their situations are not just slightly different , but very different .
Today it is still intended to maintain this injustice by restricting their access to the so-called Irish Box , the intention being to redefine it as a sensitive area in the Irish Sea .
I would like to stress the consequences of recovery plans for coastal regions or areas dependent of fishing .
At the same time , I would also like to explain that I have voted in favour of an increase in the budget in relation to the reconstruction of Iraq , although I was at the time and continue to be totally against the war , because I believe that we cannot continue to punish the Iraqi people , particularly in view of the serious insufficiencies in basic services for the population which already existed .     – Mr President , Commissioner , and the few honourable Members who are present , I am going to be very brief and I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur , Mrs Figueiredo , on her report .
These States are : Finland , Denmark , Spain and Portugal .
The Community institutions have become , as a result of the principle of subsidiarity , a form of legislative machinery which depends for its execution on the Member States , which means that this uniform and effective implementation depends on the goodwill of those States .
In Spain , the Count of Romanones , who was a minister during the era of the Restoration , at the beginning of the twentieth century , said : ‘laws are for Parliament , but leave the regulations to me’ .
Condoning anything less would amount to rewarding those who infringe Community legislation .
Three options are provided for sugar , but only one for olive oil , tobacco and cotton .
The circumstances surrounding olive oil and tobacco are similar , yet no such proposal has been made for these crops .
It only comes into full production ten years after it is planted .
I wonder if it is aware of the danger of one of the affected producers challenging the regulation in the Court of Justice and rendering it ineffective .
Furthermore , the consequences of decoupling aid run counter to those sections of the Act of Accession of Greece I quoted earlier .
I refer to Mr Alemanno , the Italian Minister .
Some 20 000 families would be affected .
Parliament rejected Amendments Nos 723 and 338.
Mr Jove Peres highlighted this earlier .
