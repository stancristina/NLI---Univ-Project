Or that they are genuinely willing to stop repressing minority groups .
However , if a patent is granted to Myriad Genetics , this will create a monopoly situation for one particular company .
Not only Parliament but also everyone in society who is involved in this has registered objections in this regard .
The mind boggles .
Let us not make it more complicated than it already is : Article 5.1 and Article 5.2 contradict each other .
In March 2000 , I said that Directive 98/44/EC would continue to provoke discussion .
Mr President , Commissioner Vitorino , I should like to make a few observations .
Mr President , installations at risk , such as nuclear power plants , flood-control dams , ports , oil depots , extremely tall buildings and research centres for biological warfare and for genetic manipulation will never lose their appeal for terrorists .
The decision-makers are given the chance to take these into account when taking decisions .
He is right to call for tighter supervision , although that does not rule out a crisis .
Mr President , I was astonished to read the briefing by Parliament ' s Information Office , which presented the Goebbels report as follows : ' In a resolution on the operation of the International Monetary System , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is critical of the introduction of a Tobin tax on financial speculations ' .
In an amendment tabled by my group , a proposal has been formulated in an entirely neutral way that was also formulated in the ECOFIN Council .
Two issues are involved .

( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure ) Proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the People 's Republic of China to the World Trade Organisation [C5-0487/01 - 2001/0218(CNS) ]
We want to involve Parliament to some extent but preferably as little as possible .
However , if all signals are red - and that is the case here - then that should be voiced in this House .
We dropped a huge number of amendments from first reading and concentrated in the committee on a number of compromise texts , on which it must be possible to reach agreement , in our view .
With regard to the sanction provisions , Mr Menrad has also already communicated their importance in order for the directive to be taken really seriously .
If one considers - as they did - that information and consultation are very important , not only to employees but also to employers and to the company ' s performance , then one must ensure that this measure is introduced very promptly .
In any event , that is the state of play .
Over the years , we have discussed many resolutions dealing with the lack of consultation .
That framework directive is also needed - as has been indicated by various people - if we consider what happened to Renault-Vilvoorde , Michelin , Chorus and other companies .

We are making a start this year at micro level by asking all the institutions to draw up a list of negative priorities .
Until such time , and until the seat issue has been solved in another way , we really are stuck with two buildings that need to be altered to cope with a larger number of MEPs .
However , the intention to enlarge by spending tax money in an efficient , effective and desirable manner does merit such praise .
I should like to warmly congratulate the European Commission on the fact that it has already committed itself to this , and I hope that it will set an example for others , including the European Parliament itself .
There is still room for improvement on many levels , including in our House , for example with regard to differentiated waste processing and the use of environmentally-friendly materials , saving electricity and setting up a mobility plan for staff and Members alike .
I hope that this dialogue will be fruitful , so that we can reach an agreement which is satisfactory to everyone , but particularly to the European citizens , of course .
