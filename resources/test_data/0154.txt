We should be in agreement in one further respect too .
After all , as representatives of the people of Europe , we have a supervisory role which we must exercise so as to remain credible .
Firstly , the length of the overall inspection procedure .
I should just like to touch on a few points which are , in my opinion , decisive for the future work of monitoring research in general .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , after nine months ' work and a long struggle for consensus , we now have a draft European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I hope that , even though it can only say yes to this Charter of Fundamental Rights , Parliament will clearly apprise the Council of its demand for this Charter to be made legally binding over coming weeks , so that it can open the way to the European Court of Justice for the citizens of Europe .
But Europe will only progress and find its feet if we are all prepared to help bring about a good result .
If you are successful , it will be a joint success for the European Parliament and all the people in the European Union .
Many new rights for children , the elderly and the disabled are mentioned , together - and I find this most interesting - with a new freedom to conduct a business which is almost tantamount to a sort of ban on socialism .
Madam President , I have championed the Charter of Fundamental Rights from the outset .
The solemn proclamation must pave the way for binding European constitutional law .
In my view this is a failing and it should have been mentioned .
So far , five rounds of talks have taken place .
President Sezar clearly stated why Turkey had no alternative but to embark on this process of reform in his address to the Turkish Government last month and I fully endorse what the Turkish President said .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , may I start , on behalf of my group , by warmly congratulating the two rapporteurs on their reports .
I think that is wrong and I think it is dangerous .
The most important and tangible result so far is that a debate has begun and a certain degree of political differentiation has started to emerge in Turkey .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report troubles me .
The citizens ' Europe we are striving for must establish such recourse .
This is giving rise to an anti-attitude which we cannot afford in the Union , given the large number of Turkish immigrants already living here , and which , given the increase in xenophobia , we must not afford .
At the same time , however , it is clear from Mr Morillon 's report that Turkey is nowhere near meeting these demands .
Mr President , I should like to close the debate by pointing out that there is , of course , a link between the Commission report on the progress that has been made , or not made , in Turkey and the accession partnership .
We changed precisely this last year with the backing of a large majority in the European Parliament .
It is of paramount importance that we understand the advantages of the Barcelona process , i .e . that , with our help , it will trigger the economic and social development needed in these countries , giving prospects to the people living in these regions .
I think responsibility must be vested in very few people if we are to raise the profile of European work on the ground .
Unfortunately , Mr Moscovici was not here when I spoke .
Allow me a brief comment , Mr President : I love France , I love the French and the charm of French men is , as a rule - I repeat , as a rule - unsurpassed .
We must act decisively - albeit with a certain degree of tolerance - both towards Kostunica , whom we shall be receiving here tomorrow , and the new Yugoslav authorities .
NATO professes to have intervened in order to prevent further suffering , and yet there were far more exiles , dead and wounded as a result of this war than there had been in the 12 allegedly decisive months before NATO intervened militarily .
It would have been smarter - if we are to have a common foreign and security policy - if all 15 Member States had taken a joint decision to resume relations with North Korea at the same time and on the same terms , as opposed to this display of showmanship by some Heads of State and Government .
However , the main reason is overexploitation of fish stocks due to the huge catching capacity of the fishing fleets .
They are the most efficient way of ensuring that rules are not ignored .
We need to select a comprehensive modus operandi which takes account of all fisheries activities in the Community , both in EU waters and on the high seas .
I moved on behalf of our group for a split vote , as I personally reject the idea of a compensation fund for pigfarmers .
As for European regulations - as many as are needed , but as few as possible .
We are introducing an insurance system and can easily demonstrate that social aspects play a part .
For a long time this has not been the case .
The proposal makes provision for the fund to be set up by the Member States .
Without doubt , this is , to an extent , the key question in the debate on this proposal and it is addressed in proposed Amendments Nos
