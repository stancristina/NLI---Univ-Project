Mr President , if the mass murderers Arkan and Milosevic were sitting here in the gallery and listening to us , they could rub their bloody hands with glee .
Winter will soon be upon the refugees in the mountains of Kosovo .
Milosevic wants to make them hostages by only allowing aid in special reservations , which he himself controls .
No, Mr President , we must not permit a repetition of the mass murders in Srebrenica , where 7000 men were sacrificed to our policy of cowardice .
If we do not even dare help people in need , then the policy of cowardice has gone too far .
Emergency aid must be sent in convoys by land or by air , with or without authorisation from the UN , and the aid must be protected .
If the convoys are fired on , they must be permitted to defend themselves , and they must be armed to do so .
NATO and the EU were set up to prevent a repetition of those events .
Does that mean that membership of the EU bears no relation to international law and the Vienna Convention ?
That was one point .
Is it really also the view of the presidency of the Council that Sweden is obliged to participate in economic and monetary union and does not have the freedom that the German Bundestag enjoys ?
I agree entirely with you , Mr President , in that the President-in-Office has given an answer to the effect that , if all the other Member States agree , a Member State can terminate its membership , and that is , I suppose , selfevident in law .
At the same time , the President-in-Office referred to Article 240 , which states that the Treaty is concluded for an unlimited period .
I therefore understand the statement of the President-in-Office to mean that the EU Council of Ministers takes the view that a Member State cannot withdraw from the European Union unless all Member States agree .
We are glad of that .
The public interest must weigh more heavily in almost all cases than concern for the confidentiality of past discussions .
Mr President , how can we use the EU to bring more women into work , and how can the EU play a part in ensuring that help is given to women working in casual and precarious forms of employment , under the constant threat of becoming unemployed ?
And at the special summit on employment in Luxembourg , the heads of government committed themselves to taking coordinated action to combat unemployment .
In the new objectives , we must therefore insist on setting more ambitious goals for equal treatment of this kind .
We need clear goals and clear timetables , and the financial resources for achieving them must be made available .
The new objectives must include the following : a drastic reduction in the gender gap in unemployment ; the labour market has to be made less gender-oriented , with affordable childcare schemes ; the training opportunities for women must be improved , and leave arrangements need to be framed in such a way that they also appeal to men ; the differences in pay between men and women must be eliminated .
The bulk of the work is needed in the Member States themselves , but the common objectives should ensure that the Member States have to live up to their promises .
In other words , we should be thinking about equal treatment in relation to all political initiatives at both national and European level .
We must strengthen our common efforts by ensuring that UCLAF and Europol function optimally , we must demand that the Commission work out a common strategy for the fight against fraud , and we must ensure that this common strategy is translated into concrete initiatives .
On the other hand , we must coordinate our action and strengthen the practical cooperation that exists between our countries .
Unfortunately we are discussing an all too topical subject here .
The Commission has some troublesome matters on its conscience at the moment , and that is something that does not exactly enhance the Commission 's already rather tarnished image in the eyes of so many EU citizens - the image of a closed and Ã©litist institution that looks after its own .
In this connection , I would ask the Commission to give an account of a very scandalous affair .
One point is the general disorder that prevailed during the tests , with a lack of supervision of toilet visits and use of mobile phones .
I think it is disgraceful .
I am glad that it has finally been put on the agenda so that we can have a debate on this important subject .
The many cases convey an unmistakable message but , most important , the investigation of the Court of Auditors contains clear criticism of the present situation and gives concrete indications of what can be done .
As regards Mr Santer 's answer today , I have to say that it is no use chiding us for criticising the Commission and complaining that things are moving at a very slow pace .
If Mr Santer had sat with us hour after hour in the Committee on Budgetary Control just trying to get the key information out of the Commission , he would understand our urgent desire to see real action and to see a change in the present procedures .
There is quite simply a need for a more independent office .
So , Mr Santer , what we need is something more concrete from the Commission on what the Commission really intends to do in this area .
It is so crucial to people 's confidence in the EU system that more decisive action be taken on corruption and
