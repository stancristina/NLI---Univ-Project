The volume of programmes dedicated to this in the annual programme lends a suitable importance to those areas because they can provide us with the solid basis that we will need in order to be able to face the challenges we are now presented with .
In moulding a greater Europe we have a significant challenge , but mobility in Europe - student mobility for instance - is still very low .
Only 2 % outside the old Erasmus programme of students are actually mobile in Europe , which is not something upon which we can build a new economy at all .
We are entering the new technological age , and again can I congratulate the Commission and also the Portuguese Presidency on the work that it has done to usher in the technological and informational age .
Again , we need a programme of education that matches the best practice across the whole of Europe .
We cannot develop a whole series of initiatives based on , for instance , small businesses or health on-line or whatever without educating people to be literate in those technologies .
This means perhaps looking again at all our educational programmes to see that they match the programmes we are particularly enthusiastic about .
Can I just , in finishing , say that we will have started four new programmes by the end of this year - Media , Culture 2000 , Youth and Socrates .
I hope that we will evaluate the work that was done in the previous programmes to ensure that these are not just another new layer but are actually a new beginning for the programmes that can present us with an educated European citizenry .
Mr President , I must object in the strongest possible terms to the proposal , within this legislative programme , to reduce the agricultural budget by EUR 300 million for the purpose of rebuilding Kosovo .
While I have every sympathy with the need to rebuild Kosovo , and while I understand fully that the CAP accounts for almost half of the entire expenditure of the EU , I nevertheless object to the agricultural budget being regarded as a well from which water can be drawn each time another department develops a thirst .
I know a guarantee has been given that the removal of this sum from the budget will not affect any of the financial obligations entered into by the Commission within the framework of the CAP , but I just do not believe it .
I do not accept that this will simply be a one-off event .
When farmers in my own constituency of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in more than 100 years , how can I explain to them that this EUR 300 million would be better off spent on Kosovo ?
When farmers are going bankrupt every day in the UK, when the level of suicides amongst farmers and farm-workers has reached unprecedented levels , when the economy of rural Britain is in spiral decline , how can I explain to them that EUR 300 million would be better off spent in Kosovo ?
In such circumstances , it would be mad to slash the budget to this extent .
We should be spending more to alleviate this crisis rather than contemplating spending less .
I urge honourable Members , when we come to vote on this issue , to vote against this proposal .
Mr President , I should like to return to the subject of the annual legislative programme , after that digression on the European budget .
I should like just to address one particular subject , which is the issue of what has happened to the initiatives that Parliament took under Article 192 of the EC Treaty .
As Mr Prodi knows , this new article added to the Treaty by the Maastricht Treaty gave Parliament the right to request the Commission to submit legislative proposals .
The last Parliament exercised this new responsibility on six occasions , but only once did it lead to a legislative proposal being brought forward by the Commission in response to our request , namely the proposals originating in the report of my colleague , Mr Rothley , on insurance for people using their vehicles in other Member States .
That is a very good example , but what happened to the other five ?
It seems that the Commission has not responded .
There is no obligation on the Commission to respond , but we would expect the Commission , in a spirit of cooperation with Parliament , to look at these proposals carefully and to respond in most cases .
One out of six is simply not good enough .
We now have an Intergovernmental Conference looking at the Treaties again .
Following the addition of this article to the Treaty at Maastricht we did not press the Amsterdam IGC to give Parliament a full right of initiative which would enable us to submit a proposal to the Council without going through the Commission .
We were happy with the compromise that Article 192 represented , but if this compromise is felt not to be working , and if it is not seen to be satisfactory from Parliament 's point of view , there will inevitably be pressure for the Treaty to be amended to give Parliament a full right of initiative , something the Commission does not want because it sets great store by its monopoly of the right of initiative .
I say to the Commission , if you do not want that article to be amended further then you must take your responsibilities under the existing article more seriously .
I would urge the Commission in future , when Parliament makes a legislative proposal in this way , to take it up , at least in the majority of cases if not in all
