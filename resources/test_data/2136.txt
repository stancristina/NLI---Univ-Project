We can see this in the right-wing amendments submitted , which seriously limit liability .
Mr President , in my opinion the Council has made a conscientious attempt to reach a balanced result where these accords are concerned .
I understand that the Council has discussed this and also recognised it as a problem , but can this be adequately resolved by leaving it to the Member States ?
This provides an opening for further negotiations .
Is it right that the American Government should refuse to accept the International Criminal Court ?
If the Council is to have its way such trust will have to be placed blindly in a third country outside the borders of the European Union , namely the United States .
But for Member States without a bilateral extradition treaty and for Member States that operate a so-called positive list there will be a sweeping change .
In that case EU citizens would at least be assured of an adequate legal process with guarantees secured within Europe for the trial .
In any case we must always keep the United States at the back of our minds , since that country is an important neighbour of ours .
In addition there is talk of benchmarks - there are a number of internationally recognised benchmarks , by which the neighbouring countries will be measured , and these are consequently mentioned in concrete terms .
Naturally I warmly welcome the latter news .
I hope that the President of the Council will give that point a moment 's thought .
Does this wider Europe in fact relate to these kinds of bilateral agreements , like this common economic area with Russia ?
But what would be the effect if Russia , which after all is a former superpower with a great military capability , were to start playing a major role in European security and defence policy ?
Hopefully the Council and Commission will raise the question of tackling the thoroughly deplorable Chechen terrorism - let there be no misunderstanding on that point - at the forthcoming summit with the Russian Federation .
This augurs well for good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament , in achieving , now and in the future , an effective approach to combating animal disease epidemics .
That does mean , though , an increased risk .
Naturally the legislation permits us to sell our products on the European market under certain conditions but as regards the supermarket chains we are left with question marks .
At the same time I say this with mixed feelings , now that in my own country , but also our neighbours , Germany and Belgium , the spectre of fowl pest has reared its head .
After his report on the foot and mouth crisis he has worked hard to ensure that the list of recommendations that this House submitted last December has been incorporated into the Commission 's proposal .
Meanwhile we are engaged in a legislative process .
One important reason was that political responsibility proved anything but transparent .
This requires a foot and mouth policy in which there is a clear apportionment of responsibilities , regional , national , European and international and with the parliaments also involved .
This requires a minimum of two things ; supermarkets to sell the products and consumers to buy them .
I have paid particular attention when arriving back in Europe from time to time from another continent .
It is particularly disappointing to note that as of now , some two years after the amendment was submitted and carried , the Commission has still not begun this research .
Will that also be covered by future compensation schemes , yes or no ?
In that respect the Commission did do its work .
The EU 's animal disease policy requires re-evaluation .
The Commission continues to opt for culling and at the very most extends the possibilities to emergency vaccination .
The existence of various serotypes of the FMD virus is an argument against preventive vaccination .
.
In 2000 , the international community in North and South agreed that , by 2015 , all children should be able to attend school .
Therefore , they have to - and do - take the lead in policies aimed at sustainability and long-term solutions .
I also understood from his answers that the Commission is in the process of systematically looking into where , within the dormant funds , further possibilities lie for achieving a considerable increase .
It is a success for us all .
My report asks the Commission to report back in a year 's time on the implementation of this resolution , if it is adopted tomorrow , and I am assuming with some confidence that it will be .
Yet there are a number of infuriating aspects , because everything takes so long .
Give a girl or a woman education and you are educating the whole family .
The individual personal development of women also offers more protection against exploitation in all its forms , including prostitution , forced or otherwise , and human trafficking , particularly trafficking in women and children .
Not only are we trying to simplify the guidelines , not only are we here to talk about a three-year period , but we are also trying , as they say , to 'streamline ' them .
I would mention the fact that , since there were 167 amendments to the employment guidelines , some restraint is called for .
In fact , what we need to do in the short term is to consider job sharing again .
Mr President , it was one year ago yesterday that we held a debate on the global economic policy guidelines in this plenary .
During this debate , I made some critical remarks about the economic policy
