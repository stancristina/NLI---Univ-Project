the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats abstained in the vote in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Fraisse .
Sport and the arts are always dropped first .
Every year , 216 000 women suffer from this disease and 79 000 women still die from it even though 90 % of all cases can be cured if they are diagnosed and properly treated at an early stage .
We have to get the right information quicker and get better at exchanging experience .
In Europe , a woman dies of breast cancer every 20 minutes .
Only when the attending physician reads at least 5 000 mammograph screenings per year does he acquire enough training and experience to recognise breast cancer when it is between five and seven millimetres .
Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission , you have plainly been guided by financial constraints on this point .
Information about medical treatment which does not have food safety implications , for example the administering of iron tablets to piglets , does not have to be provided , reducing the amount of information involved .
This anonymity is a cover for business deals that are criminal and practices that only just border on legality and of which the consumer would certainly not approve .
I think it is important that these artisanal small businesses should be recognised in the definition of the Regulation .
This is something that we are all aware of , and that we support .
The problem is that the agenda is adopted on Monday , but not adhered to by Thursday .
( Applause )
On Monday , we decide to debate a matter on Thursday afternoon and Members assume that this debate is going to take place .
Reducing aid through modulation leads to an unreasonable drop in agricultural income .
To that extent we believe it is important to state , having given our agreement to the Oostlander report , that , if and when it comes to a decision on Turkey 's membership of the European Union , it will be up to individuals to decide freely , that any such decision lies in the future , and that our agreement to the Oostlander report in no way forms a preliminary decision anticipating any such decision that may be taken in the future .
Therefore it is not I who have gone against a democratic decision .
Here it is also important that the complainant really does have the opportunity to present his complaint to the Commission in person and to explain it in more detail .
It has happened to every one of us that at some time we have had to defend the relatively small number of officials - some seventeen or eighteen thousand - that the Commission employs , because most of the time they behave towards the public as if they had about a hundred thousand .
It was from there that Islam spread so extensively throughout Asia , and the island has developed a very strong and healthy sense of identity .
Military might , political persecution and taking away the freedom of people who , in defiance of all repressive measures , continue to fight for democracy - all these must not be tolerated .
I myself was able to experience the escalation in violence when I visited the country on the occasion of the parliamentary elections as an election observer , albeit under the wrong label , because I was not recognised as representing the European Union .
I would like to emphasise , however , that , in a secret ballot , a good quarter of those present at the ACP meeting agreed with us , and some delegates even dared to say so openly , and to condemn , very forcefully , what is happening in Zimbabwe .
I am very much in favour of our attempting , jointly , under French leadership , to restore peace in the Congo , but I would also like to say clearly that we cannot accept it when France , on the subject of Zimbabwe , has for years prevented or delayed effective measures or has actively blocked them .
Citizens must be able to identify which areas can be regulated by the European Union and which cannot .
This constitution cannot be a copy of any nation-state 's constitution .
Walter Hallstein was right , as always , when he said that European union is a creatio continua - an ongoing process of creation .
I believe that a Europe of citizens has also been created .
From my perspective , we can indeed describe it as a milestone in the history of European integration , and I would like to take this opportunity to thank both of them particularly for their work in the delegation and their work in the Convention 's Praesidium .
We cannot allow the Constitution to be undermined even before it enters into force !
If we were to receive such clear signals , this would strengthen the Middle East peace process as well .
There have to be the right actors on both sides , and of course there also has to be pressure from the United States on Israel .
He must show this determination even in an election year .
What we certainly need is support for Palestine 's security .
Bit by bit , right up to the Cologne Summit , and , beyond that , in Saint-Malo and on many other occasions , we learned the necessary lessons from this , which have now enabled us to progress further .
It will not be the first strategy , or first draft of a strategy , to be presented , and it will certainly not be the last
