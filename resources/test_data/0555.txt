The forests maintain a living countryside , various industries and much small enterprise , which provides employment .
The strategy presents opportunities for the EU to promote environmentally benign exploitation of forests in contexts other than the allocation of regional funding .
The EU can be actively involved in bringing influence to bear on the establishment of an international certification system which takes account of the special features of each country .
The use of wood and biofuels as energy sources , with the aid of advanced technology , could afford new opportunities for the creation of a greener Europe .
The EU Member States have also committed themselves to these .
Mr President , the painful genesis of the Thomas report at least showed that the forestry issues which arise in the various regions of the Union are very different .
As you know , this article is a kind of black hole by means of which the European Union draws power away from the Member States .
In their own proposals , the Greens stress that the forests must be considered in a balanced manner from the points of view of sustainable use , social benefit and environmental protection .
In this way the Commission could also help to ensure that this system is adapted to European conditions .
In this way it might also be possible to find money to protect Scandinavia 's last surviving ancient forests .
I know this work has not always been easy .
However , there should be certain common principles to enable us to safeguard the sustainable use of forests .
To this end , a common strategy is needed which takes into account and reconciles the varies types of use to which forests are put and need to be put .
But forests are also valuable and important as a renewable resource , a source of raw materials and energy for many different industries .
One of the things which should be done at European level is to organize joint research into the development of forestry resources and the health of forests .
We need to know what this money is being used for and what our priorities are .
All Member States of Union have common interests in the state of the forests and their use ; the forests serve to bind carbon dioxide , prevent erosion and provide opportunities for recreation .
We should also not forget the spiritual values they possess , either .
Finland 's national wealth has been generated with the aid of forest-based production over the past 150 years .
To my mind this is a practical demonstration that it has always been a vital necessity to us Finns , as it still is today , to take good care of our national resources , our forests .
From these points of view , the report does not entirely come up to my hopes .
The report also recommends that consideration be given to setting up a European forestry school .
I cannot support this idea , because in my opinion forestry education is already adequately organized within the territory of the Union , right up to university level .
Although the current improved version of the report still does not take enough account of the Nordic point of view , it is nonetheless considerably better than the original version , and I therefore consider that it should be adopted .
It has been proposed that France , Germany and the UK inter alia , be given the right of veto .
Mr President , racism is one of the most destructive phenomena in society .
Consequently , every individual , especially we as politicians , and similarly every Member State , has a responsibility to act to eradicate racism .
It is important that this year is being observed as the Year Against Racism , but that is not enough - where racism is concerned we need to be constantly vigilant , even when this year is over .
However , I should also like to remind you that in every Member State of the EU there are other ethnic minorities who are daily subjected to discrimination and racism .
I should hope , for example , that the European Union and Commissioner Flynn will take action on this matter and step up cooperation for example with the Council of Europe , thus enabling the European Union and the Council of Europe to combine their resources to this end .
I am pleased that Finland has shown the will and preparedness to engage in multilateral cooperation in this field , which is covered by the Maastricht Third Pillar .
It is worth asking whether it is sensible for endless resources to be spent on processing asylum applications in each Member State even when the applicant may already have been refused asylum in another Member State .
Given that the central idea of European integration is the creation of a safe living environment and securing freedom of movement for Europe 's people , it is essential that the Union should be able to demonstrate credibly that it has the will and the means to defend the right of European citizens to enjoy the fruits of those principles without the threat of terrorism .
Recent terrorist acts show that the EU must concentrate particularly on eliminating terrorism by Islamic extremists and on obtaining and training experts in this field .
The most important support for culture comes from the structural funds through the regional development programmes .
A rich diversity is at the core of the European identity .
We do not need any standardizing Euro-culture .
In terms of the EU 's cultural and educational policy , respecting the subsidiarity principle means striving towards common objectives on the basis of our own cultural identity and in the framework of our own structures .
For this reason I do not particularly like the idea of setting up
