They are used for food and for natural medicine , and this , of course , quite obviously threatens these species ’ long-term prospects for survival .
Something had to happen .
What the EU will , in actual fact , do is of course a matter for speculation .
The fact is , the EU has not done much other than make payments and adopt statements .
Secondly , I wish to support what was said just now about giving the Geneva Agreement a much clearer status on this road map .
It seems , in fact , that a terrorist is being defined as someone who kills himself .
It cannot help that we continue to engage in double-speak in this connection .
The way things are now heading , we are not going to have two viable states .
The report’s nicely polished exterior is , however , a legal ‘Potemkin facade’ .
It is that outcome , and not a concern for justice , that gives the project impetus here in Parliament .
Federalism in conjunction with supranational power means , however , a weakening of the legal systems that have their democratic basis in the Member States .
Secondly , the report overlooks the threats to the rule of law presented by the construction in recent years of huge police and monitoring systems – Schengen , Europol etc – which cannot be monitored and of which it is impossible to take an overall view .
There is nothing in the report about this .
That is a quotation from one of , in all , eleven amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left which , together , serve to remedy the report’s striking deficiencies in one practical field , namely respect for immigrants and asylum seekers .     The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted against Mr Leinen’s motion for a resolution ( B6-0067/2004 ) .
Over and above this , we do not think it is the Council’s task to develop best practice in terms of parliamentary scrutiny and referendum campaigning .
We are nonetheless aware that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not therefore apply to Denmark , cf . the protocol on Denmark 's position .     Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , I wish firstly to say thank you to Commissioner Schreyer , who is taking part in her last budget reading today , and , in common with Mr Garriga , I find that quite sad .
There was almost a chill in the air on entering a committee room to talk about budgetary matters , because relations were not good after the fall of the Santer Commission .
I think that , through your way of working , Mrs Schreyer , and through the way in which you have tackled things , you have made a very large contribution to rebuilding trust between Parliament and the Commission .
You deserve thanks for that .
I really do think there have been fantastic successes throughout these five years .
We together decided , Mr Garriga and I , to follow a strategy in which we tried to find as many funds as possible under expenditure heading five so that we might return many of the savings agreed by the Council and so be able to meet the desire for staff increases as a result of enlargement , staffing reform and changes to financial management .
We have , then , returned close on two thirds of the Council’s savings , and that in actual fact makes it possible for all the institutions to implement the desired staff appointments as a result of enlargement and staffing reform and the reform of financial management .
I think it was especially unfair that the Council’s savings hit the budgets for the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor .
On the other hand , we have only a very modest margin below the ceiling for the administrative expenditure .
I understand that new statistics from Eurostat show that wages will increase less than we had originally expected in 2005 .
We have also , in different institutions , investigated the possibility of whether , through accelerated payments this year , we might help create some leeway in the budget for next year .
Last but not least , the institutions should of course continually ensure that administration takes place as efficiently and inexpensively as possible so that financial surpluses are prevented through cooperation between the institutions .
Where Parliament’s budget is concerned , we have kept this down to 20 % of administrative expenditure , that is to say 20 % of the money under expenditure heading five .
I nonetheless wish to emphasise that , in recent years , it has been possible , within our budget – that is to say , within the 20 % – for Parliament to expend quite a significant amount on buildings , thereby saving ourselves rent in future years ’ budgets .
We are in the process of having two new buildings constructed in connection with Parliament’s building in Brussels .
There is still the hope that it will soon be possible for a statute of members , which will guarantee MEPs uniform financial conditions , to be adopted for Parliament .
It is uncertain to how many MEPs a statute of members will apply at first , for there will obviously be a number of transitional arrangements .
A figure with what is called a ‘p.m. ’ ( ) is quoted .
At the moment , some investigative committee work is under way in which we are looking at whether our rules can be written out in a clearer and more easily understandable way , and we in the Committee on Budgets have entered the amount for increasing the secretariats ’ remuneration in the reserve while we await an actual decision
