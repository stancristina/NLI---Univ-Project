, under the EU system , we give direct transport subsidies to these long transports of livestock .
I hope that the majority of Parliament will show that it is considerations of animal welfare that are crucial in connection with the transports .     The June Movement has voted in favour of Amendment No 39 .
We did not want to see the clause on education removed but , in our judgment , the ability of the Member States to take further steps is a consideration that must weigh more heavily than our position that the EU must not interfere in issues of education .     – Mr President , 25 countries have now agreed to prepare an EU Constitution by 17 June .
Compromises have already been negotiated behind the scenes , and a double majority , with population as a decisive element , has been approved as a principle .
There are also negotiations concerning a smaller Commission from 2014 , so that not all countries will any longer have a member of the Commission .
We propose instead that all countries retain one Commissioner , and that the Commissioner be elected by , and be answerable to , the national parliaments in order to uphold the democratic principle .
We also want to see the EU slimmed down , with most of the 100 000 pages of EU legislation scrapped and the Member States legislating on all matters that do not have a cross-border dimension .
In cases where we are ourselves unable to act , we have no democracy to lose , but we can instead gain joint influence where we should otherwise be powerless .
My experience from all the group visits and meetings is that the minority 's fifteen points correspond much better to the attitude of the majority of voters .
Adieu , Giscard d'Estaing .
See you at the referendums on the EU Constitution .
Finally , I should like to congratulate Bertie Ahern on the appointment of our old colleague Mr Gijs de Vries as Counter-terrorism Coordinator .
He is someone in whom I have confidence , in contrast to the head of OLAF , who steals computers and telephone and address books to reveal journalists ’ sources .     – Mr President , if good intentions and earnest words could change the world , Mrs Boumedienne-Thiery’s congenial report would constitute a revolution .
It is the same refrain that underlies this report , namely the notion that rights are derived from words .
What also strikes me in this report is a detail of the tribute paid to the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Its doing so would have achieved the same result .
I quote the report : ‘[ The proposal ] will make the SIS an even more prominent instrument to fight crime and … [promote ] work towards the progressive establishment of the area of freedom , security and justice . ’ Despite this , the legal basis for the proposal is transport policy – to which I am returning – namely Article 71.
I shall confine my remarks to three points .
First , regarding the Schengen project in general , which of course constitutes the most extensive system in world history of supervision and political and social control .
From annual reports and surveys , we know that , in 2001 , the Schengen Information System’s database contained more than ten million individual pieces of information .
Anyone with the slightest sense of justice must pose the following questions : Who may record what ?
A reading of the texts supplies no certain answers .
What , for example , is the meaning of Article 96 where , according to one of the conditions , people’s presence is assumed to constitute a threat to public order .
What is termed the Joint Supervisory Authority has , in several annual reports , expressed its lack of ability to function independently .
The Supervisory Authority possesses neither the independence nor the resources necessary for the system to function effectively and affords only modest guarantees in connection with the collection and exchange of information that takes place in the SIS and the even more advanced SIRNE system .
I turn now to my two supplementary questions to the acting Commissioner .
The legal basis that I mentioned earlier completes the farce .
It is Article 71 , which deals with transport policy .
Finally , in my own little country , Denmark , we have a special regulation pertaining to the extension of Schengen cooperation or the Schengen regulations .
The mysterious legal basis is possibly the explanation of why the Danish Council representative , with whom I talked today , simply declared himself unfamiliar with the proposal .
The report states that the basic view is that , insofar as it wishes to do so , Turkey is in a position to transform itself into a first-class EU Member State .
If Turkey transforms itself , the country will become other than it is , but the question is of course one of whether such a transformation is at all possible .
The admission of countries outside Europe has never seriously been debated , and it is hardly possible or desirable to create such extensive cooperation within the framework of the treaties that constitute the basis of the EU.
I must say , moreover , that I do not believe in the value of the Annan plan .
I think Mr Verheugen is mistaken if he thinks that the Greek Cypriots are adherents of this plan .
I do not believe that the Greek Cypriots will be able to accept a plan that gives Turkey a foothold on the island .
This implies a total change to the Turkish constitution , its penal law , its legislation on marriage , its religious legislation , and so forth .
Change cannot be brought about merely through economic aid .
