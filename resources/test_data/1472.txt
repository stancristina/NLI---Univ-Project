In the EU , we do not accept Beijing’s occasionally threatening stance towards Taiwan .
It is a country in which people continue to be detained and to disappear , their families kept in the dark .
China deserves nothing less , and therefore the embargo is a useful tool to have in place until China faces up to what happened on those fateful days in June 1989 and until it stops exporting arms to , and supporting , regimes that massacre and oppress their people , as in the cases of Sudan and Myanmar .
Nevertheless , any eco-labelling of fisheries products caught on the basis of criteria other than those laid down in existing legislation concerning the fishing catch may lead to discrimination between producers .
What is needed is to set up a public certification framework with the direct involvement of the authorities in the Member States .
Among the different proposals put forward by the Commission in this communication , the one that can best serve the interests at hand is that of establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes .
This is incompatible with a system in which the Commission has a secondary role and in which publicity concerns carry greater weight than a series of tight , objective criteria .
This will put the Union in a stronger position as regards not only the prevention of , and fight against , terrorism , but also the protection of fundamental rights .
I should like to underline the example of the agreements with Australia and Canada , which we find acceptable in terms of proportionality , which sets appropriate limits as regards scope , time , and amount of data , and which is subject to monitoring by a judicial authority .
For example , a systematic survey and study of this heritage and the recognition of its variety and versatility , the creation of a legislative framework to guarantee its protection , incorporating incentives for the conservation of traditional buildings , financial assistance , the continuation of traditional activities such as farming and arts and crafts , the conservation of traditional professions and local know-how , the restoration of natural habitats and architecture , the training of craftsmen , the adoption of new methods and techniques , the promotion of initiatives as part of the framework of Community programmes aimed at creating a European heritage inventory , and , lastly , the promotion of all the tangible and intangible elements that make up this heritage .
Unsurprisingly , the majority in Parliament has adopted a resolution on EU-China relations , which , in its many paragraphs , barely contains any reference to bilateral relations , opting instead for a policy on China of blatant interference .
On the one hand , this is a totalitarian State that shows no respect for human rights , nor the slightest concern for humanitarian issues , the environment , integrated development , promoting freedom or respect for the minimum values of the human race .
As the debate has shown , the creation of eco-labelling for fisheries products raises important issues .
Such fisheries products must not under any circumstances be captured , let alone put on sale .
Lasting peace in the Middle East is dependent on respect for the rights of the Palestinian , Syrian and Lebanese people to their own sovereignty .     .
Peace in the Middle East can only be built between peoples , countries and States that are free and democratic , responsible for their own acts and capable of administering their own territory .
This will not stand in the way of peace , but will simply stop people from being naïve .     .
Normally we would be feeling refreshed and raring to go .
The Member States are responsible for emergency management on their territory , and they must be held to account when they do not do everything in their power to prevent such disasters .
We must be resolute in the fight against the fires , in the fight against the destruction of property and our forests , and in preserving the future .     .
Furthermore , resistance has grown to the destructive policies of the IMF , the World Bank and the WTO and to the multinationals ’ all-consuming domination .
In economics , utopias tend to be dangerous and rash behaviour expensive .
Included in these data are 34 categories of information , for example : hotel and travel bookings , telephone numbers , email addresses , private and work addresses , favourite foods , numbers of credit cards , and many others .
An agreement between the EU and the USA on the use of passenger name records is urgently required , in light of the impending legal vacuum from 1 October 2006 .
There are measures that must be taken quickly , based on clear , precise principles , to protect our citizens from any attack on their lives , their property and their fundamental rights .
As regards the civic participation of civil society , I feel it is important to highlight the emphasis that Mr Sifunakis places on the need to involve local people in preparing and implementing policies , some of which are in the report , as follows : a systematic study of the cultural heritage and the creation of a legal framework for its protection ; funding to restore local monuments and traditional farming methods ; comprehensive restoration of traditional habitats and traditional forms of architecture ; and know-how and traditional professions passed down through the generations .
I wish to congratulate Mr Sifunakis on his important and timely report on the protection of the European natural and architectural heritage in Europe’s rural and island regions , to which I lend my
