one has the right to appropriate a work of art and deprive society as a whole of it , let alone remove it from the environment in which it was created .
I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission if , having merely indicated its serious intentions , it now plans to take action to facilitate the return of the Parthenon marbles .
It is not just that consumer confidence was lost when these three successive crises occurred ; we also watched as consumers restructured their consumer habits , we watched as numerous companies which never imagined they would be excluded from the market folded and we watched as several thousand people who were in no way to blame lost their jobs .
We did not seriously evaluate the attitude towards events and developments on the part of senior politicians , technicians and technocrats and high-level departments in the Member States , with their silence , their cover-ups , their misunderstandings , their failure to act and their calculated recourse to free trade .
This service is not an authority , it is a sort of intergovernmental consultancy service .
However , when it comes to international trade and free trade , then the discussion becomes somewhat obscure .
So all this restricts the role of the service under discussion .
However , I have one reservation .
At the start of this new decade , a new multipower system is gradually taking shape before our very eyes and , as the European Union , we should make this our strategic choice .
And we , whose job is to send a message not just to the nations of Europe with ideological and political problems , but to the entire world , must act as a force for peace , as a force for cooperation , as a force for progress and as a force for democracy by strengthening the procedures which civilise the world without creating conflict , without there being any cause for conflict and without starting by using military conflict or considerations in order to bring about democratic results .
That is not the point .
Conspicuous by its absence is any reference whatsoever to the fact that peace in the area is in jeopardy now that the United States has stepped up its aggression towards China , as seen in the NMD , the new US defence philosophy , flights on spying missions , the visits by the Dalai Lama and the President of Taiwan .
But the report does not omit to call - twice - for visas to be granted to members of the government of Taiwan , thereby mimicking the American tactic on this issue .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Galeote , on his highly detailed and substantiated report .
And in order for this to happen , the diplomatic services and delegations of the Union and of the Member States will need to be properly coordinated .
I should also like to ask the Council how it intends to react to the fact that Turkey is being obstructive and refusing to enshrine equal opportunities in its constitution .
However , I think that we should not be too optimistic when it comes to competition .
In other words , we want a universal service which is accessible to all and of the same standard for all .
We have also called for proper consultation with consumer associations when reviewing the conditions under which licences are granted .
He must be able to keep his telephone number , which the Commission is quite right to propose , and he must be able to change company without incurring charges .
We need general principles which specifically protect consumers because that is the way to make better progress here .
Secondly , because abolishing tobacco subsidies in order to combat smoking is a hypocritical approach .
.
However , in reality , the summit will be held under the shadow of the recent referendum in Ireland , in which the people rejected the Nice Treaty .
The state of the European economy , the fall in the euro and other economic issues will be addressed with even stricter anti-grass roots measures than before , at the expense of the workers , by speeding up capital restructuring and hitting the insurance systems , so as to safeguard the competitiveness and profitability of big business in Europe , thereby creating more poverty , unemployment and insecurity for the people of Europe .
This is the Europe of their visions ; by no stretch of the imagination is it the Europe of the workers .
It distorts reality in a desperate bid to convince the people that all this is for their own good .
And to prove just how meddlesome it is , the European Parliament has seen fit to commend the Commission 's proposal that tobacco subsidies gradually be abolished .
( EL ) The group of MEPs from the Panhellenic Socialist Party voted against part two of article 23 of the motion on preparation for the European Council in Gothenburg because it feels that abolishing tobacco growing in Europe , which is the aim of this provision , will not have the slightest effect on the overall quantities of tobacco used by the European tobacco industry , given that the European share of the supply ( approximately 30 % of the total ) will immediately be replaced by imports from countries outside the European Union , at the expense of European producers .
( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I shall be reporting on the proposal for the Erika II package , the purpose of which is to create a European Maritime Safety Agency to provide the Commission with support in applying and monitoring compliance with measures and in assessing their effectiveness
