As you know , the largest surpluses were found in the Structural Funds .
Needless to say , it is still a general resolution and the ultimate choices are still before us .
I can say that my group will be verifying the final Budget against at least three items .
The tenor of the FÃ¤rm report is more and still more money for the EU 's policies .
The EU should confine its remit to those areas of policy where European action clearly has added value .
What happens , however , with the millions of illegal immigrants who have never applied for asylum ?
For the ratification , this means that national parliaments have to like it or lump it .
Our PSE Group stresses that it should be the Palestinian people who decide on their leadership , and not President Bush , but we deeply regret that hundreds of Europeans who wanted to support the peace process were denied access to Israel , and we continue to call for a political dialogue involving two states , Israel and the Palestine , which are both safe and both democratic .
Expanding co-financing to 20 % is acceptable for this purpose , but no funding should be claimed from this amount for any other projects .
The incineration of these fossil fuels is a major contributing factor to global warming .
( NL ) Nuclear energy is a very controversial issue , but following years of inactivity in the wake of the Harrisburg and Chernobyl disasters , attempts are once again being made to build new nuclear plants .
However , if we include these two aspects , then we will have to label just about everything , and I wonder whether we are helping the consumer in this way .
Are we then certain that we will have a really good label ?
Moreover , a lack of finances is often the reason why people have no food .
This is not the first discussion about food and GMOs in which I happen to be heavily involved .
The proposal we are discussing today does not give the consumer any freedom of choice , but neither does current practice , despite claims to the contrary .
What is now new is that all additions to the end product that theoretically originate from , or are processed by means of , GMOs , now have to be labelled .
We should also realise that we thus accord genetic modification a definite place in food production .
In all recent food legislation , we have made certain that imports from third countries must meet European standards .
Unilever and the governments of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands prefer to leave things as they are .
I should like to thank the Commissioner for his answer .
In my view , Parliament has fought with him a successful battle towards a breakthrough in Doha on this score .
Residents of this estate were unaware of the presence of the fireworks factory .
Thirdly , cooperation and coordination in Brussels must be improved , because we need to draw as many lessons as possible from near disasters .
The duty to communicate applies just as much to ourselves , the Commission and national authorities .
It is of great importance that dangerous operations , should , in due course , be separated from residential areas or other areas frequently visited by the public .
First of all , this report does not call for harmonisation of legislation at European level .
It would be rather bizarre if we argued this on behalf of the developing countries , with European voices falling silent the moment we talked about our own policy .
I therefore urge you to learn from each other without the need to harmonise .
This information should be about forming relationships and about how to relate to each other in a responsible manner .
The third track is the most controversial of the three .
I hope that these attempts will be rewarded tomorrow and that the Commission will lend its support in order to launch an initiative .
The provision of sexual information is essential to avoid unwanted pregnancies and diseases .
Those who do not support this create the possibility of very vulnerable women and girls once again ending up in little backrooms with knitting needles in the foreseeable future .
In some countries , it is still completely impossible these days to terminate a pregnancy in a legal and safe manner .
Every policy-maker must be acutely aware of their educational role and it is exactly for that reason that we must also prevent pregnancy from in future becoming something one either does or does not have insurance for .
Parliament is imposing on the candidate countries its own time-limited standards regarding abortion , contraception and sexual education concerning free sex .
The lateness of the hour and the limited speaking time oblige me to confine myself to one single reason from a nonetheless long list of reasons for rejecting this report , and for the sake of convenience , I will therefore pass over the fact that Parliament has no authority whatsoever in the fundamental matters underlying this report , and what is before us should really be considered as a kind of ideological occupational therapy , as the umpteenth violation of the subsidiarity principle and as an attempt to force the practice of abortion on the candidate countries as some kind of acquis communautaire , which is wholly unacceptable .
As has been stated before , Europe has no competence in this area .
I have received many negative reactions from various European countries , in eastern and western Europe alike , and even today from the European Forum of National Laity Committees in Erfurt .
Despite the few improvements , it is too one-sided and sometimes incorrect , in my view .
Our group has tabled compromise amendments
