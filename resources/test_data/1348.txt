security services in Europe .
I would like to see national police services backed up by a genuine , efficient , effective European police service .
I was travelling around Europe and who was I protected by ?
The Konrad report brings this dream closer , as it will reduce the price of all cars sold in Europe .
Naturally , I shall accept Parliament 's decision , since it is entitled to silence an MEP or tell him what to say and how to speak in a parliament if it wants to .
Madam President , I voted for the Howitt report on corporate social responsibility , especially for paragraph 13 , since , here , Mr Howitt calls for all pension funds to state their ethical criteria in their investment policies .
Of particular interest is the proposal to create an EU platform for corporate social responsibility that brings together the various stakeholders , making it possible to register codes of conduct , and offering arbitration between companies , individuals and the Community whenever the codes are violated .
However , I regret to say that we are a parliament which is not free even to decide on this matter .
What is outrageous is that , not even in a hazardous situation , is Parliament able to decide in which location we should meet .
I feel that this is a point which should be addressed , something which is an outrage for all of us .
Mr President , I am afraid the best has not been saved for last , as the saying goes , for I have to inform Mr Schultz - this being the world cup season - that a thundering own-goal has been scored .
Mr President , I would like to say to Mr Duff that I am one of those conservative people , although I belong to neither the Group of the Party of European Socialists nor the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
The truth of the matter , as things stand in Parliament , is that all those lengthy , tedious voting sessions are essentially the result of poor preparation in committee .
His task was to simplify Parliament 's work and make it more transparent , not least in order to make it easier for public opinion , for the general public to understand .
The seven Members of the Bonino List , the seven radical Members , for instance , elected by over two and a half million Italian citizens , have not been able to table even a single amendment to the Corbett report purely on our own behalf , such that we have had to ask two group chairman to grant us the favour of - symbolically - allowing us to table symbolic amendments together with them - and I would like to thank them for this .
I feel that this evening 's debate confirms the need for us to change the way we work in the European Parliament .
At the end of the Convention 's work , we will certainly have to compare our work on the Rules of Procedure with the decisions taken on the legislative procedures .
The second is that on no account can the European Parliament arrogate to itself the right to pass judgment on the allegations themselves in the manner of a sort of court .
They use the independence and lack of institutional accountability they enjoy as a shield for what are , in fact , political actions .
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group , I can only fully support this approach and recommend that Mr MacCormick and Mr Duff 's reports be adopted without any amendment .
The request was considered in that case as being made by a foreign authority and having to be communicated through the government and its diplomatic representations .
This interpretation has now been included in the Duff report as a general solution , and it is therefore proposed to amend the Rules of Procedure to give Members the right to request that their immunity and privileges be defended , thus affording greater protection of privileges and immunity .
Therefore , in order to contain and resolve the issue of social exclusion , specific actions have been proposed based on the four specific Nice objectives , which include the action to help the vulnerable , people with disabilities and elderly people who are not self-sufficient .
In this regard , I would point out that there is a desire on the part of these countries to cooperate in the management of immigration policy , and this is important for us if we want to protect the Union 's external borders , but we cannot , as Europeans , focus solely on this aspect : we must also be open to discussions with these countries on how and under what conditions managed , lawful immigration is possible .
Often , however , European governments ' policies run counter to these principles , and that could place us in a position of conflict with these countries too .
Mr President , cooperation between the European Union and the Maghreb countries must be based on a number of basic principles .
With regard to the majority of them , we believe that we cannot make any exception to the fundamental ideals relating to growth and civilisation in which we firmly believe and which Parliament has never failed to uphold .
In particular , a Member State may introduce requirements for voluntary , unpaid donations , including the restriction of imports of blood and blood components ' .
In addition , still on the subject of voluntary unpaid donations , some of the Members called for the Council of Europe definition to be included in the text , particularly in Article 3
