Then , according to the experts , we were on the verge of a financial collapse , and we were on the threshold of another great depression .
We can do a great deal for them on many aspects , and I would like to specifically focus on confronting protectionism .
As a result , we need a common policy , which has still not been developed .
The response must involve legal migration , as an alternative to illegal immigration .
Mr President , Mr Billström , Commissioner Barrot , the start of this legislative term offers us an excellent opportunity to rethink our immigration policy .
Mr President , Mrs Malmström , ladies and gentlemen , this is my first time before the House in this new legislative term .
The G20 's contribution to the development of a coordinated response has been vital in avoiding an even deeper recession than the one we are currently experiencing .
A few days after the Washington Summit last year , the Commission proposed the European Economic Recovery Plan , which received the political support of the European Council in December .
We can now confirm that these stimulus plans , together with the very significant monetary stimuli adopted by the central banks , plus the mobilisation of public resources in support of financial institutions , particularly the banks , have managed to halt the economy 's freefall .
It may be said that we are witnessing a radical change in tone after nearly three decades dominated by the model of deregulation and theories on the alleged infallibility of the financial markets .
Others are currently being discussed in this House and by the Council and , by the end of the year , the Commission plans to adopt another series of proposals , starting next week , one day before the Pittsburgh Summit , with the proposal to create the European Systemic Risk Board and three European micro-supervisory authorities , based on the recommendations of the de Larosière report , which both the Council and the Commission have taken on board .
The public expect guarantees that the financial institutions and their executives will be required to comply with rules , particularly on pay , which will prevent them from once again endangering the financial system and the real economy as a whole .
It must be said that the European Union is totally united on this point .
A great deal more progress has been made in the space of six months than over many years before that .
As you know , the Commission adopted a communication on the financing of climate change last week .
The next step in the coordination of economic policy must be to define an exit strategy and commit to a decision as to when and how this strategy will be applied in a coordinated manner .
However , I also fully agree with those who say that the issue of pay is extremely important in economic , social , political and ethical terms .
However , without a functioning financial system , nothing else can be sustained .
It is therefore true that not everything has been solved in these six months .
To date , no one has recognised his error , and the blame has instead been placed on the United States .
In Greece , 130 000 olive trees were destroyed by the fires , as well as many hectares of vines , cattle , beekeeping holdings , storehouses , stables and a large number of greenhouses and houses .
This means that this is not an internal issue of Lithuanian policy .
I voted against the report on a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Tajikistan because the EU is only interested in that country for its natural resources and its geostrategic position , given that Tajikistan has borders with Afghanistan and China .
The proposal to end the milk quota scheme in 2015 , and until then to increase the quota by 1 % per year , will , in practical terms , legalise the surpluses which already exist in certain countries , which are being produced above their quotas and which are then exported at very low prices , pushing down market prices , in many countries below the cost of production .
This is therefore something new compared to the 2009 budget .
With regard to research and the Seventh Framework Programme , as in previous years , we have demonstrated prudence and asked that , now that fisheries research no longer has its own heading in the budget , at least the percentage of investment should not decrease , as all decisions on fisheries management hinge on knowledge of the environment and of marine species , especially given that one of our new objectives is to apply an ecosystem-based approach to all legislation in the Common Fisheries Policy .
He has placed no pressure on Israel or Morocco to comply with international legislation .
Such a move would please me all the more because the Commission has already taken that step , as has the Committee on Fisheries .
A few months have passed and we have received quite a few reports from NGOs , trade unions and citizens about one of the four countries that have received very significant amounts of assistance to public finances : EUR 6.5 billion , 3.1 billion , 2.2 billion and 5 billion .
Why have we had to lend them money ?
We cannot , for better or for worse , take decisions which are the responsibility of the governments and parliaments of those countries .
In part , of course , this derives from the crisis , but as a result of past mismanagement , it is much greater than in other countries where conditions are , objectively speaking , similar .
What is our alternative , then , as representatives of European
