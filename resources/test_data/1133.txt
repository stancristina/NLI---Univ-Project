Baroness Ashton , thank you for the statements you have made .
Those who would question the unity of the country threaten the stability of Macedonia , Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Madam President , Minister Magnette , Mrs Damanaki , ladies and gentlemen , this is the second time today the House has discussed this issue and the possible risks associated with oil exploration and oil extraction off the coast of Europe .
My aim is to clarify the European legal framework and to bring it to a new level .
We need a new model , greater synergy and more efficient cooperation , perhaps even a system for auditing the auditors .
However , catastrophes such as this suggest that the entire issue of energy should be examined .
We would be happy to work on this .
Despite the expansion of our rail networks over the coming decades , oil will continue to be the key source of energy in air transport , for both passengers and cargo , and in the surface transport of heavy goods .
The issue at stake there is market value and certain possible changes .
However , it is now clear that the time was right and that the correct action was taken .
The group included victims , people who themselves had lost a leg or had suffered other serious health problems because of cluster munitions .
The major fluctuations in the liberalised markets and the effects of climate change continue to necessitate a safety net .
The fact of the matter is that , under the new Rules of Procedure , this report was introduced and voted on very quickly .
The European Aviation Safety Agency will , in future , play a crucial role in this and we also need to strengthen this agency in this regard .
Anyone who rejects this agreement accepts the fact that we will have 27 different legal standards in the European Union which are not monitored as closely as would be the case at European level .
Thank you very much , Mr Kazak .
We must show solidarity in the financing of these measures , and the EU must speak with one voice and not 27 different ones .
Under no circumstances must we be cursed with agricultural or forestry monocultures .
This makes it all the more important for us to take the necessary precautions .
The Commission wants to take action at an early stage in order to ensure that we have a common approach to our external energy relationships .
The Commission 's role has been reinforced , but it is not the sole decision maker .
It is also important that we do not get bogged down in discussions on modifying the treaty .
I would like to raise three points with the aim of looking to the future .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this debate , which began with the subject of gas and gas storage , has taken on a more general character and has expanded to cover energy policy as a whole .
It is clear that as long as the energy mix is primarily a matter for the Member States , we are dependent on the sums done by the politicians in the Member States for our forecast of how much gas will be used to generate electricity and what our gas requirements are .
The fact is that we are mutually dependent .
Or are we divided ?
I am pleased to be able to say to you all that we will implement the regulation quickly and , in the report which is planned for four years ' time , we will analyse its strengths and weak points and present our final conclusions as to whether it will make sense to develop the regulation further and expand its content .
Do you believe that this is the right course of action ?
Combating illegal immigration should be a matter of course for every state , rather than a form of pressure .
Even in the area of enforcing intellectual property rights , there is still work to be done in order to comply with the treaties .
The problem is simply that the liberal visa policy of France and Italy has also opened the door to the rest of the Schengen area .
Against the background of the increasing asphalting and concreting over of farmland for roads , buildings and industrial installations , we need measures to safeguard agriculture throughout the whole of Europe .
It must also be possible for these countries to diversify their economies so that they are not dependent on imports .
Europe must fulfil its responsibilities .
Therefore , we need a strategy for the sustainable use of biocides which provides information about alternatives .
If we reduce the number of active substances , resistance among parasites and insects will increase , with fatal consequences .
One of the main problems is that we do not have an EU authorisation system for biocides .
We must make a decision which supports the cause of consumers , otherwise we will be putting people 's health at risk .
Under the terms of Article 81 of the Rules of Procedure , we are submitting to you today an interim report on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2007-2013 .
As we all know , the Treaty of Lisbon has assigned new tasks to the European Union , ranging from the External Action Service to space policy .
I believe that we must keep the different problems separate from one another .
However , if we want to do all this and to take it seriously , we must adapt our European budget accordingly .
The Commission should try to augment the existing proposals for adjusting the interinstitutional agreement on the basis of this debate .
We have established a working group
