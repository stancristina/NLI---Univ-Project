These reports are typical of the times - they are fashionable , appropriate and obsessive .
I therefore very much welcome the fact that , as is acknowledged in a recent Commission report , Portugal should be able to enter the vanguard in terms of meeting the nominal convergence criteria set at Maastricht .
That would help to strengthen the euro in the world economy and benefit all concerned .
I think that the creation of a single currency will be one of the strongest bonds , not only vital if we are to have a genuine European internal market , but also if we are to bring about economic recovery , investment and create jobs .
He said that the insistence and tactlessness of his speeches not only make him unpopular , which he accepts , but also make the whole of Germany unpopular , which Germans neither deserve nor are willing to put up with .
These reports heap prestige on our parliament and should be vital working material for the Council of Finance Ministers and heads of state and government for the Councils due to take place in Ireland very soon .
We must also bear in mind the process of 'disintermediation ' , according to which the supply and demand of capital operate reciprocally and without need for financial intermediaries , and the institutional agreement needed to allow for coordination between policies , strengthening the independence of the European Central bank , by means of democratic legitimacy , which I see as a linchpin , and the need to appoint the members of the Economic and Financial Committee in terms of greater responsibility , in keeping as it happens with the proposal made by the rapporteurs .
The third stage of Economic and Monetary Union is upon us .
How can that cohesion be brought about ?
Incentives should not be processed in a single framework , created for them alone , so as not to scare small firms away from strategic areas of research for European industry .
Finally I should like to appeal for cooperation to be stepped up between the Union and its Member States , between the Member States and with third countries .
The Commission proposal should therefore deserve the plenary 's support and there is no justification for holding up the extension of the application of the right to free movement to a group of workers already prevented from leaving the country where they started to receive pre-retirement benefits as that would imply the loss of the right to their respective financial benefits .
I must begin by complimenting Mr Wolf on his report , and the fact that he managed to reach after much laborious effort a wording and compromises that enabled the report to be resoundingly approved in Committee , without giving ground on any of the principles or key ideas on employment and unemployment which underpin the social aspect .
We are debating and preparing to vote on an important report about a question that everyone claims to be concerned about but concerning which few people , in accordance with that concern , at least subscribe to positions of principle in which they could actually influence a policy that has actually been increasing unemployment and lowering the quality of employment .
But could not man return to the mythical era of the golden age when he did not have to work and when poetry and labour were one and the same ?
This does not mean ignoring the implications of the single market , Community policies or EMU for employment , but it means not giving in to the rhetorical temptation of exaggerating the responsibilities of the European Union so that blame can be transferred , turning it into a scapegoat .
It intends to enhance the employment content by 170 billion ECU , including the Cohesion Fund at 1995 prices , helping to create jobs once the European economy is revived and the sources of growth are revitalised , once Community funds are absorbed more efficiently , which is not the case at present , and to redirect them , not only to speed up economic growth but so that its content should be richer in lasting and sustainable jobs .
When these figures refer to people without jobs , then we should keep on deciding , as often as is necessary .
If we take away this tax with one hand and take it away with a reduction in European industrial competitiveness , then Europe will be left with the tax and the Americans and Japanese will have competitiveness .
We would opt instead for more flexibility in this area in labour negotiations in the various Member States , which would undoubtedly not create greater difficulties of a social nature in Europe 's economic activity .
The analysis must be accurate .
If we are to be thorough nor should we play down the territorial dimension of the structural funds .
We must opt for the former or otherwise the richest regions will go on getting richer and the poorer ones poorer , with all the consequences - mainly demographic - that would result .
In turn this must not be done only in terms of obtaining a job at the end of activities funded by the ESF but also of the level of qualification obtained by the trainees and the competitiveness that this grants them for the future on the job market .
These groups have come to function as political parties on a European scale , and have even been able to include regional members , some of them elected by regional parties .
It is far easier to achieve greater proximity between electors and their elected representatives , an important cause of this parliament , when candidates stand for national or regional party lists than it would be if ever they stood for European political parties .
This is an excellent merit .
