a monitoring role at least .
Doctors of economics , financial analysts , business journalists , political decision-makers who were all , until four months ago , singing the praises of the global financial market were all caught up in a monumental fiasco because of their lack of foresight .
This backto-business or return to greater state interventionism as well as intervention by international financial organisations is quite evident in this report and in this resolution .
I would hold responsible for that damage the two Presidents of the European Parliament during this legislature and those Members who have given in to populism and did not have the political courage to defend the institution as a whole , punishing at the same time a ( small ) minority of prevaricators .
This report does not just deal with a bureaucratic issue , as its title might suggest .
And approving a transitional period enshrining inequality between different Members is a worrying signal .
We are four weeks away from the launch of the euro and , according to the latest news , it was not easy to find a solution for representing the euro area at international financial institutions .
The economic and commercial weight of the European Union strengthened by the constitution of the euro as a reserve currency and international reference currency , gives it special responsibilities in the reform of the world financial system and its institutions , in particular the IMF.
The other , with a monetary trill , will be permanent and will be emitted by the President of the ECB.
Those are the words of a great European 400 years ago .
The prospects offered by this fifth framework programme for researchers , enterprises and the well-being of citizens should not be jeopardised by a lack of agreement over the European Union 's financial perspectives .
That is why I hope that the Marie Curie bursaries are going to be opened up to nationals of countries that are not members , as symbolic recognition that science , like music , is a universal language .
We should also ask ourselves whether the answers given by the Commission are enough and whether they are in keeping with the seriousness of what has taken place and whether our minds can be at rest for the future .
I shall , therefore , concentrate on certain questions that I think are of particular importance in this final phase of the procedure .
Let us now look at the question of strategic reserves : now that we have reached the end of the process I must say that we have many doubts and a great deal of concern today about the strategy that has been adopted and , above all , the results obtained by it .
It is a fact that these are payment appropriations and the question might therefore seem quite technical .
At first reading , in October , the European Parliament did some positive work by reinstating the necessary appropriations for some of the main programmes for regional and social development , fighting unemployment , preserving the environment and humanitarian aid .
Throughout the year the Commission has been doing all it can to clear these back-payments , but it has not solved the problem .
That is natural given the origins of the euro and the interests that its creation primarily serves !
Recital J of the Arroni report points out the psychological , social , political and national dimensions and rightly considers that a currency is not only a technical instrument to make trade easier .
Mr President , in Portuguese we have the equivalent of the expression 'shutting the stable doors after the horse has bolted ' - in other words people tend to find ways of avoiding problems only once they have taken place .
It also seems to us that the proposal for the European Union to have a stronger budget to allow it to take effective action against asymmetrical economic slumps is the most appropriate one .
That shock will be scheduled , predicted and inevitable .
It could take the form of loans from money markets anchored in solid guarantees by the Member States .
It would be unjust , but if it did happen then the adjustment mechanism being proposed here today could help to repair any damage .
Unfortunately , Mr Metten 's hope that the European Union will have a stronger budget than it does at present is not realistic and the fight against short-term slumps would undoubtedly be fought with the resources that should really be earmarked for structural solutions .
However , our basic reservations about this motion for a resolution will not stop us from supporting the creation of a Stabilisation Fund , but we do so grudgingly as this has to be seen as inevitable ; it would be compatible with the Stability Pact , the main plank of the strategy , and it would provide a guarantee mechanism with loans to be repaid with interest - something that we object to .
But it would politically inexplicable if these two problems were to be resolved at the cost of funds aimed at the poorest countries and regions among the current 15 Member States of the European Union , turning Article 2 of the Maastricht Treaty on economic and social cohesion into a dead letter .
If it was then we are facing a serious crisis in the history of the European Union - curiously at a time when 11 out of the 15 prime ministers are socialists .
This report is being debated at a particularly significant moment for human rights : we are commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration and the 10th Anniversary of the Award of the Sakharov prize .
