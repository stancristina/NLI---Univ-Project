very good , business-like atmosphere , and the discussions were also very detailed .
This will make it possible for us to step up our bilateral cooperation , but above all cooperation in international forums on climate protection .
I can say that we agreed that the situation can be resolved only by peaceful means and within the framework of the Ukrainian constitution .
We have nothing to hide .
One example of a success is that at the WTO negotiations we came to a bilateral agreement on private transport to and from Kaliningrad .
The most important pillars of prevention are sex education without taboos and access to condoms , above all in schools and for young people .
Furthermore , the high costs of therapy , which range from EUR 7 000 to 12 000 per annum , must also be taken into account , as they are a major burden on a country ’s health budget .
The question must also be asked as to whether this is financially responsible .
They do not violate the Bosman judgment .
Or do we need the clubs to voluntarily commit themselves to giving their own young players a chance ?
What I expect of you , Mr Fabra Vallés , is that you now think about what you are doing in the light of what has been said so far , and then I expect us to get stuck in to this debate on matters of principle .     Mr President , I would like to start by expressing my congratulations to the Court of Auditors on this report .
The people at the Court of Auditors are not historians , nor are we in this House .
The meeting called by the Colombian Government for 3 and 4 February 2005 will present a very good opportunity both to reiterate the international community’s solidarity with the Colombian people and to issue a reminder regarding the undertakings that have been given .
I have attempted to set out what underlies a good policy for Colombia .
As this information came too late for a motion for urgent procedure , I would now ask the House to examine this case and , if need be , to take action against Iran .
There are those in our group who would rather not have any negotiations and who are saying from the outset that they would prefer another form of partnership , to which we have given the name of ‘privileged partnership’ .
If Turkey were to join the EU as it is , it would have to make itself subject to the EU’s as a whole .
That is the question I put to you .
With fellow Members of this House , I visited the small Kurdish town of Kiziltepe , where , on 21 November , a lorry driver and his twelve-year old son were shot dead .
We are thereby committing ourselves to ensuring that , in Turkey , Kurds , Circassians , Lazs and others can use their mother tongues as well as the official language of the country .
That is what we already have at global level , and it no longer has much at all to do with the EU.
So let us seek out new ways of giving all these countries the prospect of membership in the EU , while at the same time allowing the European Union to grow politically .     Mr President , today’s debate on Turkish accession , on which we have to decide , shows how weakened , unsure of itself and divided this House is .
Much has been said about ‘open-ended negotiations’ , but we know that Ankara is not interested in those .
We do not want full membership , but a privileged partnership with a special status that both parties – the EU and Turkey – can cope with .
The present progress report from the Commission bears detailed testimony to the fact that Turkey is not fulfilling a single one of the Copenhagen pre-accession criteria .
With a second-class Member State , with different grades of membership , our political union would eventually cease to function .
Opponents of the report have once again been trying to restart the discussion on new terms , some of which are based on falsehoods , raising many of the hurdles that have already been cleared and adding many more .
And anyone who seeks such a closely integrated Europe cannot favour full Turkish membership , which would degrade this European Union into a free-trade area .
I cannot imagine that Turkey will manage to fulfil the criteria within the next few days or weeks .
These were laid down at the Copenhagen summit more than ten years ago , in 1993 .
Nor is it a matter of simply echoing the shouts of the crowd in the stands , since these are largely fuelled by emotion .
It is a resource for people’s everyday lives .
For this reason , I proposed that people be issued with an introductory guide to mobility .
More exchanges of young trainees must be encouraged at every level , with primary importance attaching to financial support .
The third priority is a stronger Europe in a safer world , creating greater stability and fostering democracy and human rights .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am glad to see Mr Barroso again this morning .
To take an example , the Services Directive will give you an early opportunity to show us whether this Commission is willing to bring the two together .
This is an important field for the EU , and one in which this House expects , from 2005 , to be fully involved , for our European society is founded upon the rule of law , and every citizen allows himself to be guided by the standards set by the Community , believing as he does that these have been examined and approved by the majority of his legitimate representatives
