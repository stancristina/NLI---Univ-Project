to sacrifice preparation time to the founding of the authority .
These matters are important to citizens .
Openness and appointments based on merit are essential .
Mr President , I would first like to join in thanking Mr Whitehead for his excellent work .
He has continued along the wise line adopted by Mr Bowis in his own report .
The most important part of the regulation now under discussion concerns setting up the Food Safety Authority .
It should not endanger the authority ' s independence and integrity , it should provide a good scientific infrastructure and facilities in the field of food safety .
Now , headed by Mr Whitehead , they too appear to understand that it is important to establish what we expect of a Food Authority and what kind of criteria we will set for its location .
This policy should be maintained .
Mr President , I would finally like to express my deep regret that the Council does not appear able to reach a decision on this matter sufficiently quickly .
Setting up the Food Authority is a matter in which the confidence of the citizens must not be any further shaken by creating political deals on solutions that have nothing in common or - even worse - by creating the impression that political horse trading is taking place in the Council , which should clearly be an area of politics belonging to the past .
My view on this matter is , on the one hand , that of the producers and , on the other , that of a country with small volumes and long distances .
My problem in relation to the proposal is why the precautions are identical for the entire area of the EU if the risks in some areas are non-existent .
I propose that instead of only following principles , we should combine them with common sense .
In my country ' s only animal waste plant different categories of waste can still be separated from each other , but separating waste from different species of animal seems extremely difficult as we are looking at such small volumes .
After all , natural cannibalism does exist as a phenomenon in the animal kingdom .
Although we are now accepting Parliament ' s opinion on the directive proposal , we still need to think about these things .
Mr President , has the Council considered other means of achieving the same goals ?
In other words , if the Tobin tax is not the way forward , can you tell us what else has been done ?
The Commission ' s proposal and Mrs Torres Marques ' excellent report promote this trend .
Simplifying Community law must always have the consequence of reducing the administrative burden on SMEs .
A recently published Nordic study stated that by 2005 approximately 80 % of company invoices will be transferred electronically .
So the significance is far from small .
Electronic signatures , referred to in Amendment No 18 , can be one way of ensuring that invoices transferred electronically are genuine and that their content has not been interfered with but it is not the only way .
Using advanced electronic signatures must not be compulsory .
I also hope that Mrs Torres Marques will further consider her opinion before the voting tomorrow .
I also welcome chairman Bar√≥n Crespo ' s small penance , when he regretted that this discussion could not take place today .
We have waited for this for a long time and we do not want to lose this opportunity .
The theme of sustainable development must not be overshadowed by a prominent guest but must now be taken seriously .
I was a little impatient when the Commission did not seem to be preparing its own proposal on sustainable development and in conjunction with the Stockholm Summit I said that President of the Commission Romano Prodi was ecologically illiterate .
But unfortunately there is a risk that the summit will not be able to achieve this , i .e . set quantitative targets .
I welcome the fact that President of the Commission Romano Prodi wishes to hold a discussion which already looks at the period after the goals of Kyoto have been achieved .
My group says a definitive no to this trend .
We want to focus on the alternatives .
It must be clearly stated and signalled to the candidate countries that the Irish people in no way wanted to reject enlargement .
These can no longer be addressed behind closed doors .
We need more democracy , more referendums , and more participation not less .
I only received the 14 last amendments for this part-session in my native language this morning .
In my opinion this is unsatisfactory .
The strategy of sustainable development will create a real content for the Union ' s policy , particularly by uniting the economy , employment and the environment .
In Gothenburg , the leaders of the EU must do their utmost to change the negative decision on Kyoto made by the US.
We must reassess the way the Union works and increase openness .
When , according to researchers in the field , not even the Heads of State who took part in the negotiations are fully aware of the consequences of the Treaty of Nice , we might ask ourselves whether it is possible to reach a sensible decision on this issue at all .
Citizens must be able to follow what is happening in the Union and the institutional reform cannot be made an exception to this principle .
The area of application of the directive is the most essential question in this whole matter .
Self-employed hauliers must not be subjected to artificial regulations limiting their total working hours .
The issue has no bearing on road safety because the driving time of independent self-employed hauliers is already regulated under other rules
