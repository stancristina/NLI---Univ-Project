For this reason , failure is not an option .
There is no doubt that you are experiencing difficulties because the functioning of the Presidency of the Council is complex .
It is a matter of proposing a uniform procedure for small-scale actions .
With regard to the area of security , I believe that it is reasonable to concentrate initially on those types of crime which are of a truly international nature .
Madam President , we find ourselves , in this legislature , with a momentous challenge with regard to the construction of the European Union .
Immigration for political reasons is one thing and economic immigration is another , and the two things do not require the same solutions .
This Charter must be binding and actionable .
Another point which the President has mentioned , and which seems to me important to specify , is our approach towards the Intergovernmental Conference .
According to many historians and anthropologists , the Basque people form the oldest nation in Europe which , in spite of its limited population , has maintained its own ancestral language for centuries and millennia , as well as a distinct culture and traditions .
The armed organisation ETA has declared a cease-fire and the majority of Basque political parties , unions and civil organisations have signed an agreement in Lizarra-Estella ( Navarre ) which aims at dealing with the Basque conflict through dialogue and negotiation .
We have not rejected your candidature or your proposal , since we prefer to seek opportunities for the future .
We trust that your well-known democratic disposition will help to find a satisfactory solution for all of us .
Mr Prodi , both through his loyalty to the principles which brought about the current European Union and through his proven capacity for management , will , I am sure , lead the new Commission along the path and at the pace which current circumstances require .
And finally , the European Parliament also increased the payment appropriations in the 1999 budget in view of the clear shortfall of one billion in payment appropriations , a shortfall which had appeared , above all , in the Social Funds .
I will turn directly to SAB 4 , which proposes 137 million in commitment appropriations for the creation of an Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo , for macro-financial aid for the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and 30 million in humanitarian aid for Turkey as a result of the earthquake .
The Commission also recognises that the reallocation of this sum is not yet possible in category 4 , but says that an extensive effort should be made to make a reallocation within the budget as a whole .
Mr President , this "burden of the future " which you talked about years ago in the Committee on Budgets , is now the burden of the present , because I believe that we have ignored your "warning " and we have not been sufficiently strong as a Parliament to prevent this false saving on the part of the Council , which presents a payment budget while carefully forgetting that the commitments have to be fulfilled .
The truth is that it appears that you have been doing it all your life .
This has led to the delay and we therefore are faced with this supplementary and amending budget which the Committee on Budgets is fully prepared to grant .
This is therefore an issue which should be looked into thoroughly .
Firstly , the ineffectiveness of the United Nations which , unfortunately , is nothing new .
It is late , too late , but , on a Community level , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , we must ensure that the humanitarian aid , mentioned this morning by the Minister , of EUR 8 million , and the aid to follow , arrive at their destination immediately .
Let us look at ourselves .
I regret the so-called reply which has been given to me because are we to conclude from the words of Mr Sasi that the Spanish authorities were acting correctly on 8 July when they expelled those 100 Romanian Gypsy families ?
For this reason , we eagerly await the Tampere Summit .
I must remind her that one Socialist Minister has been found guilty of kidnap and the Socialist Government of her leader , Felipe Gonz√°lez , was found guilty by the Court of Human Rights for the expulsion of 103 immigrants on the border of Melilla .
A general plan in which the competences and responsibilities of the European Union are defined , as well as those of each Member State .
I believe that this is a very pertinent procedural motion .
Question No 18 by (H-0443/99 ) : Subject : Construction of a nuclear power station in southern Morocco Is the Council aware of the fact that a nuclear power station is due to be built in southern Morocco for the purpose of desalinating sea water ?
The achievement of a just peace in the Middle East , which we advocate in the Socialist Group , is only possible if , together with the negotiations on the items on the peace agenda in this complex conflict , the problem of the refugees is resolved .
One of these options is this report .
I hope , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , that the European Union , neither now - with Finland - nor later , allows such a mockery to take place .
And we are far too sensitive because we have to come here via a transport system which is also inconvenient and our inconvenience in the face of this transport system is added to the inconvenience that we find here .
I think we should bear this in mind if , at some time , Mr Quintela wants to once again become involved in the works of the Parliament
