year ago agreement was reached in New York to extend the NonProliferation Treaty sine die .
That will mean that a chance has been lost of getting the 'threshold ' countries signed up to an international treaty which opposes the development of nuclear weapons .
The question is whether one cannot find a formula , for example a reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty , to Article 6 , which everybody could accept , so that the problem of India could be resolved .
The Union must send out a very tough and unequivocal signal and must take action .
We should respond to that signal !
Let us stop investing there .
The tragic killing of Mr Adali is bad enough .
I hope the Council and the Commission too will press for this .
Taiwan , with only 21 million inhabitants , is an economic power to be reckoned with in the world economy .
And I voted for it in the Foreign Affairs Committee , as Mrs Laurila said .
But Taiwan plays no official part on the world stage . 21 million people are deprived of a voice in the United Nations . 21 million people are unable to benefit from the information , expertise and experience of the World Health Organization .
I have not so much a question for the Commissioner , Madam President , more a comment in reply to Mrs Lenz .
Madam President , may I ask the Commissioner if the European Commission will be closing its delegations in all countries which are not members of the World Trade Organization ?
His main election pledge was to end the war in Chechnya but now , after the bombing , he has pledged full support for Yeltsin 's policy .
The fact is that the cultural and political rights of the national minority in Vojvodina must be respected , and this must be one of the criteria for granting aid in the territory of the Republic of Serbia proper , for example , or the rump Yugoslavia .
And to focus on activities which impel people to work together across ethnic lines .
Mr President , following the many political pronouncements on the form which aid to former Yugoslavia should take it is now time to discuss the regulation on the basis of which that aid may be given .
It will be good for all of us .
Like Parliament 's Committee on Budgets , we are very much in favour of having this aid deployed regionally and locally , naturally with the necessary guarantees of conditionality .
Some petitions bear many signatures .
It must also be made clear in what cases petitions may be submitted and on what conditions .
So I think we have to agree on a more efficient pattern of meetings , so that we do not overlap with Parliament 's other committees , and we could do that on Thursday afternoons and Friday mornings , because there are no other committee meetings then .
Every effort must be made to clear the backlog created by the procedure for appointing the Ombudsman and I fully endorse what Mr Chanterie said about the meetings of the Committee on Petitions .
The Commission , Commissioner , is not the guardian of the Treaties for nothing .
We have looked at an excellent report , and you have heard an excellent account from the rapporteur and from the chairman of the Committee on Petitions too .
Israel has highly sophisticated scientific research and is technologically very advanced so can be profitable to the European Union .
This makes quite a hole in the budget for the specific programmes which make up the fourth , and shortly the fifth , framework programme .
Decisions concerning the fourth framework programme are taken jointly with Parliament using the co-decision procedure .
My second question : has the Commission consulted the other countries affected , particularly Canada and Mexico ?
Cuba is primarily an American problem , but Libya and Iran really represent the same problem to both the US and the Union .
As we begin this debate I must convey the sympathy of the EPP Group to the parents and families of the murdered girls .
How long are we going to allow countries to refuse to cooperate , like Tunisia and Morocco , and then there is the case of the abducted girl Milena Bianco from Bassano del Grappa , but there are dozens , hundreds of other instances .
Crimes must be punished .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Group of the Radical Alliance I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the parents and families of the girls murdered in my country .
If we really want to demonstrate our sympathy we should look for social responses which Europe itself can provide , for example the creation of a register of missing children , more police cooperation across borders and the pooling of experience of policy on prisons and sentencing .
Children 's rights must be placed on our statute books and enforced against third countries too .
How could things have got to that point ?
The Stockholm conference , by virtue of its content and the publicity it received , gave hope to all those who work to protect our children and grandchildren in Europe .
People do not understand why the judiciary and the authorities are so powerless in this fight against brutal violence and deeds of the utmost baseness .
We could talk about the lack of legislation to control a medium like the Internet which is used for the most degrading purposes .
Are we prepared to take measures against firms , including big companies such as Benetton or Mexx , which use shocking images often of naked children for the most vulgar purposes of commercial gain
