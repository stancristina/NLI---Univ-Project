I am convinced that her answer is based on accurate facts .
I would be grateful if the President did not use the gavel before my time was up .
I believe that could be valuable .
There is a great risk that they will exploit monopoly rights .

So I want to ask whether this is such an important issue that , for environmental reasons , with reference to the environmental guarantee , a Member State would be able to demand that imported bottles , cans and the like are adapted to the country 's own system ?
This could be for various reasons .
For we women the prevention of cancer is an important topic and it has been in the news this year .
It is clear that we need some kind of quality control of the laboratories which check the tests .
Mr President , the figures displaced persons have risen dramatically in recent years .
Thank you Mrs Zimmermann for mentioning Sweden 's efforts in this area ; they have , of course , been quite considerable .
It is now up to each country to do this itself , otherwise a few countries will have to cope with the consequences alone .
That is unreasonable in a Union with freedom of movement .
As the Commission has also pointed out , it is very important that the conditions are created in our countries for these people to be able to support themselves and their children .
This initiative is central for the Union , since it is a test of whether we are capable of collective responsibility in difficult situations .

Mr President , the chocolate directive has led to a stream of calls and letters from farmers in developing countries who grow cocoa and other chocolate fats , from consumer organizations and not least from the chocolate industry .
Into the bargain I could gain points for defending Swedish economic interests . but I do not sit here as a representative of Swedish industry , but as a representative of green political ideas .
The reasonable conclusion then is that goods should be labelled so that the consumers can get effective information quickly and easily .
Mr President , we knew that the EU would bring extensive detailed regulation before the 1994 referendum in Sweden .
It is high time that Swedish industry recognized that , and recognized that we who sit here for Sweden are not some lackeys for Swedish industry , but that we stand for certain ideas , in my case for green ideas .
The question concerns developed systems for deposits on bottles , cans , plastic , glass and metal in Sweden which have worked well and are now working well .

Now it has been signed by the foreign ministers .
For example , I go to meetings every week in Sweden and I am asked about what various things in the Amsterdam Treaty mean .
That is why this these debates arise : How great are the demands ?

In addition , I wonder whether the process of assessing the announcement will be finished before the ratification of the treaty in the Member States begins ?
I also wonder whether people can have a copy of the President-in-Office of the Council 's son 's dictionary , which appears to be a central document in the interpretation of the Amsterdam Treaty .
We are talking about encryption , but our own language is cryptic and we often refer to various articles .
I am , you see , convinced that this area is one of the most urgent ones for the EU.
The developments are rapid .
We must also think about this when we impose a responsibility on the various players in the information chain .
At the same time as I would like to aim for balance and fairness between the various players , I would also like to aim for balance between the various copyright holders , as the previous speaker pointed out , and as we point out in the report .
I do not know whether Commissioner Wulf-Mathies is able to answer on Commissioner Gradin 's area .
