These issues are : with regard to Question Time , the President of the sitting should have the option of referring questions for Question Time to the committee responsible , which would have the advantage of freeing up time in plenary for debates .
I would remind you , because of their importance , of the main challenges identified in the joint report , which are : to develop an inclusive labour market and promote employment as a right and opportunity for all ; to guarantee an adequate income level and resources to live in human dignity ; to tackle educational disadvantage ; to preserve family solidarity and protect the rights of children ; to ensure good housing for all ; to guarantee equal access to high-quality services ( health , transport , social , care , cultural , recreational and legal ) ; to improve the delivery of services and to regenerate areas of multiple deprivation .
We must not , therefore , try to deny the reality of the situation and bear in mind that , although it is difficult to analyse the correlation between public expenditure and social protection on the one hand and the risk of poverty on the other , it is fair to say that without social transfers , notably old age pensions , 41 % of the population of the European Union would be at risk from poverty , a percentage which would still be 26 % if we included old age pensions but excluded income from other social transfers .
This problem has repercussions not only for the dignity and quality of human life , but also for macroeconomic policies , social security , freedom and security .
Finally , I should like to emphasise the need for the candidate countries to participate , as soon as possible , in the strategy for social inclusion and to draw up their own national action plans to improve this .
On the one hand , the Commission is taking a step backwards with regard to previous legislation ; in other words , when faced with non-compliance with previous legislation , the Commission prefers to stop talking about a marketing ban .
What we are dealing with here , therefore , is not so much the issue of price , of whether or not donations of blood should be remunerated .

( PT ) The amendments tabled during the vote on my report on social inclusion weakened its substance on significant points .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr de Miguel , the outcome of the preparatory meeting held in Bali has been a disappointment .
Against this backdrop , and because we cannot waste the kind of opportunity we have not had for ten years and which is unlikely to be repeated in the next ten , the European Union must play a leading role .
Consequently , out of respect for the citizens that we represent here , I believe it is crucial that the European Parliament has the right not only to send a delegation of 25 Members of this House , but also and above all the right to have its representatives participate in the daily European Union coordinating meetings .
Johannesburg , therefore , is at risk of being a total failure , with extremely damaging consequences for the environment , for the poor countries and for the planet as a whole .
We must bear in mind that failure in Johannesburg will threaten the reasonable expectations raised in Rio .
Do this and see what answer you are given .
( PT ) The purpose of this report is to revise Article 6 of Parliament 's Rules of Procedure concerning : ( a ) the concept of the 'appropriate authority ' of a Member State to request that immunity be waived ; ( b ) the appropriate procedure for verifying the competence of the authority submitting the application for the lifting of immunity of a Member facing prosecution ; ( c ) the procedure Parliament should follow when examining a request for the waiver of a Member 's immunity ; and ( d ) the procedure to be adopted when Parliament needs to assert the parliamentary immunity of a Member .
( PT ) The drafting of this report was prompted by the cases brought by the Italian courts against individuals who are Members of the European Parliament .
Only a comprehensive reform such as the one suggested in the Duff report , which was studied and voted on the same day , will provide a complete and structured response to this type of problem .
This is my position exactly , because I am disappointed with the degree of conformism that I discerned in the prevailing Council positions and because I am convinced that it is absolutely crucial to push forward with the positions held by the industry in this field , in order to achieve a balanced weighting of the values involved .
As Mr Ram√≥n de Miguel stressed , the possibility of escalation can never be excluded in a military conflict .
This is the only way in which the European Union will be genuinely able to bring its influence to bear in conflict prevention .
Hence , our vote in favour of the report .
It is equally important , however , that we pay full attention to soil , which is also a component of terrestrial ecosystems and a crucial factor in their sustainable development .
Mr President , this report represents a politically significant boost by the European Parliament to the enlargement process .
The planning stage is over .
Nevertheless , and bearing in mind the differences of opinion between the previous government and the election-winners on a whole range of issues , such as the Status Law , social dialogue and public procurement for example , the possibility of changes in Hungary 's position on the
