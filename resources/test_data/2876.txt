justice .     . – I have voted in favour of the Cottigny report following the achievement of a sufficient majority for amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , which incorporated proposals I had made in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
There are recurrent instances of reprocessing plants causing the radioactive pollution over wide expanses of land and sea .
Mr President , I crave your forgiveness for our late arrival .
Turning to the Balkans , this issue was and is an important one for the Austrian Presidency , and I therefore regard the Gymnich meeting and its engagement with it as a message of encouragement , even in a dual sense of the term , addressed to the people of the states of the Western Balkans .
As we proceed down that road , it must be made clear to them that they need the willingness to take the necessary action and demonstrate that quality that is described so well by the English term ‘ownership’ .
Perfectly understandable though it is that demand should be made for the EU to be made more capable of welcoming new members – I am thinking here of the constitution and of the financial basis – this cannot be used against the countries of South-Eastern Europe and as a means of fending off their efforts at accession .
On the one hand , there is the situation with which both sides in the Holy Land itself are presenting us ; on the other , there is the issue of how probable it is that Iran will be deterred from a military nuclear programme .
Corrupt and dubious though the Fatah state was , a state ruled by Hamas would be even more objectionable .
We have emphasised the need for appropriate action to restore peace and order ; we have said that Israel’s use of force in Jericho and the activity by Palestinian extremists in response to it are both capable of further destabilising a situation in the Middle East that is already tense .
I would like again to emphasise that this can be the final stretch in countries such as Norway – which is also a party to the Schengen convention – so decide on the basis of their participation in the European Economic Area .
We want to prepare for the next accessions as best we possibly can .
We share your House’s view that Croatia is contributing more to regional cooperation and that further efforts are required .
I very much welcome what both Commissioner Rehn and Mrs Plassnik have had to say on this subject .
Such tensions and problems must be resolved before accession negotiations start .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report calls for the geographical boundaries of the European Union to be determined and its nature defined .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am from a country that , according to all the figures and data available , benefited very considerably from the last enlargement , yet , even so , the popular view of both the European Union itself and its enlargement is a very critical one , so let me make a few personal observations on the subject .
The sector studies that the Commission is already preparing and wishes to carry out in further depth form a crucial basis for this , and the issue of market definition is also significant in this regard .
To reiterate : we are convinced that the Commission will take the right action and proceed responsibly .
That is why I expect the Council to become involved with this issue .
Does the fusion benefit consumers ?
In the meantime , the Presidency , too , has issued a statement on this .
This Foundation has a key role to play , particularly at this time .
Austria would like to continue its involvement in this wider context , and has already invited the High Level Group on the alliance of civilisations to hold its third meeting in Vienna at the end of May .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am obliged to all of you for mentioning the positive impact of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in your speeches .
I am pleased to have the opportunity to join you for this debate .
We should have liked to see a different outcome on one issue or another , but , after all , compromises are necessary in a multilateral framework , and we need to ask ourselves whether what proved possible in the end is , in essence , still consistent with what we actually wanted .
Fourthly , the Human Rights Council has the competence to make direct recommendations to all the bodies of the United Nations , including the UN Security Council .
More continuity has been introduced into the work , and there is to be a regular review of the human rights situation in all the UN Member States .
It has been pointed out repeatedly that the election of members of the Human Rights Council is of the utmost importance .
The Commissioner said that this is not the beginning of a legislative process , but that we are just responding to a request from the WTO .
We are making good this shortcoming , and I also think that this makes sense .
If we open up our markets to products from third countries , we must be able to make this conditional on these countries applying the same standards in terms of quality and social aspects as prevail within the EU.
If there were no benefit to be gained from this , we would not be having this discussion within the WTO .
We must proceed very carefully in such situations .
