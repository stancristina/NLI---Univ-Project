Commissioner , I think that you are perfectly aware of , and sensitive to , these issues , due to the fact that you come from a region with specific problems .
This is the message that I wanted to put across , as well as once again congratulating Mrs Sudre and all the members of the various committees , which have enabled us to get as far as this report today .
And , what is more , if crisis management is inadequate , the problem uncontrollably spreads and worsens .
These figures are not much to solve a problem that affects 110 million people in 64 countries , 26,000 victims of mutilations every year and , vitally , the many children who are described in countries such as El Salvador as the broken children , as these children are maimed , missing their hands , arms or legs .
We are talking about millions of people killed or maimed , between 70 and 100 million mines that could explode at any time , anywhere in 60 countries .
Our efforts over all these years have been to this end , including in 1998 when the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe , over which I have the honour of presiding , awarded its annual prize to Mr Axworthy , Minister for Foreign Affairs in Canada , for the efforts of his government which took concrete form in the Ottawa Convention .
Like Mrs Maes , we are perplexed at the paradoxical behaviour , in which we see how , since the creation of the European Union , millions of euros of aid have been approved for countries that are clearly involved in the military occupation of one or other of their neighbours .
There comes a time , however , when words are not enough and a far more aggressive attitude must be adopted in defence of what , for the Christian Democrats , constitutes the very core of our philosophy and our political action : the transcendental value of the person and the right to life from the moment of conception until their natural death ; two principles which are incompatible with the application of the death penalty .
Democracy cannot subject everything to the law of numbers as no action affecting the fundamental rights of the person , the first and foremost of which is the right to life , can be undertaken or justified in the name of the majority .
Parliament has spoken in favour of the Charter being incorporated into the Treaties and these rights of European citizens being applied to citizens of third countries .
I would like us all to ask ourselves whether we can do more .
Every execution is an error that democracy , the defence of human rights and human dignity cannot accept .
Mr President , I believe that the institutions must live up to the values of our civilisation and that our citizens must see themselves reflected in the ethical mirror that , as a result of our work , we should be for them .
In any case , we believe that the priority for the European Union must be specific measures and policies and the definition of a European programme on climate change , which must also have specific objectives and aims , and it worries us that this is not the philosophy that will be advocated at the forthcoming Hague Conference .
Reasons for this include the realistic consideration that this will enable us to achieve short-term environmental goals by establishing specific reduction levels , and timetables for fulfilment .
It is true that with the measures contained in the Kyoto Protocol , to which the report we are debating today refers , we will not achieve short-term results , but it is also true that the human race should try to solve the problems it creates .
The Commission justifies the proposal we are now examining on the grounds of urgency .
The Agriculture Committee has therefore proposed an increase in the percentage of Community financing for certain joint schemes involving several producer organisations under certain conditions , especially in the regions most dependent on fruit and vegetable production , or for associations or mergers of producer organisations .
To avoid absurd situations of systematic penalisation , the Agriculture Committee has decided to propose setting it at the level of what was produced in recent years .
It often seems that less is demanded of institutions if they restrict themselves to proposing budget savings .
The objective of promoting supply pooling must be met by encouraging producer organisations .
There is a gap in the area of labelling .
The difference between the Commission ' s proposals and the European Parliament ' s is EUR 151 .
With this action , one cannot help feeling that the Commission is determined to reform these regulations at any price .
We are going to support Mr Jov√© Peres ' s report without any hesitation .
It is an excellent report - for which we congratulate the rapporteur - which provides a balanced reflection of the various interests and agreements involved .
It should be remembered that the fruit and vegetable sector is the first common organisation of the market to be financed by its own producers , so it is vitally important to encourage producer organisations and to support an increase in operational funds .
Fruit and vegetable production is closely linked to the Mediterranean culture and diet , the greatest exponent of a balanced , healthy diet for our consumers .
Commissioner , this sector seems to be the hard currency used in preferential agreements with third countries and in the subsequent reviews of their protocols , with the added disadvantage that these countries produce without the economic , social and environmental conditions we have in Europe , but with the same timetables as our own producing areas .
I should like , however
