’s action plan as the aim .
These themes are a scientific basis for determining additional obligations , the scenarios and risks attached to these obligations , the costs and impact of adjustment , emission trends and socio-economic factors , the potential for policies , measures and technologies for alleviating climate change , the costs and benefits of alleviation , sectoral analysis and the effect on competitiveness , experience gained , the lessons learned from implementation of the Kyoto Protocol , how long the obligations should remain in force , the sectoral approach , an outline for future commitments , and the additional costs of developing , adopting and transferring technologies .
Mr President , it is as yet impossible to go into the cost-benefit calculation in detail , but a review is obviously essential to ensure that there is the right balance of measures and benefits gained from them .
I hope that we can be in active contact with the European Parliament during the process , because Parliament has shown a very keen interest in these issues of climate , which is welcome considering how important this is for our future .     President-in-Office of the Council , I appreciate your well-informed reply to the previous question enormously .
These negative experiences include distortion of competition , disruptions in the internal market , and the fact that any party that has dealt well with the problem and taken environmental action early can end up paying for it .
Mr President , we presume that the Commission ’s report on the emissions trading scheme will be available sometime during the term of the Finnish Presidency , and , naturally , in the debate on it , Finland will have the opportunity also to raise the issue of its own experiences in the national context .
The European Union urges all parties to participate constructively in the process for determining Kosovo’s status and would remind them that progress in the implementation of standards in Kosovo will be crucially important for taking this process forward .
Mr President , the whole time during this process we will stress the importance of close and successful cooperation with the United Nations .
We must remember that Mr Ahtisaari is actually a special envoy of the UN in this area .
Mr President , during the Finnish Presidency the Western Balkans will be a very important issue in many different ways .
I can nevertheless assure you that the important role played by the Western Balkans in the European debate will also be continued during our Presidency .     .
Kosovo’s closer rapport with the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association Process is also bound to lend support to the implementation of standards in many different ways .     .
We must basically take a dim view of ransom demands for hostages .
Ransoms paid to hostage takers are an incentive for more kidnappings and can therefore lead to an increase in terrorism .
The efforts of the EU Member States in hostage crises led to the UN International Convention against the Taking of Hostages .
The relevant practical forms of action include united political support and action on the part of the EU in kidnapping situations , preparing for hostage taking situations in joint pilot projects and crisis exercises , the reinforcement of national crisis groups using experts from other countries , and a Member States’ check list of options for joint action .
All information , furthermore , would need to be treated strictly confidentially .
The European Union will help in a variety of ways to find a solution to this crisis , but , obviously , the parties themselves hold the keys to that .
We will work hard and we hope that a solution will be found .     .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union applies and means to continue to apply a comprehensive strategy and to migration both in the Union’s internal policy and in relations with third countries and in dialogue with them .
As regards the action that the Union has taken in response to recent events in the Canary Islands , I would like to suggest that the honourable Member take a closer look at the answers that were given to oral questions H-0440 , H-0455 , H-0460 , H-0473 and H-0478/2006 .
Obviously , this area of external relations also needs the resources and tools necessary to be able to have a proper impact .     In answer to the question about a stable labour market in the European Union , you said that the Council is considering all aspects of immigration policy .
Mr President , the European labour markets and the viability of this labour market system are , of course , together one key issue that has a direct effect on immigration policy , and , consequently , various elements of these need to be discussed and solutions found for them .
The legalisation of illegal migrants is obviously a complex matter in itself , of huge significance for the individual and his or her protection under the law .
Ultimately , legalisation of this nature is a matter which falls within the competence of the Member States of the European Union , although it is obviously useful to exchange information and , furthermore , engage in political debate on the subject .     .
It is obviously difficult to see far into the future and know what direction these policy decisions will take , but it is important to have political debate on issues that fall within national competence because , as I said just now , decisions that are taken in individual Member States also have a wider importance and influence in the Union as a whole .     .
The Hague Programme also mentions that there is a need for better coordination of national policies .
