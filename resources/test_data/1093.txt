I welcome Parliament 's support for that .
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten 's report .
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission 's accountability to this Parliament .
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission 's practical commitment to that .
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents .
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors .
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament .
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text .
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment , training , appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals .
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions .
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .
Members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praised Commission officials , who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity , hard-working and of great capability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made .
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential .
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months .
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House .
It is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations .
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay , conditions , staff representation rights and so on , but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters .
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change .
That is most certainly relevant .
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend " as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources .
It is very clear , however , that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched .
Parliament has frequently made that point .
Secondly , it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology .
Thirdly , it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken .
They are already having implications for resource availability .
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities " and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity .
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management .
I want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission , it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission .
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten 's report .
I conclude , Mr President , by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur , to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions .
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities .
Mr President , firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today , particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process , and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker " for the entire operation .
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended .
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date .
Nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late .
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome .
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East
