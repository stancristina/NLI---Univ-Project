And it seems to us that everything that concerns human investment must be of paramount importance .
Mr Georgievski did this by integrating in his government the party of Mr Xhaferi , whom socialist colleagues regarded as an extremist , though they had to sing another tune when they saw the role played by Mr Xhaferi at the time of the 1999 crisis , when hundreds of thousands of Kosovars were chased out of Kosovo by the regime of the war criminal , Mr Milosevic .
I think it is urgent that we act , that we move more quickly , and that we restore the confidence of the Macedonian population and the Albanian-speaking population of Macedonia .
