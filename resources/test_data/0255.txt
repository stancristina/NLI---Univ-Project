- ( PT ) For a Portuguese Member of Parliament from the CDS/Partido Popular , a party which has been notable for its opposition to and criticism of the very negative way in which the Socialist government routed in Portugal 's elections on 17 March has run the economy and the public finances of our country in recent years - and , indeed , during the period under review - it was particularly difficult for me to formulate my position on Mr Marinos 's important report .
I am certain that these efforts on the part of the new Portuguese authorities will be recognised and appropriately supported at political level by all the European institutions and that those efforts will be supported by a majority of Members of this House .
Nevertheless , this report , and thus the resolution contained in it , make a clear appeal for the communitarisation of the ESDP , as in Paragraph 9 of the resolution .
I find it difficult to understand the criticisms made by some Members given that this document is largely in line with this Parliament 's own views .
We neither agree on everything nor differ on everything .
I even believe that it would be helpful for us to give this transparency another name , because the transparency we are talking about here is not the same thing as transparency in access to documents .
We believe that this needs to be put right , and that is not because we want to weaken the intergovernmental axis of the European Union ; just the opposite in fact .
That applies to the plans for reform of the Council .
For this reason , I agree with Mr Poos , the co-rapporteur of the report presented to Parliament on the reform of the Council , when he says that people expect the European Council to have an open and forward-looking political vision , and strategic options and guidelines , rather than responsibility for coordination or taking decisions which should be made by the General Affairs Council .
We regret not being able to support this motion in the final vote because we are even in agreement with the first two paragraphs , and we agree that the time has come to update the division of competences between the Union and its Member States on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality , in order to take account of the lessons of the Community 's history - particularly those lessons that unfortunately point to so many excesses and infringements of the principle of subsidiarity .
We accordingly differ on a matter of principle that we regard as being fundamental .
The criterion of synergy and of effectiveness is , in itself , extremely dangerous , because that is how all the attacks on the principle of subsidiarity are made .
However , what really stands out is the hard core of specific competences .
Mr President , Commissioner , we cannot allow the Johannesburg Summit to be just an event to mark the ten years since Rio de Janeiro .
I believe that both the Commission communication and the Papayannakis and Lannoye reports contribute to making this a good agenda .
Secondly , the political conditions must be created for the United States to rejoin the joint effort in the environmental field .
Under these circumstances , we must now urge the Member States and the Commission once and for all to adopt a position in keeping with the scourges that affect the world and to push for guidelines , measures and the means needed for fair and sustainable development , linking environmental protection to the eradication of poverty .
The Trentin report calls for fulfilment of the Barcelona strategy , confirming the liberal trend of Lisbon .
The resolution adopted today in the European Parliament follows the federalist line , an example of which is the attempt to make the operation of the Council , in its legislative capacity , more like that of a parliament , bringing it closer to being a second parliamentary chamber at European Union level .
This is an item on the agenda for the Seville Summit to be held in June .
In the final report adopted today , however , this appropriate and necessary concept does not appear .
The report contains proposals that undermine the national sovereignty of the European Union Member States , and we reject them , notably the proposal that foreign policy and the definition of the legal basis of a 'common area of freedom and security ' should become the exclusive competence of the EU.
Even so , I think the general sense of the communication is positive , especially when the United Nations is taken as a basic reference and pillar for the pursuit of the Community 's aims and policies in these fields .
We share these concerns and these positions , but we also stress that the pursuit of an effective partnership and the achievement of compatibility in structures and procedures must be promoted on three fronts : through strengthening strategic political dialogue in order to define policies and programmes ; through strengthening cooperation on the ground in developing countries so as to ensure complementarity and coherence at an operational level ; and through the creation of a stable financial framework , with consistent rules and principles in the two institutions , as well as the above-mentioned new framework agreement , of course .
We appreciate the initiatives of the present Indonesia regarding the normalisation of relations with East Timor and Portugal .
We respect their attempts to keep the country united , but we stress the need to find solutions other than the mere use of force to respond to the ethnic , religious and regional differences that unsettle life in that country .
This is not the time to analyse the episodes that gave rise to this violence , but it
