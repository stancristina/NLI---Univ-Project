between the various political groups and to the proposal backed by the majority .
With this report as a basis , the Commission should quickly be able to table proposals for a new directive .
The strength of the report is that it really puts the environment and public health first , and that must be our main task .
Firstly , the proposal as to which chemicals are to be included under the requirements for registration , evaluation and authorisation should be made more comprehensive , as proposed .
Great importance should be attached to this so that safer alternatives will always be sought .
We wish to emphasise the demand that it should be those departments of the Commission with responsibility for environmental protection that should approve new chemicals .
Mr President , Europe needs a new strategy for dealing with the issues surrounding chemicals .
It is exceptionally important that Parliament adopt the report in such a form that it have the same thrust given to it by the rapporteur .
What is the use of jobs and a sound economy if we poison our countryside and destroy what is essential for future generations ?
It is in a number of capacities that , as human beings , we are affected by the ways in which chemicals are used .
In that way , a better world can be created .
It is incredibly important that we should take this step towards a new , better and more effective chemicals policy .
The modes of procedure presented in the White Paper are well balanced , and I believe they involve a step forwards in the direction of sustainable development .
We wish to maintain a high level of protection for the environment and human health , but we also need to try to make use of the advantages presented by chemicals .
We all know that there are chemicals in practically all the products we encounter every day .
Anyone who examined what is now the European Union ' s 20 year-old system of supervision would see clearly that it is not effective enough by a long chalk .
It is probably the case that a majority of the products forming part of our modern life-style today are manufactured from plastic or contain chemicals of some kind .
We are all of us exposed to chemicals on a daily basis .
More and more reports are coming in concerning health problems , allergies and asthma assumed to be connected with chemicals .
Chemicals are found in the depths of the sea and in the Arctic , where they have never once been used .
Even though we have made some progress within the EU when it comes to evaluating the risks and restricting and controlling the use of hazardous chemicals , there is still an incredible amount to do .
That , basically , is what EU legislation will amount to .
At the same time , we naturally want to ensure that the internal market is able to function and that the European chemicals industry , which is the world ' s largest , can maintain its competitiveness .
We must help one another ensure that animal experiments are restricted .
Pragmatic decisions are required in this area , together with a sensible application of the precautionary principle to chemicals policy .
These are substances that are carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic to reproduction .
They must be authorised before they are allowed to be used , and companies must show that they can be used safely on condition that risk management measures are taken .
In this way , approximately 1 500 substances , that is to say 5 per cent of all substances , will be covered by this authorisation procedure .
We must be pragmatic to start with , so that we do not relapse into having an unmanageable system .
On the part of the Commission , I want most definitely to recommend a limit of one tonne so that it is possible to use the resources of the industry and of the authorities in the most effective way possible .
The very fact that the limit is set at one tonne does not mean that chemicals produced in smaller quantities escape monitoring .
The Commission has now set up a number of technical working parties with experts from the Member States , industry , non-governmental organisations and the Commission .
Finally , I want to say a few words about the debate which I know is taking place and which is perhaps being conducted most eagerly in Germany and the United Kingdom .
It must be possible to guarantee that what is produced is safe for use in terms of human health and the environment and that it corresponds to the requirements of consumers .
We can defend our European chemicals industry through the safe use of chemicals in the future .
The communication must be seen in conjunction with the launch of the new water policy in Europe - the water framework directive , adopted last year .
Part of this analysis will naturally be carried out in conjunction with the drawing up of management plans for river basin areas in accordance with the water framework directive .
These working parties are to develop implementation guidelines .
The European Parliament will be kept informed about the future development of water pricing issues at EU level .
We really need to discuss packaging .
We have to discuss logistics , transport and the packaging that eventually becomes waste .
I might perhaps be allowed to appeal for the forthcoming White Paper on Integrated Product Policy to address the whole of the logistical chain , something which did not feature in the Green Paper .
I would thank her for her work on this own-initiative report including a resolution on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste
