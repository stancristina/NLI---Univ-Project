The analyses carried out by the Court of Auditors were of great help in drawing up the reports .
Personnel selection problems are also common to several agencies , since the agencies certainly require greater assistance than larger institutions .
This would be in addition to the immediate humanitarian assistance provided by ECHO , the Commission ’s department set up to help in the event of natural disasters or armed conflict in regions outside the EU.
Well , then , I think that is more or less what there was to say about the report , which I hope will be adopted during the next sitting .     Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would just like to inform this Assembly that an attack took place this morning in Nassiriya , Iraq , against a European military convoy : three Italian and a Romanian solider were killed .
In taking the floor , I simply wanted to explain our position in relation to the duties of the Bureau .     Road safety directly concerns all of the inhabitants of the European Union .
Among the objectives the EU has set itself is that of halving the number of road accident victims by 2010 .
Before going into detail , I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups , Mrs Sommer , Mrs Corbey , Mr Maaten , Mrs Evans , Mrs Breyer , Mrs Liotard and Mr Blokland , for their decisive contributions and for their willingness to negotiate , even in the most trying times .
This compromise has not been easy , partly because the Council’s position on some points remained very inflexible – practically rigid – until the end of the negotiations .
Those labels will instead have to be subject to the full authorisation procedure that will guarantee greater control , not only in scientific terms on the part of EFSA and the Commission , but also on the part of the Member States in the context of the comitology procedure .
Once that period has expired , they may continue to be used provided that they are accompanied by a corresponding claim that complies with the provisions of the present regulation .
Furthermore , by reducing the data protection period to five years , compared with the seven planned initially , we have shortened the waiting times for claims to be used by those small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have the financial resources needed to fund their own research into labels .
As a further , albeit final , offer , the Council has also allowed the use of the wording 'low alcohol content ' .
Furthermore , thanks to the measures taken by Parliament , due attention has been paid to SMEs , which must be supported if they are to adapt to the changes introduced by the regulation and which will consequently be able to rely both on definite time periods in which to place their own products on the market and on the possibility of using pre-authorised claims .
In February , Parliament unanimously adopted my report on that subject .
That Treaty was not actually approved , but rather rejected by means of popular referendums in France and the Netherlands , with the leave of Mr Napolitano , the newly elected President of the Italian Republic , who , in his inaugural speech , championed the cause of that Treaty , having forgotten that he was above the parties .
Why was the emphasis placed on photographs and flags back then , while a much firmer and also much more formal position can be observed today ?
Other measures have been undertaken in Bulgaria : the National Council for Equal Opportunities has been set up under the Prime Minister’s Office ; the government has signed the optional protocol of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women ( CEDAW ) ; and with the recent elections , Bulgaria has become much closer to the European average in terms of the number of women present in parliament and in government .
In my capacity as rapporteur for the trans-European networks , moreover , I must stress that these networks represent one of the key factors in achieving the European Union’s targets for economic growth and employment , as identified in the Lisbon Agenda .
We are concerned here with negotiations that I have had the opportunity to follow closely as a member of the first temporary committee , which was set up on an ad hoc basis in order to draft the European Parliament 's proposal aimed at strengthening the cohesion policy and guaranteeing an optimal level of financing so as to enable the necessary reforms to fulfil the ambitions of the European Union and its citizens , whom we represent .
The European Parliament has succeeded in adopting a budget that reconciles political priorities with financial constraints , and in updating its structure and improving the way in which it is executed .
I wonder , however , whether the clear separation between an own resources budget and the provision of the Member States ' contributions might not cause some technical problems in the financing of particular programmes , unless this separation is also applied to the programmes themselves and the political objectives to be achieved .
Nevertheless , I cannot fail to mention some shortcomings of the report too .
The Commission must therefore demonstrate that no grey areas exist in that regard .
Consistency is also duly required between the Community’s actions and those carried out by each individual Member State .
Interinstitutional cooperation and dialogue constitute a testing ground that will enable us to achieve a positive and effective outcome in the interest of all the actors involved , particularly those from developing countries .
There is therefore a need to identify long-term prevention measures , which can be summed up using the concept of
