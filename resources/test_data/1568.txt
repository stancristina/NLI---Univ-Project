be more than five million more unemployed than at the start of the economic crisis .
One of the objectives set out in the document presented by the Commission on 3 March is to reduce the number of people at risk of falling into poverty by 20 million .
This is a very important part of the EU 2020 strategy that I mentioned before , and it was included in the conclusions of the meeting of the Employment , Social Policy , Health and Consumer Affairs Council that has been mentioned so many times here and took place this week .
Madam President , the first question , on pensioners who own property in Spain , is very similar to another question put to me previously , and the response is very similar to the one I gave previously .
I would like to mention an interesting result of Eurobarometer 2007 , according to which half of Europeans think that all elderly people , who are the most vulnerable people , are poorly treated , and even abused in terms of the way in which their needs are met .
The social dimension of the strategy for growth and job creation features very heavily in the document presented by the Commission , and will be debated by the Heads of State or Government .
This is what happens in any European countries where this occurs .
In turn , according to the same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia hoped to negotiate and conclude local border traffic agreements between Russia and the neighbouring Member States of the European Union that might be interested in doing so .
It will therefore always be beneficial for us to seek opportunities to strengthen our relations with Russia , while always standing firm on our principles and on the values on which the European Union is founded .
In any event , it is very important to us that there are solid clauses and solid agreements with Russia on trade , investment and energy .
In the European Union - especially since many European Union countries suffered very directly from the gas crisis between Russia and the Ukraine at the beginning of 2009 - we place an extremely high value on energy security , and we definitely consider it to be one of the European Union 's major objectives , an objective that is naturally linked to the major objective of combating climate change .
The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens European foreign policy : there is a President of the European Council and a High Representative , and there is going to be a European External Action Service .
I would also like to remind you that this issue is dealt with periodically in the context of the dialogue between the European Union and Russia on energy .
Linking this with visa policy is a leap that is currently very difficult to establish or specify .
In order to make this a reality , my Group is in favour of three main objectives .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately we are having to deal with this sad and now customary matter once again .
I would also like to express our gratitude to all the people who have worked selflessly and to all the professionals who assisted the victims .
The European Union , under the Spanish Presidency , has established a mechanism for coordinating aid with the United Nations , and a post-disaster task force ; the European Commissioner for International Cooperation , Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response is also expected to arrive on the ground in the next few days .
I would like to highlight President Bachelet 's actions , for she has demonstrated once again how politics should be conducted , displaying great humanity and working closely with Mr Piñera , who takes over as President today ; I also wish to congratulate him for the exemplary way in which he has put politics to one side in order to rise to the challenge as his country needs .
I therefore think it is important to consider not only the recovery and reconstruction measures needed after a disaster has occurred , but also , in many cases , to re-examine certain structural elements , and my question relates to that point .
This resolution urges the European Union to show unreserved support for the change of political regime in the Republic of Cuba and also proposes the use of European cooperation mechanisms in order to achieve that aim , which constitutes an unacceptable act of interference that contravenes international law .
It was done in this way when responding to the very serious crisis and there was an immediate reaction in terms of injecting public money into Europe 's economies , which led to large deficits .
These are the strategic objectives that the European Commission stated in its document , such as the issues of employment , investment in research and development , climate change and energy , leaving school early , education in general and poverty .
A commitment by developed countries generally to collaborate with those that are still not developed so that we all arrive at the very important Cancún conference in the best possible condition .
Madam President , I believe this has been a very important debate : a debate on an issue that is at the heart of European concerns at the moment - the Greece issue - but , beyond that , on the economic situation of the European Union as a whole , a debate at which , by the way Mr Audy , the Presidency of the Council has been present , as agreed in Parliament : I represent the Presidency of the Council here .
I am sure that this weekend 's European Council , which is the same European Council that met on 11 February , will strengthen and preserve that stability
