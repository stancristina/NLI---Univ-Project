.
Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on this important report .
It is important both in terms of the functioning of the single market and , most importantly , for the protection of consumers .
It is right that we should focus on the way in which counterfeiting is growing between the Member States , within the single market , as well as beyond the frontiers of the European Union .
The consumer can be conned by counterfeiting in all circumstances very easily but it is always a menace .
It is a menace because the counterfeit product carries none of the necessary guarantees of safety and quality which come from a product which the manufacturer can stand by and endorse .
It can be dangerous to health .
It can certainly be dangerous to innovation .
It can be dangerous for the future of research .
There is very little to be said for the counterfeiter except that , at best , he or she is a parasite upon productive industry .
This is not a victimless crime .
We are talking about things that seriously damage the marketplace .
For that reason , the Environment and Consumer Policy Committee takes much the same line as the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in supporting and endorsing this report .
Naturally the point we would wish to make in conclusion , however , is that in protection of the consumer , the provision of information must involve consumer organisations within the Member States themselves .
They are best placed to pick up some of the worst scams which now prevail and inform the public that what may , at first sight , appear to be a bargain , is really a snare and delusion .
My second point has been touched upon by the previous speaker .
It is this : there are those who would say that this debate embraces the debate about copyright and trademarks .
These must be kept separate .
A number of amendments from the political groups and the committees have tried to make this clear .
There is a debate going on - and the Commissioner knows perfectly well about this - about parallel imports and whether these are now being used in some cases in a way which is damaging to trade , anti-competitive and against the interests of the consumer .
We do not want to see these two debates confused .
What we are attacking here in this proposal , and quite rightly , is those who , by the parasitic practice of counterfeiting , batten upon the public , confuse and deceive it and can sometimes actually damage society in the process .
Madam President , I wish to thank my own group for allowing this resolution to come this far .
It is not often that we discuss urgencies that might be able to change something for the better .
We are always very reactionary and talk about things that we really cannot affect .
However , next month , before we sit again in Strasbourg , the European football championship starts .
A number of problems have already been raised by people such as the Belgian Police Federation , and there have been many documentaries in various countries about various games and the security arrangements for Euro 2000 .
I know this is meant to be a human rights issue , and indeed it is about the rights of ordinary people .
Every real supporter of football has the right to go to a football game and spectate , and then come away without a threat of violence , without problems on the streets and without being harassed unduly by people we do not particularly like to meet at any time : football hooligans .
This is what this motion is about and I very much hope Members will support it .
( Parliament approved the proposal )
Madam President , on a point of order .
It is the same point , and for once I agree with Mrs Ahern .
This must be a first !
Mr President , I am pleased to have this opportunity to address Parliament on this very important issue .
The main thing to stress is that misuse of funds in one place should not prevent innovation continuing in other areas .
Excellent schemes are already being developed and should be supported .
In an unstable agricultural industry , the opportunities offered by flax and hemp in a developing market for natural fibres should not be lost .
It will provide farmers with the opportunity to diversify - something that they have continually been urged to do by respective Member State governments and by the European Parliament - to produce new employment possibilities .
In my own nation , Wales , flax processing plants are already being established using European Union aid .
The report from our Agricultural Committee also includes amendments to extend grant aid for producing flax and hemp to non-arable land , thus providing opportunities to diversify areas of the European Union unable to obtain monetary support under the present regime .
This is a crucial matter as it affects thousands of hectares of European land with low productive possibilities .
For example , 80 % of the land mass of my nation , Wales , is non-arable .
The higher than average incidence of rainfall there makes it ideal terrain for growing short-fibre flax and yet it could not apply for European Union support under prior regulations .
Its peripheral location , something which has already been stressed here from other areas , and its small family farm units having to compete in a wider market , coupled with the high value of sterling , has meant that it has lost 80 % of its income in less than three years .
The importance of flax production being subsidised in such areas of the European Union cannot be overemphasised
