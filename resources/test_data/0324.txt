like to ask the Greek Presidency whether it is going to do anything to mediate on this regrettable issue of the disappeared .
Hence my question : why are the appropriate decisions not taken so that we do not have to suffer another such disaster , and so that the adoption of measures is speeded up with the efficiency that this case demands ?
Mr President , I respected your authority at all times , since I did not know whether or not I could ask a supplementary question .
Do you not also believe that we should identify particularly sensitive corridors , so that we can have an emergency plan in each case ?
This requires the Bank to take on risks private operators would decline .
One instance is more careful consideration of the social and political aspects of restructuring the productive sector .
I believe it is now extremely close , and takes many different forms .
The first of these is the Bank 's competence in the region .
We certainly believe it would be wise to continue active cooperation with the EBRD following enlargement , whilst also working with the obvious partner , namely the European Investment Bank .
The Commission would first like to thank Parliament for its support of a range of new measures put forward as part of the Commission 's strategy .
I am pleased to inform the House that the Commission has recently concluded the selection process for a study on genetic engineering in aquaculture .
They will require detailed study .
Sea bream and bass are two current examples .
Nonetheless , we have taken note of Parliament 's requests .
That was merely a month to the day after the vessel sank .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , aquaculture is daily achieving greater recognition within the wider context of the fisheries sector at global and Community level .
I am confident it will receive the same support in plenary .
The interests of sensitive European maritime and fishing areas must come first .
In particular , I would like to thank Mr Martin for the speed with which he incorporated into this report the request for ad hoc instrument to be resorted to when environmental disasters occur , regardless of whether they are due to natural causes .
A special section on the promotion of this type of product should be added to the FIFG regulations .
Hence our belief that one of the Community 's priorities must be to identify new high quality species , and add them to the list of preferential species .
The Commission had indeed supported some new facilities for turbot farming .
It will make it possible to maintain the supply of high quality products to the markets .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by joining in the almost universal chorus of praise and congratulations for Mr Martin .
There are employment opportunities in aquaculture itself and in the processing and service industries .
Parliament must urge the Commission to make this available to ensure aquaculture enterprises can benefit from the support of national and Community programmes .
He loved his region and he loved the sea .
It is my belief that such a report will be in line with the resolution adopted here today .
In addition , the presence of our fleet helps to bolster activity in areas dependent on fishing .
Unlike their competitors at global level , European fishermen are no pirates .
The yearly catch amounts to 2.7 million tonnes , which represents 40 % of the annual catch by the Community 's fleet .
To reiterate my earlier statement , the European Union does have the economic , legal , legislative and political potential to take the lead in responsible fishing beyond the Union and promote the principles involved .
The sea is the neglected half of our planet , ladies and gentlemen .
We have the consequences of the Prestige disaster very much in the forefront of our minds at present .
We believe all fishermen should be guaranteed fundamental labour rights .
We are fully aware of the importance of this chapter of the common fisheries policy , especially for certain regions of the European Union .
I do not however agree with the rapporteur 's assessment of the need to revise voting arrangements within the RFOs .
The European Union has committed itself to complying with all international agreements it is party to , and to ratifying the agreement reached in New York .
Currently , 14 Member States are in a position to proceed to ratification .
I am referring to Community legislation and the recommendations by RFOs .
Support will only be available however if there is a fisheries agreement in place to lend consistency to the arrangement .
I trust the House will endorse this assessment of the situation .
The protection and conservation of wild flora and fauna are also two of the objectives defined in the communication from the European Commission on a strategy for the protection and conservation of the marine environment .
Ideally , the potential repercussions should be assessed in advance .
Only when sound scientific information is available will it be possible to decide on the nature of the measures needed to supplement those already in place .
It is clear that we cannot continue to do things as they have been done so far .
The Council fully shares this view .
In 2002 , as some of you have pointed out , we supplied 23 000 tonnes of wheat worth EUR 5 million to the World Food Programme for North Korea .
Elections from which , in the face of so much disaster and outrage , the opposition parties withdrew .
Therefore , Madam President , we consider that this Resolution is very good and positive in terms of achieving something that is among the priorities for Parliament and the European Union .
