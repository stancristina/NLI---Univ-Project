The European Union needs to be bolder , to learn from the successes of the American model - which announced a worrying 80 % increase in farming subsidies yesterday - and to allow the creative forces of private initiative free - but not of course unaccountable - rein , without abandoning the social market economy , so as to escape the current climate of uncertainty which is a breeding ground for many a threat .
However , I should like to add the following : First : the European Union should revert to the idea of a special programme on tourism , such as the PHILOXENIA proposal which came up against opposition from a number of Member States .
The motion for a resolution by the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport contains a number of fine proposals .
Of course I know what has been done in the past but , with the Olympic Games approaching , I think we should seriously consider if all these individual measures and studies are going to bring about a real Community action plan or , if the Commission encourages the Member States and the relevant decision is taken , national action plans on the subject .
The number of children taking dietary supplements and turning professional before they even reach school age is out of all proportion .
Mr President , I have one comment and one question .
I do not mean programmes and money , I mean something else .
Do you intend to submit a proposal for us to recognise some sort of special representation of the Roma to the European Union ?
You have reiterated what was said in Helsinki and of course I have a great deal of respect for that , but what I am referring to are the negotiations taking place between the two sides .
As you know , this is a scenario which is currently being discussed .
Mr President , it would , to say the least , be na√Øve to maintain that the food industry is in a parlous state due to a lack of updated directives , given that what directives exist are blatantly disregarded .
This problem is first and foremost a political problem .
The GUE/NGL Group endorses and supports the joint motion for resolution on Euro-Mediterranean relations .
Events themselves , with fatal cases of serious "unprecedented " illnesses , should have made us face up to crucial questions about the health of our livestock , the quality of our food and the huge threat to consumers .
Otherwise , we shall end up tinkering with individual technical aspects which do nothing for public health and misleading consumers in the process .
The GUE/NGL Group has endorsed the joint motion for resolution on relations between the EU and Russia .
Thirdly : at a more general level , the European Union needs to promote the perception of and the institutional structures and economic mechanisms for a common European area with Russia , as with the Ukraine .
It reinforces the anti-grass roots policy of constantly higher profits with proposals which provide cover for the rampant neo-liberal economic and social policy of the ? U and its tragic consequences .
At a time when the social and economic situation is worsening and inequalities are spreading , it advocates a policy of structural reform to apportion unemployment , make flexible forms of work and job uncertainty and insecurity the rule , condemn millions of citizens to poverty , penury and marginalisation , reduce wage costs and ensure that big business keeps making bigger and better profits .
We are voting against the motion because the policies of the ? U and the Member States are incompatible with the needs of workers , farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises and are dictated by and serve the interests of big business .
As far as the ? U is concerned , ? ? ? ? is a "fundamental guarantee for the Euro-Atlantic stability and security [and ] the essential framework for coalition operations " and the EU aims to be a " coherent , reliable and equal partner to the US" in the context of NATO .
Competition between the imperialist powers finds expression in the report 's call for the US to honour its commitments to the WTO , the IMF and the World Bank .
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report .
When shall we have this sort of policy ?
Which countries are they ?
I thank the President-in-Office for the sensitivity which he has demonstrated , both now and when we discussed the matter today , when referring to the intervention on the part of the Spanish embassy with the Egyptian authorities .
In the final analysis , what counts in our political career , over and above the grand speeches we all make , is whether or not we are able to save or improve a few lives .
Two Siamese twins were successfully separated by doctors in the United States and both have survived .
Our citizens have every right to object to the abdication of power to the European Union , even if it makes sense technically , while this democratic deficit persists .
Nor does it agree with policies of violent , controlled crisis ; in the final analysis , they are not in its interest .
We have never discussed how many smugglers have benefited from the embargo , we have never discussed which companies here in the European Union are collaborating with the regime and snapping up every project on offer in Iraq on very good terms .
This being so , the various committees being proposed should include a committee to write a who 's who of Iraq 's financial and commercial
