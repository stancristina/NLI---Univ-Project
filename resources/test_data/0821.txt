In my opinion , it is interesting to note , however , that it would be more useful to have functioning Ombudsmen in those countries and in particular in Italy than to have a European Ombudsman .
I would , however , congratulate Mrs Sbarbati on her productive work with the European Ombudsman . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Mr Frattini on his comprehensive report and on the proposals , ideas , content and values defended in his speech .
The reaction has been one of unacceptable xenophobic violence .
Every citizen who commits a crime is personally accountable .
It offers maximum protection for people working , studying and wanting to become integrated , but comes down hard on those people who break the rules .
In Italy for example , the decree implementing the directive sets forth certain terms and conditions , but it does not provide any sanctions , so the law is in fact completely ineffectual .
Above all , we need to make sure that immigrants are escorted back to their own country , obviously in cases where there are genuine reasons for doing so .
This was in Rome , one of Europe 's foremost capital cities .
These are proportional measures that always allow for the continued right of mobility , a right that will never be denied for economic reasons , because poverty cannot be a stigma or a reason to discriminate against citizens .
Blame is individual , never collective .
We have discussed - and are still discussing - the Schengen Agreement .
This government , which is as incapable of understanding social unrest as it is of preventing it , cannot conceive of addressing the problem .
The European Union , rather than lament the fact that Italy has not asked for funding , should take note of what President Barroso said , in other words that if a Member State allows slums to develop on its territory , what can it expect the Commission to do ?
Europe understands this .
We can certainly agree to the directive on penalising employers who illegally employ non-Community migrant workers , but we find no trace in the programme of those legislative measures on legal migration previously announced by Vice-President Frattini .
My Group is nevertheless somewhat hesitant about certain other aspects , especially concerning the external dimension of the Schengen area .
The issue under discussion , neighbourhood policy , this laudable new initiative , will undoubtedly become bogged down in bureaucracy like so many others : Lisbon , but also Barcelona and all the rest .
The problem is that our Europe has limits .
The EU 's humanitarian aid must be accompanied by political and diplomatic activity that makes compliance with international law , especially international humanitarian law , a priority for the so-called recipient state .
Illegal fishing , considered to be one of the major scourges undermining the protection of bluefin tuna stocks , also needs to be vigorously combated .
Sociopolitical matters are within the competence of the Member States .
We do not really need studies and analyses .
It is time to take action at last .
We believe that all religions can play a positive role , a peacekeeping role , to encourage respect for diversity .
The knowledge base of workers must likewise be raised .
Now , with flexicurity , we are experimenting with a new ideology , but one that preserves the old model of insecurity intact .
Free trade , the WTO rules and even EPAs are not an end in themselves but tools at the service of world trade .
Major progress has been achieved in almost all respects , yet the railway sector lags behind somewhat .
How can a locomotive be made to cross a border when it might not be perfectly suited to the network on the other side ?
It also advocates that the burden of proof of the fact that something is not interoperable - even on safety grounds - should be shifted onto Member States : in other words the initial assumption is that , once certified , everything can go everywhere , unless someone can give me a serious reason why that should not be the case .
We quite rightly saw fit to separate out safety from everything else by creating 25 European agencies .
The list drawn up by us in this House , with everyone 's assistance , is merely an indicative list , which I hope can be further expanded .
In sum , we all acknowledge that tourism is one of Europe 's most promising industries , and I think we can say that - above all for reasons of cohesion - it is worth standing by our main aim of developing the tourist economy ; this means making the most of resources such as cultural and environmental resources , which can be done by utilising the Union 's formal powers to the full .
This comprehensive report contains a number of ideas which should be more than pious wishes .
I will finish , however , by saying that China absolutely must play its part and the Commission must demand that it does so .
For this reason , Commissioner , I have attempted - along with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and the European Parliament , whom I would thank once again - to envisage in the report a comprehensive , coherent reform which is above all transparent .
We therefore support a more efficient use of economic resources : for national development programmes and for the implementation of measures better tailored to the specific needs of each producer country .
It is thus essential , Commissioner , for designations of origin and geographical indications , which embody the quality of European wine-growing , to be well protected .
Protection means the
