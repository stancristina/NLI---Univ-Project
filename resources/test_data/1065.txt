This has been the situation over recent years , although the threat of regression and attempts at destabilisation have not disappeared .
After the irregularities in the first round which took place in April , Parliament decided to send a delegation of observers from this House to the vote on 28 May .
Finally , the candidate , Mr Toledo , during his visit to various countries of the European Union and to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( incidentally , it would have been desirable for him to have met with Members of this Parliament during his visit to Brussels ) , expressed on several occasions the importance of preserving and maintaining economic cooperation and aid from the European Union to the Peruvian people .
Therefore , since two recent days , 9 April and 28 May , have caused us great concern , it is clear that we will only be able to act appropriately if we send observers , which we hope will be possible , and who we hope will be able to act effectively .
President Fujimori took power with dangerous plans : to give absolute priority to supposed economic efficiency , claiming that a strong hold on power was required to manage it , and to overcome what he called 'party-ocracy ' , subliminally blaming all the previous problems on the institutions of the democratic state .
In fact , having denounced the irregularities of the campaign , demanded the postponement of the second round and withdrawn its observers , it does not seem consistent that it should remain silent with no further reaction or sanctions , contenting itself in reality with merely condemning the situation .
Firstly , the incorporation of new countries , which means that the countries which currently benefit from the Cohesion Fund may find that they will no longer be in receipt of those Funds before they have achieved the objectives of real convergence .
Secondly , transport aimed at the integration of peripheral regions , islands and outlying areas should become a priority .
This approach must be applied systematically and must be based on the analysis of the payments corresponding to each regulation .
The majority of nut production in the European Union takes place in arid areas and on steep slopes in drought conditions .
Tariff protection is very low and is being progressively dismantled following the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation and other preferential agreements .
The tariff for hazelnuts stands at 3.3 % .
The pressure of imports and the difficult climate and soil conditions demand , therefore , support for Community nut production .
I had my speech prepared , but having heard the reply which the Commissioner has just given us and the words of Mr Jové in his presentation , I believe that I am going to forget my notes and try to improvise in reply to the Commissioner ' s response .
Therefore , I would like to say that , in the COM in fruits , the operational funds are intended for those crops - for those fruits - for which there is large-scale production .
Therefore , Commissioner , the extension of these improvement plans , as long as they are organised , used , and allocated according to a differentiated treatment in the coming reform of fruits , which will happen shortly , I believe that this will resolve and calm the fears which Mr Jové has expressed , which are shared by all the nut producers in the European Union , as they communicated to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , where they received our political support .
It must be said that both specific measures for nuts and locust beans , as well as the lump sum aid for hazelnuts , were in fact transitional measures aimed at the conversion of the crops , but there is no reason why they cannot be extended .
Secondly , according to the assessment of the agricultural sector , and this one in particular , it should be pointed out that there is much greater sensitivity towards environmental responsibility than there was ten years ago .
As has been pointed out , our tariffs continue to be very low , European products are still unable to compete with those originating above all from Turkey and the United States , as a result of social and labour costs or because the crops , in the case of the United States , are in irrigable areas and are mechanisable while those in the European Union are in drought areas which are not easily accessible , where there is little chance of mechanisation , and it is therefore true that they are less competitive .
Each institution must fulfil their respective obligations and urge Member States to gather reliable information by working clearly and effectively together .
Whether we like it or not , Europe is not confined to the European Union , which is why we must support moves to broaden the scope of this proposal to incorporate countries that do not form part of the European Union and those who at present have the status of candidate countries .
I think that Mr Ferri' s concerns - some of which I do not personally share but have defended as a member of the Group of the European People ' s Party - will come to the fore in the next few years and I should like to assure him of our support since he has been proved absolutely right on many of the issues he has defended in the past .
As regards the regulation , the first point I should like to make is that it derives from the 1993 Directive .
One of the more important amendments in my view is Amendment No 16 , which provides that , in certain
