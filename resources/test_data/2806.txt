To this end , over the last few weeks , the government has submitted a national programme for the adoption of the acquis communautaire and a raft of very important legislation on VAT , excise duties and the right to purchase property .
One does wonder in that case what aim the campaign is pursuing and what the point of it is .
I think that these episodes are merely temporary aberrations which can be put right by the political forces and the authorities in Slovenia .
I believe that Slovenia enjoys all the right conditions and has the capacity to do very well .
Throughout the region of the Balkans there is a need for stability , development and processes of integration which transcend national identity , and Slovenia can make a significant contribution here .
I think all the right factors are there : the attitudes of the previous labour government have been overtaken by the determination of the current one , and the main macroeconomic indicators are good , as was acknowledged by the rapporteur herself , Mrs Malone .
Now I think that , if that does indeed happen , it would be the last opportunity and could create difficulties if the Members ' Statute were not respected in the individual countries .
I fully understand that there is a political duty and a duty on the institutions to intervene as matters now stand , and for that reason , while confirming my own position on the conflict , I now support any initiative designed to seek a positive solution from a political , moral and legal standpoint , focusing particularly on the role that the UN , the EU , NATO and Russia can and must fulfil .
And so this is ethical warfare .
I would further ask for the European Parliament to sponsor an initiative to show solidarity , including financial solidarity , with the people of Apulia , who have not only generously taken in and continue taking in tens of thousands of Albanian and Kosovar refugees , but are paying the high price of the war given the logistical difficulties they face as a result of the closure of the region 's airports and the impact on the whole of Apulia 's tourist industry as tourists cancel their reservations and decide not to visit the region .
We therefore consider the amendments to be an integral part of the programme itself .
As you see , we have tried to devise a broad strategy because a Europe that is able to create a single market and a single currency must be able to find ways and means of jointly tackling a problem of this magnitude .
Mr President , as conveyed in the joint resolution , the Green Group wishes to express its sincere condolences to the families of the victims .
The Channel Tunnel has on several occasions run into great difficulty , despite being extremely modern .
It also worth pointing out that the resolution further calls for closer cross-border cooperation between the civil protection units ; points to cooperation with the Swiss authorities as the best way of tackling , in the short term , the problems caused by the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel ; and calls upon all the Member States to assess the need to equip with a safety tunnel , allowing rapid evacuation in the event of an accident , those tunnels which currently do not have one , as was tragically the case in this incident .
I expect representatives of the affected regions to meet in the coming weeks to assess , not least in the light of our debate , what new measures can be taken both to bring traffic back on to the roads and as regards the issue of tourism .
Plainly , we cannot tolerate accidents of this kind , which are totally incompatible with the approach being taken by the European Union .
We read that the French authorities are condemning the dearth of Italian rescue services at the entry to the tunnel and the fact that , in the event of an accident , the rescue services actually had to come from Aosta .
My second proposal is to further encourage the shift of hazardous goods from road to rail - hackneyed words , but this approach has never been adequately implemented - and therefore to provide new incentives for combined transport .
Switzerland has been mentioned .
Forced labour and indeed slavery are widespread in the country .
We would be deluding ourselves if we were to think that a Cambodian court could give an unprejudiced ruling on the crimes he committed against humanity or , more generally , the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge .
In particular , the Commission must suspend development cooperation under the Lom√© Convention and simply maintain humanitarian aid and direct assistance by the NGOs to the most vulnerable sections of the population .
Madam President , violence is a dominant feature of contemporary society and an enigma of our open society , a society that has lost its values and is taking on new idols and new symbols , confounding those traditional values which have always formed the basis of our civil life .
Unfortunately , it is clear that the only way to keep these businesses where they are is by granting direct fiscal and economic incentives to firms operating in Venezia Laguna .
I should like to dwell for just a moment on this first point .
And because we inherited it , we are duty-bound to hand it down to future generations .
Venice clearly does belong to humanity as a whole , since when wandering through its streets and over its bridges , eight out of every ten people one comes across are tourists , and seven of those eight are foreigners .
I have heard talk
