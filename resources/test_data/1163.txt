suggestions from any quarter that Ireland should suffer as a result of the success of the Irish economy is a very serious threat .
Madam President , I would like to inform the House that , as a substantial rightholder in the audio-visual sector , I have a direct financial interest in the issue before the House and will accordingly be abstaining throughout .
Madam President , there will of course be many Members who will have some direct or indirect financial interest in this matter , in most cases to a rather small extent .
Parliament 's Rules of Procedure however state that Members must declare their direct financial interests if they are going to speak in the debate .
I refer to Article 1 of Annex I of our Rules of Procedure .
The Rules do not require us to register such an interest before voting .
If every Member who has an interest is now going to get up and declare it before we start this vote , we will only start the vote at 1.00 p.m.
Such interests are registered in the written declaration of Members ' interests , so they are there for the public to see ; that declaration will also soon be on the Internet following the vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs last week .
Madam President , as I have declared it to other people already I thought it was only fair to declare it to this House that I will be abstaining because of pecuniary interests .
Madam President , following a point of order made by Mr Corbett , entirely correctly referring to the Rules on this , I should like to draw to the attention of the House that on the previous vote of the Bowe report , if everybody in this House who had an interest in pharmaceutical companies through shareholdings had declared an interest , we probably would not have arrived at the majority required .
It is therefore important that Members do not need to abstain on the vote .
They need only to make a declaration of interest in committee or in Parliament if they speak on the matter .
Otherwise we shall find we are short of majorities on a number of votes where people legitimately have interests .
Madam President , this request from the EDD Group is actually an abuse of our procedures .
If the EDD Group were really concerned with this issue , it would have tabled an amendment to the legal basis of the proposal at committee stage , or at first reading , or when it came to the committee at second reading .
To come back now and make this procedural motion in Parliament because they have failed to do their homework in committee is really abusing the Rules of Procedure .
( Parliament rejected the motion for referral back to committee ) ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) Report ( A5-0015/2001 ) by Mr Lange , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/24/EC on certain components and characteristics of two or three-wheel motor vehicles [COM(2000 ) 314 - C5­0334/2000 - 2000/0136(COD ) ] ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) Report ( A5-0018/2001 ) by Mrs Jensen , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment [COM(2000 ) 459 - C5­0384/2000 - 2000/0195(COD ) ] ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) Report ( A5-0024/2001 ) by Mr Swoboda , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council regulation on assistance to Turkey in the framework of the pre-accession strategy , and in particular on the establishment of an Accession Partnership [COM(2000 ) 502 - C5­0468/2000 - 2000/0205(CNS) ]
.
The European Parliament has been asked to give its assent to this agreement between the European Union and the United States of America in the field of higher education and vocational education and training .
As rapporteur for the European Parliament I gave my support to this agreement as cooperation of this kind is essential in today 's global society .
I believe that there is a great deal to be gained on both sides with this agreement .
European skills in business and technology can be enhanced both by learning from American teachers and with American students .
The same model could be reversed to help improve American knowledge of language teaching methods and working in multi-cultural contexts .
This is borne out by the agreement itself , which was inspired in the United States by their observation and admiration of the ERASMUS programme .
I am sure that the European Parliament would welcome a greater involvement in the discussions for this agreement , and hope that MEPs are consulted at an earlier stage of the proceedings than for this set of negotiations .
The Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport was notified of the agreement only a few weeks before the negotiations with the American authorities .
The agreement is to receive EUR 8.6 million for its five-year duration .
I would propose that research be carried out from next year into how private funding can be used to supplement this figure .
Discussions with the Commission and the American authorities have shown enthusiasm for the idea , and I hope it is one that the European Parliament , European Commission and US Administration can cooperate on .
As I set out in my explanatory statement , the programme would also benefit from being given a name that would help raise its profile among students , universities and the general public .
