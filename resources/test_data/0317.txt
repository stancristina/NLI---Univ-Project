would like to take this opportunity to express one regret and voice one hope .
Mr President , this morning , I think that we indeed witnessed an historic moment , as all my fellow Members have said , when we welcomed our counterparts from the candidate States .
Following accession , however , we must continue our work to enlighten and convince people throughout the enlarged EU.
Accession to the European Union will not protect the workers of these countries against unemployment that is already high , the low wages or the reduction of social protection schemes and will not prevent peasant farmers from being driven from their land .
This solution is to define a specific framework of relations including a substantial economic section and which enables us to finance a specific number of projects and infrastructures .
This is far from being the case .
With regard to the second point , entitled 'Stability and security ' , the terrorist threat hangs over the Union .
With regard to the Union 's foreign policy , we would ask the Commission to publish a Green Paper on the new borders of the enlarged European Union , supplemented by ideas on relations with the new neighbouring States and the various partners .
It is maintaining the restrictions on public spending under the Stability and Growth Pact , even though it has been recognised at the highest level that the Pact is not as intangible as it seems .
The Union should play a part in international negotiations , in particular within the WTO , and espouse concerns over genuine development in the poorest countries .
They want to become part of the European family and are ready to make a great deal of effort to accomplish that .
We could adopt a dogmatic stance in response to this situation , superstitiously chanting 'stability , stability ' .
In February 2002 , the Commission presented to Parliament the annual political strategy for the year 2003 .
I would like to end by emphasising the importance of dialogue with the Council .
What will happen at the end of 2003 if the Council does not manage to reach an agreement on the ethical issues relating to these hundreds of millions of euros in appropriations ?
Lastly , the document as a whole leaves a nasty taste in the mouth .
Mr President , media concentration is an important issue not only at European and national level but also at sub-Member State level .
In the face of these powers , governments like the European authorities only bow down and respect the speculative stock market profits and board secrets .
Although a reunited Cyprus is not considered a criterion for accession to the European Union , which I am pleased about , a peaceful political settlement is still a priority .
We voted against this report .
( FR ) When the Council adopted a directive in 1999 authorising the application of reduced VAT rates to certain labour-intensive services , it was understood that this was an experimental measure due to expire on 31 December 2002 .
That alone speaks volumes about the true social content and nature of 'enlargement ' . The only reason we are not voting against this report , therefore , is because some of the programmes and financing stipulated might perhaps , even if originally intended to support Western European industry , help certain Eastern European researchers in some small way .
Furthermore , harmonisation on the subject , due to adequate , responsible cooperation between the Member States , can effectively reduce the increase in cigarette sales as well as the number of lives destroyed by smoking .
Promoting a brand , that is a symbol of the tobacco industry , obviously has the same effect in terms of smoking as advertising packets of cigarettes .
Furthermore , I agree with the rapporteur in that we will need a larger budget if these aims are to be fulfilled !
Nevertheless , we abstained on the report as a whole .
I call on you therefore not to make the same mistake with the Chechen movement , and to stand firm against Islamic terrorism .
We could have responded positively to Mr Putin 's proposal for a common market , not just in goods and money , but also in people .
The agreement includes a commitment by the European Union to provide technical and financial aid to the Russians to promote the economic development of the enclave .
Mr President , we need to be proactive in developing many different relationships with Russia on a number of strategic issues , from the fight against terrorism to the situation in the Middle East , from energy to space .
Since that time , the situation in Chechnya has dramatically worsened , and the civilian population of the region is powerless in the face of the actions of the special forces .
The terrorism of despair of the Chechen fighters is in no way comparable with the State terrorism practised by Russia .
Along with my colleagues , I therefore call for Article 202 of the Treaties to be reformed .
It also proposes defining the role of the European Central Bank , which has an essential role as a lender of last resort .
At seven weeks , chickens who consume antibiotics in their feed are ready for slaughter , whereas those which do not , weigh barely one kilogram .
My group will therefore support it .
This is why the report presents temporary employment as a normal form of working , even though it accentuates exploitation , flexibility and insecurity .
Biotechnology and life sciences are undoubtedly key in building a more competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy .
We must also encourage the development of researchers in our universities and facilitate their laboratory work within the spirit of the European Charter for Small Enterprises
