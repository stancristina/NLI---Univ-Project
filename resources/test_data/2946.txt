I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas .
In June 1998 , the Commission undertook to present a proposal on the future of the common organisation of the market in olive oil to the Council and Parliament in 2000 .
The new regime would apply from the 2001/2002 marketing year which , as the honourable Member will know , begins on 1 November 2001 .
The Commission is currently studying new data on the structure of olive oil production in the various producer Member States , as well as developments in the world market where the Community is the leading producer by a considerable margin .
The study will also take into account the need to draw up an olive oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product .
As far as product promotion is concerned , the Community is already financing promotion campaigns through the International Olive Oil Council .
Those campaigns appear to have a positive effect within the European Union and indeed in third countries .
In response to a specific issue raised by the honourable Member 's question , I have to point out that the produce of new plantings would not give entitlement to aid .
However , the Commission hopes that the Community producers concerned will benefit fully under derogations from the rules as they relate to approved planting programmes , although the olive oil in question would count towards the maximum guaranteed quantity which has already been set .
Finally , the Commission wishes to point out that rather than simply abolishing the intervention system , what has actually happened is that it has been replaced by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support .
Since the start of the 1998/99 marketing year , it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid .
However , it is worth emphasising that over that same period the old buying-in intervention system would not have been activated either .
I am grateful to the honourable Member and I know of the deep concerns he voices .
They certainly are communicated in this House and he does it in a most articulate fashion .
All I can say to him at this juncture , because I know this is a matter of continuing concern and activity by him , is that the CMO for olive oil is due to be reformed , as I indicated earlier , by 1 November 2001 , following agreement in the Council and in this Parliament in adopting Regulation 1638/98.
I cannot assume that if the situation were precisely as the honourable Member describes , and smaller producers were in a dangerously disadvantaged position by comparison with the big producers , there would have been such agreement in the Council and in this House .
Therefore , I hope he will give attention to the results of the studies I mentioned being undertaken at the moment by the Commission , both in terms of the general questions he raised when he submitted his question and also in terms of the relative fortunes of big producers and small producers .
Finally , as someone who is merely a consumer of olive oil , I hope there is no extensive dilution of what is one of my favourite complementary foodstuffs and that , whatever else we do in the European Community , we strive together with olive oil producers of all sizes to maintain the maximum quality .
That is how we sustain our considerable lead in world markets .
Mr President , the current weakness and volatility of the euro is a cause of concern both within and outside the euro-zone .
Does the Commissioner feel that the current stability pact and the powers of the European Central Bank are sufficient to force the Euro-land states to make the difficult and fundamental adjustments in their economic and labour markets , which are essential if the euro is going to be taken seriously by the global financial markets ?
- Mr President , you realise this is the second month running you have done this to me - cut me off as my question was coming up .
Yet you have allowed speakers to speak for over one minute including a rather long and pointless dialogue about the merits of Murcia .
Also in the rules as I recall , you are only allowed to take one supplementary question per political group and these rules are being broken and as a consequence , for the second week running , I miss out on a question .
I think it is absolutely outrageous and I will be writing to the President to complain .
I wish to thank the Commissioner for that very full answer and , in particular , for the last part where he indicates that the Commission is looking at speeding up and , where possible , giving fast-track approval for state aids .
However , in some Member States there is still a serious problem created by delays in decision-taking on state aids .
I am convinced that some jobs have been lost because waiting for the decision on state aid has meant that a company has gone out of business in the end because it did not have the approval in time .
In terms of the delay , is the Commission of the opinion that the reorganisation that is currently going on will provide new resources and assistance to him in his attempts to speed up the processing of state aids , or does the problem lie , as he partly indicated , with the Member States in the inadequate information provided by some of them when they make an application ?
Mr President , I too regret the
