European Union have the political will to put the policies of the Barcelona Process to proper , continuous and efficient use .
The involvement of regional and local society and the involvement of civil society and women in all three pillars of the Barcelona Process rather than just the economy , as the European Parliament recently pointed out in one of its resolutions , will put our efforts on a democratic footing , make our plans sustainable and offer protection for human rights , for which there is a dire need in the region as a whole .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fifth Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting will meet in Valencia on 22 and 23 April and will adopt an action plan containing proposals and measures designed to promote Euro-Mediterranean cooperation .
As I am sure you can guess , I am talking about the Arab-Israeli conflict , Mr President , the tragic and dangerous Israeli-Palestinian conflict which is again in the headlines .
Valencia is a unique opportunity and it must not be wasted .
The Council of Ministers should immediately adopt and promote these measures , as contained in the European Parliament 's proposal .
There have been huge changes in China over the last decade .
China is not doing at all well when it comes to human rights .
And that is what our political strategy should be geared towards .
Our relations are improving constantly and , more to the point , I hope that we shall have more improvements in the future .
And there are a lot of them !
Having said which , I trust that when we come to vote on Mr Gra√ßa Moura 's report tomorrow , subject to a few improvements , we shall set the European Union 's strategy towards China on the right political course .
To put it plainly , they are being asked to adapt without reducing the level of protection or standard of services which they provide .
Similarly , expecting Member States to include the positive impact which reducing the pension burden on contributions would have on the cost of labour and increasing pro rata contributions would have on auxiliary pension funds in their strategies means , to all intents and purposes , that the entire burden of pensions is shifted on to the workers .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , no one disputes that the subject of today 's debate lies at the heart of one of the biggest challenges facing the European Union if it is to update its social model and achieve the Lisbon objectives .
Because these policies are so sweeping and so important to Europe both now and in the future , they have to be democratic and they have to increase the involvement of the social partners and of social and regional agencies and women 's organisations because these social reforms are particularly important to women ; and , come what way , the method of open coordination must guarantee that the European Parliament is fully involved .
I think the European Commission urgently needs to organise information campaigns in liaison with the national governments and social partners .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Fatuzzo for his report and to express my admiration for his enthusiasm and staying power on the subject of the reform of pensions systems .
As we have said time and again in this Chamber , this is not an economic issue , it is a social issue with economic implications .
Pension systems cannot be reformed in a vacuum .
The demographic problem was initially aired at the Madrid conference on the ageing population , which discussed the twin problems of the rise in life expectancy and the European countries ' inability to make up their populations .
No, that is not enough .
Policies on poverty and social exclusion also need to be mentioned here .
However , it is clear , both for reasons of mobility - several members referred to numerous new problems with worker mobility in the European Union - and because there are common causes for the problem of viability , that there is a need for cooperation .
Indeed there are !
Is there more room for cooperation with Parliament ?
Every year Parliament 's presence is more keenly felt , greater account is taken of its proposals and it has a very important role in the application in question .
And may I say I have no objection to sending all the reports to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , so that we can really work together right from the start .
The conference which you have organised in May with authorities from the candidate countries is a good starting point for cooperation , given that the candidate countries will have to take part in this joint exercise in two years ' time .
May I remind the President-in-Office that controls were carried out ; in fact a ship carrying Greek demonstrators was turned back .
These programmes are objectionable and absurd but we cannot attack them through legislation or administrative intervention .
I do not have a great deal of faith in self-regulation because competition lives by its own - very powerful - rules .
However , even with all this , unless we come up with something more original and imaginative , I shall persist in my pessimism as to the future and the success of this sort of programme .
However , that is not the case today .
My own view is that there is a direct correlation between the uneven distribution of people on the planet and the demographic problem on the one hand and the development and distribution of the planet 's resources and the question of social justice , education , equality of the sexes , human rights and development standards , on the other .
