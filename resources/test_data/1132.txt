in Kosovo gets under way , the procedure must be simple and clear , with regard also to the administration of funds and the share of responsibility .
Otherwise , the management of funds will be time-consuming and will lead to a situation in which the impact of aid is weakened .
In May , we discussed here what sort of international presence was needed in East Timor .
That was the great challenge , as people were being intimidated and , since April , the terror had been really appalling .
People went to vote ; it was a sunny day , and I will certainly never forget how many people came to thank us , the international observers , for having come there .
Already the following day , paramilitary forces began to rampage through the streets and villages , and we received news that , in particular , local people in the service of the UN were being persecuted and killed .
Secondly , we must send , through the ECHO programme , humanitarian aid as soon as possible and , obviously , the aim should be in the long-term for a programme of development .
Mr President , Mr Cushnahan asked the Commissioner responsible for foreign policy a question .
The situation in East Timor , and three issues in particular , are on the agenda .
Mr President , I was asked a question which was addressed to Mr Patten , who is responsible for foreign and security policy .
He will assume office tomorrow .
There will be three basic issues : how to re-establish peace ; what the urgent humanitarian needs are and how they can be met in the area ; how to prepare a multi-annual programme to build institutions in East Timor .
They were fully in action until 9 September when they had to be evacuated for security reasons to Australia .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate for their opinions and also for the questions they have asked .
The resolutions approved on Monday by the Council are an indication that we feel a special sense of responsibility towards finding a solution to the issue of East Timor that will benefit its people .
Another principle is insistence on compliance with agreements .
This being the case , the Union will continue its forceful action in the United Nations , the Security Council and in Djakarta .
The meeting at which the decision was approved was a long one : it began yesterday at 18.00 . local time and ended today at 02.00 .
We can feel satisfied that the mandate that has been given is a so-called strong mandate .
The Australians have announced that they are on twenty-four hour alert .
In the long-term , we must allow other Asian countries , and especially those in ASEAN , to participate fully .
The new problem that appears to be emerging now is the situation of the East Timorese in West Timor .
To show that the international community is in earnest in this matter , we are recommending a visit to West Timor in the next view days by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , Mrs Ogata .
Humanitarian action is urgently needed and its main priorities are the protection of refugees in West Timor , access to the area by the UNHCR , and the commencement of airdrops of food and other supplies to take place as soon as possible .
For this we must ensure there are sufficient supplies , and we will use Union relief funds to purchase these supplies .
Furthermore , ECHO has all the while been involved in assessing the size of the aid package needed and co-ordinating Union aid so that it gets to where it is needed most right now .
The legal aspects of the decision are to be finalised by the relevant bodies , and I shall not go into further detail as far as that is concerned .
It has been said here that no one could have failed to predict that things would turn out as they have .
It is absolutely true that we knew beforehand that there would be problems in the region after the referendum .
The Union and the whole international community had had an assurance from the Indonesian government that they would be capable of keeping order and maintaining security in the region .
For this reason , the Council has decided to give its support to the organisation of a special convention of the Commission on Human Rights and the appointment of an investigatory delegation to be sent to the region .
Mr President , the procedures used in Member States to effect deportation do not fall within the scope of Community legislation .
In carrying out their tasks , the authorities in Member States must act in compliance with their own national legislation and be subject to legal and political monitoring by national bodies , and also act in compliance too with the relevant international provisions relating to the safeguarding of human rights .
The death of a child is always a shocking event .
However , the Council , unfortunately , has no knowledge of this case , so it cannot take a position on the matters raised by the Honourable Member in her question .
On the basis of the question , however , it would seem that this is more a case of a traffic accident , rather than a problem of action on the part of the Spanish police .
Mr President , the question is a very far-reaching one : what can be done in this respect ?
Mr President , first I would like to say that the Union aspires to a more uniform immigration and asylum policy and this is the subject intended for discussion at the Tampere Summit in October
