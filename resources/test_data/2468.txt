guidelines .
I would like to congratulate my colleague , Mr Seppänen , who has done much hard work to get this regulation through as quickly as possible , which was our objective .
It is no wonder that the rapporteur had to engage in long and arduous debate with the Council .
As a result , their energy giants , protected from competition as they are , have been able to charge consumers higher prices and use the extra profits , for example , to buy out smaller competitors that are in a more difficult situation owing to the competition than those which evade it .
I have not received a clear answer to this .
National oil companies have always been profitable , not by accident and not just last year , but for decades .
The more than EUR 60 billion profit made last year is so incredible that it even exceeds many countries ’ budgets .
This then is more about countries than just companies .
We know that the industry also has cartels and that it is not a very gentlemanly business .
High oil prices are obviously very harmful to the economy and now the question is whether these profits will be used for any sensible purpose , and how sensible .
The Commissioner said that it is difficult to interfere in the business of companies .
It is difficult because they are bigger than states , but I would urge you to be courageous , because we have a responsibility to the citizens of Europe and , in fact , the future of all humanity .
There are actually two alternatives : increase research or raise taxes .
Moreover , the position of women in the developing countries is connected with our security .
It has also been found that terrorist groups , which we now fear so much , recruit members from areas where there are a lot of unemployed young men with no good prospects for the future .
With regard to development cooperation policy it therefore has to be understood that improving the status of women is one of the most effective ways of promoting development in general ; not only that , but it can help to promote stability and prevent new hotbeds of conflict from springing up .     Mr President , in my speech I will focus just on equality and equal pay in the EU countries .
Unfortunately , the European Union has barely made any progress in matters of equal pay .
The representative of the Council spoke just now and said that the ministers responsible for equality in the EU countries are committed to the development of strategies to promote women’s employment and skills .
President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , now is the time to take action to prevent us from losing our credibility completely and to enable us to fulfil the promises that have been given to women , children and men .
International Women’s Day should not be a day on which women are humiliated by being eulogised .     .
I likewise wish to thank Mrs Jensen and Mr Garriga Polledo , who today are proposing mainly technical amendments to this year’s budget , according to their own areas of responsibility .
The European Union is still going through a period of adjustment to the year 2006 .
In particular , this means bringing the situation with regard to human resources up to date .
Multilingualism is an important value in Europe , and one which needs to be fostered .
Recently the subject of posts in Parliament has arisen once again .
There should be a natural solution to this in the future with the various parties concerned working closely together .
Perhaps a good compromise could also be reached with France , the country concerned .
This has partly come about through a policy of economy with regard to operating expenditure .
That is why the report under discussion provides a good basis for discussion of the budget itself .     Madam President , the essential point of Parliament’s resolution is the definition of European competitiveness .
We Social Democrats are calling for social and environmental sustainability .
Is that possible ?
Yes , it is .
At the same time we have been able to maintain social and environmental sustainability , unlike the United States .
As a member of the Lisbon Committee , I was disappointed that the report is not insisting that the names of those Member States that have not implemented the Lisbon legislation should be repeatedly published .
That way , having received the information , people could encourage implementation .
These two go together .
Sustainable growth and competitiveness cannot be achieved without the highest possible levels of environmental and social protection .
It should be directly linked to the Lisbon strategy and it should also serve to guide different policy areas within the European Union .
New , more ambitious steps have to be taken to prevent climate change .
We have to estimate how much doing absolutely nothing will cost .
Ambitious legislation linked to the right means of financial control is also a good combination for creating demand for the new environmental technology .     .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks go to the rapporteur , Mrs Locatelli , for her excellent work .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists strongly supports the report and appreciates the work that has been done so well .
That is why this is a crucial area .
Accordingly , it is hardly appropriate to finance very small individual projects in the field of basic research .
Private agencies and institutions will hardly be prepared to provide such a large share of the funding of organisations that have their sights on the distant future and technological revolution .
Examples might be hydrotechnology and nanotechnology
