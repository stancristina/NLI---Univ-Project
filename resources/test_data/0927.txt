The ecosystems , the people themselves , transportation , water - all these disregard frontiers as such , and I believe we need sufficient flexibility to be able to plan our activities at regional level .
First , we believe the legal basis proposed by the Commission to be correct .
Acting on our proposal , the Committee on Transport and Tourism is calling for the development of postal services to be coupled with an improvement in the living and working conditions of postal workers .
But I could not end without speaking of one of those texts which only the Commission is able to produce , referring of course to its communication on the application of rules of competition to the postal sector .
The question also remains as to whether the rapporteur has done right in calling for this review by means of a new directive , thus permitting the public and political debate to continue , rather than leaving the technocrats to decide alone .
It is not possible to make a decision regarding the possible liberalization of direct mail and incoming cross-border mail from June 1998 when the directive does not enter into force until 1997 .
Mr President , I know that monopolies , and especially public monopolies , have the annoying habit of becoming comfortably institutionalized and that liberalization and healthy competition can do them a lot of good in improving their service .
Because to this tragic list we must also add all those who have died at the hands of anonymous attackers , encouraged by the racist propaganda of the far right , and also others .
This is what my country , France , did by adopting the Gayssot Act which led to a veritable intellectual Chernobyl , now denounced by Gaullist writers and deputies .
There is no point in organizing major information campaigns on this subject if we , Europe 's democratic representatives , are prevented from participating due to no fault but our own !
Today 's vote should be seen as an expression of the desire for financial and geographical fairness and social and economic cohesion .
That is a question to which I have not yet found the answer .
By favouring a lax attitude towards immigration , in the name of the combat against racism , the advocates of this resolution and of the policies which it may inspire will alienate people , such as my own , who are not racists but who do want to remain masters of their own country .
Two additional bricks have been added to the edifice by this Regulation and Directive , as they introduce the concept of 'national treasures ' making it possible to give them protection under Community law .
Does free trade always bring maximum satisfaction to all the partners ?
That is now done , and Parliament will receive an annual report on such aid .
I should like to single out a vital element of response .
Just now , we talked about the quantity of aid .
The consultative committees which are to advise the Commission are unquestionably useful , but in the form envisaged in the initial text and made more complicated by the rapporteurs ' amendments , they seem to me likely to make the whole programme very cumbersome to operate .
We are also going to submit to the social partners the entire complex of problems associated with the integration of the young .
We have also begun thinking about a number of ways of reducing the tax burden on employment - the social costs , as they are called - because they have increased over recent years ; we want to see how they might be replaced by other forms of deduction .
First , I should say that our communication , and our strategy , are not intended to replace the responsibility of our Member States , because we are fully aware that it is with the Member States that the primary responsibility lies , and that they and the national governments have their own homework to do .
The first essential is to restore consumer confidence so as to bring market stability via specific activities designed to eradicate BSE - mad cow disease - completely .
As you are well aware , the Commission - in common with Parliament - requested that the social chapter should be integrated into the Treaty at the intergovernmental conference .
Thirdly , they are going to produce a framework text on training , which is equally essential as a lever for providing access to employment .
Mr President , I am in agreement with the honourable Member , because - as I have been at pains to make clear - we are not intending to reinvent the wheel .
As far as the second question is concerned , it is of course true that economic and monetary union is one of the crucial elements for completing the internal market .
It goes without saying that I am also in favour of reducing the cost of labour , but we shall then have to see how these costs are replaced by other measures , other means .
That is the essence of our policy , which is designed to alleviate the sickness from which Europe is now suffering .
I hope that we will be able to obtain initial approval of these regional pacts when they are presented by the Commission at the European Council in Dublin .
Neither solution is entirely satisfactory .
Are we going to treat Morocco as if it was Iraq ?
The second point which seems to be deterring some of our colleagues from endorsing the text produced by our rapporteur , Otto von Habsburg - who , incidentally , I must congratulate - is the matter of Western Sahara
