I also call upon Parliament and upon the Council and the Commission to adopt a position of total condemnation of these methods , which could encourage others to act in the same way .
In any case , I feel that it is appropriate to emphasise that these actions by the LFEC must be explicitly and roundly condemned .
Mr President , since May 2000 , eight Portuguese citizens have been held prisoner in the territory of Cabinda .
This does not mean , however , that we are unaware that there are many conflicts , including the conflict in Cabinda , that do not reach the public ' s attention as a result of the way we ignore Africa .
There is no need to look any further than the reports by Amnesty International , which detail the extrajudicial executions , the systematic use of torture , the murder of civilians and the destruction of villages all suffered in Cabinda .
As a matter of fact , in the recent past , contacts have been established and direct negotiations have taken place between the Angolan Government and those fighting for independence in Cabinda , and the international community can only support this approach .
Bearing this in mind , those who wish to see this initiative as an attempt to use the media to take advantage of a situation that is of legitimate concern to the whole Portuguese and , of course , international community , or to exacerbate political or party-political quarrels , which have no place at all in this context , are deluding themselves .
If I may put it like this , the LFEC must not be in any doubt as to the appreciation of the Portuguese and international communities of the historical aspirations that motivate their struggle .
I also wish to add my voice to the appeal made to the LFEC by all the Portuguese Members here in Strasbourg , for it immediately and unconditionally to release the eight Portuguese citizens that it is holding hostage , to respect human rights , to think of these people ' s families , who are undergoing considerable anguish and worry , and to return the hostages to normal life so that they can move freely within the country in which they have decided to exercise their professions .
European diplomacy must be active in this country , which has 4.5 million inhabitants , and which is already experiencing religious persecution , media censorship and the ongoing breach of human rights .
I wish to take this opportunity to mention Commissioner Nielson ' s willingness to make statements on this subject to the Commission on Development and Cooperation and , particularly , his announcement here of extraordinary aid for Mozambique .
Unfortunately , Mr President , we are speaking once again about a disaster recurring in Mozambique , a new democracy .
It is extremely important that we send health specialists because the first symptoms of diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea have already been diagnosed in the population .
The European Union must therefore express its solidarity with Mozambique , translate its words into action and not forget the efforts of the people of Mozambique , who have tried , at great cost , to consolidate their process of transition to democracy , which is still a long way from being achieved .
In addition to destroying infrastructures , these floods are causing a shortage of drinking water and food as well as a real danger of epidemics as serious and deadly as the floods themselves .
Humanitarian disaster in Mongolia
We must therefore do the best with what we have and with solutions which may be enshrined in European instruments , such as the Staff Regulations , but which represent only one possible approach towards a future European statute .
We have been informed today , by Commissioner Liikanen , that the Commission is , at last , going to get the ball rolling on this dossier .
I shall be writing to the President of this Parliament to express my concern at this action .

At the same time , a great deal is still expected of the Veterinary Inspection Office .
In the meantime , we must keep in mind the tragic problems facing so many farmers and draw our conclusions from the facts .
Central to achieving this objective is the report that the Commission will present in June .
We are seeing trafficking in human beings , the genuine social exclusion of millions of illegal immigrants and the despair that this situation generates deserves closer attention .
I live in an island region , which , under the terms of Article 299 of the Treaty , is called an 'outermost ' region .
In line with the changes to the financial perspective , the 2002 budget will not exceed 1.1 % of the Community GNP , which means that we will be able to stipulate a non-growth budget for the coming year .
As a matter of fact , I would point out that , in this context , we refused to undermine our post-2001 spending objectives in Agenda 2000 .
This illogical approach is intolerable .
The United Kingdom has slaughtered hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions , of animals and the Netherlands has slaughtered a few thousand .
I have one final question : your Veterinary Committee knows the type of vaccination needed and can guarantee its safety .
Secondly , the problems faced by some countries today in mobilising resources to deal with sick animals are clear for all to see .
Otherwise , we shall run the risk of losing control of a potential future outbreak of an even greater crisis , or of irreversibly damaging irreplaceable genetic heritage , as has happened , in some countries , with certain native breeds .
The second question I would like
