supportive of our work , because they know that unless Europe takes a lead on this issue , unless we begin pulling together the best of the ideas from across the European Union , then the cities , towns and rural areas , will continue to suffer from unacceptable levels of congestion and pollution .
I commend Mr Costa 's report , his work and , above all , his ability to bring us all together in a single common objective of trying to tackle the transport crisis .
Mr President , we must make it very clear that this is not about the EU raising taxes or imposing a new tax over and above the existing national taxes .
It is an attempt to find a common set of criteria , of cost components for the transport infrastructure , and minimising substantial discrepancies across the EU.
However , it is up to the Member States to set and levy charges , albeit in a common framework .
At present , revenue is not earmarked for transport infrastructure .
Quite often , I know in the UK, it is used for bolstering government coffers .
I am sure it is the same in other EU Member States .
Transport costs should be paid by the user , but governments should not charge rural users if there is no public transport , and this report makes that very clear .
This report is about a level playing field : not to charge more but to charge more efficiently .
Hauliers in the UK complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage , and that is true .
Non-UK truck drivers do not pay UK road tax .
Other EU countries ' average is ten times lower HTV taxes .
The same applies to diesel fuel : it is three times more expensive in the UK.
That leads to distortion of competition across the EU.
Instead of the UK Eurosceptics criticising this report , they should welcome it because it will do a lot to help our hard-pressed hauliers .
Mr President , also on the question of the security of the House , you will recall that on 28 November 2000 , the Turkish Foreign Minister addressed the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy of this House and he was interrupted by demonstrators .
This was a cause for great concern .
At the time , we drew the attention of the President to this matter and she promised she would look into it and find out what the circumstances were , how the demonstrators had got into Parliament , and take appropriate steps to ensure that such things did not happen again .
In the context of what we have been discussing , the security of this House , I wonder if you would follow this up and see what steps have been taken to improve security and report on that particular incident last November .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on a very good and comprehensive report .
One of its main themes is the need for an integrated strategy .
If we are to tackle the very serious imbalance of representation of men and women , not only in the political sphere but also in decision-making at all levels in society , this is essential .
We should remember that just last year the Finnish presidency looked at nine sectors in the Member States , including national , regional and local parliaments , the civil service and the supreme courts .
Wherever it looked it found women were under-represented .
The problems have been recognised for a long time , but progress on solving them has been slow .
We repeat ourselves constantly in these reports , calling for better statistics and training , awareness campaigns to encourage more women into politics in the same way as they have already very often become key players in their own communities and local groups , and for measures to make it easier for men and to women to balance work and family life .
We have to keep on saying these things because they are needed .
But , in addition , we need positive action , such as quotas , to make a real difference .
This report does not dictate what should be done in individual Member States , but calls upon the governments to look at their own situation and take action to improve the balance of women and men , using legislative means , if necessary , as some have already done .
Where these measures have been used , they have been successful , not only in getting more women elected to Parliament but also in raising awareness , providing good role models for other women - girls in particular - and improving debate and decision-making all around .
So the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support all the conclusions of the report because it will contribute towards achieving equality and real democracy .
Mr President , Commissioner , may I start by declaring an interest , or two interests , in this issue .
I have an interest in a forestry business in New Zealand , inherited from my father , so that gives me a practical interest .
More recently I visited Finland to see the forestry industry at work as the guest of CEPI , the Confederation of European Paper Industries .
So you see the strong Finnish theme in this report continues even with me .
Can I welcome this communication and express my pleasure at its emphasis on the importance of this industry .
Like the rapporteur and other colleagues I recognise that forestry is a very important industry , important for the economy and important for the environment .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report
