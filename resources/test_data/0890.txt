medium-sized businesses to take on young people to improve vocational training .
On this latter point , I wish to digress slightly : my government , the Italian Government , has , in my opinion , made a bold proposal , not to establish a reduction in working hours by law by a decree forcing everyone to do so , but to encourage agreement between the social parties to arrive at a reduction in working hours , with the assistance of the Institutions as well .
This direction favours all the unemployed but , I think , women in particular , who are the most heavily penalized by the rate of unemployment and who have always said that the problem of working hours requires intervention for everyone , men and women .
All responsibility now lies in the hands of the Council .
Personally , however , I do not see any reason for thanking the rapporteur for the other institutions who , on my request to make a minor change to increase the Sakharov Prize allocation , replied that the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgets do not enter into politics .
Taking care not to say , on 21 November , that we will solve the problem of unemployment in Europe with ECU 350 million .
My question is this , Mr Commissioner : does the Commission not think that different forms of guarantees from the usual ones should be introduced for many countries , such as the performance bonds that have already been introduced in America and England ?
And , I repeat , this is why we recall perfectly that the stake is not just one of meeting the citizens ' need for security and the requirements of our finances , but also one of building an efficient democratic structure to combat crime more generally .
The agreement contains specific provisions on transport : the provisions of the transport agreement between the European Union and Slovenia with regard to the overland system , the rules on the freedom to provide transport services and the right to set up establishments remain in force .
We are still faced with a general statement and one of principle on this point , however : we know , in fact , that , while Slovenia has already committed a substantial part of its budget to the construction of infrastructure , the remaining 50 % borne by the financial institutions has not yet arrived .
It is not just a door because , if we look at its flourishing and active economy , Slovenia is already is line with the Maastricht criteria , almost all of which focus on becoming a partner like all the other countries .
There is the danger of a sensational case of unemployment , 2 , 500-3 , 000 more unemployed in a city of around 30 , 000 people .
The Amsterdam Treaty is certainly another milestone in the constitution and development of the European Union .
This Parliament has been complaining of problems such as unemployment and economic development for some time , paying them just as strong and determined attention as that reserved for the monetary union , but we , and the Commission in particular , have had to wait for the initiative of a Member State .
I believe that , with a reorientation of structural funds , passing a stability and social cohesion pact , encouraging and ensuring that member countries have appropriate budget and tax policies for an economic revival , unemployment may be fought in the medium term .
The reforms contemplated by Agenda 2000 will be a reason for a full and exhaustive debate in our Institution , but from now one we can say that we will give our entire support to completing the single market , to reviewing the problem of indirect taxation , to better finalizing the efforts made to make our economy more competitive , to continuing hastily with regard to trans-European infrastructural networks , to reassessing the scientific and technological potential and to a qualifying review of the structural funds .
A policy once again left in the hands of an institution of officials , the Commission .
These were our hopes when the Intergovernmental Conference began its work - to take steps forward towards democracy within the Union and to establish the bases for the definition of appropriate rules for creating the political union and for meeting the conditions required for expansion .
Never have we been as disappointed as we have been here .
That is the fundamental problem : either the Union , under the influence of the single currency , will manage to establish a political status , or it will be destined , from crisis to crisis , from expansion to expansion , to become a trading area for 400 million consumers , subject to political decisions that will be decided by other countries , based on strong , economic and financial relations prevailing from time to time .
Jacques Delors , in his White Paper on Employment , stated , with regard to the insistence on miraculous methods for growth , that untying the purse strings may generate temporary euphoria , in the same way as drugs do , but the awakening will be all the harder when the damage caused by inflation and by internal imbalances has to be rectified .
Europe must be Mediterranean or it will not exist , because we will not have the strength to withstand an ever more desperate immigration .
In fact , Europe has a great responsibility today on this matter : the responsibility of being a beacon , a reference point for all those in difficult situations , those subjected to particular and temporary dramatic living conditions .
If the directive were adopted , it would force the Member States to market products with vegetable fats in their territory under the name of chocolate
