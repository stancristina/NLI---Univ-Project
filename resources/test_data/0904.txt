I wish to remind the Chamber of the tragedy of the forest fires and the drought which have laid waste to southern Europe in recent years , and which have unfortunately hit Portugal particularly badly .
I should like to thank you , Mr President , for the information you gave us on the way in which Parliament marked this date .
It is a serious breach of human rights and of the laws on immigration and work , and has a highly detrimental effect on national and international security .
We are still awaiting a report assessing the measures adopted by the Member States and on whether or not it has been implemented by all Member States .
Thousands of poor women are lured by the promise of a decent , well-paid job , only to be forced subsequently into prostitution .
This debate must produce practical results , whereby the rights of workers are safeguarded and the economic groups with a history of relocations and unemployment no longer receive aid in any Member State .
Has the Commission published the register of breaches of contract by businesses that have relocated and have benefited directly or indirectly from public money ?
By obtaining the various public incentives and aid and exploiting cheap labour deprived of rights , the company is looking to gain maximum profit in a short space of time .
The terrible natural disasters of the summer of 2005 – significant flooding in Central Europe , severe drought in southern Europe and fires destroying thousands of hectares of forest in my country , Portugal , and in Spain – require appropriate and rapid prevention and response measures in the area of civil protection .
There also needs to be effective public monitoring of how Community aid is used and granted to businesses .
Cooperation and dialogue with NGOs and bodies that specialise in the field of equal opportunities must be stepped up , at national and European level , and with third countries .
This is clearly the case when it comes to so-called ‘gender policy’ .
The end does not always justify the means .
We also wish to highlight the proposals on integrated environmental and natural resources , including the management of forests , of areas most at risk from flooding , of wetlands and other fragile ecosystems , and risk assessments in urban areas .
In a country like Portugal , stricken year after year by forest fires and drought which have left indelible scars , this proposal will make it possible to train specialised personnel , to establish preparedness mechanisms and to share equipment and best practice with countries that are more advanced in this regard .
The EU has been proactive and has shown solidarity in response to Member States’ requests for help in the event of major emergencies .
We must do as much as we can when other communities are affected by major emergencies , the crucial priority in this issue being to strengthen mutual assistance between EU Member States .
Even the much-vaunted stabilisation that they claim to aim for does not happen .
Our proposals were as follows . - To highlight the fact that , in most cases , the purpose of business relocations is to derive the maximum profit , secure tax breaks and financial support , and to exploit cheap labour deprived of rights ; - To highlight the fact that relocations form part of the worldwide liberalisation of trade and the deregulation of the labour market , under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation ; - To set up a regulatory legal framework which , among other aspects , addresses : the contractual definition of a minimum seven-year period , guaranteeing stable and lasting employment and regional economic development , providing for sanctions to be applied in the event of non-compliance with contractual obligations ( return of aid granted and prohibition from receiving any more Community aid ) , and protecting the workers by keeping them informed and giving them meaningful involvement , including voting rights ; - To draw up an annual communication on relocations and the impact thereof .
I do not feel , however , that some forms of relocation are avoidable .
Among the important points raised in this report are an end to mercury exports , an end to the use of mercury in measuring equipment and in dental amalgam , controls on emissions , and studies into the effects of mercury in vaccines , something that could bring major benefits for public health .
Our amendments were aimed at guaranteeing free access to technology and knowledge , freedom of movement and exchange of knowledge , and at strengthening the role of intellectual property in relation to the free movement and dissemination of knowledge .
I particularly welcome the call for the early adoption of the 7th Research Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme ( 2007-2013 ) , both aimed at providing the appropriate financial resources to support the Information and Communication Technology ( ICT) as a driving force for competitiveness , growth and employment .
Europe 's economy will only be competitive if it is an innovation-driven economy and if it becomes an economy of the near future and not one of the present .
At the same time , however , the Commission must commit itself to detecting and combating glaring examples of unfair competition , which is exacerbating an already problematic situation .
Although the adopted measures are broadly welcome , we do have one or two concerns .
Given the lack of time I shall limit myself to two remarks .
To pursue this and other unjustified exclusions totally undermines the credibility of these measures .
The real losers in this policy are the workers , small , medium-sized and micro-enterprises , and countries such as Portugal , as borne out by studies and , more
