States , so that it does not fall victim to the cost-cutting that has been the case to date .     – Mr President , Mrs  Hermange’s report is in fact a very important one .
We hope that a few journalists are here too on this occasion , because the evenings are always so long , and so it is sometimes a little difficult to adhere to scheduled starting times .
I hope , Commissioner , that in the next few days you will have something to say about Charleroi airport in Belgium , because it is not acceptable that the railways should be making huge losses on their long-distance passenger services because the cheap airlines are luring their customers away and congesting our skies .
The Council , along with the rapporteurs , has basically been trying to reduce the number of points at issue between the Council and Parliament , sometimes by accepting parliamentary positions and sometimes by proposing compromises , with the result that the conciliation procedure will focus on a core of considerably fewer than sixty or seventy points .
The Council is now proposing that all Member States be represented on the Board .
In this context , may I make an urgent appeal , especially to the Council and its President-in-Office , Mr Lunardi , to ensure that the most directly affected countries are able to agree on a common position so that they can signal to everyone , including Parliament , that the deadlock is being broken .
The obstacles to a single European market that still exist in this domain must be systematically removed .
And let me reiterate my gratitude to the Commission , which has done so much good groundwork .
Had we been able to have such a discussion , I believe we could have broken down certain prejudices that rear their heads in every debate .
I have no wish to become obsessed with dates , but I should like to point out that it would be bad for the railways and for our countries if we in this House did not set any deadlines , because we are convinced that tomorrow’s transport map will cover the whole of Europe , and this development must not be stopped in its tracks by special measures and special rules in the small countries .     – Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs and the entire committee for their work .
I move that this amendment be adopted , so that we can dispense with a second reading of this proposal for a regulation , otherwise the regulation , which is already overdue , could not enter into force in good time .
In the domain of support for rural areas , however , you will be voting on Thursday to determine whether you propose that the amount laid down in the financial programming should be exceeded .
My second point concerns the new Financial Regulation .
The Commission is proposing a further injection of EUR 200 million between now and the end of next year , over and above our humanitarian aid .
We will orient this Budget as far as possible towards savings .
As Mr Garriga Polledo has said , we have seen to it that our traditional areas are maintained , but this House has before it an amendment on aid for Iraq , in which EUR 500 million are asked for – EUR 500 million , even though we know from the most diverse published sources , especially the Commission ’s own , that it will not in any way be possible to properly administer these EUR 500 million in Iraq next year .
I really am slowly coming to wonder about that .
Last November , we expended a great deal of effort , between first and second reading , on negotiations towards extending Parliament’s right to be consulted on the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
I would ask the Commissioner to join with her fellow-Commissioners in giving some thought to whether it might not make sense to establish a category specifically for the agencies , enabling control of them to be improved and made transparent , and also guaranteeing Parliament’s right of co-determination .     – Madam President , Commissioner , members of the Council Presidency , ladies and gentlemen , the Budget resolutions are about setting down in figures the policy that one wants to implement ; it is about turning one’s own political priorities into a proper structure of figures that will stand up .
I think it likely that we will be able to continue to enjoy excellent cooperation at the next stage of the Budget procedure .
Let me conclude by returning to the very important issue of aid for Iraq .
My concerns merely lie in the fact that the toll has been postponed indefinitely and that this working group , which you have already put in place , has also helped us to show that shortcomings have arisen and that this has also led to discrimination between various Member States .
My attempt was successful , and the constitutional change has now been adopted so that all obstacles to the necessary judicial reform have been removed , and the Commission is holding further talks with the Bulgarian authorities on widespread support for it .
It would perhaps be sensible , Mr Bolkestein , if you did not go into individual amendments in the debate , as we will still , in any case , have to discuss them with the Council .
The compromise that we came to – EUR 5 million for personal injuries and EUR 2 million for damage to property  – is a compromise , with which I think the insurance markets can cope .
During the debate I had three main requests .
These types of violence must also be prosecuted with greater determination in the
