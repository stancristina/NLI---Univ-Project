scrutiny , monetary union , and the need to create new jobs , places an absolute priority on this objective .
Unfortunately , up to the present time , culture has been the poor relation of regional development , since only 3 % of the total allocation of Structural Funds has been made available for programmes of a cultural nature .
I believe that the Green Paper on Culture , which is being drafted at this moment and which is anticipated with great interest , will provide the policy direction we so badly need .
The surrender to private ownership of the most lucrative sectors and analogous services means in fact reducing public services to a minimum , resulting in the downgrading of the services provided for the great majority of consumers , private individuals and small businesses .
At the same time it directly affects the position of the workers , which can be translated into a significant loss of jobs in postal offices which at present employ 1 , 500 , 000 workers .
Mr President , we are also concerned not only about the workers in this sector , but also about the users of the services , especially in the disadvantaged regions , who , with the complete liberalisation of the market , will be abandoned to their fate .
I would particularly like to mention Mrs Kokkola 's report , which urges the Commission and the Member States to act on two fronts , simultaneously promoting a policy of equal opportunities for men and women and measures of positive discrimination on behalf of women in sectors where women are still in a minority .
Mrs Kokkola is right to ask for the appropriation of funds in order to achieve equality and to insist on the establishment of a working group to ensure that , in every Community activity , regard is had to equality between men and women .
At the same time , however , long-standing prejudices and ideas about the participation of women in the creation and development of our society must be swept aside .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , of course acts of violence against women are a result of a complex of reasons , of a system of values and actions tolerated by society and its institutions .
Shocking details are given about the abuse of women in the United States of America , in India , and in Africa - where 2 million women a year are sexually mutilated while 130 million have suffered horrendous torture .
However , violence against women does not manifest itself only through physical abuse .
The ECU 3 million that were made available during 1997 on the occasion of the events in Belgium are obviously not enough to tackle the phenomenon .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate , Mr Scapagnini , whose question has given the European Parliament the opportunity to discuss a very important issue .
Secondly , have the Commission 's own experts ever gone to investigate which reactors should close and which should remain in operation , and what the damage is ?
Is there a monitoring committee to go and investigate at some point whether the money has in fact gone there and whether the reactors are ready to be put into operation ?
In the event of an accident we are all in danger .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , I will not repeat what my colleagues have said because I think we concur .
What are we planning for beyond the millennium ?
That , I think , is the big problem .
That is the essential point , Mr Commissioner .
As a passenger travelling from Rome , I felt I was being exploited , first because half the people on the same flight had paid a reduced charter rate , while I had paid the normal price because of my Sabena ticket .
For my part , I will study the regulations that you mentioned , Mr Commissioner , and I will come back , but I think it would be a good idea for you to investigate the particular case that I referred to in the question .
It is not for this Parliament to make a list of charges and to restrict ourselves to a discussion of what is at fault .
This is a necessary precondition since , in addition to its many human victims , terrorism gives rise to strong feelings of insecurity in Israel , creating problems in the development of Israel and in its participation in the peace process .
Secondly , actions to end all those terrorist acts and the decisions that they provoke .
And fourthly , actions to ensure the success of the proposed new New York process - a process that will proceed in two phases : a bipartite phase , namely Palestine and Israel , and a tripartite phase , namely Palestine , Israel and the United States .
In addition there are other , more specific , proposals .
And secondly , in place of a special envoy , I propose that the Council , the Commission and , dare I say it , the European Parliament , should create a task force which is linked with the standing committee on security .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I personally believe that we must devote a lot of time to these negotiations and processes .
Mr President , I think that , after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin and the accession to power of Benjamin Netanyahu , the scenario we now see unfolding is not something that could have been regarded as beyond the realms of possibility .
Unfortunately its international dimensions , beyond what has already been said , are extremely important .
Relations between Greece and Turkey , the Cyprus problem , both fall within a wider zone of instability
