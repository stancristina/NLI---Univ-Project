What can be said about a resolution that , because it supports the idea , fails to mention or condemn the way in which the bases of neoliberal capitalism , militarism and the attack on the sovereignty of States are consolidated as a result of power being centralised in the supranational institutions of the European Union ?
The European Parliament should now adopt an objective , realistic and unbiased position , instead of insisting on an uncompromising stance and on false ‘negotiating positions ’ – Parliament is not involved in any negotiation .
As a matter of fact , because the aim that is proposed – by means of ‘formally coordinated actions ’ being able to ‘improve the implementation of policies’ , in other words , to establish Community standards that can only be applied with particular arrangements , taking account of very different and specific existing realities – already features in the Treaties , specifically by implementing the principle of subsidiarity and by means of a much more straightforward and appropriate process , which is to set targets to be achieved , leaving it up to the Member States how to do this by means of a directive .
I believe that the measure recommended for raising local authorities to the level of direct partners of the European institutions forms part of the well-known process of European centralisation and of ignoring the States and I predict that , if the practice of concluding such contracts becomes widespread , the complexity of interinstitutional relations will increase disproportionately , as will the related bureaucracy .
As the rapporteur states , ‘the Eurostat case has laid bare a number of weaknesses in the Office’s investigative activities’ , in particular the fact that the investigation has been dragging on for years and that the rules to protect those being investigated have not been complied with .
I therefore welcome the Commission ’s evaluation report on the activities of this organisation .
For this reason and given that there are large immigrant communities in some Member States with origins in another Member State such as Portugal , for example , we should enhance the value of measures that could meet the specific needs of these communities , especially as regards the set of problems addressed in the report .     .
Mr President , it is important that this Parliament discusses the current Commission mandate , given the failure of the WTO Ministerial Summit in Cancún to conclude any agreements , and that we make the appropriate proposals for the future which take account of these concerns .
Above all , however , we must consider the enormous effort made by Commissioner Bolkestein in order to complete the internal market , which is absolutely crucial to European integration and also to Europe’s economic recovery .
The postal services sector has been exempt from VAT since 1977 , a time when , it is true , the sector was dominated by State monopolies , which meant that competition was practically non-existent .
The vote will take place tomorrow , at noon .     Mr President , between some people’s euro-scepticism , some people’s arrogance and the stubbornness of others , the governments of the Member States and their leaders are endangering the adoption of the Constitution that the peoples and the citizens want and need .
Fortunately , and to the despair of the Eurosceptics , the European Constitution is a popular idea and one that mobilises the people .
This is something that the recalcitrant Member States must understand .
Long live the Constitution !     .
One example is how the Bush Administration has shared out the contracts amongst its friends , allowing US and European companies to work in Iraq .
I have taken note of the position expressed by a majority of Members .
It is only by simplifying the bureaucracy , which is directly linked to the intelligibility of legislative texts , that the aims of these mechanisms will be effectively served .
The agreement reached at the Luxembourg Agriculture Council of 26 June 2003 still fails to meet the Azores ’ needs .
Because I am aware of the reality of the situation in the Azores , I believe it is crucial to allocate to this region a supplementary quota and temporarily to extend this derogative system because , in coordination with national and regional authorities , the Union must promote the dissemination and adoption both of viable alternative forms of production and of other ways of keeping farmland profitable without condemning it to abandonment and desertification , for the sake of the much-trumpeted and rarely observed economic and social cohesion .
I support this proposal , and the work carried out by the rapporteur , Mr Pirker , and I congratulate the Council , which took account of most of the proposals tabled by the European Parliament at first reading .
At the same time , there must be close cooperation between the competent authorities and the economic operators in the chemicals industry .     .
Culture 2000 was given around EUR 167 million and will end on 31 December 2004 .
Examples are : greater support for preserving and restoring cultural heritage of European interest that is considered to be cultural heritage by UNESCO ; greater participation and support for cultural cooperation initiatives by local associations and institutions , greater support for acquiring cultural equipment by local associations .     .
The apparent aim of this proposal for a directive is to prevent the double taxation of company profits , to be precise , ensuring that profits taxed and paid as dividends by a subsidiary to its parent company are not taxed twice .
The main thrust of the report is to advocate the non-commercialisation of human tissue and human cells , preventing the human body or its parts from becoming a source of financial gain , ensuring
