feel , or rather I must express my utmost satisfaction at the fact that , looking back at the rate of progress , it is apparent that Poland has displayed remarkable energy and ability in this race , on this journey towards enlargement , towards accession .
My feeling is that , in this regard , we are proceeding almost without any safety net at all , for such a reaction would involve the annexing of part of the territory of the European Union .
Mr Lange , I know we are talking about a White Paper , but this White Paper sketches a mere initial outline of our views , and when we in the PPE-DE express our opinions , we like our subsequent actions to be consistent with them .
This , ladies and gentlemen , not only harms the chemical industry but also jeopardises the environmental objective we have set ourselves .
This is a prevention strategy , then , and not just a strategy of acting in retrospect , when the damage has already been done , but it is also a strict , rigorous strategy .
Therefore , any pricing policy must be based , above all , on a realistic examination of the social and other conditions in which the commodity of water is to be used , but also on a user education campaign that raises awareness and particularly focuses on water saving measures .
Mr President , I feel that , as Mr Berenguer Fuster said , the Commission proposal fills a large gap in the internal insurance market which has been created by the huge development in insurance and reinsurance transactions recently , particularly relating to the insurance of specific interests , and here I refer to the major industrial and commercial risks , while the market for private individuals and other smaller risks has been left rather to its own devices , resulting in a sort of free-for-all .
The Committee on Freedoms particularly stresses the need for the public promotion of research to be done with the greatest possible transparency and involvement of the citizens .
Then we asked for action in the field of health and safety at work , in order to encourage access for the socially excluded and disadvantaged , such as people with disabilities .
The danger that European research funds might end up being monopolised by large companies , which , by definition , are those that perhaps need them least since they patently already have the capacity to propose and run research programmes , is still very real .
If , however , we wish to build that knowledge-based society that was sketched out in Lisbon , research must permeate our whole society and therefore impinge , first of all , on small and medium-sized European enterprises .
With regard to the biomedical sector , I must express my satisfaction with the EUR 500 million increase given to biomedicine , not just for genome and post-genome research but for all research aimed at adding to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of diseases as well .
It is right , therefore , to lay the foundations straight away and to find the simplest instruments that can be most readily understood by the citizens of both the European Union and South America .
Mr President , the common strategy on Latin America is a strategy that may contain highly novel elements for Europe in this ever more complicated world .
After the vote on Amendment No 130 : President .
I therefore thank all the Members who voted for it , particularly the European Members of the Northern League - Mr Gobbo , Mr Borghezio , Mr Speroni - and of course above all the Members of the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left who tabled the amendment that has been voted on , and also all those , notably including the socialists , who voted for it .
I take the opportunity to hope that the European Union will also soon regulate the mediation of public insurance .
So how should we carry out scientific research in Europe ?
Since then I have been in favour of nuclear energy and so I have voted for this document , especially because it promotes study and research into the nuclear sector in Europe , which , in my view , we should increase further .
Millions of Afghan women have not only been the primary victims but have also been the major architects of non-violent opposition all these years throughout the world .
No, enough of that !
What future can there be , however , without half of the population ?
The aim of all this is to acquire useful data as soon as possible to prevent the creation , stockpiling and spread of such means of mass destruction , and , at the same time , to prepare the necessary information measures for the staff of civil and paramilitary institutions to equip them to deal effectively and rapidly with these new scenarios of disasters caused by people without any scruples at all .
However , the need to defend ourselves against attack from an industry which has taken less time to complete restructuring , which has regained its competitiveness first , must not be used an excuse not to change the current situation .
Well then , we must not restrict ourselves to defence but be open to these possibilities too , in short , to a faster developing market : we must have the courage and the ability to keep up with it with active as well as defensive measures .
Without a doubt , the state of war and the economics of war then precipitated events into a genuine crisis for the airlines which has already had extreme consequences for Sabena and Swissair .
