of decision making but also for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty .
Secondly , the importance of transport .
Please allow me to make a correction , Mr President : there are no large and small countries here .
I have always been against the idea that we had to deal with the 'leftovers ' from Amsterdam .
Here , the only risk involved in democracy is the risk taken in elections .
In section 17 , instead of " the OAU" it should say " Africa " .
Nevertheless , Parliament believes that the integration of the financial perspectives into the Treaty will mean that , as well as stability , there will be sufficient flexibility to allow for a review of those perspectives when necessary .
Sooner or later we will have to be sufficiently progressive in terms of own resources as a basis for this fair tax system .
Furthermore , in this respect , I believe that the effort of the rapporteurs in drawing up the original draft and seeking a compromise through the amendments will lead to a position which should be taken into account by this Parliament and by the national governments .
How can it be that we have warehouses full of surplus food which we are obliged to destroy when it rots away pointlessly or when it does not meet the conditions for consumption which we demand ?
When will we have a Marshall Plan for Africa ?
Nevertheless , I consider his reply to be basically too retrograde .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , if I had to point here and now to two complex issues in the economic field , I would no doubt choose the following : the consolidation of the financial markets and the approximation of the direct taxation regulations - specifically tax on savings - which is under discussion .
In the explanatory statement , I offer a detailed comparison of the two types of market .
We could not agree more .
Liberalisation must therefore be implemented in parallel with the increase in measures relating to control and taxation .
With regard to the legal framework , I believe that there is a paradox in this sector .
The only way to do this is to replace the current rigid regulations with a set of specific Community regulations which will produce certainty in this very delicate sector of the economy .
It is necessary to clarify , on the other hand , that the single system applies to every type of worker in the European Union ; there are not only workers who work for themselves in the European Union but also many cooperative workers , fortunately .
We were in complete agreement with most of them and they seemed to us to be very interesting , but we consider that this resolution was not the right place for them and that , by incorporating them , its message would be less clearly expressed .
These days we hear the siren song of globalisation and together with that goes the idea that we are international .
These must be the great pillars upon which this strategy for the internal market is built .
We will not make the headlines with this , but it is important nonetheless .
The second message of this resolution is that we need to make the present , rather disorganised laws , which the citizens see as a burden , into a genuine legislation , a coherent and clear framework of rules and regulations , without any overlapping or contradictions .
Finally , Mr President , to sum up , I hope that tomorrow , on voting for the resolution , Parliament will send a clear message .
This new version does contain specific measures and proposals .
Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , it is natural that I should speak about the problems which the strategy for developing the internal market may pose from a social point of view .
Liberalisation by means of privatising public companies may end up consolidating dominant positions and private monopolies which in my opinion may offer fewer benefits than a monopoly conceived in the public interest .
I say this especially , Commissioner , so that you can communicate to the Commission , and particularly to Mr Fischler , the fact that the common fisheries policy is one of the few areas of Community activity where until now very few steps have been taken in the creation of a genuine internal market .
The Spanish text simply says "remove the barriers imposed on entrepreneurs capitalising on company value through the issue of share options on the stock exchange " .
Of the 150 languages which are spoken in Europe , we should make a list of those which are only transmitted from mothers to their children , which are only spoken in a domestic setting and which , currently , with the invasion of the media and with the official use of languages in schools , will have very few years to live .
What should really be underlined is that , in my view , we must firmly support a Commission proposal which , essentially with regard to an issue as serious as the budgets of the Member States , is inclined to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than criteria such as the amounts due in the field of taxes and social contributions .
I would also add that there is no other accounting method which would correctly record revenue in a budget .
The rapporteur mentioned a debate which occurred in Spain which , in short , resulted from the government claiming ESP 750 000 million in 1997 as social security income , which was theoretically owed but which was clearly never going to be collected .
