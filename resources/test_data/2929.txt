think that Portugal ' s commitment to driving forward the launching of this Intergovernmental Conference was made very clear at the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and subsequently confirmed by the Portuguese Foreign Minister ' s statements in this Chamber .
I believe that the mechanism we have proposed for this conference has been very well received by the various governments .
The mandate that we brought back from Helsinki does indeed the three Amsterdam leftovers , but it also covers associated institutional issues .
The same thing could be said about the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
In our presidency capacity , we welcome these proposals and they will be properly addressed in the discussions at this conference , whatever each Member State may think about the solutions the Commission itself is putting forward in its proposal .
We also hope to be able to hand over to the French Presidency something tangible and as representative as possible of the links that may be established between the Member States in the course of our work .
This also demonstrates its willingness to contribute , by means of its two representatives and its President , to reaching a more satisfactory final solution to this revision of the Treaty .
Therefore , Mr President , and my dear friend Dr Seixas da Costa , my question is this : without wishing to know more than we need to at the moment - in order not to compromise our common goal - I would like to know , from the contacts you have made during your tour of the capitals and from your own point of view , if there is any useful information you could give us .
I was one of its critics , as I felt that the Commission should have gone further at the Helsinki European Council .
I shall finish by offering my warmest congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency .
I have no doubt that Parliament ' s next report on preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference will address this issue rigorously , for three reasons which are , to my mind , interlinked .
The last reason is that this court , the Court of First Instance , is the only instance to which individuals and companies have recourse on economic disputes with regard to decisions by the bodies which affect them .
When Member States accept the possibility of an appeal to the Court of First Instance involving proceedings on the same matter as an action already brought by a private individual , the Court will be able to establish what appeals a Member State has lodged .
I believe , particularly because there was such considerable consensus within the committee , that Parliament will agree to these two proposals and that it will give the Court its vote .
It may also be said that European policies have suffered , throughout these five decades , from the innumerable and crazy whims that have held sway in a wide variety of situations and for a wide variety of reasons .
Therefore , for this understanding and sharing to be fully possible , they must be based on a concept of culture which involves the crucial dimension of European democracy .
It is through culture alone that millions upon millions of our citizens are able to recognise themselves as Europeans and can cultivate , develop and broaden this feeling of being part of Europe .
The people of Europe whom we represent here have the right to demand a more consistent , effective and above all a more European attitude from the Union ' s institutions .
I cannot hide the fact that the success of this proposal will depend in the final analysis on an institutional mechanism being found which corresponds to the basic meaning of the word " conciliation " .
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier , even when they are nationals of third countries .
Suspending a state is just such a process , and is to be condemned .
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged .
I passionately defend Europe ' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law .
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law , but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law , in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties .
We are extremely concerned to witness this upsurge in the forces of the far right in Europe , especially in Austria , Germany , France , Belgium and Italy .
First of all because the separate votes that we requested have not been adopted .
At least they should not be prejudged , which is what is happening here .
This even applies to those who , like us , are poles apart from the racist and xenophobic views which seem to be spreading across Europe , but who prefer to oppose them by decisively attacking their root causes .
In particular , that was the intention of the Community LEADER initiative which was launched as LEADER I and LEADER II , in 1991 and 1994 , and which continues today through LEADER+ .
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade , but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards , common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind .
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones .
Certainly not
