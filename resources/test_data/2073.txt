Mr President , Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had very much hoped to be with you to discuss this point .
On behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Commission , I am pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with you on the situation in Belarus and on the Commission 's work to support democratisation and civil society .
We have recently seen a worrying deterioration in the situation .
These incidents occur in the context of growing repression of political parties , NGOs and independent media outlets in Belarus .
You may ask how the Commission has reacted .
In response to the growing repression in Belarus we have increased our funding for democratisation and human rights by transferring EUR 2 million from the TACIS Programme to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights Programme , one of the two instruments which do not require the consent of the government .
This year we have already signed 27 small contracts with NGOs worth EUR 3 million .
These will be implemented by OSCE - ODIHR , the UNDP and the Nordic Council of Ministers .
When alleviating Chernobyl-related problems , our approach is to fund project proposals put forward by the local communities .
The idea is to increase awareness of human rights and democracy issues in the Belarussian population , and provide it with factual news on developments inside and outside Belarus , which would not otherwise be available .
The broadcasting will kick off in Russian , and Belarussian programmes will be phased in as soon as possible .
In addition , we shall open a Commission office in Minsk early next year .
We have also looked at how best to ensure that all our policies towards Belarus are consistent and coherent .
The Commission has taken the lead in the discussions on how to improve cooperation among the donors active in Belarus .
The process of democratisation in Belarus and the wellbeing of its people are matters that are very close to our heart and to the Commission 's objectives .
We are doing all we can to support those striving for the development of a democratic and pluralistic society in Belarus .
This is crucial in view of next year 's presidential elections .
I take note of the points raised and will pass them on so that we can digest them seriously .
I agree with the various speakers who are very concerned about the road Belarus is still taking .
This implies , inter alia , that we use to the maximum and further develop the policy tools that are available under the European neighbourhood policy .
There were some specific questions addressed to the Commissioner , and as I have said , I have passed them on to our services .
Why do we support broadcasting in both Russian and Belarussian ?
This is precisely why we have opted for broadcasting in both languages , Russian and Belarussian : Russian for pragmatic reasons – that is what most people speak every day ; Belarussian for symbolic reasons – this is the language that heralds a new free Belarus , which we are all in favour of .
Mr President , I would like to pay a warm tribute to Mr Menéndez del Valle for his excellent report on the EU-India strategic partnership which will serve as a very useful stimulus to the policy of the European Union in this field .
As the new India defines itself economically and politically , the rest of the world , including Europe , must adjust its own vision of this country .
Europe has clearly indicated that we take India very seriously .
This action plan paves the way for closer cooperation on shared strategic goals for the development of trade and investment in enhanced cultural cooperation , participation in Galileo and even foresees India 's participation in ITER .
We share fundamental values , be it our commitment to democracy and human rights or a joint attachment to institutions of global governance .
Indians buy 2 million mobile phones a month , but 300 million Indians still live on less than a dollar a day .
Our regulatory dialogue , student exchanges and scientific cooperation will all serve to underpin ongoing reform .
Our relationship with India cannot be built only through bilateral cooperation .
The EU and India must show leadership in bringing the Doha Development Agenda to a successful conclusion and indeed India , as our partner , is in a unique position to make a case for open trade in goods and services as a powerful tool of development .     Mr President , I wish to thank Mr Menéndez del Valle for a successful report in which human rights questions have been incorporated into the partnership in an exemplary manner and not set aside as if they were a separate category , as is often the way .
EU-Indian relations are close ; we are friends .
Good legislation is not enough , however : time and effort must be invested in its implementation .
Approximately 35 % of India’s billion or more inhabitants live below the poverty line , and a large number of people are still totally deprived of basic rights .
The single most significant reason for this is the caste system , which legitimises human inequality .
Those Dalits who try to break away from the caste system by marrying into a higher caste or , for example , by acquiring education or land legally , often become victims of physical violence and social outcasts .
Now that industry is talking openly about the leaps in technology that India needs and which the EU can help realise , the EU should be providing India with more tangible support in issues of human rights in order for it to be able to put its excellent political will into practice .     Mr
