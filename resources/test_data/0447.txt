reform was necessary to present them at the negotiations at the Doha Round in a way that was credible and justifiable to the international community .
It does not appear that our negotiating partners are ready to satisfy such a request .
Fundamental guarantees of human rights are still not being respected : the right to life and to freedom of assembly , expression and opinion , to say nothing of the right to religious worship and the restrictions placed on Christians and Catholics , as well as on the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam .
On the third floor of our building at the moment an event is taking place to present the Olympic truce .
We believe that the European Parliament should also vigorously support this initiative in order to bolster the spirit of peace and mutual respect .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the city of Turin has , on the occasion of the Olympic Games , promoted an initiative of international cooperation among cities in order to support and promote the Olympic truce .
The truce is a call for peace that ignores all political persuasions and , as such , cannot be exploited by anyone in any circumstances ...     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to speak on this subject , seeing that – as was reported by the delegation from Parliament’s Committee on Petitions , which recently travelled to the Susa Valley in Piedmont , Italy – the valley has been occupied by the military in order to force the members of the community to accept the construction of a 54 km railway tunnel , although they are all against it .
This sector in Italy produces a very high quality output and employs 80 000 workers .
It would therefore be reasonable to allow patent holders the opportunity to be involved in the procedure laid down for the granting of compulsory licences for the manufacture and sale of medicines intended for export to World Trade Organisation countries .
Three principles which must be applied during the hearings are very clearly detailed there : the principle of transparency and openness , the principle of fairness and the principle of consistency .
The second point concerns the replacement of a member of the College .
Clearly , when drafting the proposals for the introduction of criminal sanctions , the Commission will have to hold to two main principles .
We have also proposed a means of extending this to other fields .
The means exist , most obviously in Article 13 , which undoubtedly forms the subject of a directive , and is therefore chiefly a Community matter .
I believe that merely transferring the provisions contained in a framework decision to a community directive is unacceptable if this transfer is not carried out with full respect for the prerogatives of the European Parliament .
That is a key justification for the ruling of the Court of Justice , as well as a principle which , naturally , we shall investigate thoroughly .
How , then , can an incorrect legal basis be transformed into a correct legal basis ?
In conclusion , Mr President , I wish to make it clear that the Commission will only ever exercise these competences if it proves necessary .
It is therefore necessary to ask if this framework has worked , if and how it has been applied , if it has been in a position to promote a genuinely open , competitive and transparent market for all operators and if it has been able , at the same time , to promote the necessary investment .
At the same time , however , we must avoid penalising operators that are already securely entrenched in the market , and we must effectively compete with the giants of the markets outside Europe .
In our report , after the consideration of Parliament , we suggest various points : first of all it is necessary – and I say this strongly to the Commission – to open a debate on the whole institutional set-up .
The question of roaming is crucial : we appreciate what the Commission and the European Regulators Group are doing but we ask for something more , which appears in our document to the Commission specifically on roaming .
Second : the establishment of a clear framework to regulate the institutional relationship between the European Commission and the European Regulators Group , to increase the responsibility and involvement of national authorities – thereby restoring competitiveness – and to provide greater incentives for investment , especially in the new emerging markets .
In my country , Italy , for instance , the experiment of reduced VAT rates has coincided with a measure providing incentives for building renovation via income tax – something that has met with enormous success .
The possibility of carrying out a post-incident technical investigation to ascertain the causes of the incident and those responsible should therefore be reviewed , and this case should also be considered within the Erika II policy package , so that it can genuinely be said that those responsible for carrying out the checks will themselves be checked .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Italy has been at the centre of today’s debate ; in the wake of the Zoro case , it is not considered an offence to say ‘dirty nigger’ .
We need to address the massive increase in costs , which will have repercussions on the Union’s economy , and to reduce the environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of meeting the Kyoto targets .
It has been accepted that there is a need for more transparent energy billing systems , which can help users to adopt an energy-saving approach .
The first relates to the need to simplify and reduce the management and administrative costs for businesses , which are today faced with 25 different tax bases
