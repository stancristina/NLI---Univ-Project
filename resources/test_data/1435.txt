For Bengtsfors and the province of Dalsland in western Sweden , for example , the effects have been disastrous .
The first concerns whether he considers current penalties to be adequate and sufficiently severe in cases where state aid is given to companies , as a result of which jobs are transferred from one European Union country to another .
Does the Commission believe that structural aid must in the future be redesigned in such a way that new undertakings and new jobs are given priority instead of jobs being transferred from one place to another ?
It is a matter of questioning clearly , steadfastly , patiently and consistently whether Sharia law really is compatible with human rights and the UN Convention on Human Rights .
We must also be able to question whether it is reasonable for Sharia law to be so fundamentally at odds with international law and human dignity .
We Moderates find it gratifying that , with this resolution , the European Parliament is attending to the harmful consequences that often arise in connection with the EU 's Structural Funds .
Mr President , in the past few months , the common foreign and security policy has very obviously proved to be devoid of any content .
We might ask ourselves what right we have to ask countries that have experienced decades of dictatorship to abandon their democratic ideals .
It will take time to heal the wounds inflicted upon European cooperation during the last few weeks and months .
There must be one voice that speaks for freedom , democracy and human rights , and not only on our own continent .
Now , the war is under way , however , and we must look to the future .
Following that , Iraq must be reconstructed .
What is more , new life must be breathed into the peace process in the Middle East .
We need a common foreign policy .
Since then , many fine words have been spoken about the significance of the Lisbon process .
Nor has the equally important liberalisation of , for example , the gas and electricity markets taken place .
They have responded with deep tax cuts .
There are no short cuts .
The year 2010 will continue to recede ever further into the future .
I , personally , am also the rapporteur for the twenty-fifth amendment to this directive , through which a further batch of substances is being added .
That is not at all what is controversial about this recommendation .
The directive does not , then , cover the main source of what we are exposed to , that is to say carcinogens and other dangerous substances .
That is , of course , precisely why , in fact , a directive is required , namely so that people do not continue to be exposed to carcinogens through consumer products .
Unfortunately , it will be a good many years before the chemicals policy comes into force .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating everyone who has been involved in this work : Mr Caudron , Mrs Sandb√¶k , the Commission and the Council , for this is a crucial action programme .
The issue of access and prices is of course incredibly important .
What , in practical terms , has the Commission done ?
- ( SV ) We wish to take this opportunity to explain our reasons for voting against Amendment No 58 to Annex II , item 4 and Amendment No 59 to Annex II , item 34 .
We are doubtful as to whether Amendment No 58 is relevant and safeguards assistants ' interests .
It is important that there be a supranational prosecutor able to protect the EU 's financial interests .
It is important right now , however , to emphasise that the EU 's prosecuting office must only devote itself to protecting the EU 's financial interests , and nothing over and above that .
- ( SV ) I voted in favour of the report .
Legal proceedings are impeded by the fact that the national systems are so different from one another .
I have voted against Paragraph 1 on ' ? common provisions in the field of criminal law and criminal procedural law in the European Union ' .
The wording would make it possible for a future European Prosecutor 's mandate to be extended to include new areas of responsibility , over and above financial crimes against the EU.
In the present situation , there is no reason to establish a European Prosecutor .
Would that transport system look like our present one ?
Secondly , our directive would raise the status of their profession .
Like the rest of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I would hope to avoid conciliation when it comes to this directive .
What is important now is that we have high-quality training courses and that there are authorised training centres .
It would be just too risky .
We have waited a long time for this and shall examine it with great interest .
What is more , moving makes Parliament 's work considerably less efficient .
There is no reason whatsoever for demanding changes or a review of the UN conventions on drugs .
This is , of course , emphatically about politics , Mr Evans .
We know what he is after .
Ladies and gentlemen , the signals we must send to Vienna and to all the young people of Europe , including those sitting here and applauding , are : no , we do not want legalisation ; no , we do not want liberalisation .
Mr President , the Swedish Social Democrats , including myself , believe that the UN conventions on drugs should form the basis of the EU 's drugs policy , and we
