in which the fishing industry finds itself , in view of the ongoing and , in some cases , serious depletion of fish stocks , the cuts imposed on fishing activities and the rising costs of certain production factors .
I agree with some of the amendments tabled by Mr  Hammerstein and Mrs Breyer , and they are : Amendment 1 to paragraph 2 , which is a useful and sensible recommendation on the assessment of potential risks to human health and the environment and the subsequent social and ethical implications and which takes nothing away from the original text ; Amendment 6 , which maintains that funding for research must be granted exclusively to projects that use at least half of the resources to carry out risk assessments ; and Amendment 8 , which stresses that the risk assessments must be carried out throughout the life cycle of the products obtained from nanotechnologies , from conception to completion .
Nanotechnologies are extremely important , and none more so than nanoelectronics , which enables us to achieve ever greater gains in efficiency while consuming less energy than we currently do with microelectronics , as is also confirmed by the platform’s work .
The overall issue of advancing and safeguarding science is in fact a Union issue .     .
The relationship that exists between gender issues and trade is not only economically important , but also sadly reflects a culture found in various parts of the world , where women are still on the margins of society .
This agreement forms part of a wider commitment .
Firstly , this agreement does not permit the exchange of a larger amount of data .
On the one hand we have to take note of the existence of various agencies ; on the other we have established that United States Customs and Border Protection retains the same function as before , this agency - and only this agency - being the direct recipient of transferred data .
The other element which is important in my opinion is , on the one hand , the impossibility of direct access and , on the other , the change in the modalities of accessing data .
An important reference to European legislation would therefore have been missing .
Obviously this is primarily in civil law countries .
Parliament is adopting a clear stand with regard to the services sector : it wants to gradually remove regulatory barriers and obstacles , not because it has an uncritical , sceptical attitude that cannot tolerate red tape and wants to dismantle the existing system , but rather so that it can encourage that positive competition and openness to transparency and innovation that is a fundamental part of sustainable economic growth and consumer protection .
I personally recognise the importance of professional services as drivers of European economic growth , and I agree with the rapporteur on the need to begin a process of reform of the sector , aimed at liberalising professional services .
In conclusion , from the point of view of reconciling the need for greater competitiveness in professional services , through liberalisation , with consumer protection , I support the rapporteur 's worthwhile proposal on the adoption of codes of conduct and self-regulation .
There are three basic issues , which were among the items I recently addressed with the Ministers of Home Affairs at the Council meeting held last week in Luxembourg , and recently in a meeting with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
Obviously , the need soon arose to extend the scope of the responsibilities to candidate countries , countries that are already , albeit to varying degrees , on course to join the European Union .
It is therefore advisable not to rule out the possibility that pre-accession countries might perhaps be taken into consideration , but account must be taken of the demands made , on the one side , by the Council of Europe , and , on the other , by some influential Member States that formally raised this issue at the Council meeting in Luxembourg .
Postponing the decision would mean not making any decision at all , and I believe that that would be a mistake .
It is strange that the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , as represented by Mr Pirker , is worried about bureaucracy and the rise in costs when we are concerned here with defending fundamental rights .
I believe that granting Parliament a powerful role in the establishment of the Fundamental Rights Agency is a positive step , just as I believe that the work of Mrs Gál , Mrs Kósáné Kovács and Mr Frattini , who has reaffirmed his favourable position in this House , is important .
However , we must also ensure that there is strong involvement on the part of NGOs and European civil society .
First , we need to clarify the figures being cited .
Why do we need an agency ?
The Council of Europe will continue to carry out its own work .
If I make reference to political groups and the judiciary in Europe , it is because I believe that they too must wish - and I am sure that they do - for transparency in the protection of fundamental rights in their activities .
Mr President , I must truly congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
I believe that the European Union is based on absolute values in terms of respect for the dignity of every woman and every man , and that it is therefore impossible to accept , under any circumstances , acts that demean human dignity , in this case women 's dignity , as they are the polar opposite of symbols of integration .
