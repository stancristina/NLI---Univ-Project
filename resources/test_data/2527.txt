We have four specific fields : the rational use of energy , the management of demand , which previously fell within the SAVE programme ; new and renewable energy sources , previously known as ALTENER ; transport aspects relating to energy : STEER ; and the promotion at international level of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency , known as COOPENER .
With regard to the amendments presented by the European Parliament , I am pleased to note that , following the recent discussions with the Council , a compromise has been reached with regard to the amendments which were still awaiting agreement .
I want to thank you for your speeches , ladies and gentlemen , and say that , indeed , the attempt must be made to avoid the 'stupid ' energy , to which Mrs McNally and other speakers referred earlier .
That is clear , and that is the direction in which we must move .
I am happy to say that , in my opinion , the proposal for a Directive on the promotion of cogeneration , which we are discussing , conforms to the requirements and furthermore it provides a response at a time when we are talking about integration of the European energy market and in particular the electricity market .
Furthermore , as a result of the future directive , energy and cogeneration producers will be in a position to request a guarantee of origin which demonstrates that the electricity sold to the network is genuinely produced by means of high-efficiency cogeneration , from cogeneration which results in global energy savings .
I would like to congratulate Mr Glante and everybody who has participated in the various meetings which have taken place on this issue , because it was not an easy issue to understand .
For the simple reason that electricity is a more elaborate form of energy which is obtained from heat .
However , as draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , I must say that this was not the case in this committee and that the opinion it approved , in the light of what is being proposed today , following the debates and meetings which have taken place , lacks realism and rigour .
Congratulations , Commissioner .
But the problem is that , when we talk about the concept of cogeneration , there are in fact very differing realities between cogeneration in the countries of the North of Europe and that in the South .
I would like to say that , in general terms , we will support the text of the report with the amendments proposed .
Mr Glante , please allow me to address an observation expressly to you , and I would like to thank you warmly for your receptiveness and cooperation throughout the work we have done together : when a sculpture is finished and is almost perfect , there are always certain final touches which make it absolutely perfect .
The intention is to support real cogeneration and to prevent subterfuge , which , on the pretext of carrying out cogeneration activity , really involves other types of activity .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say very briefly that the Community regulations in force simply require air companies to be insured , but they do not set any criterion , condition or sum to be respected by the authorising authorities of the Member States of the Union .
The proposal which the honourable Members are discussing today also stems from the various discussions which took place in a special group created precisely in order to discuss the problems relating to insurance following the tragic events of September .
We must acknowledge your work and your will to resolve issues so that the European citizens are much better covered and so that they gain confidence in air transport .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the speakers for their words and their proposals .
Amendments Nos 26 and 28 , which extend the application of civil liability and liability for passengers to air operators , because they could give rise to problems in terms of legal interpretation and , on an issue of this nature , as Mr Ortuondo quite rightly pointed out , it is essential that we have the greatest possible clarity in order to prevent contradictory interpretations .
I would like to say to the honourable Members that the United States , for example , has clearly expressed its willingness to begin these negotiations in the coming months , if we have a Commission mandate in this regard .
I would like to begin by congratulating the European Parliament on its initiatives aimed at drawing the attention of the States of the Union - which we should not forget are the European protagonists in the space sector - but drawing the attention of those States to the need to take courageous and significant decisions in a sector in crisis , as the space sector currently is .
With regard to the Galileo issue , I would like to point out that this is one of the great essential projects if we are to maintain our space sector , and that , furthermore , if we do not establish the joint undertaking very quickly , which must move this project ahead , we risk facing difficulties when it comes to continuing to maintain the adjudication of frequencies which we achieved having overcome every type of obstacle in 2000 .
It is the only technology capable of ensuring the emergence of new worldwide rules to genuinely allow the European industry to access new markets and new technological developments .
With regard to the launcher sector , the Commission is preparing a report for September on this strategic sector ,
