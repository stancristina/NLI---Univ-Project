afflict them .     .
I have studied this patent several times and also consulted with patent agents .
I would invite him to read the Council’s explanatory memorandum , and also the joint resolution : these regulate the issue of cloning unequivocally .
The Patent Directive clearly excludes the patenting of germ line cells .
It is a good thing to ask ourselves this question , therefore .
There should be no retreat in Europe , but instead a decisive campaign .     . – Mr President , what is it that is happening here ?
The Commission has compiled fundamental questions on the regulation of economic migration in a Green Paper in order to obtain an overview of opinion that is as comprehensive and reliable as possible as a basis for drafting subsequent proposals for regulations .
Apart from the fact that there are far better ways of regulating immigration , this would mean considerable intrusion on the competences of the Member States .
Much worse , this act would have a pull effect .
A further example is making it easier for migrants who have returned to developing countries to immigrate again to the EU , partly in recognition of the experience of integrating they have gained .
In the long run , we have to ask ourselves fundamental questions here .
It is to be hoped that the political authorities start to realise that so much traffic is indefensible for reasons of energy consumption , climate change , adverse health effects and environmental degradation .
In particular , scientific developments and technical progress have to be taken into account .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee for Regional Development has , in its opinion on the budget , agreed to the Commission ’s proposals and reinstated the preliminary draft , with particular reference to the payments .
Any strategy of this kind must form part of the Lisbon strategy , for it is environmental technologies that will give us an edge on the world market .
This procedure is currently being used for EUFOR Althea in Bosnia , and it is intended that it should in future be used specifically to finance what the EU calls its crisis management operations , which amount to waging war .
If we manage to learn that lesson from the 2006 budget , then we will have achieved a great deal .     Mr President , one gets the feeling , when listening to Mr Ferber , that it is very unfortunate that he has not yet been summoned to Berlin to take charge of the Germans ’ financial arrangements in Brussels , for then a few things would change .
We must not , therefore , be in any doubt about the fact that you cannot have more Europe for less money .     Mr President , I would like to point out that I followed the rapporteur’s line on the Doyle report and regard Article 175 as the right legal basis , on the grounds that Austria and Denmark have already adopted wholesale bans on the use of these f-gases , and their experiences show that alternatives to them are , in principle , technically and economically workable and that these have a far less damaging effect on the environment .
Mr President , Mr President of the European Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I address you , Mr President of the European Council , quite deliberately as such and not as ‘Prime Minister’ .
If handled in the right way , globalisation has something very positive about it .
There is also a need for bureaucracy to be reduced .
At the heart of this development was the consistent coupling together , for the first time in economic history , of economic and technical advances with social progress .
I do ask you , though , to keep to your priorities ; they are vital to our future , and when people like Gerhard Schröder criticise , remember that he has been voted out of office and no longer has a mandate to speak for Germany .
Their numbers are dwindling , and the Ecumenical Patriarch fears that there may well be no Christians left in Turkey by the time the accession negotiations come to an end .
We should be very , very judicious in our criticisms ; we Europeans have no good cause to point the finger at this country , which has suffered so much , and say who should be punished and what has gone wrong .
You mentioned media access ; the media have great problems to contend with , not least as regards their own safety .
First among these points is political reform , with , above all , the promotion of human rights , democracy and good governance , to which I shall return later .
Secondly , it is essential that we consider the vital importance of education , not least in terms of its impact on society .
Mrs Jäätteemäki quite rightly puts particular emphasis on cultural cooperation , to which we , too , want to give greater attention in future .
I do not suppose it is accidental that it was the Scandinavian states that acquired such an instrument at a very early stage and that thought was given as early as the 1970s to establishing such an office in the Community , something that was eventually accomplished by the Treaty of Maastricht .
Despite all the difficulties to which Mr Seeber referred , this has already made it possible for much to be achieved , but we should nevertheless keep trying to persuade the public of the advantages that the Ombudsman can offer in bringing to light those abuses in European administration that are rather more serious than the case just described by Mr Martinez , and in following these problems up .
