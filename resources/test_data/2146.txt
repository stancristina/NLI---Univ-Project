a problem for women , but children as well - for sexual exploitation .
The thinking behind the Finnish initiative means that its proposals no longer have any point , because they have now been fully adopted .
For the reasons which have been expressed , and which I would probably just be repeating : this initiative takes account of one aspect , the most repressive one , but that is only one aspect of the problem .
Firstly , the Minutes state that Mr Medina Ortega 'questioned whether the letter from the committee ' s chairman truly reflected the opinion of the committee as a whole ' .
Unfortunately , in terms of human and technical resources , the European Commission is , in our opinion , currently unable to be present in each and every one of these regional fisheries organisations with the commitment they deserve , or in a way that reflects the important interests the different Community fleets have in the various oceans on this planet .
NAFO has served as a model in many cases .
Whilst we await the findings of the port inspection , we ask everyone to comply with the NAFO fisheries ' regulatory measures .
If we are to maintain the balance in this important organisation - and in what is an extremely important fishing ground for the Community fleet - then the only way to do so is for everyone to behave responsibly .
For this reason , we would like NAFO to be - and indeed it is - an organisation open to countries that have vessels operating in this area .
Our fleet , the Community fleet , does not wish to be seen as a pirate fleet , as a fleet without nationality , nor as an intruding fleet .
These incidents were the product of suspicion bordering on persecution which has often concealed a desire to throw a smoke screen around management errors in some coastal states .
The aim of such common rules is to ban the flying of such flags and stop Member States allowing these fleets to dock in their ports .
As you know , such measures include rules on the size of fishing gear , - and of meshes in particular - minimum allowable landing sizes , specific closed areas , protection of endangered species and so on .
We also feel that reducing the size of carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres , which has been widely called for by the sector , is a very positive step .
However , perhaps their attitude would change a little if we were to explain exactly what it is about and how a report of this type can impact on the lives of the peoples of Europe .
Approximately 10 000 women in Galicia extract carpetshells , as shellfish are not fished but rather extracted .
Carpetshells measuring 40 millimetres are neither produced , sold nor consumed , simply because there are none .
The only thing we hope , Commissioner , is that we do not have to review the regulation again within a year , because this would mean that both we and the European Commission had once again made a mistake in our calculations .
As a result , I feel that the compromise reached is acceptable and to be commended .
Evidently , these figures also highlight the high socio-economic dependency of some Community regions on such activity .
We should like to show our solidarity with the family and friends of the deceased .
I must tell the whole of Parliament , as Mr Barón Crespo has already done , that Mr Gorostiaga' s party sometimes goes as far as to regret the deaths caused by terrorists , perhaps because it has no choice , but it does not condemn them .
Mr Gorostiaga represents nobody but that minority which , showing a complete disregard for the best European democratic traditions , tramples upon fundamental rights .
There is a section of the Basque population which does not feel comfortable , which does not feel at ease with the current legal-political set-up in the Basque Country .
However , if we read the verbatim report , we can see that Mr Knörr Borràs ' intervention said : " Madam President , I should like to convey our support and sympathy for the people of Paraguay in the light of another attempted military coup .
In its meeting of 13 April , the Conference of Presidents decided by a majority to create a temporary committee .
In my opinion , it would not be normal to deal with this issue tomorrow , but rather an objection can be raised when you present the Conference of Presidents ' proposal to this House .
This also involves those cases where words were accompanied by actions , such as when a stone was thrown and acid sprayed at the President of the United States .
There is no political element , no element of fumus persecutionis .
As a Socialist member and spokesperson in the Legal Affairs Committee , I would like to reiterate the objection to this point of view .
To this end , it also seems to me to be fair and beyond all doubt that the tobacco industry will have to adapt to stricter conditions of manufacture , presentation and sale , such as those proposed by this directive .
In this respect , a proposal of time limits may seem logical .
However , to ask in passing for the removal of aid to tobacco growers is to hijack a different debate : that attitude is , 'while we are on the subject of tobacco , let us ask for the removal of aid to the growers ' .
Commissioner , you have the responsibility for harmonising , and harmonising in the real sense , and to this end I believe you have the support of the majority of this House
