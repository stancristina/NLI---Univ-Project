Let me turn to three other aspects .
We will ask the British Foreign Trade Minister and the Minister for Science to show their understanding for our concern .
Mr President , with the Rothe report - at least with the interventionist aid system for renewable energy sources that it describes - we are about to make mistakes in energy policy , which will have a very serious impact on Europe in the long term .
Secondly , the aim of any energy and economic policy must be to reduce and optimise energy consumption , for only the careful treatment of resources of whatever kind can help minimise the external costs .
To draw such narrow boundaries between them can only produce problems and difficulties .
One day Vietnam too was reunited , not peacefully however , but by the force of arms , and it was reunited under a Communist system , a dictatorship .
Nevertheless , in answer to Mr Dupuis , I regret in that respect that we could not agree on a joint resolution , that important and justified points that are also endorsed by the Human Rights Watch - not the most tolerant organisation when it comes to violations of human rights - were not accepted .
In that respect , they are indeed based on negotiations , but the vote will show in what direction we are heading .
Notwithstanding these observations and reservations , I voted for the report .
It should be regarded as a success that the European position , as proposed from the outset by the Commission in its consultation paper , prevailed in Basel , so that the inclusion of internal rating procedures is now at the centre of the debate .
So , ladies and gentlemen of the Council , do get on with it .
But we in Europe must look at the small banks .
Accordingly , the point of departure of this report was the recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to give applicants access to their own marked examination scripts during the selection procedure it organised .
I nonetheless agree with Mrs Villiers that this is an important report .
As a result , there might be job losses in SMEs .
This idea of Parliament 's was then adopted at the Tampere Summit , and I am very grateful to the Council for adopting this project , originated by Parliament , as its own .
To take just one point , Mr Posselt writes of 'providing training sessions for senior national police officers on the basis of common standards ' .
( In other States , it is different . )
We were supposed to bring home measurable results , by which I mean physically measurable results , but that aim has not been compatible with the Americans ' position .
So we do need a reweighting of voting rights with a view to ensuring that a majority of states which are home to a minority of the European population cannot ultimately make the rules ; the unequivocal democratic principle must certainly prevail here .
This is something else that we need for the future .
The real success or failure of Nice will be measured by whether governments finally begin to take people 's concerns and needs seriously .
The stadium is now in sight .
If the disparity between the large and the small members of the Council becomes too great , we face the risk of a legitimacy crisis within the European Union in a few years ' time , because the small countries will no longer feel comfortable in the Council , fearing that they might become unable to defend their own identity .
Mr President , the omens have never been good before any Intergovernmental Conference .
Yesterday , two people broke into the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee , interrupted the proceedings and threatened our guest , the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs , both verbally and physically .
This did not prove to be politically acceptable , which is why we now have two figures , both of whom perform sterling work in their own way .
In this context , Mr President of the Council , I also believe that in Afghanistan in particular , a country we ought to speak about here , we should play our part in ensuring that firstly a stop can , at long last , be put to the trail of murder which has plagued that country for decades and which a barbarous regime is now pursuing against its own people and secondly in ensuring that the people in Afghanistan are able to live in a rational , peaceful and socially just world .
It will not always be possible to take these steps one after the other in chronological order , but we need the entire package , and the fact is that only all of these factors together will make a coherent , balanced defence and security policy in Europe .
We have just seen the examples in The Hague .
In the early part of 1990 , when it was foreseeable that the Warsaw Treaty would collapse , the Government of the German Democratic Republic which I headed adopted a new military doctrine based on freedom from nuclear weapons , on international security partnership and on gradual disarmament .
At the same time , however , the prestige of the European institutions has sunk to a new low in the eyes of the public , beset as they are between a lack of confidence on the one hand and the pressure generated by a growing number of problems on the other ; by way of example , I need only name three of the most pressing problems at the present time - the oil crisis , climate change and BSE.
The European Parliament needs to take a good look at itself here too .
On those points where you feel unable to accept our proposals , produce
