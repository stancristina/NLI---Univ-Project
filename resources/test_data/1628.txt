my speech that human error is certainly the main factor , but just think how many poorly constructed roads cause accidents : we only need think of aquaplaning .
The legislative text we are discussing this evening makes no demands on the United Kingdom nor on Germany , because the procedures contained in the directive are specifically inspired by the UK and German systems .
Once again , I am grateful to Mr Markov.
Nevertheless , as Vice-President Mauro knows , I hail from a region of Italy whose history , whose raison d 'être consisted of sheep and goat farming .
It is important to recall , in this connection , that the purpose of the recent CAP reforms was to make agriculture in the European Union more efficient and competitive , but at the same time to ensure its sustainability .
Once the discussions have been finalised and the conclusions reached in Parliament and the Council , it will be up to the operators in the sector to exploit these opportunities as best they can .
Member of the Commission . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it seems that all of us here this evening come from regions where pasture farming exists and there is a keen interest in the sheep and goat sector .
We are working towards an agreement on the agricultural aspects of the Doha Development Agenda , which should be finalised before the summer break .
The forecasting group for the ovine and caprine sectors is made up of market experts and meets twice a year to discuss market trends and forecasts .
An initiative for young people is to be held in Brussels on 10 July , giving them a chance to discuss road safety , and a series of events on road safety will take place during the French Presidency , the most important of which will be held in Paris on 13 October , although there will also be events geared towards action in this sector in other European cities , with a view to raising public awareness and in particular the awareness of young people .
We have made a great deal of progress as a result of eCall and at the end of this year the Commission will present a new communication to Parliament and the Council setting out the final stages for the achievement of eCall .
They refer to the cognitive capacity of human beings , their ability to understand , to abstract , to solve problems and apply knowledge .
The first answers were always 'too fast and dangerous speeds and drink-driving ' .
It is unacceptable that destruction of the environment and risks to public health should be subsidised .
Only in that way will we close the gap between the peoples of Europe and the institutions .
I should like briefly to answer the question raised by Mr Pribetich as regards timing .
For that reason , I thank you , Mrs Ayala Sender , for your suggestion , and I thank all the Members who have spoken ; the Commission , I reiterate - I am concluding , Mr President , and I apologise if I have taken a few extra minutes , but I feel that this issue is important enough for us to overrun the times laid down by the rules .
This debate has the purpose of confirming that there is no room for ethnic profiling in Europe : so much so that the Government seems to be doing an about-turn on this issue and we welcome that if it is the case .
It is a statement that undermines the dignity of the European Parliament .
We are grateful to Commissioner Špidla for his commitment to give a European response to a major European issue and we ask him to speak clearly about the measures adopted by the Italian Government and to report to the European Parliament .
A state of emergency is justified by natural disasters or catastrophes or events of that kind .
First question , then : where was the left , which has governed in Italy for decades , when these illegal camps were set up and proliferated in conditions totally lacking in the most basic health and safety standards ?
I would also like to ask you if your silence over all these years does not bear you down , like a ball and chain , fashioned of indifference and hypocrisy , of looking the other way , when you obviously had no eyes - nor much political interest - to see that dozens of children were dying of cold or burns every year because of the lack of safety in these shanty towns .
This applies to all minors living in Italy : Italians , and EU and non-EU citizens alike .
In Italy we are witnessing a full-blown profiling of all Roma , including children , who are being fingerprinted , and including Community citizens and even Italian citizens , despite the fact that their details are already registered .
To say what ?
The resolution has been altered and now describes a country where there was reportedly a massive turnout at the elections , forgetting that the population voted under continuing threat from armed groups .
Anyone who heard my speeches in the committee knows that I have regarded ownership unbundling as a priority right from the outset , so as to ensure that companies transporting gas are fully independent of companies generating it , even though of course ownership unbundling is no miracle cure for all ills .
If we are to attain the goal of reducing our energy dependence , we need a single energy market and a single integrated network .
I hope , moreover , that the Council will give due consideration to Parliament 's decisions .
Thank you all .
