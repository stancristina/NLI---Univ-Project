It is also a source of deep concern that the Communist government in Moldova has removed the political immunity of a large number of members of the Christian Democratic Party and that their political activities in Moldova may in the future be completely destroyed .
With reference to a resolution from 5 July 2001 , we would emphasise that children are the first victims of the breakdown of family life .
In my own country , Sweden , a leader of the country 's third largest political party openly pronounced the words , ' Death to the family ' to the Swedish general public .
More than ever , we need the family and the appreciation of its importance .
I thought I was immune , but Jenin was worse than I had imagined .
It was of course there that Sharon 's political forefathers within Irgun murdered as many as 250 Palestinian civilians in April 1948 , an act that was the signal for the mass flight of Palestinians that lies behind the whole problem .
Last Sunday , the New York Times reported that a Berlin Wall is to be built around the whole of the West Bank .
The Jerusalem Post says of Knesset member Ben Elon that 'he promises Jewish continuity in Jerusalem ' .
If we were to exchange the word 'Jewish ' for 'white ' , ' Swedish' , ' Christian' or any other ethnic or national designation , everyone would shout 'racism ! ' . Why are Mr Patten and Mr Pique I Camps so incredibly cautious ?
Israel must therefore be treated in the same way as we treated Milosevic 's Serbia and apartheid in South Africa .
The Swedish and British Medical Associations have proposed that the Israeli Medical Association be excluded from the World Medical Association , and the football organisation FIFA is to adopt a position on Israel 's exclusion at the beginning of May .
Europe 's decision-makers must be able to create a broadly based confidence in the EU as a partner in the Middle East .
Are trade sanctions against Israel , and thus indirectly against Palestine too , really the best way of preparing the way for peace ?
Experience of previous international sanctions should give pause for reflection .
Hardly .
I have a few direct questions for you , Minister .
I have also received information to suggest that the Swedish Government is preparing to introduce trade sanctions .
You said that all alternatives are open ?
Mr President and the Council , two weeks ago , the joint resolution on the situation in the Middle East tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left was voted through by a narrow margin here in the European Parliament .
We in the Christian Democratic Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats voted against .
Neither Hamas nor Islamic Jihad , labelled as terrorist organisations by the United States and the EU , were mentioned or criticised in the European Parliament 's resolution .
Nonetheless , everyone knows that these men associated with violence and suicide bombings - these people who are happy to see sons or daughters sent to kill other people and who receive money from Iraq for the purpose - are not at all prepared to recognise the State of Israel 's right to exist in the area .
The debate in this House reveals a type of one-sidedness which means that we are not taken seriously by either party to this deeply tragic and bloody conflict .
Mr President , it is perhaps more important than ever today to stand up for tolerance and human rights at a time when racism and intolerance are raising their ugly heads and when the winds of xenophobia and anti-Semitism are being felt in ever more European countries .
We need a coordinated , credible and consistent strategy that is integrated naturally into the EU 's other activities .
For quite a few years , Parliament and the Commission have proposed different measures for coordinating policy between the institutions and improving follow-up .
Slavery and trafficking in human beings , especially children , are terrible problems and they occur , to some extent , in secret .
The open society must never be weakened by undemocratic methods .
Certainly , this is extremely praiseworthy , but we wonder how it relates to the demands we are already making .
We also have our doubts about setting up a new human rights agency .
Human dignity is still violated in the most odious ways throughout the world .
The EU can play an important role when it comes to defending human rights .
Only then can the EU obtain real influence .
Slavery is on the increase throughout the world , including in Europe .
The UN 's children 's fund , UNICEF has raised the alarm about the fact that 200 000 children in West Africa are victims of trafficking , with the cocoa industry responsible for a significant proportion of this .
It is not only a question of child labour , but children are also sold as slaves by one cocoa producer to another .
Such trafficking is a great tragedy for those affected , who are exploited in a horrible way , above all within prostitution .
Such resignation is dangerous for democracy itself .
That is not consonant with human dignity .
At the same time , I have to state that it is remarkable and quite frustrating that it took six years from the Council 's making its decision to the Commission 's presenting its programme of action .
If these objectives are to be achieved in the developing countries too , there
