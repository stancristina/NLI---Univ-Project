regrettable that no reference is made to the existing agencies , when we all agree that there is a need to undertake in-depth assessment of the work of these agencies , to propose the reworking of some of their tasks and powers and , possibly , to update the structure and composition of their organs .
We will , therefore , pay particular attention in the proposal for a future legislative framework to rules that impose on the agencies all the requirements for sound administration , for compliance with legislation on transparency , on access to documents , with the rules for protection against fraud and for protecting the Community’s financial interests .
The Commission ’s current mandate , however , obstructs this need .
We must grasp the opportunity provided by the failure to reach an agreement at Seattle , Cancún or recently in Geneva , to review the proposals presented by the Commission and to give consideration to this much-needed balance .
Illegal , unregulated and unreported ( IUU fishing ) a highly destructive practice , a mode of fishing that damages the conservation and sustainable management of fish stocks .
I do support this report , however , which in my opinion will both help to preserve fish stocks and to bring some calm to Community waters .
Another situation that needs to be remedied is the poor quality of the data submitted by the flag countries which , apart from being one of the most fundamental obligations of the flag country , makes any assessment of stocks less reliable .
This proposal seeks both to update this Joint Action and , at the same time , to ensure greater transparency and to extend the Joint Action’s scope as regards exchanging information , risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs .
I share my group ’s view of the rapporteur’s intention in highlighting the aim of simplifying the structure of information exchanges , proposing a set of amendments that seeks to make the entire process more effective .
I welcome the European Community’s conclusion of the International Convention against organised crime , in other words , the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the protocols thereto against trafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants .
Given the extremely poor living conditions of millions and millions of migrants and victims of trafficking in human beings throughout the world and in Europe , who are forced to endure situations of unacceptable exploitation and humiliation , without any rights , I welcome the Council’s conclusion of the agreement on the UN Convention against organised transnational crime and the protocols thereto against the trafficking of persons and the smuggling of migrants .
In this context , this will be the first global instrument for combating criminal networks , which will provide universal definitions of certain fundamental concepts of criminal law in the fight against organised crime .
I support this initiative and stress the urgent need to adopt a set of regulations on protecting the environment through criminal law .
Any measures taken in the name of maritime safety are to be welcomed and correspond to a correctly identified general need .
We would be better advised to encourage closer cooperation between Member States , which would in turn foster greater interoperability and compatibility of the resources available at intra-European level and would avoid wasteful duplication and overlapping .     .
This proposal consequently contains broader ideas than simply combating pollution .
The EU has an obligation to promote maritime safety and must not , under any circumstances , be relieved of this obligation .
It is , therefore , legitimate to question the appropriateness of the procedure .
I therefore voted in favour of the reports on maritime safety , with the exception of the Pex report , as I do not agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to create a European Coastguard .
I believe it is possible to make it attractive to fly the flags of Member States – the EU needs to have a considerable fleet – without being negligent on matters of safety .
The Commission feels that current policy in most Member States and candidate countries does not effectively address the problem of nuclear waste .
In the vote on the three reports on nuclear energy , I opted for what I consider the most prudent political line for those who , like me , are in favour of this energy source , provided that the highest levels of safety are maintained .
I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals .     .
Once the programme has been submitted , each Member State must set its own deadlines to put the programme into practice , choose a site , build the disposal facility and begin operations .
The aim is to ensure that high levels of nuclear safety are maintained in the EU , given that the system to be implemented will fall within the competencies of national safety authorities .
This is why so much care is being taken in the wording of provisions on interaction with national safety authorities and the form that Community monitoring will take , which we believe to be the right approach .
In its proposals , the Commission argues that whenever nuclear energy is exploited for commercial purposes , adequate safety levels must be guaranteed and that countries must accordingly be obliged to enforce a series of rules .
Fortunately , however , emphasis appears to have been placed on the crucial issue of promoting and sharing ‘best practice ’ in many areas of European life .
The question before us is whether the 77/270/Euratom Decision , which empowers the Commission to issue Euratom loans for the purpose of contributing to the financing of nuclear power stations , must be adapted to suit the circumstances of certain third countries about to join the EU , in which such investments are clearly of considerable significance
