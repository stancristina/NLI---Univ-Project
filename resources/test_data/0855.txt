First , during all this discussion between the Commission and the Council and the Turkish authorities , have any specific commitments been made on the part of the Turkish authorities in order to meet these criteria ?
My question is this : can we start integration proceedings before the criteria have been met ?
And , if we do , is there a specific timetable , as referred to by Mr Papadimoulis , whereby if the criteria are not met , integration proceedings are stopped ?
Given the earlier procedure and what you too have said , could you perhaps allow a minor extension of 2 to 3 minutes for my question ?
The statistics we have at our disposal are both revealing and worrying .
The citizens of the European Union – and women especially – have extremely acute concerns and demands , as we all saw during the European elections .
The debate on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 , the new regulation on the Structural Funds and next year 's budget give us ample opportunity to turn our attention to these matters .
Are the European Commission and the Council ( which is absent today , as usual during such debates ) satisfied with the evaluation being made of the national action plans on employment , the national action plans for social integration , the results of coordination , to which you referred , Commissioner ?
However , for this special studies and research are needed , statistics need to be collated by category and , as you mentioned Commissioner , indicators are needed .
Unfortunately , no one has yet addressed this issue with efficient and radical reform .
The minimum income is the income that needs to be used as a transitional stage , for reintegrating women into employment , and combined with development policies inside and outside the Community , with social insurance and health policies , social welfare policies , housing and child support policies , education and training policies , rural development policies and employment policies .
The modern European model , Commissioner , cannot be put to shame by marginalised social classes such as women , with whom impoverishment begins .     – Mr President , I abstained from the vote on the joint resolution on Ukraine .
Human rights are , unfortunately , trampled underfoot even in our partner countries .
For the moment , I shall abstain .     – Mr President , the sovereign imperialist powers which either supported or encouraged extreme religious fanaticism to take hold in numerous countries bear a tremendous responsibility .
The situation is truly intolerable .
Nonetheless , I would point out that we face a new Iraq-type plan announced by the United States of America , which named Iran as one of the countries of the axis of evil .
This plan has been adopted by ΝΑΤΟ , integrated into the general ' Middle East ' plan agreed at the ΝΑΤΟ summit in Istanbul last June and accepted by the European Union .
All of you dreaming of a new Iraq will be sorely disappointed , because the whole of mankind will rise up .     – Mr President , European citizens face two new food scandals : on the one hand , Dutch dioxins and , most probably , on the other , as the diagnostic test to date has shown , the first signs of mad cow disease in sheep and goats .
The European Union needs to take care of public health , as well as the market , in order to prevent the introduction of suspect products into the food chains .     – Mr President , for a week now , the American occupying forces have been committing an abominable crime in the city of Falluja in Iraq .
Your counterpart , Mr Alawi , is prohibiting the names of the dead from being announced in the city of Falluja .
Why do you people who talk about human rights now have nothing to say in the face of this crime ?     – Mr President , as you know , the European Commission has proposed the adoption of a regulation to establish a pre-accession assistance mechanism ( ΙΡΑ ) .
The challenge of the European orientation presupposes the overcoming of differences via dialogue , mutual understanding and agreement .     – Mr President , the detection of dioxins , carcinogenic substances , in dairy and animal products produced in Member States of the European Union is a threat to consumers .
Adopting regulations does not change the nature of production .
When I found out , I shrieked and , as the walls have ears here , the service may already know and may already have made the necessary change .
My comment is that Parliament 's Committee on Budgets decided , quite rightly , that financial support would be given to the Turkish Cypriot community under heading 3 , in other words under the heading for assistance for Member States of the European Union .
That is why it is absolutely necessary to extend the operation of the agency until the end of December 2006 and to make provision for examining the possibility of even extending its operation beyond that date , given that there will be important developments in the Balkans both in 2005 and in the next period and policies are needed to consolidate stability and security in the Balkans .
This money needs to be given to the Turkish Cypriot community , because it will help Turkish Cypriot citizens and the Turkish Cypriot community , it will contribute to economic development , to the incorporation of the , to the configuration of the necessary infrastructures and to the creation of jobs .
We are not financing intransigence .
