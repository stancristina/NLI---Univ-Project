treatment .
To this end , amongst all of us we have produced a report , thanks to two years of exemplary work by the Committee on Petitions , which unanimously adopted this report .
In other words , all the rights of the citizens who have complained to this Committee on Petitions are now going to be safeguarded .
I am therefore dismayed about the fact that , over the last three years , complaints about land-planning abuses have increased very considerably .
If we do not promote these solutions now , it is clear that in the future , unfortunately , we will have to face this problem all over again .
I therefore entirely agree with the criticisms of the land-planning situation in Valencia : the criticisms of the law and the criticisms of the government .
Thirdly , this Parliament cannot establish compensation : an administrative authority cannot pay compensation without a judicial judgment or an administrative resolution without being guilty of the misappropriation of funds .
This directive is intended to promote the development of an energy services market which , although it is already in existence , is not sufficiently well known to the final customers .
It is crucial to the launch of the Lisbon Strategy and the achievement of its growth and employment objectives .
Achieving a common tax base has great value in itself , quite apart from being essential to further progress .
Thirdly , because I do not like tax fraud , and I believe that by consolidating the tax base we will be able to eliminate transfer pricing and the location of company operations in those countries that are most permissive in terms of not taking account of an item of spending or being able to deduct an operation .
It is difficult to establish the extent to which the European Commission , the Member States or this Parliament are responsible for this situation , which is repeated year after year .
Nevertheless , from a European point of view , it is not good news , because the saving results from a very significant under-execution in payment appropriations corresponding to the Structural Funds .
It is bad news , both for the 2006 budget of Mr Pittella , and for the negotiation of the financial perspective .
Having been rapporteur for the Union’s budget , I am well aware that it is not an easy thing to complete a successful budget .
What I believe we could call ‘the certainty of the accountant’ .
Since it has taken two to achieve all of this , and I do not want to be entirely negative toward the Council , I would like to congratulate the British Presidency , in which I must confess I did not have too much confidence at the beginning , but which in the end has been up to the job .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased that this agreement on the 2006 budget has finally been reached , and I would like essentially to stress two aspects : one directly relating to the budget and another indirectly related .
Despite the fact that the British Presidency quite rightly – very rightly in fact – stresses the importance of research and development over and over again , there is no parallel budgetary effort in that direction .
This is also true of the , which is intended to suspend the application of a legitimate law , approved by a legitimate regional parliament and not invalidated by the Constitutional Court : this is a blatant encroachment of competences by this Parliament .
Security over freedom , no .
Since democratic society is made up of personal restrictions and personal abdications , I would like us to consider one question : how much individual freedom must we surrender in order to guarantee fundamental rights , freedoms and collective security ?
I am passionately in favour of human rights .
We have not received any response .
I believe that this is the key : the key question and the key issue .
Parliament has asked that the issue of pluralism be dealt with within the scope of this directive and on numerous occasions the Commission has said : this is a very delicate matter and we dare not — to put it in a simplified fashion — deal with it .
You have not referred to the statement of the ministers of the Spanish Government , nor the position of certain Commissioners who are not competent in this field , nor even the request for exclusion from the Socialist Group a week before the decision so that you would not be competent in relation to these issues .
You have shown that you tell the truth and I am very sorry that a compatriot of mine has called your honour into question .     Madam Commissioner , without going into detail , the facts are as follows : you asked the College of Commissioners for support , which is an exceptional situation .
Meanwhile , there are certain other forms of transport that are losing share and volume , as in the case of goods by rail .
I would also like to congratulate the Council and the British Presidency on their dynamism and on the efforts they have made to achieve a good agreement .
In close cooperation with the Commission , which , we must acknowledge , is doing exemplary work in terms of facilitating access for disabled people to all forms of transport — they have already done so in the case of trains , now aircraft , and tomorrow buses — have succeeded in drawing up rigorous legislation , which is demanding but applicable , and suited to the new circumstances of the airports and companies .
Will you change your initial proposal , which meant a 40 % cut with regard to the Commission
