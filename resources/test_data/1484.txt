That is quite impossible .
It follows that we are right to adopt the strategy of commencing negotiations towards a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with each country one at a time .
He is a member of the French Foreign Legion and holds a French passport ; heaven knows where he is now .
Commissioner Vitorino also referred to the issue of ‘standards before status’ , which should be given practical expression by such things as the stipulation of more precise deadlines ; it is , though , above all for the Albanian authorities in Kosovo to take the necessary action themselves .
This statement by the Commission makes that clear .
To an overwhelming extent , most of the personal data stored in the present-day SIS relates to people who have been refused entry into the EU.
Let me conclude by adding that I believe that our relationship with Canada functions as a model .
The same is true of the network for the training and further education of judges and public prosecutors .
The European women’s lobby has initiated important campaigns , such as the campaign for increased involvement by women in the European elections , has prompted a debate on the constitution , and is monitoring enlargement with a particular eye on equal opportunities issues .
That is , of course , highly disadvantageous , and I think this an extremely inopportune time for you to launch a major action of this kind .
Let me give you just two examples .
When , too , the European Commission constantly stresses that Europe has more of a presence in these countries , is exerting greater influence and providing more financial support than is generally known , it is all the more surprising that this region is not even mentioned once in such an important document on the European Union’s future relations with its eastern neighbours .
So , there is no legal basis ; I do not believe there is any political will either , or , if there is , it is at least deficient .
They are perfectly justified in now closing their operation down in response to the home-made crisis for which President Chandrika Kumaratunga must bear responsibility .
The reality , though , is something else .
We should , however , recognise that the time is coming when the wind of freedom will blow through Vietnam .
I am not sure that I can take seriously the idea that it is the foreign ministers , of all people , who find the title of ‘Foreign Minister ’ problematic .
Let me give two examples : the explicit reference to equal opportunities for women and men as being among the values of the European Union was not of the Convention’s doing .
My fear is that we will then end up with this peculiar ‘rendezvous clause’ .
It was , ‘this is better than nothing . ’ Then , after Nice , where the failure was complete , we gave it to them again : ‘this is better than nothing . ’ Now I have come to believe that a bad constitution is not better than nothing .
And , as this is not just about the content – although it certainly is that too – but also about the name , I would also like to speak in support of Mr Antonione , who stated plainly that this is – and must be – about a foreign minister .
Speaking on behalf of my group , but also of the German Social Democrats in particular , I want to thank our own government and the Italian Presidency of the Council .
To this issue too , I ask the Council , its Italian Presidency – which , I know , is trying to get sense to prevail – and the Intergovernmental Conference , to actually find a solution that will enable this Parliament to keep on working .
I hope , Mr President-in-Office , that you can provide us with them .     – Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the reason why I rise to speak on this point is that the experience of the last few weeks in connection with the handling of the Stability and Growth Pact , that is to say of European law , have made clear how important it is that the Intergovernmental Conference should still include price stability in the list of the EU’s objectives in the European constitution .
To you , Commissioner Solbes , I would like to express our group ’s gratitude and appreciation for the way you fought right up to the end .
I really do ask that of you .
By a political decision , they set the rules aside , but the Community is not an alternative to politics .
If it did , perhaps our debates would be quite different , as we also have to bear in mind that the figures at issue between the Council of Finance Ministers and the Commission in the cases of France and Germany , even with the error rates in our statistics , relate only to a gap of 0.2 % .
The larger countries are demonstrating that European law is of no interest to them .
The EU’s foundations have been tampered with , and a long-planned alliance has been forged against the European Commission .
The Commission also agrees with Parliament that the consultation process must not be allowed to slow down the legislative process and stresses that the minimum eight-week consultation period for public consultations strikes a good balance between the need for efficient decision-making and gaining the necessary input from external parties .
This phase has already begun .
The reality is rather different .
The issue then , as it is now , was combating fraud and the conclusions that the Commission needed
