However , we cannot support the specific proposal to extend the scheme of operating subsidies for up to 2 years .
However , our lack of support for the extension of the operating subsidies for up to 2 years is politically dependent on there also being fair competition internally within the EU.
( The sitting was closed at 6.10 p.m. )
It is important to protect cultural heritage , and the Union ' s common cultural heritage is its diversity .
I therefore consider this report to be superfluous .
Up until now , the Member States have helped implement the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage by tabling proposals - many of them - for inclusion on UNESCO' s list of values of specially universal significance .
I do not think it goes without saying that there should be a special list detailing European cultural heritage .
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I have therefore tabled a series of amendments whereby Parliament is to call upon the Member States , and not the Commission , to implement the necessary cooperation in consultation with UNESCO and the Council of Europe .
I think that this is an area in which we can put the Union ' s work on hold for a short while .
Mr President , I should above all like to congratulate Mr Staes on a most outstanding report .
It is unfair that we in Parliament should have to deal with a report from the Court of Auditors concerning events going back many years , but the fact is that Mr Staes has done his homework and gone out into the field .
The history of the Commission ' s delegations in Bosnia has become a success story .
Many of the problems are due to the projects having previously been administered centrally from Brussels .
This shows that the idea of giving the delegations more duties and more responsibility does , in actual fact , work in practice .
At the same time , the Court of Auditors would like to see tighter control .
If we simply give money as a direct form of budget aid to the organisation , then the Commission will completely lose track of things and no longer have any control .
The issue of cooperation between the EU and the organisations will become part of the 1999 discharge .
The Commission is calling for clear guidelines from the Council and Parliament .
We cannot demand both better control and more of a free hand .
The UN system is unfortunately becoming more and more bureaucratic , inefficient and corrupt so , in spite of everything , I have much more confidence in our own EU system .
Mr President , I want first of all to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his report .
There are , of course , many different ways to create full employment , but this cannot be achieved without economic progress and a high degree of competitiveness .
Moreover , every politician has a soft spot for small and medium-sized enterprises .
When it comes to everyday practice , however , the reality is all too often different .
Far too many obstacles are placed in the way in the form of bureaucratic rules which deter many people from setting up in business .
There are not enough incentives to take risks , and this generally impedes development and dynamism .
I therefore also think it is important to ensure that these programmes which , through the European Investment Bank , provide small and medium-sized enterprises with new financing opportunities operate as efficiently as possible in the eyes of the enterprises concerned .
Mr Bushill-Matthews ' s excellent report and the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy contain criticism of experience to date .
We must also ensure that the programmes are effective overall , and I am therefore particularly pleased about Mr Bushill-Matthews ' s request that the Commission follow up the programmes and examine their effect on employment .
We have voted in favour of a report on securities and guarantees for traditional own resources .
There are , however , a few points from which we would disassociate ourselves .
First of all , this is unclearly formulated .
Secondly , we are not in favour of harmonising criminal legislation and the administration of justice in the Member States .
What we do support is establishing the necessary instruments for combating fraud involving EU funds more effectively .
The unit must only concern itself with crimes committed by EU employees .
We must not , however , have harmonisation for harmonisation ' s sake and , in other areas , the Member States ' criminal law and administration of justice are national concerns .
I think it only right that we in Parliament make efforts to reduce the problems experienced by frontier workers .
I think this illustrates how major the obstacles in practice are .
In my opinion , we cannot , however , require governments to compensate frontier workers financially for changes in legislation .
It is better to heighten awareness not only of the problems there have always been , but also of new problems that might arise .
I should also like to support the view that we should do more to simplify Regulation 1408/71 .
It is good that we should not forget frontier workers and their problems .
We can , therefore , once again regret the lack of success in obtaining more majority voting at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice .
Regulation 1408/71 concerns the coordination , and not the harmonisation , of social security arrangements , and it is important to make this clear .
It is partly those who organise resistance to the EU who are purposefully working to ensure that nothing at all happens in this area .
However
