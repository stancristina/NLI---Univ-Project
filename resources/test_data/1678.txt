It is important that these funds are used .
Ideally , they should be adopted some time this year , but in any case no later than next year , otherwise the funds that have been granted will remain unspent , as they were in the first few years of the Agenda 2000 programming period .
In this connection , the subject of compulsory cofinancing of direct agricultural aid must be clearly raised .
With these observations we are prepared to give the report our support .     .
The new financial frameworks are thought to be backward-looking in Mr Elles ’ report too .
We want to see more cohesion , more science and research , more concern for the environment , and more social welfare .
Militarisation was one of the Council’s main areas of focus in the new financial frameworks and the Council also secured financing for it in the new Interinstitutional Agreement with Parliament .
Sovereignty in foreign policy is one of the main hallmarks of an independent state .
The Commission ’s proposal for a special Globalisation Fund is a disappointment , in that a condition of Community aid is mass lay-offs , where at least 1 000 workers lose their jobs .
There will be nothing wrong with the mirror , either .
We must set about preparing to draft and implement the multiannual programmes fast ; otherwise the year 2007 will see a dramatic underutilisation of many appropriations .     .
Channelling the EU’s regional policy funds into projects which help improve development in more disadvantaged regions , as well as economic growth and competitiveness throughout the EU , is the background to the guidelines to be drawn up .
For that reason I am in favour of clawing back funds that have already been paid to the regions and Member States , if necessary , unless important key principles relating to European Union policy , such as sustainable development , equality , non-discrimination and the implementation of environmental legislation have been taken into account satisfactorily in the programmes .
Finally , I would like to emphasise the importance of another matter .
Human rights cannot be relinquished , and no price can be put on them .
I have repeatedly expressed concern about the EU’s growing dependence on energy .
EU dependence on Russian energy resources in particular seems to be growing .
My first point is that the Prime Minister is one of the best defenders of Europe .
There are not too many ‘federalists ’ out there : there are many closet federalists , but not many real federalists any more .
My second point concerns the controversy about the name of the Constitution .
I heard the debate with the Foreign Ministers and I disagree with those who wish to change the name .
That treaty ’s name was conceived in Joschka Fischer’s speech in May 2000 – six years ago .
So let us not try to hide things .
Could he be more specific ?     .
It is short-sighted , however , that , just as we ought to be rapidly increasing levels of innovation , this budget is being cut .
In many crucial areas our competitiveness is waning .
Investing in socially sustainable competitiveness will give us a chance to create a Europe where innovations flourish in a sustainable way .
The Framework Programme stresses the need to support the work of small and medium-sized enterprises .
It has been a pleasant experience collaborating on this project .
There may not be any principle at work here .
The principle may just be that we are giving careful consideration to what needs we have and how we can use taxpayers ’ money sparingly .
Last year we decided by a clear majority that we would add EUR five million for groups of visitors .
Why does Parliament decide things in general if they are not put into practice ?
In my opinion , the Committee has quite rightly made it a condition that there should be long-term financial plans for it : consideration of what it will cost next year , in five years ’ time and even over a longer period of time , so that we know where we are going and how the administration will work .
Parliament has abandoned the idea of a nursery here and has bought a splendid house : a nice setting for the children but totally in the wrong place .
The nursery ought to have been in this building or close by .
We should set an example , and I am disappointed with the Social Democrats , who do not care about families with children , who put people down , and who seem contemptuous of families with children .
Mr President , Commissioner , our group obviously takes a positive view of improved energy efficiency .
The Union lacks a transport energy efficiency policy .
Improved energy efficiency in buildings will call for new investment and new technology , but there are no alternatives to it .
When Finland was part of Russia , the tsarist authorities taught the Finns discipline by sending our fellow countrymen to Siberia .
From the point of view of energy efficiency , rising energy prices are the EU’s Siberia .
It teaches you to save energy .
Firstly , on the issue of education , Romani women are , in effect , in a situation of double discrimination : first , as a member of the Roma minority and , second , as members of the weaker sex .
Secondly , access to healthcare : here again , Romani women are in a position of unacceptable weakness , especially on issues relating to reproductive and sexual health .
Efforts need to be stepped up to provide basic reproductive education and to prevent coercive sterilisation .
The many necessary steps identified in the report are all fundamental to lifting many Romani women out of the spiral of disadvantage they are
