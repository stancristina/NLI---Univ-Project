The human body , as has been emphasised on numerous occasions , is inviolable and inalienable and must not therefore be turned into a source of financial gain .
Full and in-depth information for the donor , from a trained person , on the purpose , nature , consequences and risks involved in the donation is a necessary precondition to free consent .
Allow me to conclude by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Peter Liese , on his work and on the huge effort which he made for the procedure to be concluded as quickly as possible .     Mr President , the directive we are debating is very important ; perhaps it is directive of the parliamentary term .
We have proven that we can find compromise solutions such as , for example , the gradual introduction of compulsory insurance so that the cost of the damage is never passed on to the taxpayer and the polluter can cover the damage under his insurance , or the compromise whereby the Member States must undertake to restore the damage if the polluter cannot or if the person responsible cannot be found .
If , however , we do not do something in this direction , industry will never be persuaded to abandon polluting processes .
So greater willingness needs to be demonstrated by both the Commission and by us , ladies and gentlemen , so that this legislation really is legislation of the parliamentary term .
This moderate position on the part of the European Parliament is now in danger of being cancelled at second reading , in that there are amendments which , if accepted , will result in complete exemption .
To conclude , I should point out that the contradictory positions of the PPE-DE cancel out protection and it is worth questioning how it is that , while they are calling here for collective responsibility , they advocate personal responsibility everywhere else .     Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , you have heard a great many criticisms which I endorse but which there is no reason for me to repeat .
We voted against the Daul report on the 3 % reduction in the tobacco harvest premium in order to fund the Community Tobacco Fund , because this retention will reduce even further the already miserly incomes of the poor tobacco producers , especially in Greece , in order to promote research into how tobacco farmers can diversify into other crops or professions .
In 2005 , when the new reform of the CAP will apply , the sums which the Fund will have collected will be enormous and will be used to deceive and uproot tobacco producers · at their own expense .
Similarly , it will result in comparable levels of quality and safety in all the Member States .
That is why I too , like the whole of the GUE/NGL Group , voted against the amendments by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the proposal as a whole .     Mr President , at the start of the part-session yesterday , I wanted to make a proposal and I asked for the floor .
What you said is positive and demonstrates sensitivity on the part of the Council .
I would repeat that this is a hostage issue .
Nor can the salvage company manager .
Once again , I thank the Italian Presidency .     Mr President-in-Office of the Council , a short while ago , in reply to Question No 5 , you told us that the Council considers that it has an obligation to get human rights respected throughout the world .
Or perhaps it has to do with the issue denounced in Question No 20 by Mr Patakis , in other words that the Council relies on the United States for the European Union 's policy on Cuba and related issues ?     I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply .
The point has been repeatedly raised in this Chamber that , while we support regional cooperation , and at Black Sea level there is even a bank and an intergovernmental and interparliamentary procedure and secretariat , our relations with it are as if it were a far flung country , a country in the Far East .
I understand him , some languages are difficult to comprehend and I therefore reserve the right to raise my supplementary question again as an oral question at the next part-session .     – Mr President , there can be no doubt that the role of the Union , together with the United Nations and the African Union , is very important in conflict prevention and peace-making on the continent of Africa , which continues to be torn apart by quarrel and armed conflict .
Nonetheless , generally when we talk of democracy and peaceful coexistence in an area in which violence is a daily reality , we need to take account of two serious factors .
That is why we also need to incorporate local perceptions and practices into international mechanisms .
The Council and the European Commission therefore need to take account of this factor and to reinforce the initiatives of women in peace processes through the budget ; EUR 250 million would be a respectable sum .
Today 's resolution endeavours to restore once again the possibility of resolving the problem , which is why I voted in favour of it .
At the same time , the European Union has turned this country into an experimental laboratory to test its ‘crisis management ’ policy which , in essence , is a policy of imposing its imperialist intentions .
These positions turn any positive elements which the resolution contains into nothing more than a wish list .     – Mr President , over the weekend of 6-7 December 2003 , the number of innocent victims of the
