process .
There is other legislation under way .
We had the privilege - and I thank the Commission for this - of seeing its draft legislation , the regulation which has already today been passed for consultation within the Commission .
At first appearance , this document seems to be an important and very good step in the right direction and I am sure it is going to join the 92/20 revised directive within months as part of the legislative framework to control GMOs .
I can only say to the House that we must accept our responsibilities .
We must do what we have to do for the people of Europe and that is to support this piece of legislation tomorrow .
Mr President , with an issue of this importance it is necessary that we indicate to those still on the premises that a vote is taking place .
It is very unusual for a vote to be called in this way with about 12 Members in the House .
Many others outside are completely unaware - as are those of us who are here who happen to wish to speak in this debate - that this issue is being considered .
If there is a way in which you can alert those on the premises of Parliament to that fact that there is a vote and adjourn until they are present , maybe we will get a more representative result .
Mr President , I am sorry that most of those who sought to stop this debate did not bother to stay to hear it .
I compliment the rapporteur on her report and all the work she has put in .
Food supplements can be a tonic or a health aid .
In rare cases the nature of the supplement or the nature of an individual mean that too great a dosage could be harmful , and so , for generations , we and other countries have set safe upper limits .
With these and with proper labelling the consumer can exercise a safe , free and informed choice .
In Britain , Ireland and elsewhere we have not gone down the route of some of our fellow Member States , which is to take the recommended minimum daily allowance that was set by the American Government in 1943 to ensure that GIs serving in Europe did not suffer from scurvy and beri beri , and to treat that as the basis for maximum intake before classification as a pharmaceutical .
We fear that route leads to higher costs to consumers or an incentive to use unregulated foreign suppliers .
Our belief is that the two systems can coexist .
That is the purpose of Amendment No 50 , in my name and that of Mrs Doyle and others .
It allows the RDA to be taken into account when it is close to the upper safety limit .
I believe that the positive list , as it stands , is far too limited .
We should at the very least expand it by the amendments to this effect .
Labelling must allow for accurate health messages , such as for folic acid .
Lastly , I support the reinstatement of the word "physiological " alongside "nutritional" , as otherwise a significant number of items on sale and acceptable today could risk being banned .
It was a word included , I believe , at the behest of the Council 's working party of experts .
Folic acid is an example .
These are not just my views and those of my delegation .
They are the views of the British Labour Government and , more importantly , the views of the new UK Food Standards Agency .
Mr President , I am glad to be able to follow someone who has so vigorously supported the Labour Government , as Mr Bowis just did .
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur after the sometimes stormy passage of her report and the mini-ambush which she almost suffered tonight .
In the UK we are the largest manufacturer - and indeed consumer - of health supplements of one kind or another , vitamin and mineral supplements to the diet .
We have been stringent in ensuring that false claims are never made for them , and that is why in the UK they have never been marketed as medicines .
But they do bring benefits to millions who would accept that they are a supplement to , but not a substitute for , a balanced diet .
We believe that the upper safe levels are sufficient to make the difference between foods and medicines even clearer .
Obviously the situation is different in some other Member States , and any attempt to regularise the position makes sense in the general context of emergent food law .
I support the rapporteur 's view that all substances which have been validly in use in the Member States , according to the laws of those countries , should continue until such time as they can be tested and perhaps found wanting .
I rather doubt if many will be , and I do not think that the annexes themselves contain anything like the number of exceptions that we should see .
With every day that passes , we hear of other substances which are causing concern because they may be excluded .
That is why the word physiological - and I would beg the rapporteur to think again even at this late hour - is important in terms of people who are genuine sufferers and who derive great benefit from these products .
We ought to hear from the Commissioner tonight that there will be measured progress towards effective analysis by the requisite deadline , be that 2004 or later .
Effective labelling , so that the consumers can choose both the context and the regularity of what they are getting , is the best way forward
