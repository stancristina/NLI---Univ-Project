Could you perhaps address these points when you respond to our debate later on ?
Mr President , could I start my contribution by offering my congratulations to Commissioner Monti and his officials for the scrupulous and professional way in which they dealt with the proposed MCI Worldcom - Sprint merger .
I would particularly to thank him and his officials for trying to see trade unionists from all over the European Union and indeed from the United States of America , who had an opportunity to put their views .
Without doubt , one of the consequences of mergers and takeovers is the effect on employment and I know that the Commissioner , within the confines of the Treaty , is sensitive to this .
What also needs to be stressed is that there are special technological reasons why a concentration of ownership , the potential abuse of a dominant position , is so serious .
In most other industries such a concentration or potential abuse might be temporary , but in this field if any one company does secure such a strong position it will almost certainly have it , if not forever , then at least for a very long time .
In your presentation , Commissioner , you mentioned the danger of one company gaining control over these markets .
This really is a dilemma for Parliament and for the Commission .
We accept the near inevitability and in many cases the desirability of mergers and takeovers , but we also see the potential and actual dangers .
Parliament is consistent in its view that we do not want to put any obstacles in the way of competitiveness and innovation .
We welcome the position that you have taken on this particular issue .
One other small point : much of this competition is between the European Union and the United States of America .
I know you are well aware how crucial it is for Europe to lead in the two important spheres of third generation mobile telephones and digital television and I hope that you will continue your efforts to keep that lead , which is so crucial to jobs , employment and prosperity in the European Union .
I would like to take up the subject just touched upon by the previous speaker , namely the transatlantic aspects of telecoms liberalisation and particularly paragraph 6 and 7 of the draft resolution , which refers to the unfortunate initiative by Senator Hollings to restrict the transfer of licences to telecoms companies which are more than 25 % state-owned .
This seems an ironic lurch towards a protectionist position at the very time when here in Europe and in this Parliament we are about to embark upon a debate on the latest raft of measures which , in my view , would make the European Union telecoms market the most liberalised and the most open market in the world going way beyond many if not all of the commitments into which we entered in GATT and the WTO .
This is politically if not technically an unbalanced situation which merits the attention of this House .
Whilst I have some philosophical sympathy with Senator Hollings and his colleagues who consider that state-owned companies have some hidden and sometimes explicit advantages over their privately-owned competitors , the way in which Congress in the United States is trying to address this issue is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of US multilateral commitments .
I would ask fellow Members , when considering the latest raft of telecoms measures in the weeks to come , not to allow this to go unnoticed or for that matter unchallenged .
Mr President , at the outset I would like to say that I welcome the Commission 's publication of the new telecom directives and regulations on 12 July .
This is part of the ongoing framework programme to improve the quality of telecommunications services in Europe .
Parliament and the Commission are right to be adamant that the Union must improve its telecommunications network .
It is fair to say that the United States is possibly three years ahead of the Union as regards the use of the Internet .
On the back of the new directives which are being enacted in the telecom sector , the European Union will catch up with the US sooner rather than later .
This is also in line with the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Portugal .
EU leaders pointed to the need to improve our overall telecommunications services .
I support the recommendation that all schools in Europe must be equipped with the Internet .
From an Irish perspective , I am particularly satisfied that this programme is advancing at a very swift pace .
There has been much talk in national and international media about the auctioning of third-generation mobile phone licences in Europe .
Certainly , the auctioning of these licences in Germany and Britain has secured large amounts of money for the respective national exchequers , but who ultimately is going to pay for these phones ?
I strongly believe that consumers , once again , are going to be forced to bear the high cost of these licences .
May I welcome the Commissioner to Parliament today on behalf of all of us .
We all appreciate the importance of your task in the competition department of the Commission .
It is perhaps the most important task of the Commission to maintain free competition and make the market work across the European Union .
In the telecoms context it is vital to ensure that consumers get all the benefits the free market can offer them , particularly the low-cost Internet access .
The way to deliver that low-cost Internet access , vitally important for the creation of a European E-economy to the people
