A common directive is necessary and important .
In the opinion of the Committee on Petitions , the importance of registers is mentioned .
When this time is up , it must also be possible for these documents , too , to be evaluated .
We wish to emphasise that these parties must have more rights than the general public .
We would also like to emphasis the important role the Ombudsman has played in the progress that has , nevertheless , been made .
This is a significant step towards a more open and more democratic EU.
The principle of access to documents must of course include all the institutions and bodies of the EU.
The Commission suggested 16 exceptions , which we felt was far too many .
As soon as confidentiality is no longer justified , the document must naturally be made publicly accessible .
It must be possible to appeal to the European Court of Justice , the Ombudsman or the relevant EU authority , and Parliament must always be able to question the grounds for confidentiality .
Another important principle , which has been one of my hobbyhorses since the debate on openness began , is that , as far as possible , documents must be made available in electronic form on the Internet .
The basic principle of the proposal on our table now is that all documents must be made public .
A register of all documents must be established .
I would also like to emphasise that all citizens must be guaranteed access to documents in as many forms as possible .
It is now a matter of our producing a proposal and achieving a good result in our negotiations with the Council and the Commission .
This is a very important report , which forms an important part of what we might call the EU 's new principle of public access to official documents .
It is a matter of legal security , an efficient administration and effective democracy .
We still need to vote in favour of many of the amendments that have been tabled , among others by the Group of the Greens and by the Group of the Europe Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
Mr President , the Theorin and Smet reports were debated late yesterday evening , and the intention was that we should vote on them now .
Mr President , I apologise for saying that the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats had also requested that the vote be postponed , but your coordinator in actual fact came to me and said that you also wished to postpone the issue until the November II part-session instead of taking the vote this evening .
I submit to what Parliament wants to do , but it is , nevertheless , a matter of an agreement between the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists , concerning both my report and the central issues it contains .
Mr President , like many others in my generation , when I walked through the streets in my home town 25 , 30 , 35 years ago and called out , " USA out of Vietnam ! " , I would never have thought that a quarter of a century later I would be forced to stand here in this House and criticise Free Vietnam partly for the same type of violation of human rights that we criticised the USA for then .
Now , however , Human Rights Watch , as Mr Swoboda mentioned , is saying that Vietnam has recently taken steps to improve the situation regarding human rights .
This only weakens the criticism , and those who are being criticised get the feeling that it is of no avail what they do - if they do not do everything at once , which is something they neither can nor want to do .
Mr President , in accordance with the Nordic public service tradition , the European Parliament has , positively enough , claimed that the Ombudsman 's position should be strengthened and consolidated .
This is an important credibility issue for the independence and impartiality of the office of Ombudsman .
It concerns the right of access to documents without restriction , something which is only rarely utilised .
The European Parliament , its Committee on Constitutional Affairs and , we hope , the Commission and the Council too , want to see continued development and a strengthening of the office of Ombudsman and its independence and , alongside that , its credibility among citizens .
I also object to the fact that the text of recital 7 in the report goes above and beyond the Portuguese Republic 's text in demanding one special seat for the Police College instead of cooperation on a rota basis .
I think the EU successfully kept its act together , apart perhaps from in the last critical hours .
Therefore , it is , of course , incredibly important for there to be another conference soon .
I think the EU was right not to give way on carbon sinks .
If that is the case , then it would obviously be extremely risky to add this to the equation at the present stage , when it is still so difficult to come up with definitions .
I was quite alarmed at the arrogance and ignorance shown by the Americans .
Finally , a question : even if a conference in May were not to succeed , is the Commissioner prepared to go further , to be in the vanguard , take the lead and recommend ratification by the EU ?
However , things have happened amazingly quickly within the field of European security policy since the decision to set up a joint European rapid reaction force was taken in
