We will use all of the means at our disposal to ensure that they do just that .
On the pretext of liberalising the service , we are depriving the public - and first and foremost its most disadvantaged members - of social support which is nevertheless essential .
All of this is laughable .
Nevertheless , there remain some doubts , questions and concerns about striking the right balance between the public service and the market , about maintaining the postal network in our towns and villages and about the tariffs applied .
We had tried to convince those who , although they supported the public service , explained to us that the essentials had been safeguarded .
Each Member State should retain full control over how it organises its public services .
But it raises a further question : where is the equivalent timetable for a dialogue with the Council ?
In addition , the list of these substances should not be set in stone because other products with nutritional or physiological effects could be incorporated into the provisions .
In laying down provisions for the prevention , control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , Regulation (EC ) No 999/2001 already subjects animal by-products from slaughterhouses handling ruminants and cutting plants handling meat from ruminants to rigorous and controlled health rules .
Energy is not a marketable commodity like any other !
It was originally a matter of reaffirming our desire to ensure that women 's rights are rigorously respected throughout the territory of all the Member States at a time when huge influxes of unassimilated immigrants are prone to import practices that are degrading to women or are tantamount to cruel torture , such as female circumcision .
Why do they refuse to impose throughout Europe the fundamental right of women to self-determination , including the right of voluntary termination ?
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo has given us many avenues to explore in the fight against fundamentalism .
The report systematically equates religion with fundamentalism in utter disregard of reality .
So what particular facilities do our countries offer , and how can these be rooted out ?
What is more , this latest decision by the Bush Administration testifies to a strengthened desire on the part of the US Government to adopt a unilateral approach in numerous domains : on the commercial and economic as well as the cultural and military fronts , and this last front is the focus of deep concern .
As he indicated , the three wells from which the Union draws its economic policies are liberalisation , privatisation and competition .
But who can fail to observe the extremely poor results of this coordination ?
This will inevitably be a major issue in the French election campaign in particular .
Its rapid adoption would do no less than make Europe the safest financial area in the world , decisively improving its competitiveness through the geographical factor used by the rating agencies .
In these circumstances , I believe that one reading , or one reading and a half , if you like , will suffice for us to ratify this directive , and I shall be absolutely delighted at such an outcome .
The Commission proposal has been a welcome development in the light of the attacks of 11 September .
This disclosure must be made without delay so that the market can digest the relevant information .
But are we aware that the SEC budget is already almost fifty times higher than that of the German regulator ?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , it is now two years and six months since the second war in Chechnya began .
It is essential if we wish to fulfil the objectives that we set ourselves in Lisbon .
The proposal for a directive that the Commission submitted to us is meant to be cast into a legislative text .

The question of voting rights is fundamental , and the debate over Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure has led to numerous controversies .
Mr President , the dominant theme of 2001 for the ACP countries was the entry into force of the Cotonou agreement .
As well as the fact that it is transitory , the Regulation remains vague .
The real question is in fact the more general one of governance and democracy .
There is certainly a particular place for Community law , for law of the members of the European Union .
I am extremely sceptical about Commissioner de Palacio 's point of view regarding the concept of liberalisation seen as a 'deregulated deregulation ' .
As far as I know , Alsace and Andalucia are , in terms of farming , fairly prosperous regions .
The workforce employed underpins the economic activity of rural areas .
It is therefore obvious that any action that seeks to reduce production would only increase our dependence on imports .
The Committee on Agriculture supported the wise recommendations of our rapporteur who has drafted suitable and solid proposals which do not confuse tobacco and nicotine addiction , and I hope that the House will follow suit .
All the compromise amendments were proposed in one go and given to Mr Radwan at the same time .
I think , however , that the compromise amendment submitted to Mr Radwan at 5 p.m. , which he approved without hesitation , should certainly be taken before Amendment No 48 .
This directive is a feeble attempt to regulate the financial markets , the chaotic workings of which are now seen to be the cause of financial crises and social catastrophes throughout the world , as the Enron affair has illustrated .
