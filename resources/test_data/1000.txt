In theory , the European Union could certainly negotiate a memorandum of understanding allowing the Member States to use this information but , for the moment and in the short term , the European Union must think about protecting itself autonomously with a different cryptographic system from those currently in place , such as the state of the art Hermes system which is the product of European research , with remote point-to-point transport so that the data cannot be captured by the spy satellite .
Moreover , what funding is there for European research in major , strategic sectors such as cryptography ?
There are so many resources available to us : so many data banks , so many police resources and so much legislation , and yet , all too often , when faced with the emergence or transformation of large-scale criminal phenomena such as those related to drugs , crimes against children , the trafficking and exploitation of human beings and , of course , terrorism , Parliament continues to be taken by surprise and ends up arriving too late , incapable of defining effective preventive actions .
In my view , the measure discussed in the report deals with European terrorism , not just that despicable method which - I regret to say - is developing in present-day Spain , for if we can call that method despicable then we must see the methods used in other European countries by movements with much more dubious aims as just as contemptible .
Recitals E , F and G make this clear , stressing that terrorism is on the increase in almost all the European countries and that the nature of terrorism is changing radically , but that there are also , according to recital G , in particular , international networks enjoying strong - as the recital says - logistical and financial support .
Madam President , when I was speaking on this report I got the numbers of the amendments which I wanted to be put to the vote wrong .
The numbers of the amendments which I recommend should be put to the vote are Nos 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 22 .
It recommends that , in order to genuinely combat terrorism , absolute silence of the press and television in matters of terrorism should be established .
Clearly , it is not just Italy which has cultural activities to share but the other 14 States of the European Union and the 12 candidate countries as well .
Italy and France are going to establish such limits - I recall a draft law I submitted to the Chamber of Deputies - together with the local communities , and communicate them to Europe so that Europe can modify the trans-European transport network and specify the changes in the Commission ' s White Paper , which will also cover vehicle transit through the Alps .
Madam President , a few days ago , during the summer , I went on holiday to Estonia .

I do not agree .

( IT ) Regretfully , the Alleanza Nazionale delegation to the European Parliament is going to vote against Slovenia ' s accession : regretfully because we believe in the democratic and Europeanist sentiments of the Slovenian people , a people which - we are sure - will make a substantial contribution to the integration of a Europe which is becoming increasingly capable of united political and economic action and of protecting the historical and cultural diversities of its communities .
I spent time first with a beautiful Greek Cypriot girl and then with a beautiful Turkish Cypriot girl .
Collins report ( A5-0249/2001 )
.
( IT ) I voted against the motion with great indignation : we would never have imagined that we might be spied on as Europeans , as free citizens , as businesses , not just by our Nato allies but even by our European partners as well .
These are important questions which require a committee of inquiry to be set up .
I call upon the Council and the Commission , who are more aware of the need to respect the principles enshrined in the Treaties , to correct this dangerous drift .
An operation to reduce the debt of 23 countries by USD 50 billion , which is 70 % of the total debt , was launched .
Such cooperation may have not have been adequate at the G8 summit and we must concentrate on improving in this area .
In this sense , far from being an inevitable source of suffering , globalisation is proving to be a great opportunity to genuinely change the balance of play in the world and confront the dreadful scourges afflicting much of humanity which , in these times in which we live , mean that none of us can be sure of our moral innocence .
Unfortunately , even the legitimate opinions of the peaceful demonstrators were obscured by the globalised violence of those who have become professional rioters .
It is not Italy which needs to be placed under observation but that part of Europe which speaks of human rights in this Chamber and then allows those same rights to be violated , and the self-interested generosity of certain left-wing voices which condemn violence as a means of persuasion .
We feel that the western democracies must relaunch the method of democracy and the rule of law , that they must attack rather than playing a defensive game and must relaunch the initiative of the globalisation of rights and democracy .
And without a doubt , a completely new way of working was established in Genoa compared to that adopted for all the other G8 summits .
Secondly , in my opinion , in view , apart from anything else , of the tendencies of some of the previous speakers , I
