The same is true of the conclusions on the matter now in hand , which was the basis for refusing discharge .
I read in the ' European Voice ' that on their resignation , the Commissioners would receive a three year severance package .
In my opinion , it is wrong and unfair that they should be rewarded so well for the work they have done so badly .
However , you have not made any significant comment with regard to this request .
This must also be visible inter alia in the composition of the Commission .
It has come to my attention that there is in existence an unofficial list of candidates for membership of the Commission , and that on this list there are only three women .
There are five women in the present Commission , and it would certainly be a massive leap backwards if we were not to aim for a larger number of female Members of the Commission .
I believe it should also be mentioned that those Members of the present Commission who have performed their duties well , and who are committed to the reforms , will also be needed in the next Commission , as , otherwise , the reforms will not be introduced sufficiently promptly .
The Social Democrats and Greens in Germany , which holds the Presidency of the Council , are bombing the Yugoslavians , that is to say , the Slavs , with no formal declaration of war .
There are still more Slavs in Russia .
It touches on some issues that have been largely overlooked .
In addition , no decision has been taken on the basis on which debts are to be waived , and it what way this should be dealt with .
Thus I welcome Mr Spencer 's report , as it avoids setting out the sort of political conditions that Parliament usually does , but approaches the issue in a balanced way .
One was by Mrs Piha , on the Union 's northern dimension , and the other was Mr Spencer 's report on the Union 's strategy with respect to Russia .
The committee was unable to create a link between the two reports , since the one on the strategy with respect to Russia only mentions the northern dimension in passing .
The northern dimension must be seen as an essential part of both the EU 's external relations and the decision-making process that impacts on its internal development .
In its EU policy , Russia must also be able to broaden its pan-European network of contacts .
The Union , in principle , must also be open to Russian membership , although this seems a long way off at present .
My congratulations go to Mr Spencer for an excellent report .
The northern dimension , however , should have been accorded greater substance , such as the creation of free trade zones for northwestern Russia , which would help it to develop .
That is the core issue .
Shameless , large-scale corruption on the part of politicians and dubious businessmen has destroyed the credibility of the administration in the eyes of its own nation .
We are waiting for the Russian Government to ask Interpol for help in sorting out accounts and finance .
Loans from western financial institutions must be made conditional on the eradication of corruption at high levels .
In fact , corruption rots the whole system from top to bottom , and it stifles many of the reforms .
This has had the unfortunate result that life expectancy has fallen by ten years in ten years .
We should nevertheless bear in mind that Russia has an educated population and a splendid culture which will challenge the individualism and materialism of the west .
It is an issue that can no longer be pushed aside .
Regretfully , it has to be said that the Council was slow in dealing with this matter .
But it is vital that the Statute should be approved before the new Parliament commences its term of office .
We should also abandon the system of flat rate travel expenses and adhere to one of bona fide costs incurred , but one that includes expenses incurred through travel in one 's home country .
In any case .
Madam President , Mrs MÃ¼ller has produced an excellent report as a basis for next year 's budget , and I would like to thank her sincerely .
This is a new institution , which was created only in 1995 .
The number of staff employed in this office , in proportion to the number of cases they have to deal with , is considerably smaller than that in their counterparts in the Member States .
This has to be acknowledged , although our reactions have been helped along by the fact that the funding required has not been on a very large scale .
I hope that there can be a systematic increase in resources made available to the European Ombudsman in the budget proper , as that is the way we can best promote the public 's confidence in the work of the EU generally .
Considering that the European Parliament aspires to purge the European Union of abuses as a responsible wielder of budgetary power , I personally have problems with the fact that the European Parliament is promoting 490 of its officials in the year 2000 .
When , however , I listened to the report of Mr Priestley , Secretary-General of the European Parliament , in the Committee on Budgets , I had to admit that things were the same as ever : knowledge breeds problems .
Our role in the European Parliament is to keep to a tight budget for ourselves as well .
Mr President , Mr President-designate of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of
