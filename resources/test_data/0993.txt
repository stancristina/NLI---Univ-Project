allow Parliament to participate fully in the process , not just by swapping shopping lists with you .
It is because we want to give more purpose and prominence to this procedure that the ELDR intends not to sign the current eight-page list - not because we object to the contents , but because we think this is in danger of becoming an annual ritual performance without substance and real meaning .
What we would like to do is catch the imagination of Europe 's citizens .
Mr President , I welcome the broad thrust of the proposals published by the Commission in its annual legislative programme for the year 2000 .
The most important issues that will be addressed this year will be the reform of the EU decision-making procedures , so that the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner .
I support the enlargement of the Union , but such a process cannot take place until key EU institutions , including the Commission , the Council , and of course Parliament , reform their internal decision-making operations .
As a Member of the Parliament from the constituency of Connaught Ulster in Ireland , a peripheral part of this Union , I strongly believe in real and tangible representation for smaller Member States within the EU structures .
At present , the five larger Member States have two posts within the European Commission and there is one each for the smaller Member States .
Whatever the reform , it is vitally important that smaller Member States retain their right to nominate a Member of the Commission .
Undoubtedly , the European Council , representing the fifteen governments , will have to reform its structures .
From an Irish perspective , I strongly believe that Member State governments must have a veto over tax changes at EU level .
No changes at present can be agreed at EU level concerning tax policies without the unanimous support of all EU Member States .
I believe this is an important right , which should be left in the domain of national Member States .
In my own country , the tax regime is quite innovative in many ways .
The tax burden on middle and lower income workers has been steadily reduced , while sensible tax breaks have been given to encourage business enterprises .
This cannot be said of many of the other Member States .
Any proposal to give the European Council the power of qualified majority voting on justice and home affairs would be , I believe , very unwise .
In conclusion , can I say that I am very pleased that the President has , this morning , referred to fisheries .
He said he believes it is lagging behind - that real progress must be made in the year 2002 , because fisheries are established in areas where there is no alternative source of employment .
Of course we want to ensure by the year 2002 that the countries that suffered most when the common fisheries policy was put in place in 1983 will in future receive a fair and equitable share of the resources .
In conclusion , can I say that on a broader level it is important that the European Union , as an economic entity , does not fall behind in the global search for e-commerce opportunities .
The Commission must support educational and training programmes , to ensure that business structures take account of the opportunities which can be secured from the Internet and e-commerce in general .
An information technology revolution is certainly upon us .
We cannot be passengers when these changes take place .
We must be leaders of our business communities and of our educational institutions , so that information technology initiatives are incorporated into all key social and economic sectors of our society .
The annual legislative programme is the most concrete manifestation of the European Commission 's key constitutional and political power , namely the exclusive right of initiative .
Such power must at all times be rigorously justified and clearly explained .
Yet this year 's work programme , as in all previous years , does not provide detailed justification for each of the multitude of new measures proposed .
A 15-page general summary does not exactly do justice to the 500 initiatives cited in the annex .
In future , the ELDR will therefore insist that there is clear justification for , and specialised parliamentary debate on , all measures announced in the work programme .
In particular , we will be looking for evidence that each new proposal has been properly tested against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and we will be looking for sector-specific debates in the European Parliament 's own specialised committees .
In other words , it is now high time for a comprehensive overhaul of the somewhat antiquated way in which this crucial programming document is developed and debated in future .
Mr President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission for giving us two speeches within the space of 24 hours .
Last night he clearly pointed out that we have the prospect of a successful European economy ahead of us for the next two or three years and quite clearly , if we have unexpectedly higher-than-normal growth , then that will help us in the endeavours of this annual legislative programme .
The Commission President 's speech this morning raises three concerns in my mind .
The first relates to subsidiarity , where we feel strongly in our group , as the Liberals have just said , that we need to have a test for every single proposal put forward to show that it is in the European interest .
Subsidiarity must be seen to apply : it must be clear that we are not legislating where it is not necessary to do so .
