That is why I am calling upon the Members of this Parliament to take more interest in our Committee on Petitions , since it is theirs .
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are therefore presenting an amendment which I hope the House will support and which recommends that Members leave it to citizens to initiate such procedures , while we ourselves go through other channels provided for in the Rules of Procedure .
The Valencian Community has some of Europe’s most advanced legislation in the field of town planning and protection of the natural environment , and evidence of this is the fact that the Valencian Community has 19 natural parks , 31 municipal protected sites and 4 protected areas .
I would like to raise three questions or concerns that have occurred to me as a result of the immense vivacity and liveliness of the debate in this Committee , which is fascinating .
Your issues with other ministers , directors , etc. , are your problem , Mr Cashman , as you know .
What has happened to the plan adopted to prevent and combat people trafficking ?
The pollution of groundwater leads to situations that are difficult and costly to put right .
There is no question that the exchange of data amongst public authorities represents the key added value of INSPIRE.
Tourism is one of our largest and most competitive industries with major growth potential .
It is therefore an important instrument for social and regional integration .
I believe that there has been good feeling , a positive relationship and a spirit of consensus , which we in my group thank you for .
It remains to be seen whether this Seventh Framework Programme responds to these challenges .
Parliament has the opportunity to open up the programme to everybody .
One of the challenges has been to increase the participation of small businesses and to create this cohesion .
It is also a transparency problem .
The Seventh Framework Programme is a great opportunity in a key area : with regard to one of the fundamental elements of the Lisbon Strategy , which is research and the resulting innovation .
It is entirely our responsibility to ensure that the Seventh Framework Programme is a success .
The People programme provides for important measures to increase the human resources dedicated to research , in terms of both quantity and quality , in order to make Europe more attractive to researchers and in order to slow down their exodus and to promote the incorporation of women .
We must not forget that one of the Union’s great objectives is to lead a policy of economic efficiency and competitiveness within a framework of sustainable development .
We would therefore call upon everybody – the rapporteur in particular – to support the amendments that several political groups and several Members have presented and that provide for this focus on fisheries .     Mr President , Tunisia is a key country in the Euro-Mediterranean process .
The Euro-Mediterranean process is a success , but there is at least one issue in relation to which we have not yet achieved our objective , and that is that respect for human rights should be the norm in the politics of all the countries involved in this process .
The company has applied these measures , and the latest comments from the group have largely been positive .
Madam President , Mrs Isler Béguin , I am also aware of the situation affecting the indigenous people of the area .
I would like to say to those people , however , that , with a Community policy on immigration , there would never be mass regularisation without control , and the 'pull factor ' which we are currently so afraid of would not therefore exist .
You have made a good speech , because I believe that you have managed to move people , those of us who are here and those outside of this Parliament who are listening to us .
In all of the campaigns that I have taken part in , I have never heard what all of the leaders who have spoken here today have said : the Constitutional Treaty is necessary in order for Europe to function better , in order to provide the people with added value .
That is essential .
We must increase the citizens ’ faith in the Union , show them its added value , through more effective action on issues such as security , the effective control of migratory flows , job creation and so on .
We must stress that the prospect of accession has been a powerful driving force in terms of the great political , economic and social transformations that have taken place in many countries , which have benefited both them and the Union .
Mr President , I feel less optimistic than those who have spoken so far , because I believe that the document that has been produced is essentially a document full of statements , which includes many existing clichés , many arguments that we have all heard and which are leading to an increasingly weak and less respected notion of sustainable development .
Certain economic activities are necessary in order to maintain biodiversity .
That is something we must deal with , ladies and gentlemen , on the basis of sustainable development .     .
It is something much more important .
And , secondly , how does the Council intend to approach the negotiations and what results does it hope to achieve ?
With regard to the role of parliaments in general , and of parliamentarians in particular , I would like to stress the increasing importance of these institutions in the process , not just as legislators , but also and this is fundamental in terms of controlling the actions of
