because it contains not only immediate measures to achieve this but also useful suggestions for the future .
Those vineyards would be allowed to lie fallow , and we would see the loss of a vital economic asset in that region and the destruction of a traditional human equilibrium .
First the unborn children , then the old .
We must free our enterprises from the social burdens they bear , replacing those burdens with a social VAT from which our products will be exempt on export , though it will be applied to imported products .
Today , according to statistics recently published in France , 70 % of families with more than six children are foreign , as are 50 % of families with five children .
What is at stake is too serious .
In any event , some day we will have to know where we stand and whether we do or do not have the right to defend ourselves .
Some Member States , indeed , such as the United Kingdom , are already placing on the market products derived from genetically modified organisms , surrounding them , of course , by all the necessary guarantees - as we have said - as regards nutritional and environmental safety , in order to protect European citizens by guaranteeing them the quality of products derived from perfectly monitored European production .
Yet risks to agriculture and the environment remain .
Mr President , we are here , in this Parliament , normally , to defend the consumer , the European citizen , whom we are supposed to represent .
It is not true that we have all the safety necessary .
Commissioner , I am not with you when you offer guarantees on the unknown : you act as if you were in possession of the infallible truth .
And we know that there is no threshold for harmlessness .
Yesterday I raised a question which our ' Superior ' - because I consider you a monk of this monastery - judged to be a personal matter .
In wanting to be exhaustive , the report runs the certain risk of being imperfect .
No matter .
That is how it is that Member States are to be discouraged from thinking about the possible reinstatement of capital punishment for foul crimes while total freedom of expression is to be given to the killers of children yet to be born .
But it undoubtedly goes much better for being said .
This rather damning report may shock some but , in this area , it is important to be particularly exacting and not to give way to the tendency to hide one 's face or look away from unpleasant things .
This legislation , whether adopted or under preparation , is an attack on fundamental human rights .
This attack has just be stregthened by the Perben law , which limits the liberties which still existed in the civil service in this area .
Mrs Randzio-Plath is quite right to say that after winning the confidence of the markets - which has now almost been done - it is now an urgent necessity to win the confidence of consumers , that is , the citizens of Europe by boosting growth and employment .
What is more , the few occasions we found it was mentioned , here and there , seemed extraordinarily lax .
You can smell professionals at work .
Parliament has a role to play and should lead the Commission to give unrestricted support to the prohibition from 1 January 1998 .
In their turn these faults are not fortuitous , they arise from the institutional structure itself of Europe today , dominated by a technocratic structure which considers itself superior to the nations and which , because it is so far removed from them , ends up losing all reference to reality and to the needs of people .
Indeed , the Roth report does not speak about the persecution to which the unions are subject in France .
This observation should be relocated to the context of the debate at the Intergovernmental Conference on differentiated cooperation , which we hope we will not see become a matter a priori and systematically for the Court of Justice .
The second idea is the need for a common policy for growth .
We will not solve our growth and employment problems by relaxing budgetary discipline , and we will not solve our growth and employment problems by relaxing monetary policy .
I would like to stress one thing on this subject , which is that there is no a priori reason why globalisation should not lead to the creation of jobs , even if this poses a number of problems in the short term , as we know .
I do not think it is the vision of Mr Metten either , because it is in all our interests that the extent of the internal market should coincide with the territory of monetary union .
Now , as regards problems of budgetary balance , it is not a facility intended for the balance of payments which should be used : it is another facility .
Four subjects were chosen by the Commission .
Finally , I note with disappointment , as it relates to the future of the SLIM initiative , the total absence of common vision between the Executive Committee , the ' Internal Market ' Committee and the Committee on Legal Affairs .
I think our Commission has produced a profound piece of work .
Otherwise , I am afraid that by letting things go we will see worse relocations , to the detriment of artists as well as to all the intermediaries and other active parties in the art market in Europe .
The second important failure to be highlighted in the implementation of the 1995 budget relates to fraud .
