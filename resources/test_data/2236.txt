make a start on assessing the Directorates-General .
They could perhaps be given a push in the right direction , if need be .
The Member States avoid responsibility , misappropriate funds and do nothing whatsoever to exercise control and , every time criticisms are made , a storm of criticism rains down upon those in Brussels , that is to say the Commission and others .
I think the Member States should be ashamed of themselves .
In 1995 , a convention to protect the EU' s economic interests was adopted .
It is simply not good enough , so make sure you in the Member States get your act together .
I am certain that we shall achieve a result , but it requires openness and honesty from all parties .
The Commission has proposed introducing an aid scheme for pigmeat producers by establishing equalisation funds in the Member States .
The crisis in the pig sector has resolved itself through the market economy , and precisely because unnecessary and expensive aid schemes have not been introduced .
Producers are to receive 100 % aid from the fund to reduce their production , and the EU is to co-finance the scheme .
We are therefore voting against both the Commission ' s proposal and Parliament ' s report .
We all know that it has been a long and very difficult process putting together the requirements for the incineration of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste .
First and foremost , a significant contribution has now been made to reducing discharges of hazardous and polluting substances produced by incineration - substances which are very harmful to people ' s health and which damage the environment .
I also think , however , that it is very important to emphasise that it is now no longer merely a question of discharges into the atmosphere but also of discharges into the water and the earth .
I think this is a very important result .
Finally , I want to emphasise that , by establishing the common requirements which everyone must now fulfil , we can presumably get rid of a significant proportion of so-called waste tourism .
As Mr Blokland mentioned , incineration is , of course , far from being the ideal way of disposing of waste .
It is important for us to continually invest in better production methods , recycling and re-use .
This ought clearly to be given priority ahead of incineration .
I believe this will prove to be a significant contribution to improving the environment .
Mr President , I too should like to thank Mr Rocard for his own-initiative report , even if I did not agree with his original view which was , of course , to establish supplementary health insurance schemes in all EU countries , founded on the principle of solidarity and governed by a common set of regulations .
Sickness insurance is , of course , a national responsibility and systems differ from one another .
It is a problem calling for many different solutions , including better organised and more efficient health care , so that a better quality of service can be obtained for the same money .
I am generally in favour of a system in which the money follows the patient as far as possible , so that it is the patient and not the system that is central .
However , the individual country must decide for itself what arrangements it prefers .
It would be wrong if the EU were to devise rules concerning , for example , data relating to health , or requiring everyone to be insured and , in that way , destroy the multiplicity of supplementary health insurance schemes which exist today in many countries and operate on actuarial principles .
It is right that , in connection with serious illnesses such as cancer and aids , there must be a compulsory system , founded on the principle of solidarity , which ensures good treatment for everybody .
They state that , in one of the largest countries - which is also one of the most important countries for the European economy , namely Germany - there is a risk of jumping into something resembling overheating .
What must the EU' s role be ?
The idea is that all interested and concerned parties should be involved in a type of work in which the individual countries describe the extent of social exclusion and their efforts to combat it .
When we think of the long-term unemployed - young as well as old - do we not think of physically or mentally handicapped people , of the mentally ill and of the poor and people with limited means ?
No doubt we each of us have our own particular ideas about what the concept should cover .
What we lack is a common definition .
The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition , which is also rather simplistic and unduly bland .
The very open approach adopted by the Council to the issue is , in my view , quite correct .
With regard to the actual report , Mrs Figueiredo wants to see the word 'poverty ' introduced into the legislative text .
We recognise , of course , that poverty is a source of social exclusion , as is also stated in the text .
Parts of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party also have reservations about increasing the appropriation and inserting a reference to the focus group into the legislative text , but we are otherwise able to support Mrs Figueiredo ' s report .
Mr President , in common with other speakers , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her very comprehensive and commendable report containing a series of proposals which decision makers around the world ought to take on board and from which they ought to draw inspiration .
