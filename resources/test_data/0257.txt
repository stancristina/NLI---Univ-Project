of a momentous two years for the European Union , which began with the 1996 discharge and its refusal .
I should like to congratulate Mrs Stauner on the courage which she has shown in getting her report - although not much of it is in its original form - through this Parliament .
We need , in this debate , to associate the 1998 discharge with that of the framework agreement which we will be voting on tomorrow .
Hopefully we will see signs of a more democratic Europe as a result of these last few months .
First , Parliament 's role in the discharge has been shown to be one of extreme importance .
The Council , by its absence today , shows its lack of interest in the way in which we , as a Parliament , have used our powers to begin the birth of a political Europe .
Without the 1996 discharge there would have been no Wise Men 's report , no Commission resignation and no real urgency for Commission reform .
But not all of us in this House have been heroes .
We have found ourselves split between countries , within countries , within delegations , often with strongly held views .
It was the Socialist leader , Mrs Green , who took the biscuit by voting for a motion of confidence on a motion of censure , which she did indeed get .
Miss Morgan now continues this particular inheritance by asking for a depolitisation of the discharge process .
Indeed , one or two of her amendments , like removing paragraphs 47 and 48 of the discharge report today show that some of these amendments look more Commission-born than in Parliament 's interests .
But where to now ?
Monitoring is necessary to make sure that what we have gained as a Parliament is maintained .
Mr Prodi needs to be supported in his reforms of the Commission .
Last but not least , our most important role is to make sure we have greater accountability and more democracy and that it is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning for Parliament 's rights in the European institutions .
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs - and indeed the people of Wales , because I did not realize they were so concerned about the Commission 's welfare that they had elected someone to represent the Commission 's views in Parliament rather than their own !
I would also like to say , just to correct something that Mrs Morgan said earlier , that I am very lucky in this debate , because my party declared in our manifesto - which helped so many of us on this side get elected - that we would not give discharge to any EU accounts until the Commission reform process had been successfully implemented .
I cannot therefore follow the lead of our excellent rapporteur , who recommends granting discharge to the Commission , for the reasons I have already given and because many people outside this place have been wondering what actually improved between 1996 and 1998 .
Most people believe that things got worse within the Commission in that time rather than better .
I only joined the Committee on Budgetary Control a couple of months ago , and to me the meetings and the reports of the last two months have raised probably more questions than they have answered .
To close , I would like to ask two of those questions .
Firstly , can the Commission confirm whether Mr Fl√©chard is related in any way to Mr Delors and/or members of his cabinet ?
Secondly , can he confirm whether any of his or Commissioner Kinnock 's cabinet have actively lobbied MEPs for support of the Socialist Group , and in particular for Mrs Morgan 's amendments on the Stauner report ?
If they have , would this not be an abuse of their position ? ( Applause from the right )
Mr President , the fact that the EU observer mission has garnered great international acclaim reflects the fact that Mr Schori has done an excellent job in raising the profile of what we were doing there .
I pay great tribute to him .
There is no doubt in Zimbabwe that it has been a case of " Power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely " .
Mr Mugabe has much to answer for .
If the result may be said to have a positive side , it is the fact that there is now no longer absolute power .
Much of the violence that took place before the elections can be based directly back to the leadership of Zanu-PF and to President Mugabe himself .
The so-called war veterans - they must have been very young when the war of independence was on - have been paid to be on these farms .
This is a grave problem which be traced directly back to the leadership .
There were problems too with the fact that the postal votes , which were sent directly to the army in the Congo on Thursday , miraculously returned on Saturday , all in due form going into many marginal constituencies .
Threats of violence against supporters of the MDC have continued after the elections .
The Archbishop of Bulawayo has been threatened .
All these things must be stopped .
We cannot possibly support a regime that carries on this intimidation .
The fact that President Mugabe wants to stifle inward investment by nationalising the farms , and threatening to do the same with the mines , will do nothing to resolve the economic situation in Zimbabwe .
What Zimbabwe needs is much more inward investment from outside the country .
This will not take place under the present regime
