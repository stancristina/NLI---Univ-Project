during the last critical months .
Thus , in France , a law on 'trade union representativeness ' forbids the free candidature of workers in the first round of professional elections of staff representatives or delegates to works councils , and it is only when there is a shortfall at the first round that the worker can vote or stand for an organization of his choice not yet recognized .
So on behalf of my group , I ask you , Mr Rapporteur , to be willing to accept this amendment .
I would therefore be grateful for any instructions you can give to have the minutes corrected about this .
Nobody could have explained the reasons for the policy , or justified it , better than the rapporteur , specializing as she does in this part of the world .
The success of our activities , however , will depend on three conditions .
Mr President , Ladies and gentlemen , this report is very interesting but its very title perhaps betrays the extreme nature of a deliberately global approach .
On the other hand , I do not think we have to take into account the desire of Transcaucasian peoples to become integrated into European structures .
Setting up systems for the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin is a move in that direction .
I am rather afraid that it would turn out to be a new structure of baubles , bangles , beads and civil servants , expensive , reassuring for us , but whose effectiveness cannot be guaranteed .
It was not a deputy from the National Front , it was two German parliamentarians , Christian Democrats , from the Bundestag .
That is why the European Year Against Racism , which opens tomorrow in The Hague , seems more necessary than ever .
My group , which approves the proposal of the European Forum of Migrants , for a deontological code for the media , highlights in an amendment the essential role that the media should play in denouncing racism and promoting tolerance , showing particularly the positive contribution which immigrants have made and still make to European society .
This colleague committed a second offence a short time later , without doubt so that there could be no ambiguity of interpretation , by speaking of training on the basis of race .
I am concerned , but I hope I am also mistaken .
Another of our colleagues , when talking about immigration , or the excessive number of refugees , used the word 'burden' , and I think that Mr Konrad used it again .
Terrorism in Europe is not a foreign secretion .
Many anthropologists and sociologists , such as Arnold Gehlen , have shown that man needs to be surrounded by strong traditions and institutions .
Mr President , the report on the progress of the Union in 1995 which we are examining today analyses European policy according to a rather distorted reading detectable right from the first preamble .
But be warned , the very rapid evolution towards the information society demands increased vigilance of the Community to promote this European cultural identity as much through the networks as through the services offered .
It is not , then , a question of evaluating the activities carried out by all the specific cultural programmes , but of seeing how far Community policy takes account of cultural aspects in its action in the name of other arrangements .
I would like our efforts essentially to be focused upon creation , genuine creation .
Firstly , as the Committee on Legal Affairs has shown many times over and for all institutions of the Union , what is true for some must also be true for others .
The Grotius and Schuman programmes are concerned with all citizens thanks to the Citizens of Europe programme .
My group rejects this choice of 'going all the way ' .
The difficulty lies in the fact that once the dispositions are ratified , European parliaments make an act of faith in the creation of a new European law while depriving themselves of parliamentary control .
Indeed , whether we are talking about application of K9 , communitarising the third pillar , or adopting appropriate dispositions in a pillar 1A , what is actually at stake ?
These divergences in the appreciation of the parties who will have to pronounce themselves on the IGC are not encouraging .
We would be so horrified that month-in month-out we would be passing urgencies in this Parliament condemning the situation .
Sadly , these good intentions did not last for long against the amendments which have just been voted in in the plenary session .
That is why we should support the step which the European Union is taking in the symbolic expression which has led it to declare a year against racism .
In this area the Commission ought to adopt a pragmatic approach .
The debate must begin on the problems of the real cost of transport within the European Union .
Thirdly , if the vote on motions for a resolution were to produce a majority in favour of a condemnation of the Commission 's attitude in terms which are less strong than is implied by the motion of censure , the subsequent vote would by that very fact be devoid of any political significance .
The example of the Abbruzes must lead us to quickly look at what measures can be implemented in order to fill the legal vacuum which surrounds the abrupt termination of a region 's eligibility under the Structural Fund objectives .
State policy and intervention in support of the family , primarily through parental pay , should be used to boost the birth-rate , if we are to prevent our redistributive pension schemes from collapsing under the weight of our ageing populations .
