that there is a technical need for food irradiation , that there is no danger to public health , that it is useful for the consumer and that it is not an alternative to hygiene regulations .
Let me end by saying that I would conclude that food irradiation is necessary in a number of cases in order to let fresh food and safe food go hand in hand .
Irradiation is not necessary .
There are many alternatives .
About a year ago Mr Sturdy put to me the idea of setting up a committee to investigate the recent foot and mouth disease crisis .
If I arrive at an airport there are scarcely any checks on my luggage , in complete contrast to the situation in other continents .
As regards financing : the Commission has been a little parsimonious .
That is the only jarring note I have to sound in this speech .
Parties who do not wish for such a test , should pay the penalty at the ballot box for the consequences of a foot and mouth outbreak .
The argument that vaccination is pointless because of the number of variants of the foot and mouth virus is about as cogent as maintaining that flu jabs in human beings do no good .
I wholeheartedly agree with her and I am able to speak on behalf of the inhabitants of the affected areas in my country : the Veluwe and Friesland , who greatly appreciated the fact that parliamentary colleagues visited these areas and listened to them .
It is essential , however , that if we do not adopt general vaccination , emergency vaccination should become standard in the case of an outbreak , as the Commission has said , and that even after emergency vaccination the farms involved should receive the same treatment as if there had been a cull .
They must take this report on board in their policy , or else we shall find ourselves in new difficulties regarding democracy in Europe .
Yes we must persuade supermarkets to sell the meat of vaccinated animals as a matter of course .
Unless we link this resolution to concerted pressure in the Convention , all our efforts will have been in vain .
For citizens , the complex structure of responsibilities was scarcely comprehensible , and that created the impression of politicians who took up positions but subsequently preferred to hide behind others .
Responsibilities for choices and for compliance must be clearly established , and it is our task to communicate these .
Just as people believed this of human tuberculosis .
As is often the case government power is more stupid than human society as a whole .
Unfortunately they were successful .
At least for those countries , like the Netherlands , that wish to do so .
It is very important that we vote on it today .
Evidently one needs to be the loser in a war to be tried and sentenced after that war .
The rights of citizens are therefore insufficiently guaranteed in this proposal .
I do not support his intentions , but I do support his clarity .
We run the risk of the waiting time becoming longer , of organisations and other recipients of what we might call 'cash in hand ' having to wait longer for their money , which surely cannot be the intention .
Now it emerges that North Korea is not keeping to its part of the agreements and is after all investing in its own nuclear weapons programme .
That is why we must now once again re-examine KEDO carefully , and as we see it wind it up .
My final point , Mr President , concerns the animal experimentation centre at Rijswijk .
I have no criticism to make of the hard work .
Surely that must give us pause for thought .
In the justification , there is the coy remark that political foundations are ideally qualified for the activities mentioned .
I therefore appeal to you to decisively reject Amendment No 147 .
As regards last year 's budget , the Commission had had every opportunity .
I believe that the Commission must pay particular attention to that .
I explain to people in the Netherlands that out of every hundred euros that they earn , they pay forty-three euros in tax and that only one euro of that goes to the European Union .
Everyone is surely too preoccupied with the relatively small amount .
Or at least that it has not so far been interpreted in that way .
I should like once again to press the Commissioner on his future intentions .
I come from Belgium where we had the dioxin crisis , which is certainly not unknown to you .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , I shall be brief for two reasons .
I shall not expand on it yet again , but it is of crucial importance .
I am also saying this to my British fellow MEPs .
I accept this regretfully , but I think we must ensure that this problem is solved through other means .
Ten years ago , we , as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , proposed individual producer responsibility in the packaging directive .
Have you not , however , really underestimated the costs involved ?
Do we really see the European Union - and I do mean the European Union - as sharing borders with Iran , Iraq and Syria ?
I also note that although no date has yet been set for negotiations with Turkey , the political criteria are to be evaluated in December 2004 , so it is possible that negotiations may start without a national parliament , let alone the citizens of a Member State , becoming involved in such a decision at all .
I object to this
