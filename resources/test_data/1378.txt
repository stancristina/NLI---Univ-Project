We therefore support the need for the gradual elaboration of a common European policy for protecting groundwater , which will , however , also take account of the specific characteristics of each area .
As there is no European definition of the best practice for farming , we call on the Member States to take additional measures to prevent pollution in this sector .
The emphasis on prevention , the strict protection of groundwater and measures to prevent its deterioration are both necessary and an investment for future generations .
As far as prevention is concerned , our objective is to protect groundwater with preventive measures , not to try and simply improve the status of polluted water .
We need strict criteria for nitrates and pesticides and I therefore call on you to vote in favour of Amendments 101 and 102 .
Mr President , the Commission believes that , given the current lack of knowledge about the environmental quality of groundwater and the huge variety of natural conditions which exist in Europe , it is not technically feasible , nor is it desirable to introduce on this basis new standards for a more comprehensive list of substances at the level of the European Union .
That is why we are prepared to accept in principle Amendments 17 and 57 and the related Amendments 30 , 31 34 , 69 , 70 and 71.
Using the term 'groundwater quality standards ' throughout the text clarifies at the same time that , for certain substances , the quality standards in question will be adopted at European Union level and that , for other substances , the standards in question will be adopted by the Member States .
However , greater flexibility cannot mean compromise as far as environmental targets are concerned , and the text must be absolutely clear on this point .
The proposed changes may cause confusion and water down the arrangements which already exist in the Water Framework Directive .
However , acceptance of Amendments 23 and 49 , which propose a new definition and separate system for historical contaminated sites , cannot be supported , given that management of the sites in question does not come within the scope of the present proposal .
Other amendments , including Amendments 38 and 39 , concerning the reference to baseline concentrations and the special assessment of trends in relation to point sources of pollution , are accepted by the Commission .
The Water Framework Directive , the directive on nitrates and the present proposal for a directive on groundwater are complementary and mutually supportive .
I am pleased to say that the Commission is in a position to accept 31 amendments in full and a further 44 amendments in principle or in part .
Mr President , nearly a year has passed since the ten new Member States acceded to the European Union .
Enlargement was prepared properly and I should like to add that the new Member States demonstrated a positive stand , efficiency and dedication during preparations for their accession .
The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament for this important own initiative report .
Allow me to refer briefly to certain points of the report .
In particular , the new Member States have done very well in transposing Community legislation into national law .
They must also make a greater effort to ensure that directives on the internal market are transposed correctly and on time .
This is precisely the approach that guarantees the success of the internal market .
We must not forget that the smooth operation of the internal market is one of the basic preconditions to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives .
This includes the simplification of legislation , in close cooperation with the new Member States and with the old Member States , and providing better information and guidance in connection with consumer rights and the opportunities citizens have to work and establish in an enlarged Union .
I agree absolutely with this assessment , if and insofar as the reference to economic success concerns businesses .
We need radical restructuring and to again make the citizen the centre of interest of the Union ; we need a strategy that focuses on people .
However , the month of May brings to mind another case of genocide by one of Hitler 's predecessors , Κemal Ataturk , who , when he entered Samsun on 19 May 1919 , slaughtered half a million Greek Russians .
I therefore wish to ask you , Mr President , to arrange a day in memory of these Greek Russians and a day in memory of the Armenians .
Although the Commission , as of course the McCartney family understands , cannot intervene in judicial investigations and proceedings by the Member States , it wishes to take this opportunity today to pay homage to the courage , dignity and quest for truth and justice on the part of the McCartney family .
The rule of law is the cornerstone of democracy and fundamental freedoms and the McCartney sisters are fighting not for revenge , but for justice .
The Commission 's initial proposal was designed to update the existing directive , which dates back to 1976 .
Discussions in the Council were held during the Greek , Italian and Irish Presidencies .
The Commission considers that many of the changes made to the common position improve the Commission 's initial proposal .
The current legislation , which is nearly 30 years old , urgently needs updating .
We urgently need a new directive with targeted management practices , more rational monitoring schemes and more effective communication with the public .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , as you will imagine , as a Cypriot I am particularly sensitive on the subject of protecting bathing waters , given that I come from an island .
All European citizens have the right to enjoy the waters of Europe , both coastal and inland , to exercise various
