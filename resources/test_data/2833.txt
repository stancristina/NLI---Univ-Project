bring about a final decision .
It does not have the mechanisms it needs in order to monitor what is happening on the ground in the Member States .
I think we have made significant progress , especially on how we operate .
This establishes a very important basis and will be a huge help with the new proposal on gender equality in all sectors based on Article 13 .
Mr President , local society feels the scourge of unemployment and under-employment most acutely , especially in areas of poor economic growth where , as production is cut back , workers have trouble surviving .
These proposals undermine the labour movement and increase the potential for big business to drive a wedge in , creating artificial divisions and posing false dilemmas .
Mr President , it is clear from what Mr Schmid and the other honourable Members have said that women , the regions and small and medium-sized enterprises will be the forces in the ascendant this century , which is why the Employment Strategy needs to take very serious account of these three factors .
Large conferences were held , one in Strasbourg , attended by delegates from regional authorities , from regional governments throughout Europe , and we have taken account of their views and proposals .
The European Commission can , of course , intervene with all due respect for subsidiarity and the division of powers and I think that we have already achieved important results , as we have said .
This happens via very specific information networks and an effort , which I know has not yet brought in results , to cut as much red tape as possible , since this often places an exceptionally heavy burden on local action plans and local agencies .
Cooperation with agencies , initiatives , civil society , the social partners ; wherever cooperation is needed , it has not taken the form we would have expected .
The Committee on Industry sets great store by respect for core labour standards and considers that the situation can only be improved by maintaining a fairer international trade policy , restricting speculation and reducing foreign debt .
It is in favour of imposing sanctions , especially on transnational companies that profit from failure to observe core labour standards and welcomes the use of the generalised system of preferences .
I have taken the initiative of repeating these points in Amendments Nos 9 to 12 , which I urge you to support .
They contain references to fairer trade relations , the imposition of sanctions on transnational companies that profit from failure to observe core labour standards , the need to respect other labour rights and a specific reference to the movements in Seattle , Genoa and so on .
We need to stress today how important it is for the European Union to exert influence and take initiatives to ensure that ILO conventions are ratified by countries which have not yet done so , core labour standards are observed , social dialogue is consolidated in all the WTO member countries , action is taken against the disgraceful exploitation of child labour and the modern slave trade , a common , integrated immigration and asylum policy is at last introduced and action is taken against the overexploitation of immigrants , which has turned modern society into a society of haves and have-nots .
Global society has lost no time breaking down barriers to trade and even less time setting new standards for global trade and , at the same time , not just averting new regulatory standards on social matters but equating development in third countries with unbridled privatisation and market liberalisation .
Consequently , if we really want to make the ILO a true protagonist on the new world stage , we need an integrated programme .
The previous communication was on local employment planning and , as the interventions by numerous honourable Members have demonstrated , impoverished workers in a third world country can hold workers in a region of Europe hostage .
It is a positive approach which makes use of incentives , cooperation and sustainable development .
This agreement will also cover the Cotonou and ACP accords .
As far as the Member States and individual bilateral or multilateral agreements are concerned , the Commission proposes that the social dimension and social or core labour standards be taken into account in all the relevant sectors of the European Union ( trade , development , foreign relations and social issues ) .
Where the question of cooperation between the Commissioners for Development Aid and Social Affairs is concerned , we already have close collaboration , as the result of which , may I remind you , we had a horizontal action plan on the gender dimension in all the individual projects for all development aid last year , complete with timetables and its own budget .
( EL ) The European Council in Seville added an extra course to the walls around fortress Europe by taking measures to strengthen xenophobia and racism and conceal the cruel liberal policies of the ? U and the Member States , making scapegoats of immigrants and their countries of origin .
These splendid demonstrations , with more broadly-based social groups rallying round to oppose this policy , and a new anti-imperialist , anti-monopoly front will , without any shadow of a doubt , be the workers ' response in their bid to overturn it .
There can be no doubt whatsoever that this bill degrades the basic principles of international law and illustrates the arrogant , martial , world-dominating , imperialist profile of the USA .
Which principles it and the USA applied when setting up the International Criminal Tribunal , which is illegal under the UN Charter , in order to try President Milosevic and anyone else who resisted American and NATO intervention ? 3 .
