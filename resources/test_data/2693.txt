the responsibility for non-implementation to fall to those who have caused it .
For us this is a political need , especially since we believed the promises of reform made by Mr Prodi and his Commissioners and , therefore , we have great hopes for this reform .
Mr President , I will talk exclusively about the issue of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance .
If these lawyer-linguists are not professionalised in the manner proposed by the Court of Justice , we will find that both the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice will be faced with enormous difficulties in terms of retaining this kind of staff .
For next year new posts have been requested for the purposes of preparing for enlargement , which is an objective which nobody calls into question .
With regard to the outstanding commitments for the restructuring of the Moroccan fleet , we would ask the House for them to be included in the budget , in accordance with the approved Resolution .
We have no choice but to sacrifice the intermodality between these latter two alternatives if we do not achieve our priority : to reduce the congestion of the roads .
If we compare these general principles , these solemn declarations , with social reality , with the everyday world we live in , specifically in terms of the achievement of women 's equality in the field of representation amongst the European Union 's social partners , one conclusion immediately springs to mind : there is still much to do .
I believe that the horizontal integration of the gender dimension into the different policies , the action programmes - preferably measures to reconcile work and family life - the efforts of the social agents themselves , training and information , measures to stimulate the participation of women , positive actions and action programmes , are ways to achieve equality and this , in turn , is a means , an instrument , for building a better , fairer and more caring society through social dialogue .
And in those areas where there are more concrete objectives , such as the reduction of poverty , the economic objectives are still not clear .
And , although it is true that there have been agreements , it is also true that it has not been possible to conclude many other agreements .
Then I believe we need to discuss the Brok and Titley Reports - and I congratulate both rapporteurs on their work - and the rest of my group will talk about other subjects .
That is the way that corresponds to the three-stage plan you mentioned .
I ask the Council , here and now , is this not a bad sign ?
Mr President , representatives of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to join previous speakers in expressing my concern over the physical and moral siege that the leader of the Palestinian Authority , Yasser Arafat , is currently experiencing .
It is clear , Mr President , that only on the basis of these premises will the initiatives of the Quartet , a peace conference for the region and the European Union 's desire for peace , understanding , concord and reconciliation prevail in the region .
And it is appropriate that we should talk about commerce , the economy and subjects such as the International Criminal Court , the WTO , Kyoto , etc. , in order to consolidate these alliances .
Madam President , our group supports this joint resolution which first , as other speakers have said , indicates the particular responsibility of the International Monetary Fund for the suffering of the Argentine people and some of the consequences of this situation .
This is not our observation , but that of the Heads of State of Mercosur at their meeting in Asunci√≥n last September .
The signals given to the Commission with regard to giving EUR 200 million and the increase in the Hilton quota are extremely positive , and I believe we must continue to send these positive signals .
I would stress the support of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , first of all , for speeding up negotiations and achieving a new agreement , which certainly meets the planned schedule and , if possible , speeds it up in order to send a positive message with regard to the good will of the European Union in this integration process .
The regional associations are adversely affected and Mercosur is suffering serious problems , preventing it from getting off the ground .
This involves economic , fiscal and financial measures and sacrifices requiring still greater effort for the Argentine people .
The Union and its Member States , however , should adopt drastic measures to kickstart these countries ' economies , which should be covered by the Community budget , and which are not currently included , giving special priority to exports and showing the necessary courage and resolve so that our representatives in the international financial bodies can adopt these measures urgently in order to prevent further delays .
And we hope , of course , that the European Union will not just take account of cold economic factors , but also the cultural and political factors which will provide the conditions for maintaining democracy in that region .
Nevertheless , thanks to technological advances in relation to vehicle engines and catalytic converters , it is possible today to achieve a positive balance in the reduction of CO2 emissions , because those coming from refineries will be less than the reductions in emissions from vehicles using the new fuel .
The mixture of bioethanol with gasoline produces an increase in the volatility of the resulting fuel and in countries with hot summers the pressure limits set at around 10 % may be exceeded during that season
