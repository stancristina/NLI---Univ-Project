More generous family allowances alone will not solve this problem ; on the contrary , what is needed is a comprehensive programme with good opportunities for training and earning , equal pay , more flexible childcare options and better provision for old age – a phase of life in which single women , whether with or without children , are particularly at risk of poverty .
Next comes the Erasmus programme , which gives these pupils the opportunity , once they have become students , to spend part of their course in another European country and to take their achievements there back home with them .
We should put down a marker ; education and training are a vital part of the Lisbon process .
Mr President , let me start by complementing Mrs Pack .
The reason why these EU education programmes are so effective is , after all , because those involved take to them immediately , and because the programmes make language , culture and different educational values visible and can therefore persuade the public of the added value that a European orientation can provide .     .
It is for that reason that Parliament advocates , for ‘Youth in Action’ , an increase in funding and the relaxation of the constraints of the Böge report to EUR 1.128 billion .
I personally would have set greater store by altering the Financial Regulation itself in such a way that one could work , under the ‘Youth in Action ’ programme , with a large number of smaller organisations and smaller grants .
Youth organisations need help not only with the submission of applications – the Youth Forum on its own cannot do it – but also with the disbursement of funds , which is quite crucial , as the young people are waiting for their money .
The reason why my group has raised the figures that the Commission proposed or that have now emerged from the Committee was that we need 10 times as much as we have at present .
All these considerations means that the MEDIA programme will be urgently needed over the next seven years .
Regulation 1774/2002/EC already contains stringent rules on animal by-products ; it is a s prescribing in very precise form the manner in which animal by-products are to be collected , transported , processed and used , specifying , for example , the way in which vehicles and containers are to be disinfected and cleaned .
All I can do , then , is urge that we accept Articles 175 and 95 as a dual legal basis , which is necessary in this instance ; in any other , I would be in favour of a single legal basis , although I would then have to argue the case for Article 95 , which does not fit the bill exactly .
The proposal for a regulation on certain f-gases takes insufficient account of tried , tested and already available developments .
As a fellow-Member of the same group , I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for the outstanding work she has done .
Commissioner McCreevy’s statements in Stockholm were not intended to call into question the Swedish social model , or to attack the Swedish social partners ’ right to determine wages .
In so doing , they have won for themselves the right to become members of the community that is the European Union .
Our response to that , Mr McCreevy , is that your interpretation of Article 49 will not prevail in Europe , at any rate not while the Social Democrats in this House have any say in the matter .
That is something we support , with the proviso that such an intervention fund must not be used for the victims of Commissioner McCreevy’s policies .
Your statement is a calm and matter-of-fact one , and , in that you focus on the protection of poultry generally and not just on the possibility of a pandemic , that will help us all to make progress .
Fifthly , I would like to thank those conservationists , ornithologists and hunters , along with all non-governmental organisations , who have assumed a heavy responsibility for monitoring migratory birds and have passed on their knowledge .
It is for this reason that we will , over the coming months , be addressing this issue with a very great deal of seriousness indeed .
The reforms must now be put into practice without delay .
We had the opportunity for discussions with representatives of the institutions of state , and also with various NGOs .
This is where the opposition , the government and the President need to be singing from the same hymn sheet .
Presupposing that we succeed in persuading our people of how important this enlargement is to the European Union , I hope that we will take the right decision early next year and that we will be able to set 2007 as the date of enlargement .     – Mr President , it is because our political attitudes are often shaped by imagery in constant use that I want to object to the use of the ‘yellow card ’ analogy , which is so frequent nowadays .
There can be no input on the part of the European Union , nor can any kind of discount be given .
What I object to about it is the obsession with different accession dates .
I would like to put a supplementary question : you have already referred to one of the two problems specific to the region , namely energy and the minorities , which brings in its train expulsion , separation and much else .
We do , of course , also expect these countries to give priority to action in relation to democratisation , the rule of law , and the prevention of corruption and many other scourges that currently
