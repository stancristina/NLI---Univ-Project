economy more competitive .
The Commission and the Council will therefore need to strengthen the coordination of economic policies and the convergence of economic performances by improving the procedure for establishing the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States and the Community .
I can cite the failure to promote research and development in the European Union with anything like the required vigour .
These were not endorsed by the Council .
If we want to adopt something better than a few sheets of waste paper , one option , of course , would be to submit a uniform proposal for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , both in terms of emission values and of the deadline .
So I crave the indulgence of Mr Lange and the European Parliament when I say the following to you here .
We merely have certain reservations about particular amendments .
It will be worse for the developing countries because desertification hits them hardest .
Finally , let me emphasize once again how important the task of global environmental protection is for the entire European Union , not only in the domain of development policy , and allow me also to urge the Commission to make this point more emphatically .
From an institutional point of view , what we are now doing has no greater value , metaphorically speaking , than a bluebottle stopping off on a dung heap .
Secondly , we want as much competition as possible , as much monopoly as necessary .
Amendment No 71 to Article 13 is intended to ensure that in areas where competition already exists within the universal service , it is not cancelled out again by a uniform tariff , however rational that may be in other areas .
Mr Bangemann , we can actually understand that the Commission was naturally reluctant to liberalize the postal services at the same time as telecommunications , for we too believe that we should approach the liberalization of the postal services slowly and carefully , and for two reasons .
Private postal services are efficient and public postal services can only operate with subsidies .
Two days ago , I think , a German court decided in the case of a complaint by the German Federal Post Office that remailing cannot be forbidden .
There is no contradiction !
That is not the problem at all .
This needs discussion , but many of the amendments almost totally preclude this competition .
If you do not have that , two things will happen if the use of the services declines : either you will have to set the tariffs so high that it will decline further , and I find that even today the postage rate for letters has reached a level that is simply too high ; or you have to publicly subsidize the services from the national budget and everyone realises today that this will no longer be possible in future .
Let me present the Commission 's conclusions .
Mr Oostlander rightly pointed this out in his report .
The forthcoming European elections in Austria already give cause to fear that one party leader , Haider , will stir up xenophobic feelings of resentment in order to catch more votes .
Above all we must ensure that minorities have equal opportunities , not just so that they can integrate but also on the employment market .
During the planned general review of the regulation and the directive , it should be up to the Member States to fix the financial thresholds for works of art , as it is up to them to classify them as national cultural goods .
The rapporteur herself mentioned that this committee procedure is regarded with some criticism , presumably partly because the European Parliament does not have any chance of participation here .
Here I think the European Community , if it formulates a new foreign and security policy at the Intergovernmental Conference , must take care not to use humanitarian aid as a new means of defining its foreign policy profile at the cost of humanitarian aid .
So it is not a matter of merely producing piecemeal measures but of ensuring that we create a common framework .
In the Maghreb there are two Islamic states which are moderate - Morocco and Tunisia - and one which presents a real danger , because it is a time bomb that has started to tick , and that state is Algeria .
I think I am probably the only one here in Parliament who can say that I made my first visit to the Sahara more than fifty years ago .
They really do deserve it .
But the referendum is also important to us .
Croatia , in our opinion , is pursuing a prudent economic and monetary policy .
The same terms , I submit , must be granted to Romania .
That demand , as Commissioner Van Miert will recall , was very clearly articulated at the conference on Crete in 1994 , where we not only related it to the interior of the European Union but also to our dealings with the states of central and eastern Europe , which had newly achieved their independence and were in the process of developing their own structures .
Going beyond the work of the Conciliation Committee , we naturally also want to develop a financial basis at long last .
This not only harms and endangers the drivers in question but also involves constant subsidization of an environmentally detrimental form of transport .
The licence card is actually intended to facilitate the free movement of European citizens and to promote the mutual recognition of driving licences .
The directive , as we know , is due to enter into force on the first of July this year .
Let us hope that this also contributes to speedy implementation
