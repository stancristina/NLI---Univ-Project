that forced labour still exists in Burma .
Madam President , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , Europe has undergone unprecedented transformation in only the last decade .
Today , instead , the threat to democracy is growing from within the mature democracies themselves .
The need for cooperation has never been greater .
Once we have agreed upon the economic and institutional framework for this historic event , the real negotiations will start .
The issues close to people ' s hearts are in ever clearer focus .
We must act in the interests of the whole of the European Union , ensure transparency and continuity and forge ahead with Europe 's development .
We are going to give priority to three areas of the European Union ' s extensive agenda : enlargement , employment and the environment .
These are three extensive policy areas , each one of which is of crucial importance in determining how the future is going to turn out for Europe ' s citizens .
It is our opportunity to consolidate the basis for peace and freedom , democracy and prosperity in Europe .
An economic framework had already been established in Berlin in the spring of 1999 .
Sweden' s objective is to try to pave the way for a political breakthrough in the negotiations .
If , a breakthrough is to be achieved , however , the applicant countries will have to continue vigorously to implement reforms in order to fulfil the criteria for membership , and the Member States will have to be constructive in helping to take the negotiations forward .
In June 2001 in Gothenburg , the European Council will evaluate the progress made in the enlargement process and provide necessary guidelines for its successful conclusion .
I hope that applicant countries will be able to take part in the elections to the European Parliament in 2004 .
There are still 14 million people in the EU without work .
A European Union that does not take unemployment seriously can never be the citizens ' Europe we all wish to see .
At the same time , it was made clear that full employment was to constitute a basic objective of the Union ' s economic and social policy .
Public finances are strong .
It is also via investment in education and research , new technology and entrepreneurship , as well as investment in the environment and equality between men and women .
The European Council in Stockholm on 23 to 24 March will be the first in a series of spring summits designed to push development towards the goals set in Lisbon .
As the country holding the presidency , we shall endeavour not to undermine the Lisbon strategy by adding too many new issues .
At the same time , mobility is increasing .
Today , development shows that nations which have high levels of employment and well educated populations , which have succeeded in spreading technical development , which have a fair distribution of wealth and comprehensive welfare systems are also those countries which have developed furthest in the new technological sectors .
Demographic changes must be tackled on a broad political front .
As more people obtain work , more and more attention will be focused on working conditions .
As the country holding the presidency , Sweden will actively work to ensure the unqualified success of the introduction of euro notes and coins which is to take place in the currency union at the beginning of 2002 and which is in our common interest .
We must proceed on the basis of a holistic view of policy .
By thinking in terms of recycling and by exploiting new research findings and new technology that saves on resources , it is now fully possible to use the earth ' s resources without exhausting them .
Environmental considerations must be integrated into all areas of EU cooperation .
This strategy should be focused upon a number of key areas in which we at present identify development as being unsustainable , as well as upon measures which can reverse the trend .
Last but definitely not least , the climate issue as it relates to floods , earthquakes and melting ice .
Few matters are as worrying as the risk that environmental damage is on the way to creating far-reaching and dangerous climate changes .
Environmental issues have a deep moral dimension .
Closer cooperation between fairly small groups of Member States is made easier .
For their part , the Member States have already committed themselves to working for a rapid and successful ratification of the new Treaty .
We also have good reason for discussing the way in which the European Union as a whole is structured .
This must take place in cooperation with the Commission and with the involvement of the European Parliament .
I hope that national parliaments and governments will also want to take suitable initiatives .
In the foreseeable future , the challenges for Europe in terms of security policy will be about managing crises and preventing conflicts .
The objective is that the European Union must take a decision to become operational in military and civil terms as soon as possible during 2001 .
Practical objectives will also be devised in order to strengthen the judicial system , civil administration and civil protection .
You have devised valuable proposals , and important debates have been conducted in Parliament .
High priority ought therefore to be given to deeper cooperation between the EU and Russia .
At the same time , our relations must be characterised by candour and consistency , including a readiness to offer criticism when justified .
In a modern democracy , a strong State must be balanced by a strong civil society .
We want to promote Russia ' s integration into the world economy , partly by supporting the country in its endeavours to become a member of the WTO .
