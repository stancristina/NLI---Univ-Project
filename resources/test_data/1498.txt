that tissue and cells are not collected for the purpose of making a profit .
The absolute need for ethical standards should not be questioned , and furthermore , as the rapporteur rightly states in his explanatory statement , many of the amendments containing ethical considerations that have been tabled seek precisely to guarantee a minimum level of health protection .
At the time , the issue at stake was that of forcing the management boards of companies subject to a takeover bid to refrain from adopting defensive measures against the offer or company .
I also believe that the main obstacle to this directive’s adoption in 1989 and 1996 – the effect of takeover bids on employment and their social repercussions in general – must remain at the heart of regulatory concerns .
I therefore agree with the recommendation by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to reject this Commission proposal , even though this is not the position held by the rapporteur .
I wish to emphasise , however , that this decision does not add a single litre of milk to the Azores ’ milk quota and nor does it exempt any producer from fines .
As we have stated , the Members of this House are elected to represent national constituencies .
Hence our vote against the report .     .
We are in the process of drafting the proposal for a directive , presented in January 2002 , on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage , which is particularly important for ensuring better environmental protection and for combating all types of pollution , setting out new principles and proposing new obligations , specifically for companies .
I therefore believe that making operators adopt the necessary measures to prevent imminent threats of environmental damage and to establish compensation mechanisms for damage caused is justified , necessary and useful .
At second reading , some of the original proposals were accepted and whilst the compromise that has been voted on today in the European Parliament does not accept all the proposals that we put forward , it significantly improves the Council position , specifically as regards defining generic medicines , as regards the request for a distinction to be made between advertising and information and as regards the invitation to the Commission to undertake a study of current practices in the field of information , with the aim of improving quality .     .
I welcome the efforts that have been made to establish a Community code for veterinary medicines .
I supported this recommendation for second reading which , by retabling those Parliamentary amendments that were adopted at previous reading and by improving the text of the common position adopted by the Council , better serves the aim of harmonising national legislation in the field of measuring instruments .
I know that road safety is a high-priority task for the European Union , I recognise that this report represents a step towards achieving this Community objective and consequently voted in favour of the report currently before us .
I therefore feel that the European Commission ’s conclusions are , in this last regard , over-hasty .     .
At a time , however , when the road mortality rate remains high , safety measures for all vehicles must be stepped up – not only for light vehicles ( category M1 ) , but also for minibuses and coaches ( categories M2 and M3 ) and light and heavy trucks ( categories N1 , N2 and N3 ) .
This measure does nothing more than minimise the effects of road accidents , however , and I recommend that investment be made in other , genuinely preventive , measures , as a more effective way of reducing the mortality rate on roads , by reducing the number of accidents .
In this difficult balancing act between various interests , account must also be taken of rights acquired by third parties who have purchased items in good faith .
It welcomes the militarisation of the EU.
Like the rapporteur , I believe that the Commission proposal must contribute to the smoother operation of the internal market .
Furthermore , and as regards the timetable for interoperability , I share the rapporteur’s view that this should start on 1 January 2007 , because this date would guarantee sufficient and necessary time for the industry and those managing infrastructures to define and install equipment that meets the new standards .
I must point out that , at the time of the first extension , when I was asked to draw up a report , the presentation was already extremely late .
Consequently , the specific measures intended to promote equality between men and women , women’s independence and their role in the economic , social and environmental spheres make significant contributions as well as being a matter of fairness .
Another point that I would underline is the need to create partnerships .
We must not allow our hand to be forced by a powerful lobby consisting of an increasingly limited group of huge multinationals that market genetically modified crops and which seek to control agriculture and food production against the wishes of European farmers and consumers who , in countless opinion polls , have already expressed their reservations and even fear about genetically modified organisms .
Throughout this debate , however , bearing in mind the opinions presented at the parliamentary hearing , the conclusion we are bound to reach is that contamination cannot really be avoided in the large-scale presence of genetically modified crops , with consequences ranging from the loss of biodiversity to economic damage to conventional and organic farming .
What is obvious in this entire process is that , if coexistence is not possible , the moratorium should remain in place in order to observe the precautionary principle .
