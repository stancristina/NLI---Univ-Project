We must prevent divisions , divisions between the regions of Europe , between the households of Europe and between the individuals of Europe .
Business-to-business communications are doing well but we must enhance communications between business and consumers in the European Union , where we lag behind the United States .
Of course , to do that we have to ensure that people - customers - are convinced of privacy and security , and your measures will help to bring about that confidence .
Business-to-consumer communications are particularly important for the elderly , the housebound and for those with family responsibilities who are finding it difficult to juggle work and career , overwhelmingly women .
There are ethical issues which we must give regard to , but I am very optimistic , and I think that Mrs Read will continue her work alongside you , and we will find in this House many missionaries for the 'e-Europe ' communication .
Mr President , colleagues , not since the spread of universal suffrage in the last century has our society faced such a big potential transfer of power .
The information society has potential to transfer power from government to individual , from bureaucrat to citizen and , of course , from business to consumer .
It opens up a global market place and almost limitless information to anyone with access to a computer screen .
It is the biggest engine to break down barriers between communities and nationalities that we have ever seen - bigger than any EU directive can possibly be .
It offers more power , more choice , lower prices to citizens across Europe and indeed across the world , and in my view the best thing that governments can do in cyberspace is to stay out of it as much as they possibly can and let consumers , businesses and citizens get on with their businesses and their lives .
Legislators cannot keep up with this technology even if they try to .
Technology and industry are better equipped to respond to consumer concerns in what is an immensely competitive market .
It is that competitive market which will ensure that consumers are protected , not heavy-handed legislation which might stunt e-commerce and leave others around the world to reap the benefits of a revolution in our economy which is unparalleled since the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century .
But we all know that we need a base line of government involvement .
We need a basic legislative framework for e-commerce .
I hope it will be a light-touch framework , but we need to drive it through quickly because the e-clock is ticking and there are many organisations around the world fighting for this business .
It is in our interest to make sure that we get the answers and our legislation right , but also to get them through quickly .
We in this House should drive through the e-commerce directive with its country of origin principle as fast as we possibly can .
We should adopt new rules on jurisdiction which trust consumers to make an informed choice about which jurisdiction they want to opt for .
We should drive through the liberalisation of the telecoms package , because it is only with a low-cost competitive telecoms market that we can deliver this power , these low prices and these big opportunities to our consumers , because that is the only way to get low prices for our consumers .
We want to build on Europe 's lead on mobile telephony and adopt the examples of such great global players as Finland 's Nokia .
Member States should build on the IT skills concepts in their schools , but we must do this quickly because if we do not , others will take the prize on offer here , which is dominance in the global e-commerce market .
Mr President , I simply wanted to say that if Mrs Lienemann was so worried it is a pity she did not take part in the debate and make her points to the Commissioner during the debate .
Mr President , if you are going to refer this matter to the Rules of Procedure , could you also ask them to consider the sense of drawing up a resolution weeks before we have the debate with the Commissioner and then voting on it after the Commissioner has made a response which more than overtakes the whole purpose of the resolution .

Mr President , I should like to make a point of order .
We voted on this report in committee , a committee on which all groups are represented .
We dealt with 170 amendments to this report in committee .
We have now been presented with 66 amendments in plenary .
This is not a legislative report .
If the House continues to organise its business in this way we will not only be a laughing-stock but we will fail to get through the very serious business that we have .
We ask the appropriate bodies in this House to
