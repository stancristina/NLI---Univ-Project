a provocation to the President-in-Office : to bring citizens closer to the EU , concrete signals must be sent out .
I was saying that time presses for the digital dividend and I think that we need to use this last part of the parliamentary term to make some progress together , Member States and Europe alike .
In my mind , I think of the successful and happy outcome of the GSM.
One last point , which has been mentioned by several colleagues in addition to the rapporteur , whose work we have all praised , and that is the role of the consumer : the consumer is often relegated to the background , but we want to bring him to the fore and put him in the spotlight because he , I would say , together with business , is the real driving force in the marketplace . rapporteur . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and would just like to draw attention to two points .
Finally , I would like to see a strong European approach .
The opinions adopted by these two committees in fact supplemented and enhanced the proposal , making it more efficient and easier for end users : by these I mean consumers , businesses , trade associations , supervisory authorities and Member States .
Not only is this illogical , given that the same substance presents the same risks no matter where it is , but it is also extremely risky when these products are exported by one country to another and end up being used by people who have no notion of the dangers of the product they are using .
At an international level , I believe that even the fact that REACH is increasingly being used as a benchmark at international level by other countries , which are using it as a model to adapt their own legislation , is extremely satisfying .
I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have contributed today and I would also like to thank them for their words of support for the work that I carried out , which was only possible with their help , and with the help of the shadow rapporteurs and draftsmen of the opinions of the Committees on Industry , Research and Energy and the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
It seems that the vast majority of Members who spoke are satisfied with the results that we achieved .
I am voting in favour of this resolution in the hope that it will bring a swift and peaceful end to this tragic crisis .
This report adds interesting new elements and brings a new approach to the subject ( i .e . the environment as sufficient grounds for adopting restrictive measures ) .
Evidently , the European Union must carry out a political assessment of the sanctions .
I believe that the proposal to identify more homogenous criteria for the sanctions policy comes at the right time .
This is not the case , because of the issue raised in paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Flautre report , namely the cooperation agreements containing clauses and rules that impose respect for human rights .
As a group , we recognise that the 13 amendments tabled , even if adopted , cannot alter the political tone of the report .
In short , we need more cooperation and less unilateral punishment .
These figures appear even more dramatic if we look at the encouraging progress made during the same period by some middle-income countries in Eastern Asia , South East Asia , North America , Latin America and North Africa , which prove that this awful situation can be overcome .
Trade in services also means a knowledge transfer between countries and citizens .
We know how very difficult it is to contact the democratic opposition in Iran .
The Alps , for example , feel the impact of global warming far more acutely than lowland regions .
I hope that the Chamber will give its assent in the same way as the Committee , and I ask the Commissioner to make our case to the Commission and to remind it that the contribution of the inhabitants of mountainous areas is made on behalf of the entire population and benefits them accordingly and should therefore be duly acknowledged .
This is why , when discussing terrorist offences , and the concept of provocation - which is a concept that seems to us both general and subjective - we prefer the legally more consistent and more specific concept of public incitement .
I voted against the proposal to insert a new offence of 'provocation ' or 'public provocation to commit a terrorist offence ' into European law in implementation of the Council of Europe Convention because I believe that the definition put forward by the Commission is too vague and is based on purely subjective elements , jeopardising human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly freedom of expression in Europe .
I would like to call to mind not only the Erika or the Prestige , as mentioned by Mr Sterckx , but - and this is the task that I have set myself for my report on the sector - I would also like to say that we must avoid tragedies such as that of the Princess of the Stars , with 800 deaths in the Philippines , as well as the 'mere ' 4 deaths recorded in the collision between a container ship and a hydrofoil on the Strait of Messina or again the 'mere ' 2 deaths a few days ago among those on La Besogne , which hit a bateau mouche in Paris .
To sum up , there are risks on all waters , and we need to take action on all waters
