Unfortunately , there is still quite a large imbalance in relation to the roads sector .
We have therefore tabled an amendment to the effect that investment in the roads sector should not represent more than a quarter of all investments in transport sector infrastructure so that it will be possible to comply with the guidelines for budget item B5-7 , which deals with trans-European networks .
We also welcome the fact that the Committee accepted our proposal , which is now point 9 , requiring that it should also be possible to use resources available for environmental projects for financing projects designed both to preserve and to carry out assessments of biological diversity .
In addition to these environment-related amendments , we also have an amendment about the need to comply with the additionality principle .
That applies both to citizens down on the floor of the House and to those up in the gallery .
Otherwise , the statistical basis will be fairly meagre and not serve any larger purpose .
It ought , moreover , to be possible for the Union and the Centre to have a role in supervising the domestic production of drugs , as one of the previous speakers mentioned , for we cannot get away from the fact that many of the drugs that are in circulation today , and which young people encounter on the streets , are synthetic drugs , produced in the Union and nowhere else .
It is an aggressive approach I should like to see maintained .
This report has been produced to complement the current regulation concerning the Monitoring Centre .
I myself come from Sweden .
The same applies to cooperation with Norway .
The rapporteur also deals with how the Centre operates at present .
In this regard , there are at present deficiencies when it comes to collecting statistics .
We must obtain relevant and reliable information which can be compared .
Analyses must be carried out of the policies which are applied - different types of policy are pursued in , for example , the Netherlands and Sweden .
The Summit again pointed to the importance of rapid enlargement , yet the candidate States are still looking to the EU to adopt positions from which it is ready to negotiate .
At the same time , it is a question of being clear about how the institutional questions of enlargement towards the east , qualified majority voting and the numbers of commissioners and MEPs are to be solved .
With enlargement , there also comes the demand for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We must show what kind of EU we want .
There is undoubtedly a direct link between the prelude to a new treaty and the actual contents of the treaty .
Both those whose priority is enlargement and those who give priority to a deepening of the Union would then meet with success .
I believe that , in that way , our basic values , which form the uncontroversial part of the Charter , could be used as a lever for enlargement .
The Feira Summit was in many ways an interim meeting prior to the French Presidency .
We are delighted about the formulations concerning enlargement .
Countries are still protecting their positions , and the debate about the EU' s future has only just begun .
It is a welcome and wholly necessary debate .
Our citizens expect something more .
The baton has now been handed over to France .
Mr President , Mr President , the French presidency ' s programme is interesting and in no way devoid of substance .
The idea of a community of values is important , but opinions are divided on how this is to be achieved .
This is an issue to which Mr Cox also referred .
Even in that case , the signals are unclear , which is alarming for the candidate States .
What was the reason for its action ?
I nonetheless have two follow-up questions , because this is a very serious case of a very dubious character from a democratic point of view .
I wonder whether the French presidency believes there is cause for examining this case on the basis of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty .
At this rate , it is doubtful whether we shall meet our December deadline .
If the ICC is to become a reality and to operate effectively , broad international support is required .
I must nonetheless ask the Council if it is planning to take special initiatives to encourage ratification , also by non-EU States .
Mr President , there are three countries outside EMU.
The third country that remains outside EMU, Sweden , has , however , decided to take part in the campaign , despite the fact that it will take place before the referendum and before it is decided whether Sweden will introduce the euro .
Fifty percent of the euro information campaign is financed from EU funds and is to be conducted throughout society , even in schools where it is not usual to carry on one-sided political campaigns , which is what this is .
I also want to appeal to my fellow MEPs here in the House to support Amendments 7 and 12 in the vote tomorrow , as the text of these amendments recommends that the campaign not be conducted in countries that have not decided if they are to be a part of EMU.
( SV ) Mr President , at the Commission 's suggestion , in this hastily inserted item , the Committee on Budgets is now recommending that Parliament approve a donation of EUR 22 million to a fund within the Danube Commission .
The help of the EU is required for this .
One problem is that part of the work will be carried out on Serbian territory , once we have satisfied ourselves that
