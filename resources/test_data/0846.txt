Making policies coherent above all requires a balance to be struck between these two issues .
Obstructing or hampering women’s entry into the labour market is a factor for lower productivity in Europe .
The Lisbon conclusions state that the balanced participation of men and women in professional and family lives , which is in the interest of men as well as of women , is a key factor for progress in society , with maternity , paternity and children’s rights being extremely important social values that must be protected by society , by the Member States and by the European Community .
In conjunction with the social partners , a guide to good practice must be drawn up for companies , which also publicises success stories .
This report also provides a response to the various family associations that sent a petition to Parliament on 15 May last year , on International Day of the Family .
This is a superb report and the motion for a resolution is excellent .
We are a long way from complying with Community decisions , on equal access to work , salaries and promotions , and on promoting rights in the areas of sexual and reproductive health , establishing social support mechanisms for maternity and paternity , crèches and nurseries or structures to support the elderly .
I must highlight , at this juncture , what is happening in Portugal .
Firstly , I wish to state that we really wanted this report to be about the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development , but this is clearly not the case .
We must clarify this concept , which is often abused in international discussions .
This is a matter that I feel , furthermore , should be left to the discretion of each country .
We have replaced nine directives and two regulations and have incorporated a huge amount of case-law in the field of free movement and residency into a single legislative instrument , which has the advantage of providing clearer and more transparent rights for our citizens and for national administrations .
I feel sure that the new provisions of the directive will have a considerable positive impact on the lives of millions of Union citizens currently residing in another country of the European Union and of many other citizens who will in future use the right to freedom of movement .
I thus support the recommendation of the rapporteur , Giacomo Santini , whom I wish to congratulate on his excellent work , to adopt this position in its current form .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur , Arie Oostlander , and congratulate him on his work , which concludes today and is to be welcomed .
I hope that the Irish Presidency is able to adopt this text that we are discussing here today , so that before the end of this parliamentary term , we can conclude the legislative process linked to this framework decision .     Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , drugs are a problem common to all Member States , and there is clearly , therefore , a need for the fight against drugs to be given a European dimension , which we have already seen at work in actions ranging from adopting legal instruments to combat the manufacture and trafficking of drugs , to cooperating with producer countries and promoting measures to prevent drug addiction and to combat this phenomenon .
The definitions used in the framework decision are based on already-existing UN Conventions on the fight against drug trafficking , and cannot be described as particularly tough ; they constitute the lowest achievable common denominator .
Historically , the nature of Schengen cooperation was purely intergovernmental but , with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , responsibility for managing external borders was transferred to the Community .
This is not about creating a European border guard .
It will have a staff of thirty and a budget , initially , of EUR six million in 2005 and EUR ten million in 2006 .
As regards the position of the United Kingdom and of Ireland , the Commission is in favour of including them in a way that enables operational cooperation between the United Kingdom , Ireland and the Schengen States , whilst fully complying with the provisions of the Treaty .
These constitute one of the weakest links in the system , and this has damaging consequences , not only for effectively protecting internal security , particularly as regards the threats of terrorism , illegal immigration networks and the trafficking in human beings , but also for fully implementing the principle of freedom of movement .
This , as a matter of fact , is precisely what the European Parliament had asked for on previous occasions .
I would remind him that the Commission took a very clear position in favour of the concept of a common unit to coordinate operational cooperation among Member States in the control and surveillance of external borders in its communication of May 2002 .
The area of border control is a very sensitive one for national sovereignty .
The criteria and standards vary greatly from one Member State to another .
This Council decision aims to establish a set of information systems that will enable the various European institutions to be kept informed about activities of the fleets of third countries whose practices could be harmful to the maritime interests of Member States , and , most importantly , about the extent to which these fleets may adversely affect the competitiveness of those of Member States taking part in international maritime trade .
This proposal thus gives added impetus to the stabilisation and association process .
This report improves the proposal for a decision , and as such deserves our support .
