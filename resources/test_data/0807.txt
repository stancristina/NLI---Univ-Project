accession process cannot be excluded , although I do not believe that they will jeopardise this process .
The adoption of such a measure demonstrates the consistency of the Hungarian authorities ' initiatives to combat corruption and money-laundering .
As the Copenhagen doctrine established , in the field of freedom , democracy and human rights there can be no exceptions , transition periods or Ã  la carte Europe .
The situation has a considerable socio-economic impact on the candidate countries , entails additional costs and also requires a revision of the financial perspectives in order to ensure that it is not the most badly affected or least developed countries that foot the bill .
Regional development programmes are intended to promote the competitiveness of employment and the creation of conditions that will ensure sustainable development in Europe 's least-favoured regions , in an enlarged Community .
Mr President , since enlargement of the European Union is an undeniable reality , we must also take the opportunity it provides to produce a balance-sheet of the Union 's own policies , given that many inequalities still remain within the Union and that enlargement cannot be allowed to take place at the expense of the poorest members of the current European Union .
The mistake the Commission proposal makes is to suggest that the current model of direct aid should be maintained beyond 2006 .
I feel that the Commission proposal to present 25 % of aid at this stage will be acceptable if this aid is paid out on an objective and horizontal basis - for example , on the basis of farms or of areas - without tying this to specific crops or forms of production .
The Council decision is , consequently , necessary , but to validate tax exemptions and their extension to Canarian regional products , an aspect that is not properly clarified in the Commission proposal .
It seeks to enable regions such as the Canaries , which suffer serious competitive disadvantages in the industrial sector as a consequence of their remoteness , better to integrate and exploit the highly competitive dynamic of the single European market , of Economic and Monetary Union and of globalisation itself .
Should the Canaries depend almost exclusively on tourism-related activities for job and wealth creation ?
This is the only way we will be able to guarantee genuine equality of opportunity for Canarian industrial operators or , rather , for some of them , provided that the tax measures proposed are not universal and systematic .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is one thing we must understand : what we have here are not proposals for tax exemptions for some rich countries at the centre of Europe , such as Luxembourg , for example , which would seriously undermine the balance of the internal market , which would create economic imbalances , and even a concentration of economic activity that in fact benefits no one .
Consequently , recovering around one-third or EUR 4 billion of this tax revenue would be enough to ensure that we easily meet the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact and , not least , balance public finances in 2004 .
Although steps forward and progress in this field ( sufficiently supported by common policies , which would entail various concessions being made ) must be cautious and gradual and this policy must be formalised in accordance with the objectives set for Europe at the Lisbon Summit .
Nevertheless , in the face of a public opinion that cares about protecting nature and of the economic risks created by the collapse of some fish species , fishermen are realising that they must be marine life 's allies and not its enemies .
I wonder whether this is a step in the right direction .
We must , therefore , fight to save the cod !
As the rapporteur points out , the proposal for measures was approved in 2001 , on the basis of the information supplied by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea , even before the drastic reductions of the TACs agreed for 2001 had been implemented .
Incidentally , we hope - and believe we are justified in hoping - that due to Portugal 's unique geographical position and to the extent of our maritime territory , that country will be selected as the seat of this future European Agency .
The issues of whether blood should be given for free and the voluntary nature of blood donations are of fundamental importance .
( PT ) I wish to congratulate Mr Gil-Robles on his report on the election of representatives in the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage .
The Member States must reach agreement on a date for the next European elections which does not coincide with national traditional events or public holidays , in order to optimise the conditions for the turnout in the elections .
This would do nothing to bring the citizens closer to their representatives and would only serve to take seats away from national representations and give them to a more distant set of ' European' personalities ?
An example of the latter would be to broaden the time-frame in which the elections to the European Parliament can be fixed , which would allow some Member States to pencil them in for May .
Hence the way we have voted on certain amendments .
( PT ) I wish to make a brief comment to explain how our vote on this report clearly confirms that we are in no way opposed to the European Research Area , to extending and developing it or to the Sixth Framework Programme in general .
We are left feeling that an opportunity has been missed and we will almost certainly end up with an excessively weighty institution which holds too many votes .
We have kept extremely busy in this field
