, they would deter investment , they would hurt prosperity and , above all , they would increase unemployment in Europe .
She was attacking nothing less than the foundations of western capitalism , the engine which has delivered wealth and success undreamed of by earlier generations .
She said that Europeans are quite "scandalised by untrammelled capitalism , whose relocations , social dumping , ruthless exploitation ... and remorseless pursuit of profit at the expense of working men and women have a direct and traumatic effect on their lives . "
This goes beyond socialism , this is pure Marxism .
It may have been appropriate for the Kremlin in the 1960s but it is totally out of place in 21st century Europe .
It is typical of this Parliament that we call for an end to unemployment yet we promote actions that have the opposite effect .
Her remarks fit this depressing tradition perfectly .
I do not know whether she was speaking for her party , for the Parliament or in a personal capacity but I absolutely reject , repudiate and condemn her remarks and am delighted to have this opportunity of publicly dissociating myself from them .
Mr President , I welcome the fact that the Cairo EU-African summit took place , but I must stress my disappointment that no one from this democratically elected Parliament had the opportunity to address the summit , nor did NGOs have any input .
At the very least , the two Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly could have made statements and this would have given an EU-African balance .
Members of this Parliament , through the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the ACP-EU Joint Assembly , have laid the foundation for many of the policies in the developing countries : the Martens report in 1997 pointing to the benefits of the Lom√© Agreement ; the Rocard report in 1998 strengthening the objectives for the future ; my own report in 1999 on regional cooperation and integration which is top of the Cairo plan of action agenda ; lastly , Mrs Kinnock 's excellent report in 2000 on the future ACP-EU partnership agreement that sets the scene for the next 20 years .
The final Cairo plan of action is an excellent document if we can now turn words and good intentions into concrete actions .
I know debt relief was at the top of the African agenda and everything must be done to alleviate poverty , but we must have some evidence that funds saved go towards better health care , better education and an improved standard of living for people and not into arms and war materials .
For these ideas to come to fruition , African countries themselves have to make the effort towards good governance .
We have already seen some good election results .
Let us hope that we can see the same happening in Zimbabwe , Ivory Coast and Togo in the forthcoming elections .
The top priority of regional cooperation and integration should have strong political benefits as well as trade ones .
With only 6 % of African trade being carried out in Africa there is huge potential for an increase in trade if tariff barriers and trade barriers are removed .
Many of these countries will need both time and financial help to compete in the world market , but these countries must understand there is no other option in this new era of globalisation .
This is all unattainable without peace and peace-building ; conflict prevention , management and resolution must be top of the African agenda .
The OAU must be given international support to continue its work and the peace initiatives must come from the African countries themselves .
Where peace is achieved , help must be given for demobilisation and reintegration , and the use of child soldiers below the age of 18 must be banned .
Ethnic cleansing has been the horror of the last 25 years , and religious wars destroy the very fabric of a country .
Peace can bring prosperity .
The main thrust of our aim therefore must be better education leading to better health care .
Through AIDS and malaria , Africa is losing the very generation it needs to build its future .
This summit was a start but much has to be done to turn words into reality , and we , Members of this House , must be part of that new world .
Mr President , I appreciate that wide-ranging coverage of the issues by Mr Corrie .
I would like to concentrate on my view that poverty eradication in Africa must begin with children and the realisation of children ' s rights .
The Cairo summit will be followed up by another forum in Dakar on basic education .
The need for basic education is the single most important cause of global poverty .
Therefore , we need to ensure that girls in particular have equal access at least to educational advantage .
We can see that education will deliver , it will stimulate the economy , it will offer opportunities to control population and increase health awareness .
Dakar is an opportunity to deliver on internationally agreed targets .
The EU should put its political will behind universal primary education by the year 2015 .
Clearly commitments made a decade ago have not materialised .
Africa is falling deeper into mass illiteracy and poverty and being further marginalised from mainstream developments in the economic and democratic fields .
In sub-Saharan Africa more children are out of school now than a decade ago . 40 million African children today are not attending school .
One third of the classrooms in Africa do not even have a blackboard .
They have no toilets . 70 % of their schools do not have any clean water .
