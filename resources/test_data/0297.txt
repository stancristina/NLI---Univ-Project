I support Amendment No 14 , tabled by Mr Tannock , which upholds the free movement of the heirs to the Italian and Greek thrones and supports the monarchy .
The obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment at an extremely early stage of town and country planning activities does , in fact , make it possible to incorporate environmental concerns fully right from the conception of town and country planning plans and programmes .
The Union has at last realised that we can no longer restrict ourselves to merely picking up the pieces following damage caused by short-sighted planning , but that the damage must be averted as early on as possible .
Madam President , I voted for the recommendation .
Better still , I would like to see an increase in the MEDA regulation ' s financial appropriations .
With regard to Mr Varela' s second report , on the Mauritius fisheries agreement , I did indeed vote in favour , Madam President , but I must emphasise that it was not an easy decision .
Madam President , I voted against the Watson report , as did the whole of the Group of the European People ' s Party , not just because the amendments tabled by the group - of which I have the pleasure of being a member - were not adopted , but also because the pensioners are tired of seeing European Union territory increasingly filling up with third-country nationals who do not have the means to live .
Moreover , it would be appropriate to regulate the television companies of the States of the European Union in order to allow all the political bodies in the different States freedom of expression , for this is not always the case at the moment .
This means that there is definitely something which is not working properly !
However , part of the Commission 's task is to ensure that the benefits generated by competition are not lost and that there are no barriers to innovation in the future .
These include the mobile telephony group , Vodaphone , the recent take-over of Global One and Orange by France Telecom , the combining of the AT&T and BT international activity in the company Concert , and the proposed take-over of Voice Stream in the United States by Deutsche Telekom .
I would also like to touch upon another major risk which we must combat , preventing operators using mergers to gain control of innovation and the new markets .
The Vodaphone/Mannesmann operation caused problems on the emerging pan-European market of seamless mobile telephony services for multinationals .
Mr President , as the examples of the cases of which I have just given a brief outline show , Community competition law plays a crucial role in ensuring that the benefits of liberalisation and innovation do , in effect , filter down to the European citizens .
The resolution was on multimedia , but the telecommunications and multimedia markets are one and the same and I feel that we should exercise extreme caution when intervening in the concentration and restructuring processes taking place in this sector .
For the good of ...
You referred to the outcome of the Commission 's peer group preview .
When companies establish or consolidate a dominant position without proposing the necessary remedies , we have no option but to block a merger and recently did so in a case involving two European companies , Volvo and Scania , which , indeed , are based in the same Member State .
The Commission also resolutely opposes any such legislation in our Member States .
There is nothing else I can add at this stage .
So even though Member States are free to choose either a beauty contest , an auction system or a mixture of both , they must still comply with competition law and the sector-specific telecommunications legislation on licensing and with the state aid rules .
I note that Mrs Villiers urges us to apply competition law toughly .
As to the general effect on employment , I firmly believe that if competition is maintained employment tends to benefit .
I am increasingly convinced that rigorous competition is a key component of a social market economy , be it in the traditional sectors or in the new sectors and - I stress both adjectives - social and market economies .
The democracies of the countries which are going to join the Union are making a huge effort , which we are in constant danger of underestimating .
In particular , the national procedures for ratifying enlargement are purely national issues .
Madam President , President Prodi said ' Public opinion is not sufficiently convinced ' and other Members have said the same thing .
No progress is being made on the matters of the institutional reforms ; most importantly , nothing is being done to make good the commitment we have made in past years to extend enlargement to the countries of southern Europe - I refer to the Delors I and II packages .
Parliament must reiterate what it has declared many times in recent years , including last May .
We cannot allow man to have such great power over his fellow man .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in his speech just now , Mr Fiori made things very clear : he stated clearly that this is a matter of likening religious principles - his own - to the principles of civilisation .
It is my opinion , however , that the responsibility of policy-makers - which may be more difficult , more complex - is to regulate certain issues , set limits and avoid situations out of a western .
The real civilisation of the institutions is the civilisation of secularity , experimentation and discussion .
In our opinion , it is ethically wrong to attempt to alter the nature of the fundamental rules of the origins of life .
We
