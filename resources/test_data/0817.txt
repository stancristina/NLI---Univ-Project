from the people in order to defend and save Humanity , and that will be done essentially by respecting the mother earth , living in harmony with her .
We want to put an end to that .
Thank you very much .     Mr President , a few days ago , this Parliament’s Bureau rejected the use of Catalan and the other co-official languages of the Spanish State between the citizens and this institution , which should be the institution closest to and most representative of their interests .
That Minister insisted that he had been assaulted during that demonstration and , as a result , two People’s Party activists were arrested by officers of the National Police , despite the fact that there was no evidence against them .
I therefore deplore the Bureau’s decision to reject the reasonable use of this language within the context of Parliament’s relations with the citizens .
The important thing is that the fortification be based on scientific criteria and that all of the agri-food industries be subject to the same rules with the least possible bureaucracy .
Education is therefore much more important than any rule we may lay down in an attempt to put an end to obesity .
The rigidity of the Commission ’s proposal , its obfuscation in ignoring the biological behaviour of eels , whose capture is closely linked to lunar phases , and the injustice of seeing fishing as the only cause of the reduction in the eel population , have been replaced by a compromise by the rapporteur .
In conclusion , the report by Mr Maat and the Committee on Fisheries is a balanced and measured consensus report and , in line with what the Commissioner has said , I hope that both he and the Council will take good note of it .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although the continental fishing of eel is not officially subject to the common fisheries policy , we are all aware of the reduction in stocks suffered by this species over recent years , and this could put eel at risk of extinction unless we implement an action plan within the European Union .
Furthermore , since the current knowledge for calculating escape rate is not sufficient and the models currently being investigated within the SLIME project will not be available in the immediate future , the best option is to delay until 2008 the authorisation to fish eel during seasonal bans , as an exception based on a particular management plan .
In this regard , the report by the Committee on Fisheries and the work by the rapporteur , Mr Maat , corrects these two serious problems and they will naturally have our support .
Our real objective was , and remains , to improve the guarantees for the fisheries sector , which is the beneficiary of the Agreement , to ensure compliance with its clauses and to make it operative and viable .
The European Parliament expresses its support for the Agreement but , as I have said , it reserves for itself the task of scrupulously monitoring its application , which is fully in accordance with our duties of control over the Commission , calling for an exhaustive annual report on its application and in particular demanding that we be kept informed of each and every modification introduced into the text ; in particular , we ask to be made aware of any opinions the Commission issues with regard to the possible modification of the Agreement’s exclusivity clause .
That was our difficult commitment and will continue to be so in the future , in order to ensure that the European Parliament conscientiously monitors its application once it has entered into force , in accordance with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries and if the House adopts the report tomorrow , as I hope it will .
Furthermore , the possibility of modifying the technical datasheets remains too open and we would therefore ask that all possible information be communicated and that Members of this Parliament be able to attend the joint committees as observers .
It is not a merely economic agreement , since it is intended to provide for collaboration in terms of the sustainable management of resources and enhanced cooperation .
However much the rapporteur may insist , therefore , we still cannot see any justification for the delay , which we believe to be unnecessary .
The beginning of a new phase of cooperation and dialogue between the Commission and the Kingdom of Morocco has contributed in no small way to the achievement of this Agreement , and I would like to congratulate you and all of your team most warmly .
Nevertheless , the Moroccan authorities ’ hostile and entirely uncooperative attitude to the Western Sahara dispute means that they are very unreliable in this respect .
We therefore encourage you to keep going .
I believe that what we need to do in this debate on the Constitutional Treaty is something similar : to explain to people , with examples , what would be lacking in their lives if there were no European Constitution .
To be honest , it would be more interesting for any citizen to read the first and second parts of the Constitution , which are obviously easier to understand , than this document .
The Commission estimates that , for every euro spent on this programme , six euros will be saved on these external costs .
I would also like to congratulate us , the European Union , on the existence and improvement of this Marco Polo programme , which is achieving effective results through its efficient , although possibly too discreet , work
