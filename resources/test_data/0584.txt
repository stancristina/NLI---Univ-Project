The proposal is perhaps a way of exercising indirect pressure for the borders of the European Union to be fortified .
In other words , the proposal allows entry to the territory of a Member State to be proven on the basis of hypothetical evidence .
We urgently need to implement the Tampere conclusions and devise a common European policy on asylum and immigration based on European humanitarian values and respect for fundamental human rights .
Madam President , I think you are mistaken as the voting list is different .
Whoever votes against , rejects the Finnish proposal and thus gives the Commission the responsibility of presenting a relevant proposal , as represented by the subsequent amendments tabled .
Not only is there no justification for these attacks , they also bear no relation to events in the Basque country , not that there is any justification for those events , but the circumstances are different ; they are merely blind and unacceptable attacks , the basic aim of which is to damage Greece ' s relations with the other countries .
A few days after the Americans expressed their anxiety about security arrangements for the 2004 Olympic Games and just before the police cooperation agreement between Greece and the United States of America was due to be signed .
The Socialist Group happened to be in session when the murder took place and I immediately took the opportunity , from the Socialist Party tribune , of expressing the condemnation of PASOK and of the Greek nation as a whole , which , of course , abhors such acts of terrorism , acts which are directed not only at the victims but at the security and political and economic welfare of Greece .
Madam President , I too should like to express my outright condemnation of the murder of the British military attaché in Athens both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the party which I represent , the Social Democrat Movement .
Madam President , I should like to apprise you and the House of the following incident : last Tuesday , 6 June , I travelled from Brussels to New York in order to attend the UN World Conference on Women .
The travel document which I used was the pass issued to all MEPs by the European Parliament .
I never realised , Madam President , that the special European Parliament pass was not valid for certain members because of their nationality and I spent two trying hours at New York airport until the authorities decided to grant me a visa so that I could attend the UN conference .
Our group shares the concerns about the harmful effects of tobacco and , apart from a few reservations , generally approves the Commission ' s proposals , together with many of the amendments in Mr Ìaaten' s report , although I do not know how effective they will be , especially those which go over the top , as other members have pointed out .
Clearly such a move will not help to reduce smoking because I have not seen any of the members on their high horses proposing a ban on tobacco imports and such a move would therefore merely promote tobacco production in third countries .
In other words , it will upset the investment and production plans based on our decisions , based on the deadline previously granted .
Finally , industry is required to apply the same specifications to export products as it is to those marketed in the European Union , even if the importing countries require no such thing .
Of course , the European Union could try - quite rightly - to impose its specifications on candidate and other countries with which it has close ties , perhaps even on the World Trade Organisation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one cannot fail to notice the confusion - we hope not deliberate confusion - in the report by the Committee on the Environment , which is turning the campaign against smoking into a campaign against tobacco producers .
Consequently , measures to reduce tobacco production will do nothing to reduce consumption ; they will merely boost imports .
Secondly , we are also categorically opposed to Amendment No 21 in the report , which abolishes the European Commission ' s proposal to extend the date of application for tar yields by Greece to the end of 2006 .
It is our duty to promote health through a public awareness , information and behaviour modification programme , especially for the most easily swayed section of the population , i .e . the young .
As far as the form and content of the message are concerned , it is important that it should be clear , comprehensible and brief if it is to be noticed at once , and we therefore consider it imperative to increase the surface area covered .
I think that a fundamental study of the financial and social fallout is needed if we are to avoid hitting tobacco producers .
To start with , I shall not endorse the attempt by certain members to use this act to stop production aids for tobacco because , as you know , first of all , the European Union has a deficit and imports tobacco from abroad and , consequently , the only outcome would be to penalise poor Greek farmers and benefit producers of imported tobacco .
On the contrary , I should like to see a logical programme which will really help tobacco producers to gradually restructure their crops and they cannot do so overnight .
It is wrong ; we need to be consistent and coherent .
The aim of the European Union ' s policy in the telecommunications sector is to fully liberalise the markets
