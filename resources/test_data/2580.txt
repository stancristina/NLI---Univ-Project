It goes further than this though .
It has been some time coming , but with this result , there is a good chance of an agreement at first reading .
I should also like to give Mrs Kroes credit for what she has done , because , as Mrs Ber√®s said a moment ago with very good reason , competition policy is not an end in itself , and I think that the European Commission , precisely under the guidance of Mrs Kroes , has launched a new pragmatic approach , something which we greatly appreciate .
At the same time , I have noticed that , whilst the leaders of the national governments are saying that we should have a common energy policy , they are not prepared to stop protecting their national favourites .
It has surprised me enormously why it has taken so long before we managed to strike this compromise with the Council and Commission , because we in this House had to do a huge amount of work to reach this compromise .
I should like to mention the other side of the coin , though .
This is an issue , the religious foundations of Hamas , which Mr Schulz ought to read up on some time .
The development agenda is running way behind schedule .
It must be clear where the monies end up .
A certain level of protection for patents of intellectual property rights is needed for this .
Over the past seven and a half years , people have worked hard on realising these goals , and a number of great successes have been achieved .
Too many people , despite all the growth and progress , are still deprived of basic social needs .
First of all , by placing centre-stage not only the victims , but also the successes , including , for example , the end of the wars , in Mozambique among other places , not to mention top African diplomats such as Kofi Annan , fashion houses from Abuja , wine farmers from South Africa , pilots from Ghana , top football players from across Africa and female ICT entrepreneurs .
You are right , Commissioner , MDG contracts are a good way of achieving this .
The format of this parliamentary delegation remains special and unique .
It is also good to see that it appears increasingly possible to broach sensitive issues , such as corruption or worrying situations , including those in the Horn of Africa and Sudan .
Zimbabwe remains a thorny issue .
I particularly regret the fact that the Oomen-Ruijten report excludes the proposal of portability of pension rights from the directive .
Last year , my resolution on racism in football met with overwhelming support in this House , and I hope that this will also be the case for Mrs Roure 's report tomorrow .
Europe is there for everyone , and we should , above all , keep it this way . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , first of all I would like to pay my compliments to Martine Roure , who has once again done a great job .
I very much concur with Mr Gaubert , who made reference to statements by people in public .
That is another problem : we allow these extremists to set the political agenda .
We should therefore try to set up a better asylum procedure and at the same time take measures to distinguish asylum seekers from illegal immigrants as a matter of relevant urgency .
Can the sources of information from countries that are unsafe be made public ?
Mr Catania has tabled an amendment in which he pleads in favour of open reception centres for asylum seekers and other immigrants .
I find that distasteful : it has nothing to do with PNR.
I am not a lawyer , but that strikes me as distinctly funny .
This House may not have competences any more , but the national parliaments are completely excluded .
Finally , I would like to recommend that the PPE-DE Group support the joint motion for a resolution that we will negotiate tomorrow , read the agreement very carefully and read between the lines , because it is not as good as it looks . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , this is the third agreement we are discussing in this Parliament on the transfer of passenger data to the United States , and things are not getting any better .
On two occasions , the Americans have moved this proposal , and you have had to negotiate once again with a view to them simply delivering on their own promises .
This , in turn , can lead to reduced intelligence .
I therefore agree with the producers of barometers that the use of mercury in low-energy light bulbs is , of course , also very harmful .
In January , the committee for the subsidiarity test of the Dutch Parliament drew my attention to this very subject .
They expect a reduction in the powers that are already being exercised by the Commission anyway and better parliamentary control of the application of the remaining powers .
This was also true of the brewery agreements .
As the current excise straddle between the Member States and the existing competitive distortions will persist without any sign of let-up , I supported rapporteur Lulling in her no-vote . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , for many years , everyone has been saying that , in relation to the transport of goods in all European countries , rail is losing the battle .
As many companies had their own connections to the railway network , goods carriages were able to shuttle directly between a harbour quay and a remote company without any interim transhipment of goods .
In
