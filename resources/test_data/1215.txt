President , Commissioner , the rapporteur , Mr Turmes , has , in his own inimitable manner , produced a thorough report , this time on a strategy for the use of renewable energies .
When we speak of renewable biofuels and the cultivation of energy crops , it must be realised that energy production competes with food production for the same area of land .
That is the way the market mechanisms work .
While following the Greens ’ energy strategy – and Mr Turmes is a Green – I have noticed that there is a hostile attitude to research into the use of fusion energy .
That , however , cannot be allowed to happen at the expense of research into nuclear fusion .
We are faced with problems , and solving them will rely on the coordination of population growth , food production and renewable energy production .     .
Furthermore it would be a fair assessment to say that the Roma community is in a very disadvantaged position in Kosovo .
At the same time , we do not target forced returnees specifically .
The second question concerns the issue of whether the principle of non-refoulement is being fully respected in the event of the forcible repatriation of Roma refugees to Kosovo .
The ultimate administrative responsibility falls to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo , UNMIK , as well as to the European Union Member States that have decided to forcibly return members of the Roma community to Kosovo .
As far as the Commission is aware , the agreement between UNMIK and the German government on forced returns concerns the Ashkali and Egyptian minorities only , and not the Roma and other minority groups .
This chapter contains a section on minorities and minority protection in candidate and potential candidate countries , including the Western Balkan countries .
Of course we will very carefully study what Ambassador Kia Eide will present in his standard report on Kosovo , which is due in a few weeks .
This will concern the implementation of the decentralisation measures and the critical issue of minority protection .
Mr President , thank you for those remarks , of which I have taken due note .
There are three camps of internally displaced persons in northern Mitrovica for Roma Ashkali and Egyptian people .
An agreement was signed in April 2005 by UNMIK , UNHCR , OSCE and the President of the Mitrovica Municipal Assembly , creating a framework for the return of former residents of the Roma Mahala to their homes in southern Mitrovica .
We will continue to raise this issue on the ground through our EU liaison office and the European Agency for Reconstruction , which works in that area .
I would also like to respond to Mr Posselt 's question concerning minority rights in different countries , in the EU , in accession countries and in our partner countries .
The minimum rights of minorities are set out in the relevant documents of the Council of Europe and the Convention on Human Rights .
Nevertheless , we must practice what we preach when we are dealing with our partners , whether they are accession countries or countries in the wider world .
In my view , human rights in general and the rights of minorities are at the heart of the European idea and of the European Union .
The level of unemployment depends on which statistics you look at .
However , it is at least 40 % and often more than 50 % , and the situation on the ground is extremely difficult .
Therefore it is high time to move from stability and reconstruction towards defining the status and working for economic and social development and for the real needs of citizens .
That is important because it enables us to open the negotiations on the stabilisation and accession agreement around the fifth anniversary of the democratic transition in Belgrade and , moreover , because it will make Serbia and Montenegro 's European prospects concrete and tangible and will also pave the way for a genuine dialogue on Kosovo and a resolution of the question of its status without undue and unnecessary delays .     .
It is a question and a test of how we value human life .
There are about 50 000 deaths per year , about 2 million people are injured .
It is the main cause of death in the under-50s age group .
But that is only money .
It is because it is not the Concorde which crashes , it is not the pride of the UK and France which crashes .
But when it comes to traffic safety , it is just one family crying here , another family crying there .
You have to live with it .
And perhaps only those people who have experienced that know what the grief of a family means .
I remember him leaning against the steering wheel , that anxiety in my chest .
First of all law enforcement .
When more radars appeared on French roads , immediately fatalities came down .
There are incredible discrepancies between different States .
It is up to eight times safer in the UK or in Sweden than in some of the new Member States - eight times - imagine that incredible diversity !
From now on we must carry out a systematic scrutiny of what is going from country to country .
If we make mistakes , why should those mistakes be made in those countries which are still on the road to development ?
When people have been woken up they will demand action from the politicians in their various Member States .
That should be stopped , because it is downright dangerous .
We must invest more money in infrastructure .
Europeans are mobile thanks to the European road network .
Yet things are not so bleak
