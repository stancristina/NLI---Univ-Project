However , it is not just a question of a counterweight , but also a matter of achieving an economic government able to extract the full potential of the new panorama being created with the introduction of the single currency .
In contrast to what some people might think , this sector is neither in crisis nor headed towards extinction .
So I beg the Council to think again and take account of the opinions of this Parliament .
It is a matter of providing it with a series of mechanisms to guarantee its competitiveness in an open market which is becoming increasingly competitive in the global economy in which we operate .
And it is delicate because of its disheartening statistics .
The entry into effect of the second phase of the WTO textile agreement is particularly important , since it opens the way for a greater liberalization of the market .
Mr President , 30 years ago the then European Economic Community realized that increased international trade meant that the Member States of that Community had to reach a convention to determine competence and how to implement sentences in contractual matters .
The Council is not here for this debate , so I do not have to make any very profound remarks to try to convince them of the value of our amendments .
Mr President , the amendments are certainly not an attempt to change the convention .
Mr President , we are all familiar with the difficult situations people find themselves in when they become the victim of separation , divorce or annulment lawsuits , if they are the respondent and do not share the nationality or residence rights of the plaintiff .
However , it would have been better to have been more ambitious in this case , not just clarifying things but extending the scope , to include for example the financial obligation between marriage partners , and between them and their children .
The reports by Mr Spencer , Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler and Mr Pimenta on a different occasion , as previously debated in this Parliament , all repeated the same questions as this one .
There is no piracy here : we are dealing with the protection of certain economic interests .
I want to congratulate the rapporteur for being so understanding during discussions on this subject , because I think the 20 or so amendments which have finally been adopted are reasonable and balanced .
Madam President , as the rapporteur rightly said , we are faced with a Commission proposal which we in this Parliament see as a response to a resolution passed in this House .
It is true that the title of the proposal should have specified that it refers to remunerated encoded services .
That could give rise to greater differences , if that were possible , in the very matter we are trying to harmonize .
In Spain the figure is 8 % because that country has made a great effort .
Obviously , that includes photovoltaic energy .
In any case , Mr Commissioner , we support the ALTENER programme .
Mr President , I have requested the floor because the President cannot congratulate the rapporteur in this case , so I want to do so on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
In addition , there is no doubt that citizens will psychologically see the euro as a key element of European unity , an element which is much more striking than the existing symbols and common institutions and , in the medium term , this could mean the acceptance of and even the demand for political union .
It is not unlikely that rivalry between the dollar and the euro may arise in Europe with the loss of jobs and a decrease in salaries for the sake of false competitiveness .
Let us remember the need to increase the Community budget in order to have the capacity to counteract the regional imbalances that the market and the single currency can generate .
The future belongs to everyone and together we must all share fully in the European Union .
Therefore , we have every reason to congratulate ourselves on the fact that we have moved to a new stage in the construction of Europe .
Tomorrow - and I am using your words , Mr President - our citizens will feel Europe in their pockets , and it is our responsibility , and an important one , to ensure that the currency - the tangible expression of the united Europe - has the necessary credibility , stability and sturdiness that it needs and that we desire for Europe .
But the euro , and with it monetary union , is also , and above all , a symbol of European unity ; hence the historic nature of today 's sitting .
The euro gives us access to a positive scenario of competitiveness , but forces us to keep a watchful eye on those who may have more difficulties .
In the same way , we have been extremely critical of the content of the Stability Pact , which implies higher unemployment and a precarious welfare state .
When I finally arrived in Strasbourg - which is an enchanting city and the headquarters of this Parliament - I was so tired I felt like I had travelled to India .
ETA also murdered a sub-lieutenant in the civil guard , Alfonso Parada .
In the face of the murderer 's fascist irrationality , we are affirming once again the principles which form the basis for the construction of the European Union : democratic coexistence , respect for minorities , and the recognition of the wishes of the majority .
Mr President , it is my honour to present , on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities , this report on the Portuguese
