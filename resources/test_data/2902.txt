it was not the result of our own action , whereas Parliament can and does make itself heard when it wants to .
I feel , Commissioner , that there have been very few situations or events in which many , very many of our fellow citizens have for the first time felt that Europe is genuinely close to them , that it is truly an elder brother ready to run to their aid when they are in difficulties .
Soon , there will be 25 Member States , and it is quite clear that the climate is changing .
Mr President , I will be very brief , for we have discussed this report at length , and just highlight new points which have emerged from a very heated debate in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
We are opposed to Amendment No 1 , tabled by Mrs Sch√∂rling , which was only endorsed by the Committee on the Environment by a very small majority and which states that 'the Commission should extend the ban on substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic to reproduction ...to products ... ' .
I think the different groups in the House will agree to this .
With this result under our belts , we can embark even more confidently on the final stretch of the road to Copenhagen and final endorsement of enlargement .
As the Italian Prime Minister who promoted and approved the Stability and Growth Pact and led the country into the single currency , and now as President of the Commission , I am a committed , firm believer in the value of the rules that underpin Economic and Monetary Union and the Stability and Growth Pact .
I am a staunch defender of these rules , this Union and this Pact .
Stability is the prerequisite for growth and employment in Economic and Monetary Union .
It is therefore time that we started to say in public what we say amongst ourselves in private .
At the same time , we realised that the Pact had not prevented some Member States from adopting fiscal policies incompatible with the objective of stability .
What a tragedy it would be if , in our endeavours to win the stability battle , we lost the trust and backing of our citizens , the trust and backing that are the foundations of the European democracy you represent .
Last year , in our communication on strengthening the coordination of economic policies , we proposed a number of major improvements within the present institutional framework .
New and better rules are not enough , however .
I want to make this point even clearer .
As you will all remember , the proposal was not taken up , despite the fact that both the Council and the Member State directly concerned agreed on the substance of the Commission 's proposed measure and , in fact , appropriated it .
We therefore call upon the Council to consider these proposals as a matter of urgency .
The need , which I fully endorse , for flexible application of the Stability and Growth Pact and for coordination of economic , social and environmental policies , starting with the eurozone , has , however , been completely disregarded during the recent years of recession , not least because of the serious forecasting errors made by the European Commission and the European Central Bank , which actually discouraged any attempts to promote or coordinate an active , counter-cyclical economic policy shared by the Union 's governments .
It has a single currency but it does not have a genuine federal budget .
This is why the European People 's Party will , through its members taking part in the Convention , acting in accordance with the mandate they received at the recent Estoril Congress , propose that the Convention should constitutionalise the basic principles of the Stability and Growth Pact .
As a result , we will be in danger of breaking the code of Community living - and that really would be stupid - if we do not employ the political astuteness which we need to foresee disagreements and tension and to avoid a situation where we have to stand by , powerless , until the time comes to clamp down , with the risk , as we have heard , that the Member States will indulge in bargaining .
Indeed , we share a single currency , and this means that we cannot devalue , it means that we cannot vary interest rates , it means that we really are tied to a system which is strong and rigid in many respects .
Well then , if we want this system to work , we must establish an authoritative institution to help us coordinate economic policy headings .
We have to have instruments , we have to use politics , we have to use the spirit of the law if we are to interpret our people 's problems .
In the past , I have even had the courage to impose a Europe tax on my country - specifically labelled a Europe tax - because I feel that the citizens have to be given clear , accurate information .
My apologies to the academics , but I believe that this has served to show all of us what we must do in the future .
Therefore , unless amendments are adopted which make substantial changes to the text , particularly with a view to reducing the scope of the definition of 'family member ' in the context of the right of family reunification , my group will vote against the motion .
It must be one of the bases for the conversion of the pillar structure of the Union to a Community structure
