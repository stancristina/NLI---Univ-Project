Prejudice and stereotyping are widespread and is it any wonder that people who come from minority groups whether black , gay , physically handicapped or whatever face discrimination and unfair treatment when a majority group , women , also face such discrimination .
That is why our Group supports positive action and only when women are fairly represented in positions of decision making will men also be fairly represented .
We might also then develop a culture where your paid and unpaid work , your pay packet , your parental leave and your pension are not determined by your sex .
- I , together with my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation , am totally committed to the need to have more women playing a full and active part in public life .
We share in all expressions of regret that there remains inequality and gender discrimination and especially under-representation of women in politics .
However , we are not convinced that one form of discrimination should be countered with another form of discrimination , namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee women elected places .
I feel this especially keenly as only on Tuesday evening of this week my 27-year-old daughter , Caroline , was selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for the Southampton Itchen constituency in the United Kingdom .
She achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against all-comers .
We should not adopt a position that in any way detracts from the position of the increasing number of women who are demonstrating that without fear or favour they can earn their place in public life .
For this reason members of my delegation have supported much of the resolution but we registered our opposition to those calls for positive discrimination in favour of women , which we think is the wrong way to make progress , is itself demeaning to women and distorts the democratic process and we have therefore abstained in the final vote .
Katiforis report ( A5-0041/2000 )
Mr President , the European leaders will be primarily addressing three key issues when they meet in Portugal later this month .
Firstly , they will examine how best the European Union should equip itself to accommodate the broader effects of trade globalisation .
Secondly , a closer examination will take place as to what initiatives should be implemented to avoid and combat social exclusion in our society .
Thirdly , the leaders will bring forward new programmes to guarantee that the European Union is a leader across all elements of the changing and evolving information technology markets .
The world is becoming a smaller place in terms of market access and the term "global village " is not out of place .
However , the arrival of globalisation will not and must not mean absolute and free market access for all products and services operating at this time .
It is clear that each country has different priorities in terms of the different economic sectors it wishes to protect .
That is clear from the completed Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and will be evident in the World Trade Organisation talks which will be taking place over the next three years .
From the perspective of the European Union it is important that the deal secured by our leaders in Berlin last year , and endorsed by Parliament in terms of the future administration of the CAP for the period 2000-2006 , is not reopened in any shape or form .
Moreover , initiatives to promote cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe must continue to receive support .
We must not build a Europe of the haves and the have-nots .
The European Union as an economic entity is very strong but there are still large-scale social problems which need to be addressed in a structured manner .
We must continue to put in place comprehensive training programmes for the youth and long-term unemployed in both urban and rural areas within Europe .
The European Social Fund and national governments must continue to finance drug rehabilitation programmes , to promote higher standards of adult literacy and to work against early school-leaving .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Gut√≠errez for his speech tonight and also for his Lisbon initiative , which is very important to us .
If we are honest , we must admit that it has been a very long road from Luxembourg to Lisbon , and that really now we are looking for concrete achievements , for something to genuinely come out of this Lisbon Summit .
We have a lot of Europeans in the gallery here with us this evening and I wonder what they make of our discussion here this evening .
I would like them to take away with them this evening the idea that the institutions of the European Union are now embarked upon a genuine process , which will lead to full employment once again in the European Union .
There are many challenges involved with creating that full employment .
Some of those challenges will be very difficult to overcome , but the important thing is that we have to turn the rhetoric of what we have been saying for many , many years - about full employment , about a socially inclusive society , about a society that is based on innovation and knowledge - into reality .
This is the great challenge , the great importance of Lisbon .
I just want to dwell on one or two key aspects that will help us realise that goal of turning rhetoric into reality .
Firstly , there is the commitment to having genuine benchmarks , a genuine process of peer review , to the setting of targets , of genuine targets that we can achieve , to governments agreeing to embark upon what is quite a brave process of saying : 'yes
