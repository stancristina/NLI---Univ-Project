The technology required for solving the cadmium issue already exists .
The proposals concerning the sulphur content in fuels have for example not been included in the AUTO-OIL programme , nor does the fifth programme of action regarding the environment meet requirements .
The Commissioner also mentioned in her speech that she is of the opinion that legislation in the new Member States should definitely not be diluted .
But I would like to see realistic regulations in the form of a realistic schedule .
It should also be enough for a Member State to express the wish to maintain a higher standard of environmental legislation for this to be possible .
We should in other words make every effort to ensure that a more stringent legislation is feasible .
In the AUTO-OIL programme for example , accepted by the Commission a couple of weeks ago , the permissible benzene content in petrol is set at two percent .
This kind of example , of which there are several as we have heard here today , undermines the credibility of the Commission 's role .
The Commission should immediately draw up a plan showing how it intends to fulfil its promises .
Madam President , having heard the Commissioner 's reply , we should seriously ask ourselves what will happen at the beginning of 1999 if this re-assessment fails .
If we want to prevent a succession of court decisions weakening environmental protection in the new Member States , the relation between free movement of goods and environmental protection should be revised at the intergovernmental conference , as has been pointed out today .
It is not very professional to go behind the backs of the Council .
Mr President , the severe employment , or rather unemployment situation in Europe has created a general interest in supporting the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises .
The same applies to our position at the national , provincial and local level .
I however believe that networking and the availability of information will for example increase the knowledge of business culture in new Member States .
From the point of view of developing internal markets , particularly in the high-tec sector , small and medium-sized companies are of great importance .
It goes without saying that small companies require &#x02BC ;soft ' finance and that the need for risk financing is particularly great at present .
After all one billion ecu is not a lot of money .
The price of money is one problem , and another problem is that the guarantees are inadequate .
In this connection I would like to describe briefly the situation in my own country by giving you a practical example .
One alternative is of course mobility of labour , which however also causes social problems .
Last year this company 's loss due to currency fluctuations was greater than its net profit , which illustrates the dilemma .
The culture of late payment in the rest of Europe is another major problem for these companies .
If these innovative engineers are having to face currency and financing problems , they lose sight of the main objective , and suddenly they are no longer designing raw material and energy-saving ships which could improve European competitiveness .
Mr President , I would like to express a few thoughts on the views put forward in Mrs Ewing 's report .
In this respect the Green Group has tabled an amendment to Mrs Ewing 's report , which emphasizes that the Commission should look into those sectors of business where the support system has succeeded in creating more jobs .
They are flexible and perhaps provide an opportunity to provide support to a greater variety of companies than would be achieved with direct support .
In connection with this I would like to bring up a slightly difficult , sensitive matter , that we should also encourage investigations into how support to companies may distort competition and hinder the activities of healthier companies .
I know that in some business circles there is a desire to cut back on direct support and perhaps give companies support from the community for example in the form of tax reliefs .
In general , however , the problem is that when market forces are given free rein and when the economy is deregulated the consequences are not necessarily clear at the time when decisions are taken .
The Green Group as well fully supports Mr Langen 's conclusion that the Commission should submit a fresh proposal to Parliament .
Moreover , extremely large sums of money are involved : in the context of this agreement , some ECU 350 bn . will change hands around the world each year which will certainly create opportunities for the European Union , but the strict application of the principle of reciprocity is called for , and for that reason , I endorse the previous speaker 's call for a little more time and a little greater clarity .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Piecyk , and the chairman of the conciliation committee for their efforts in securing a satisfactory outcome .
I endorse the conciliation committee 's decision to approve also Finland 's route 5 , the lifeline for the whole of Eastern Finland .
Fortunately , the Finnish Government at least understood that it should jump on the bandwagon , although once again independent action was beyond it .
Mr President , in this connection I should like to thank Mr Piecyk and the other Members who have succeeded in achieving this compromise .
The development of the trans-European transport networks is essential because the networks will further European integration and boost employment .
All the important parts of the network , from the point of view of our country , have been incorporated into the proposal .
We thank Parliament for its understanding of our
