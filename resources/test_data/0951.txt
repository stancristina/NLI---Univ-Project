That is not to mention the significant cuts in funding that the Competitiveness and Innovation framework Programme is almost certain to suffer because of what I regard as the Member States’ miserliness over the Union’s budget .
The situation in the Middle East is constantly changing .
From that point of view , I see it as a positive development that Hamas candidates have signed the code of conduct , even though there remains a general feeling of concern at the climate of violence in which the elections will take place , particularly in Gaza .
That is the commitment I call on Parliament and the Union to undertake .     .
Firstly , by emphasising the statistic that has changed our approach to assessing the data .
For that reason , we will be voting in favour of this resolution in the hope that , with the involvement of all the Community and national institutions and of the representatives of civil society and the academic world , we can quickly arrive at a new and perhaps simplified text , but one that is endowed with a common soul with which all Europeans can identify themselves .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my speech is going to be really simple , very brief and not at all exciting : I should like to say that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to add its signature to the resolution on Cuba .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Europeans we have to respect the outcome of the free vote in Palestine and encourage those elected to form a government that chooses the path of negotiation , recognises Israel and renounces violence , as President Abu Mazen himself has indicated .
I believe that Israel should put a stop to the settlements and avoid taking any steps to annex East Jerusalem .
I believe , however , that the failure to publish the report on East Jerusalem – which in actual fact is the focus of the debate – and the failure to adopt appropriate measures effectively gave Hamas a helping hand , because there is no doubt that certain truths should not be left unspoken .
In my view , it really is the European Commission ’s and the international community’s task to rekindle the dialogue and to keep it alive , thus ensuring that both Hamas and Israel can put a stop to violence and acknowledge the ‘two peoples , two states ’ principle in practice .     – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe must have a basic goal for establishing peace in the Middle East and for combating terrorism , including by political means .
That goal is to guarantee both the existence and security of Israel and the creation of a Palestinian state .
If Hamas chooses the path of intolerance , it will cause its people great harm and have a negative effect on the outcome of the Israeli elections .
Cutting off funding to the Palestinian Authority is therefore not the solution .
I am also the youngest Member in this House , and in my heart and mind I share the aspirations of Cubans of my age , who want to be able to look forward with optimism to a country that is at last more open , more modern and more just .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the resolution on the adoption of management measures for Mediterranean fishery resources , which we shall put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow , is of great economic , social and environmental importance .
We therefore hope that this resolution will lead the Council – whom we respect and trust – to send out the long-awaited signal as soon as possible .     – Mr President , during the debate on the sustainable exploitation of Mediterranean fishery resources , I said that the compromise reached by Parliament and the Commission may not have filled us with too much enthusiasm , but that it was undoubtedly an improvement over the initial proposal .
I particularly welcome the report before us because it addresses the main areas that Europe’s institutions need to tackle .
The Commission is working on that and , in collaboration with Eurostat , has set up a European system of statistics on crime and criminal justice : violence against women is , of course , one of the areas on which we shall very soon publish statistics calculated from the measures and the data that the Member States make available to us .
Mr Ferber’s report on the implementation of the postal directive is well-balanced : it underlines the positive effects of the liberalisation undertaken so far , but it also points out the need to assess the social and employment consequences of a further stage in the completion of the internal market , taking account of the particular situations in individual countries .
It is a task on which I do not always agree , even though I believe that , when it comes to increasing safety in the interest of Europeans , we need to be able to reach a compromise .
If no action is taken , then we are in danger of starting a process that in the end cannot be carried through .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like simply to highlight some formal and substantive errors with regard to the translation of the Italian text .
Obviously , the most moving case was that of Don Andrea , an Italian missionary murdered in Trabzon , Turkey .
We are talking here about an instrument that can tie in with the cohesion measures and release entrepreneurial potential in some particularly disadvantaged areas .
To this end ,
