and Citizen 's Rights , even though it has not yet stated its views officially .
Thank you for your answer , Commissioner .
I would repeat that even if we were to give these small farmers an opportunity to grow different crops , that is no reason to expect people in Europe to smoke less .
Perhaps I might add that certain programmes are being implemented on a continuing basis : there are , for example , the Structural Fund resources , which can be used to assist Objective 5b or 5a areas , and which could be applied to support the restructuring of the rendering industry in the United Kingdom , for instance , or to promote investment .
The figures which you have given tally exactly with my own figures .
In effect , this means that we now have a blueprint for the future , and it is now up to the British Government - and of course the industry in Britain - to see how rapidly they can adapt their procedures so as to meet the requirements for safe production and enable these inspections to be carried out .
That means devising a system which will serve two purposes : on the one hand , free access to the profession must be guaranteed , in any country of the European Union ; and , on the other , a lawyer must have sufficient knowledge of the legal system concerned to ensure that clients and companies receive the best possible advice .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when Ronald Reagan launched his Strategic Defence Initiative - known as 'Star Wars ' - in the early 1980s , the general reaction was to regard it as a piece of science fiction .
Unfortunately , however , the Member States of the European Union were caught napping again at the ITU conference in Geneva last year , and allowed Bill Gates and his new company to reserve all the frequencies in individual countries throughout the world for data transmission through a system of 840 orbiting satellites .
I think it is clear that the Commission has consciously chosen not to make a sharp distinction between satellite-based personal communications on the one hand and broadband multimedia services on the other , in order to have an instrument that will allow it effective involvement in selection decisions in the latter area .
That is certainly not what we are doing , and the selection procedure , which has attracted various comments in the debate , must definitely not be the norm .
I will leave it to the House to decide whether or not that is a compliment .
On the basis of such a regulation or proposal , negotiations could go on forever and I think that cannot be in our interest .
However , we believe that their inclusion here would require the House to consider every change in detail , and we do not have the time .
What exactly do they think they are doing ?
We are shamelessly hypocritical when we import uranium which continues to be mined at the sacred sites of native peoples ; when forests are felled and people lose their homelands and we import the wood .
For technical reasons connected with the budget , that programme must be paid for immediately , in other words by October 1996 .
Mr President , I am surprised that you have allowed the objection in the topical and urgent debate pursuant to Rule 47 , i .e . to switch the question of the transporting of atomic waste with the subject of elections in Bosnia .
I am sure that it will not end with an insular mad cow .
The problem in the Committee on Regional Policy was solved in the spirit of European cooperation .
If we look for the reasons , the first thing that we find is the requirement that there should be unanimity in the decisions of the Council of Ministers .
I support the present motion for a resolution .
Madam President , in his remarks , the President-in-Office of the Council spoke about the third pillar - and many Members have done so too - and he said that as far as the third pillar is concerned , the expectations of the public must be fulfilled , with regard to internal security in Europe .
Oh yes , the European Union is more , much more , than just a free trade zone , and membership is based on treaties and on trust .
Anyone who knows anything about the differences that have had to be overcome , for example between the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany on the one hand and France and Spain on the other , will be bound to admit , on seeing the results of all this work , that the rapporteur has carried out her task with a great deal of sensitivity as well as energy .
Thanks to the presence of the international troops , however , the most important objective has been achieved .
Even more important , however , is the existence of multi-ethnic political parties , which will make it possible , after the elections , to continue the process of rapprochement between the various ethnic groups , and to prevent ethnic separation from becoming strengthened and legitimized by the elections .
If we were to follow our own ideas , then we would be able to give aid to hardly any projects at all , because hardly anywhere are the provisions of the Dayton Accord being observed .
Jobs are absolutely essential in order to give people prospects and in order to make them immune to the inflammatory speeches of their leaders , some of whom are criminals .
We are on the spot , and we are also active , and that is certainly all to the good
