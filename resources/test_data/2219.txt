of Europe , is through liberalisation and free competition .
We used to regulate the telecom sector through national regulators , but these will wither away in future because we are moving towards a single , global regulator , namely the market .
The market is the most effective regulator , providing the best protection for consumers and giving consumers more power than any number of Commission consultation groups .
In future we shall want to give the competition mergers department , more work , because the market should play an even bigger role in telecoms than it does at the moment .
We want to see an end to the advantages inherited by some of the old state monopolies .
I hope you will apply competition law and merger law toughly , but always ensure that you look at each merger on its own merits .
Just because it may produce a big player or a big corporation it is not necessarily wrong for the market or anti-competitive .
We have to remember that Europe probably will need some large corporations if it is to reap the benefits of the Internet revolution .
Madam President , I had understood that Mr Verheugen was going to give a full explanation of the interview that he gave to the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung .
One important point he made was that he felt that , in his opinion , there should have been a referendum in Germany on the introduction of the euro .
Well , it is not too late .
Does he still think that German public opinion should be tested on the euro and what does he think the result would be ?
I welcome the Commissioner 's statement and particularly its measured and considered nature .
The ELDR resolution that has been tabled takes the same view .
We do not want a quick , ill-conceived reaction to events that have taken place in my country and the announcement made by the British Government .
These are serious matters and reflect our citizens ' deep concerns but we should appreciate the full context of the UK announcement , acknowledging the subsidiarity principle to which the Commissioner referred .
It is only a proposal , not a decision , and it follows a very careful and considered report by the chief medical officer 's expert group on cloning .
The matter has been under consideration for two years - too long , say some commentators , when measured against the lives of people with cancer , Parkinson 's disease or organ failure who might be aided by this research .
The experts ' group merely proposes an extension to existing UK rules on the purposes for which embryos can be used in research .
I emphasise this is an extension to existing rules and controls in this very , very delicate area .
We must respect the there are deep and genuine public concerns on both sides of this argument and this is what our resolution tries to do .
The British Government has recognised that in its proposal because it will be the subject of a free vote , possibly later this year .
I believe , although it is not my party 's government , that the British Government has been measured and considered in its response .
I ask this Parliament to be measured and considered in the way it deals with this important issue .
Mr President , a proud man wants to play God .
He refuses to acknowledge that he is only a creature .
He wants to be the creator .
The issue before us today is a battle between creation and man 's discoveries .
There are scientists so arrogant today that they are already patenting their discoveries , as if they had stumbled upon their own creation .
Dr William Hesseltine , the chief executive of Human Gene Sciences Inc. , has already patented 100 human genes and his company has submitted applications for 8000 .
They argue that human cloning is about the promotion of health .
I am arguing today that human cloning is about the wealth of certain scientists and their companies .
Some scientists have taken the lunacy of Hitler 's fascism from the battlefield and are prepared to validate it in the laboratory .
Parliament needs to reject this and as a member of the British Parliament I will be voting against it in my own Parliament .
This is an emotive subject , not least because of the title ' Human cloning ' .
Stem cell research would be a less tendentious title .
But my purpose is to ask for calm reflection and consideration of the facts and the implications for us the human race , for our health and well-being , for the future of science and the health industry in Europe and , by no means least , for our spiritual well-being .
So let us get some facts straight .
Fact : human reproductive cloning is banned in the UK.
There is no intention to change this and the UK industry has no intention of carrying out human reproductive cloning now or in the future .
The research use of embryonic stem cells is a short-term response to a scientific need to discover ways of reprogramming adult cells .
Fact : stem cell research is tightly regulated under a stringent act of Parliament by the highly respected and rigorous Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority .
It would perhaps be a good idea if other Member States were to have something similar .
Fact : there have recently been interesting advances in adult stem cell research , but there still remain significant disadvantages compared with the unique characteristics of embryonic stem cells .
The aim of research in embryonic stem cells is to find ways of using adult stem cells which overcome these disadvantages .
So we come down to the basic dilemma
