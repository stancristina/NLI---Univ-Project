Major climate problems , the hole in the ozone layer and so on must not be resolved at the expense of growth in the poorest countries , at the expense of the workers or by fatalistically accepting the destruction of our planet .
At the same time , the report is gripped by the familiar "polluter pays " principle , resulting in new incentives and profits for business .
Thus , to refer to the report yet again , it states that the cost of building and operating dams on rivers due to over-extraction ( by farmers ) "may be passed on to the users " or , if water needs to be treated because it has been contaminated , for example by fertilisers , then farmers should pay the cost .
It will work to the detriment of consumers and farmers and , at the same time , champion the promotion of other policies , such as the policy to wipe out the agricultural sector .
Madam President , my congratulations to the rapporteur on a job well done , together with my thanks for his help in ensuring that the amendments needed to the overall endeavour were accepted .
Despite the difficulties inherent in this endeavour , the Fifteen need to adopt a minimum common definition of the concept of employee if the directive is to be applied uniformly .
If we are not mature enough to extend the directive to the self-employed , we could at least extend the scope of the directive to employees who are self-employed but who are treated as employees under special legislation .
Secondly , this amendment is an inclusion in the sense of covered claims and severance pay , as provided for in International Labour Convention No. 173 , and I fail to see why we cannot cover them in Europe .
The House would be well advised to approve these three amendments .
First , we need enhanced specifications and , secondly , we need to support motorrail services through the Alps .
At present , the Commission is carrying out pre-preparatory work with the help of first-class experts , with a view to submitting a proposal to Parliament at the beginning of 2002 .
I should like to remind the House of the proposal to introduce digital tachographs which allow the time spent on the road by lorry drivers to be controlled accurately and which several Member States have opposed .
It is clear that , had users been informed , many could have escaped via the emergency exit or by getting out of their cars immediately .
So far 60 million has been spent , about 50 % of the total cost .
Immediate use should be made of motorrail facilities in the Alps .
Because of difficulty in funding these projects , the White Paper proposes Community legislation laying down fairer pricing principles which take account of all the costs incurred for each mode of transport , together with safety costs .
Mr President , the murder of hundreds of members of the Benue community and the stoning of the pregnant woman in northern Nigeria highlight the desperate situation this country is in .
One mission was concerned with the economic situation and the other with human rights and the problem of human rights and the need for the government to intervene and take action have been highlighted .
This is a new sector for the Community , which has come under military cooperation in the past .
As far as humanitarian aid is concerned , the European Commission is intervening wherever the national or local authorities are unable to deal with natural or man-made disasters , but only in countries which have asked for help from abroad .
However , the Commission thinks it is important to monitor recent developments directly on the ground , which is why it is planning to despatch ECHO delegates to Nigeria to record the dangers already referred to .
The Union has promised funding and technical assistance to countries , international organisations and non-governmental organisations asking for support for this purpose .
They are not just humane or charitable policies .
Governments themselves should start up action plans for a package of policies .
Support for research and new product technology can bring about exceptional new products for people with disabilities and new technological products can be adapted to the specific requirements of different types of disability .
The second important factor are the special policies on education and employment .
We need to work with their organisations so that we can present policies in which they themselves are involved .
May I again congratulate Mrs Lynne on her personal stand .
We are worried by the hypocrisy of all this interest being expressed in people with disabilities by the various institutions of the European Union because it is the very policy of the European Union , with its capitalist restructuring , privatisation of health , welfare and education and undermining of workers ' rights and social insurance , which is to blame .
Does a child whose father is an executive of a multinational company have the same opportunities in finding work as a child whose father is unemployed ?
How many of these children have special schools or special classes and the special equipment needed for them to acquire an education ?
This situation will change when the people , the workers and the disabled fight to obstruct the policy of "free competition and market laws " until it has been overturned .
At the same time , I am glad for this opportunity to point out that all substantive and adjectival rules , human rights and the rule of law are complied with to the highest degree in Greece , as I believe they are in the United Kingdom .
Having said which , I believe that the judiciary in my country will be scrupulous in complying with
