No alternative solution to the system of refunds on agricultural products has been seriously looked into .
A second disadvantage of the system of agricultural product refunds is the particular complexity and the cumbersome procedures it imposes upon SMEs in particular .
These informal groups , which met every six months , were , from the outset , a reflection of the determination to have police cooperation in a number of areas , including on terrorism , which was of particular concern to the members of the Trevi I group .
In view of the criminal activity undertaken at that time by some terrorist groups , the Justice and Home Affairs Council , which met on 28 and 29 May 1998 , took the decision to authorise Europol to bring forward its counter-terrorism activities and have them begin on 1 January 1999 .
In order to coordinate their positions ready for the European Conference , the Member Sates will , of course , take account of the very useful recommendations given in the document provided by the Commission departments on 17 April .
Our position must be clear , intelligible and specific .
In this , as the Commission , the Council of Ministers and Parliament , we have a shared responsibility and we want to be very scrupulous about this common approach , as Europe ' s credibility , at this World Conference Against Racism , will depend , above all , on our assessment of the situation and on how credible we are on our own territory .
I shall conclude by thanking Commissioner Diamantopoulou for making the comparison between terrorism and racism , because I consider that it is an attack on the physical dignity of persons , and as such is intolerable .
In this respect , the Council confirms that it will strictly apply the Treaty when consulting the European Parliament on any action resulting from an initiative of the Member States or the Commission .
While I wholeheartedly support Mr Wijkman' s report , particularly the budget allocation obtained through conciliation , I am concerned to see , firstly , that the significance of sustainable development has not been understood , and also that the environment need not necessarily be taken into account in all development projects for underprivileged countries .
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , on whose behalf I am speaking , completely supports the report by Mr Fernández Martín on the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries .
The Council is proposing to alter this in a direction which is not at all acceptable to Parliament .
Everyone is united in condemning non-declared work , or the black economy , as it is commonly called .
In words with which I identify completely , you described the tragic situation developing right now in Palestine and in Israel .
Admittedly , the French and Belgian case referred to earlier is an important one .
I would like to specify , given that not everyone has necessarily been able to follow this case , that this is a flight which had all the required authorisations but which was cancelled at the last minute for reasons that are unclear .
( start of speech inaudible ) ... which will be of benefit only to that minority of the population which has capital to invest and move around .
The European Union should perhaps look into the problem and return to good , sound bilateral relations which could be appreciably different according to whether they involved a democracy or a dictatorial or totalitarian regime .
The Biarritz Council of 13 and 14 October will come roughly halfway through our presidency ; so work will already be well underway , without any compromises having been reached , and the time will have come to take stock and put down a marker with a view to the Nice European Council .
Your participation is always very important .
I nevertheless believe - and this is my personal feeling - that substantial progress will take a little longer .
Indeed , it is clear that in order to provide a more effective guarantee for the values of the Union and fundamental rights , a prevention , vigilance and warning system will be required .
From this point of view , the Charter is firstly , and this is a sufficiently rare thing in our texts for it to warrant a mention , a clear and well-structured document .
It is therefore clear , as concerns timescales , that it will not be possible to make the proclamation , which will be the first step towards something bigger , until the Nice European Council .
I touched on this in connection with closer cooperation .
Having said that , we must not let ourselves be overcome by euphoria .
As regards enlargement , I do not have time to go into detail but I would like to conclude , Madam President , by stressing the importance of another aspect of enlargement .
" A case of ... letting the key players and interests play a greater part . "
It is , moreover , this sense of perspective that will provide the solutions at Nice , since it will at last be possible to enlarge the Union to include , for example , the Poland of Copernicus and Pope John Paul II or , at a later date , orthodox Russia , the eastern sentinel of the Christian world , and it will be possible to do so without disrupting operating procedures .
It is essential , on the eve of the Biarritz Summit , for the European Heads of State and Government to fully grasp the message addressed to them .
We need to hand the initiative back to the political arena and restore the initiative to the people
