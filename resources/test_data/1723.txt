Firstly , we must be able to determine who is responsible .
Parliament should do this by refusing to grant discharge when there are problems .
Only the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe changed sides , which is to their credit , while the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats refused , as usual , to demand accountability .
Institutional competition between countries with a view to discovering sound solutions leads to quicker progress than does central control at higher levels .
The question that should instead have been posed is that of what the EU can do for research in Europe that the Member States themselves cannot successfully do .
Thus , we cannot support stem cell research at Community level since it may mean Member States being forced to help fund research that conflicts with national laws in this area .
We do not believe that Sweden should participate in it .
It is difficult to draw up a complete list of violent incidents of various kinds that have taken place in different parts of Europe and that have been motivated by racism or homophobia .
This investment in small-scale fisheries should be made within the existing budget framework .
Does it not show an exceptional lack of leadership and a failure to support and explain the advantages of enlargement ?
Political leadership means forming , leading and shaping opinion .
If you ask the people for their opinion , you must also listen to what they say .
It might , if anything , be said that there is too little cross-border consolidation .
It is in this context that it is important for major companies to be able to develop in Europe , and it is , therefore , also important to welcome the consolidation we see .
I should like to call on the Commission not to intervene in the discussions about transatlantic stock exchange mergers and not to steer matters in one particular direction or another .
Politicians often have a tendency to believe that companies are public institutions owned by themselves , but that is not the case .
Companies are property , and they belong to their owners , not to politicians .
If the ground rules are changed , businesses suffer , as does everyone .
Sweden has a model guaranteed in the compromise we reached in April 2004 .
There can be no guarantee of objectivity .
If large countries retain their cross-ownership and their rules on voting rights , small countries should be able to do so too .
Pacta sunt servanda .     Mr President , thank you , Mrs Lucas , for a constructive and clear report .
Aviation would therefore be placed at an undue advantage if it were to form part of the general system , and the fight against climate change would become less cost-effective .
Paradoxically enough , it would , then , be those on low incomes who would benefit most from increased emissions charges , for these would reduce the amount of state income needed from other areas , such as rail travel , in which those on low incomes account for a larger share of the market .
The Council wants us to buy a pig in a poke .
On this issue , the industry lobby unfortunately won , both in the Council and in Parliament .
This is unacceptable .     We have voted in favour of two reports that are aimed at reforming the EU’s Structural Policy .
Nor do we support the proposed approach to research , which would extend a single research area to various seats of learning , rather than concentrating it on a smaller number of sites .     We have today voted against Mr Lamassoure’s report on a Council decision on the European Communities ’ own resources .
While it is important that a budget process that is more efficient and transparent be created for the EU , we reject any notion of future tax-levying by the EU on the likes of energy , VAT or corporate income .     I have chosen to abstain in the vote on the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the system of the European Communities ’ own resources .
The issues in question are , amongst others , the environment , research and development and energy , these being areas where we can create healthier surroundings with more jobs and long-term growth .
I am , nevertheless , in favour of large parts of the report on which we are voting .
To do so distorts competition and weakens Sweden’s competitiveness whilst providing only small benefits to the environment , or none at all , in comparison with the introduction of emissions trading for aviation .
The dramatic reduction in the price of flying in Europe is a basically positive development that has brought prosperity , freedom of movement and interaction between people .
That is not a way of behaving that I am fond of .
In its day , nearly everyone in the town worked there .
There are , however , also successful examples of restructuring where new jobs have been created and regions have been able to survive and even progress , with longer-term employment .
Firstly , then , the long-term approach .
Employees should be a part of the restructuring process .
There is also a need to demonstrate social responsibility from very early on and to train staff so as to be able to meet the long-term challenges of the future and for the regions , as it is often companies that play a large role in regions where there is a need to demonstrate social responsibility .
We can , as Mr Jonckheer said ,
