Despite acknowledging that the main reason for the increase in doping is excessive commercialisation , the Commission is doing nothing to combat it .
If they intended , and really wanted , to combat doping , they would have already done so .
We do not expect the European Union to take any such action , so we are struggling to develop a popular movement which will fight for modern sport to rediscover the principle of 'a healthy mind in a healthy body ' .
We disagree with the proposal by the European People ' s Party because , behind its total opposition to human cloning , it is merely taking up its familiar stand against abortion .
The recent decision by the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America to allow the cloning of human embryos , in order to create 'spare part stores ' for bones and vital organs , raises huge questions and problems .
Where capitalism in its most unadulterated and depressing form and the unbridled market economy rule , there is a fine , indiscernible line between the scientific motives and speculative madness of the multinational pharmaceutical monopolies .
The cloning of embryos could become the ' Trojan horse ' which rekindles attempts to clone or 'counterfeit ' human beings , with unpredictable and possibly dramatic consequences for the human race , and it must be averted .
The biggest risk is not inherent in the power of science but in the erroneous and uncontrolled exploitation and application of science .
Similarly , it only contains vague , unsatisfactory proposals on reducing permissible noise levels , especially in the vicinity of airports during the day and , more importantly , at night .
Attempts to reduce the number and times of flights by increasing the price of tickets , in conjunction with constant efforts to erode labour costs and safety specifications , are merely ways of maintaining , if not increasing the profits of the aviation industry , not measures to reduce the adverse environmental impact of air transport .
Mr President , the fires which again destroyed huge tracts of forest in the Mediterranean this summer are mainly the result of the rise in temperature and prolonged dry weather , not to mention of course criminal cases of arson .
The Mediterranean has become a high risk area and needs special measures .
I think , Mr President , that a European strategy on the conservation of forests is our political responsibility and an immediate priority .
Mr President , every September we return to the House and take tragic stock of the number of victims and the extent of the damage to forests as the result of fires .
First and foremost , both the Member States and the Commission need to update the regional development programmes and action to prevent , restore and reforest .
And to go one step further : the time has come for the Commission to draw up an integrated defence strategy to coordinate national action and measures against natural and man-made disasters , in line , of course , with the principle of subsidiarity .
I believe that the area destroyed by the fires was twice as large as at any other time and a great many people were killed despite the fact , of course , that the Greek Government was well prepared and despite the fact that Greece now has some of the best fire-fighting equipment , aeroplanes and human resources in the world .
It is a complicated issue and , of course , it concerns local authorities and the national government .
The common agricultural policy subsidises pasturing on burnt ground , subsidises animals which graze on burnt ground , at the same time as our forests are trying to reproduce naturally .
Of course we shall still have fires and , with what is happening to the climate , we shall no doubt be unfortunate enough to witness more and more serious phenomena .
But it is in our hands to try and do what we can to forestall the known causes at least .
However , the model being promoted by the European Union merely attempts to patch over the shortcomings in an education system which turns out disposable workers who are unable to keep up with developments in the productive process .
Mr President , you have just said that we will be starting at half past eleven tomorrow .
I should like to request that we keep to a standard voting time , i .e . eleven o ' clock .
It is the European Parliament which should be more sensitive to the social impact of competition policy .
It would be an affront , having created such an unfortunate situation , if we were to accept the proposed amendments to the regulation , even on a provisional basis , i .e . until the WTO agreement is completed , on the pretext of safeguarding employment and the value added .
The two monsters in Europe today are terrorism and racism .
Sixty years ago , we lived through one of the worst wars in the history of mankind .
One such dimension is the EU' s basic policy of deepening its policies , i .e . strengthening social cohesion in Europe and ironing out differences , and another is its enlargement policy , i .e . strengthening countries which have problems .
The Treaty of Amsterdam is a really important weapon in Europe ' s institutional arsenal .
Secondly , two directives have been proposed on the basis of Article 13 ; the directive on racial discrimination was voted through by the European Parliament and the Council in record time , a mere six months , and is now part of European legislation .
The monitoring centre has already drawn up studies on the extent of racism and on manifestations of racism , xenophobia and anti-Semitism in various Member
