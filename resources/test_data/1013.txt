Calls for design improvements in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet .
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament .
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media .
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently , I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife , in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks , have brought back memories of similar British disasters , such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967 , and have prompted many British volunteers to help .
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage .
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London , we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil .
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab .
Ultimately , the polluter must pay .
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25 % of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered .
Moreover , although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .
Rather than banning flags of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the 1995 EU directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations .
I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options , and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality .
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .
However , as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years , I have to ask : if Europe has the safest food control system , as you have said , why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives ?
Secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States ?
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
Regarding enlargement : what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws , given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 ?
I also welcome the White Paper .
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France 's refusal to lift the ban ?
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting .
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment ?
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time ; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda .
Mr President , the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty , it has signed the nuclear safety treaties : why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey 's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community , and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter ?
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99 ) : Subject : Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict ?
If not , why not ?
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
First of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response .
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .
This uranium becomes air-borne , is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by
