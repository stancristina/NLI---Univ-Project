I think this , too , is of great importance .
I also wish Commissioner HÃ¼bner every success in that campaign , as I see that you , too , are going to the voters in the coming months .
You have given a lot of indications , but the White Paper is the basis for future legislation and I would consider it highly regrettable if the European Commission were to fail to produce a White Paper .
In the field of energy , for instance , just 2 billion or so has to be found for energy projects , not only from this year 's budget , but also from next year 's budget and possibly the one from the year after that .
If we do not stick to them , I think we would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , we are today discussing a subject that is of special interest to consumers , namely the standard connection for mobile phone chargers .
Coaxing means that people prefer to do something because they see the benefit of it and I think that the Commissioner has achieved exceptional success in this .
My compliments , again , Commissioner .
Like so many topics in this Parliament , this topic , too , can be approached from the perspective of the internal market , the producer or the economy .
Let me deal with nanotechnology first .
Cloning for meat is usually associated with a great deal of animal suffering , and many of these cloned animals do not even live for long .
In this field it is true that there is still much change to come , and if we lay down a definition now , at the beginning , it must be possible to revise it as the science moves on .
The regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer is primarily aimed at protecting the stratospheric ozone layer , but also at preventing climate change .
This meant that the 64 amendments were replaced by a single , consolidated text .
Fifthly , some new substances have been added to the list of substances that are nominated for restrictive measures .
There is , however , more to be done in order to tackle the problem of stored ozone-depleting substances .
I would also like to convey my sincere thanks to my fellow Members , especially the shadow rapporteurs and those who have spoken this evening , for the support that I have received .
Luckily , there were lawyers to advise me that the legal basis had been changed in the recast so that we were able to make changes on that basis , otherwise it would have almost escaped our scrutiny .
The same applies to issues such as torture and rendition .
Countries that are signed up to the ICC can be punished for it and the United States does punish them .
As well as this praise , I also have some critical comments to make .
For me , that is just real transatlantic cooperation , as , while the United States does need Europe , we need to be aware that Europe needs the Americans much more than they need us .
The Commissioner herself has put a lot of energy into the region , but I am also aware that the Presidency is of the opinion that the European Union must not leave this region to the Chinese or the Russians .
I have discussed this issue extensively with Mr Caspary of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , who is the rapporteur on this subject .
Parliament must have the right to petition the Council and the Commission to that effect . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , we , too , are happy to support the continuation of the European Union 's policy of bringing about dialogue and closer cooperation with the Belarusian regime .
Minsk thinks that it is not acceptable to support the opposition like that .
There are precedents , however : for six or seven years I was personally involved in an attempt , along with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the Council of Europe , to bring about dialogue involving the government of Belarus and the then opposition .
Secondly , I urge that the authorities in Minsk be asked whether it is not finally time to lift all the restrictions on travel by the children of Chernobyl .
Mr Geremek , a former Member of this House , quite correctly once commented that we have not yet achieved the reunification of our memories .
We , as a group , will certainly get involved .
Experience has shown that there are currently few or no good mechanisms for dialogue in sport .
One good thing is that , for this reason , the High Court ordered the Government of Bangladesh a week ago to close these 'dismantling yards ' within two weeks .
A global solution to the problem of ship dismantling is still urgently needed .
Fourthly , certification of dismantling yards is to be welcomed .
However , the VVD MEPs do not agree with the provisions of the report that state that the food distribution programmes must be funded exclusively from the EU budget . on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , there is no doubt that Russia now has its fair share of the global economic crisis .
In short , the lack of mutual confidence stands in the way of joint efforts .
I have looked forward to today with eager anticipation .
Yet up to now the vast majority of Parliament has had the will to put right the current imbalance
