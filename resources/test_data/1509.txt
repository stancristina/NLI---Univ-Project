so well respected and so positively viewed by the Member States .
We are naturally going in that direction , because both parties have already started to move .
The core elements of the strategy are probably modernisation and competitiveness measures to be taken by the European Union as objectives for the EU and its Member States .
The EU Member States , represented in the European Council and in the Council , are , of course , a European institution : another of the EU 's institutions along with Parliament and the Commission .
It also asks for close examination of the Commission 's proposal for the supervision of credit rating agencies and asks the Commission - showing constant confidence in the Commission - for proposals on what are known as 'derivatives markets ' ; in other words , what has been described as 'short selling ' on the stock markets .
Very important steps are being taken by the Member States along with Parliament and the Commission .
These values are our real shield , our real protection , our real weapon of mass construction .
I voted against Resolution RC7-0348/2010 on the European Union 2020 strategy because I believe that this strategy is but a mere continuation of the Lisbon Strategy , the failure of which is demonstrated by the current crisis .
I voted against the joint resolution on economic governance because I believe that the current economic model has failed .
Among other important points , this mandate supports the continuation of the moratorium on commercial whale hunting , banning or eliminating scientific hunting outside the IWC regulations , the creation of whale sanctuaries and the continuation of very strict rules to allow aboriginal subsistence hunting .
The report presented by Parliament today is also a wake-up call to the Commission and the Member States , with the aim of achieving a coherent framework and specific proposals to immediately and successfully tackle the problems in the sector I am therefore delighted that Parliament is echoing the main issues reflected in the Council 's conclusions , particularly in relation to simplifying and improving the legislative and administrative framework , supporting research , access to the areas and compliance with the rules in the case of imported products .
The depleted status of both stocks of bluefin is well known .
Following the frustration experienced by many people , myself included , regarding the fact that at its last meeting the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) did not include bluefin tuna on its list of threatened species , the ball is now back in ICCAT 's court .
There are two reasons for this which I will now set out .
The documentation is therefore an extremely important tool for controlling bluefin tuna fishing and combating illegal and unregulated fishing .
Parliament 's amendments were essentially aimed at incorporating the new recommendations that arose at the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) in 2009 , as the Commission 's proposal only included the 2008 recommendations .
I say this on behalf of my group .
Mr President , on behalf of my group I would also like to join in congratulating and thanking Mr Romeva for this report , which does indeed highlight the need to protect tuna .
Workers have to suffer the consequences , as do species , and as does the whole of the planet with climate change .
Therefore in November in Paris the European Union needs to take seriously all the technical reports and recommendations on catch documentation and traceability so that together we can make work compatible with the environment , which is a fundamental principle that should be part of the EU 's values .
It was perhaps a little more complex to reach an agreement with the other institutions , but it was possible nonetheless .
Especially given that no one can tell us exactly what the stock situation is .
We now just need to get to work on applying this report , especially - I stress - given that unfortunately with this report we will have solved part of the problem but not the fundamental problem , and that will require us to have many more discussions and make many more commitments than we have agreed today .
Traps , which are an age-old fishing technique that has never endangered the survival of bluefin tuna , cannot be punished .
We consider it very important that this opportunity rooted in the elected body is not lost .
We should remember , however , that the names of those executed have not been disclosed and that those 18 people included some non-Libyan nationals .
In recitals A and C , replace the words 'civil war ' with 'armed conflict ' .
These are all the oral amendments .
On the one hand , the scope of application has been extended , thus falling into line with Parliament 's original position , that is to say , there is provision for all ships with more than 12 passengers in this regulation .
Furthermore , such bodies will be able to process passenger complaints that have been dismissed in the first instance by a body that will also have to be set up by carriers .
I would like to clear up some things Mrs Lichtenberger said about the ports .
I can understand Mr Cramer 's anger , because the truth is that the stakeholders we are dealing with are mainly large companies , but this is because European associations , true to their nature as such , include both small enterprises and big companies .
I have seen that you are going to launch a magnificent information and awareness campaign relating to air passenger rights .
At present , this information must be provided and these controls carried out repeatedly
