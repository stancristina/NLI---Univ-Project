non-judicial mechanism which has increased voluntary cooperation among Member States ...’ .
Then , the McCarthy report – which I think is the clearest one – states in paragraph 6 , ‘requests that the Commission carry out both and impact assessments on legislation to assist in identifying whether key policy objectives have been met ...’ , and the Gargani report has exactly the same .
What I am trying to say is that we need better regulation , better lawmaking , but it is to do with simplification and us understanding what we are deciding on and people understanding what we are trying to decide on .
I cannot imagine how that sounded through the Finnish interpretation !     The challenges faced by the outermost regions of the Union are very similar to those challenges which are facing the northernmost regions of the EU.
What are the practical effects of the longer-term presidency of the eurozone ?     .
Since then statements have been given by the Committee on Budgets , on which Neena Gill has done such good work , and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on which Giusto Catania has also done good work .
I might say that this year we have been very busy , and I also want to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee’s determined female – and male – members , who have assisted me in this , and all the others who have been involved .
We are now at a point , then , where this is to be voted on tomorrow , and I was thinking of saying a few more words about this report .
The first is ‘Active citizens for Europe’ , which includes town-twinning and which has now received a lot of positive publicity and feedback through the existing programme .
This is a means of acquiring structural support for EU think tanks and civil society organisations as well as support for civil society projects .
Action 4 is ‘Active European remembrance throughout Europe’ .
Through this programme we have tried to find those people and create a programme suited to them so that they too might experience what it is to act together , what European identity is , and how we can strengthen the common European identity .
Both the recent events in connection with the European Parliament elections and the results of referendums show that far too few people are interested in matters that affect all of us .
In a word , this programme has worked on the assumption that what we needed was not an elitist programme , but a programme that would be appropriate for all Europeans .
They mainly relate to Action 4 , active remembrance .
Regarding this , I want to thank Marianne Mikko in particular , as it was she who made a strong case for the Stalinist component and wanted it to be included .
Unfortunately , time is so short and I have gone over mine , so I cannot speak here any longer , but I will say thank you for all the support .
I hope that the vote will go as we on the Committee would like it to .     Mr President , I have two remarks , one is on the report and the other is of a general nature .
It is his first report , it is a big report and he has done an excellent job in raising all the key issues .
I must admit that , although I am not a member of the committee , I fully support what Mrs Pack said .
My more general remark is really about European citizenship and national citizenship .
I have lived in Brussels for seven years .
To be quite honest , when I came to Brussels , I had a few prejudices about nationalities .
That was the feeling I had when I came to Brussels .
So we are certainly not creating any kind of a prototype European .
I can support each and every one of them .
From experience I know that heading the conciliation process is an exacting task that makes great demands on the rapporteur .
Fluorinated greenhouse gases are one example of how difficult it is to solve environmental problems .
When at one time we switched to using fluorinated hydrocarbons in cooling systems , aerosols and other applications , we succeeded in dramatically reducing the use of chlorofluoride hydrocarbons , which make the ozone layer thinner .
Their potential for global warming is 100 or even 1 000 times greater than carbon dioxide , and the time the gases take to disperse into the atmosphere can be very long indeed .
The text for a regulation now adopted by the Conciliation Committee will encourage the continued development of alternative technologies and the adoption of existing technologies , nevertheless making possible sustainable operational models to achieve the objective .
I hope that the two legal bases now chosen will prove , despite everything , to be a workable compromise and will not cause problems of overlap .
At the time , I voted for one legal basis , Article 95 , but with the highest standards .
It would be in the environment’s best interests to combine a harmonised market with ambitious targets .
The report was unanimously adopted by the Committee , no one voted against it , and in my opinion this sort of attack by a Chairman against his own Committee is curious , to say the very least , if not extraordinary .
Mr President , this course of action is , I think , insulting to our Committee .     Mr President , the result of the Israeli elections gave the answer of the people in Israel .
We cannot define and approve ‘democracy ’ as being a ‘terrorist government that was democratically elected’ , as in the Palestinian case .
