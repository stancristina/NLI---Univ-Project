The attempt to reintroduce the European Constitution under another name shows disdain for the grassroots verdict and mocks the people .
And yet the Council and the Commission appear once again to be more concerned , as far as sustainable development is concerned , with promoting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy , despite its environmental and social repercussions .
For example , the Commission has introduced the European year for fighting poverty and social exclusion , an initiative that we welcome , but has failed to formulate more specific initiatives and effective , enforceable measures which will allow real progress to be made .     – Mr President , since last December the Commission communication and other contemporary publicity channels have been confirming the speed of global changes and the new dangers , as well as the opposing trend towards permanent and balanced three-dimensional development which links economic growth and quality of life with social integration and environmental protection .
The resolution is clear .
We need to condemn various racist crimes but , in light of both past resolutions and current Community legislation , this is not enough .
Prosecution of groups that foster racism must be encouraged .
However , there are serious discrepancies between the Member States in terms of technological progress , market size , scale of production and fuel market structures .
Does the Council therefore intend to use the procedures you mentioned , such as partnership agreements and the Barcelona process , to promote something along the same lines as the maritime strategy framework already being promoted in the European Union under the relevant directive ?
However , it is also clear that measures may become excessive and restrict the civil liberties of those they are supposed to protect .
It is of paramount importance to have effective mechanisms which function as safety valves in order to avoid infringements of civil liberties .
Subsidiarity is being undermined slowly but surely .
Our differences therefore lie in the methods used .     – Mr President , I wish to express my satisfaction with all the findings and proposals set out by the rapporteur and to make a number of comments .
The arrival of young workers in inshore fishing , apart from any family connections they may have , means that certain support policies need to be applied , given that even the report talks of the financial difficulties of both owners and workers and their limited borrowing capacity , factors which have an adverse impact on attracting young people to this profession .
It should be pointed out here that their organisation prevents them from being properly represented in decision-making bodies and at public hearings .
It is of economic importance because it secures an income in what are often poor remote island areas .
We must not forget that 44 % of the labour force in fishing is engaged in inshore fishing and that 75 % of the fishing fleet in the European Union is engaged in inshore fishing .
Young people need to be attracted to this profession because the population is aging , they need to be able to sell their products , so that middlemen do not eat up money which should end up in the pockets of fishermen and consumers , problems need to be addressed , such as rising prices and , finally , we need to make a huge effort to keep our seas clean , so that we have fish in our seas for a thousand and one other reasons .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I think that your views on oenological practices and the use of wood shavings are very general and that the Commission has not perhaps understood the basic problem raised by their use .
Have you been told , Commissioner , by society , by viniculturalists , by oenologists , by the European Parliament , that you can create unfair competition on the European market ?
No one in this Chamber assumes that it must not be modernised and no one in this Chamber , knowing the new review of the COM in wine , will refrain from making innovative proposals .
We are calling for your help .
Simply because the government in France will have changed ?
Serious concerns and confusion are also arising in connection with the enlargement strategy for the Balkans .
It is without doubt a unique success on the part of the European Parliament .
I visited Germany during the World Cup and I noted that the German authorities , in cooperation with FIFA , had taken our suggestions on board and that the measures were having positive results .
Let this happy intermission be an example to us ; it showed us that Europe and the entire world can understand differences in a climate of equality , harmony and mutual respect .     – Mr President , last week the Turkish press reported that the Turkish Ministry of Home Affairs was conducting an enquiry into the role of the Mayor of Diyarbakir who , according to allegations by the Turkish Government , supported the protesters during the episodes which took place in this town a short while ago .
We may not be here , but we need to be careful as to what we leave behind for those who come after us .     – Mr President , in all the countries of Europe there is the capital and a large city : there are Madrid and Barcelona , there are Paris and Lyon , there are Rome and Milan .
It does not have even 100 metres of intersections .
Mrs Hübner had the kindness to tell me the mayor 's position is ineffective ; in other words , he has not asked for anything .
