however , there was initially broad agreement on the need for change in the sector - the adoption of the 'Everything But Arms ' initiative makes this inevitable .
With regard to milk , the Commission presented four options for the dairy sector for the period 2008-2015 .
In view of this it was deemed appropriate to consider the situation further .
Where nuts are concerned , the producer countries clearly expressed a need for special subsidies in this sector .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Commission 's initiative to strengthen rural policy is welcomed by the Member States .
Nonetheless , the debate was extremely positive in the sense that there is broad agreement that something must be done in this area , including the fact that there is a great need for simplification of the arrangements , and the delegations have a number of ideas for improvements and for new measures in the slightly longer term .
The majority of the delegations however feel that in the first instance it should be a voluntary system that is attractive to farmers , so that we can get as many as possible to use the scheme .
The delegations have been given opportunity to ask questions , make comments , contribute new ideas , support or criticise all aspects of the Commission 's communication and the reports accompanying the communication .
President-in-Office of the Council , the Commission 's draft mid-term review of agricultural policy is a sound basis for embarking upon the discussions of a future reform of the EU 's agricultural policy .
That is good and is something on which the Presidency should be commended .
Any reform should be centred on farmers and consumers .
It should be dynamic , and it should be a continuation of the liberalisation begun at the Berlin Summit in 1999 .
The period up until 2006 should therefore be used for preparing a reform of the EU 's agricultural policy that makes European farmers competitive in the future world market .
Mr President , I should like to thank you very much for this opportunity to take part here today in the debate , which I have found both interesting and very constructive .
I do not know if I might be permitted to concur in the praise accorded at the meeting here this evening to the chairman of Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Many people touched upon the issue of the prospects for reforming agricultural policy following the Brussels Summit .
How long will the reforms take ?
In this context , I should like to draw attention to section 12 , generally , of the conclusions , which in actual fact says three different things .
First of all , it anticipates ceilings set for expenditure for market-related expenditure and direct payments , and not future decisions on the common agricultural policy .
Secondly , it does not anticipate possible results following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the Berlin European Council conclusions .
Thirdly - and as a response , too , to some of the questions raised this evening - what is stated is without prejudice to the international commitments entered into by the European Union , for example in the launching of the next Doha Round , the ways and means of which are to be in place before the end of March of next year .
I shall not at this stage weary MEPs with a report on the Council 's view of developments , but how far we get - and that is of course what is exciting and interesting : how far will we get in the individual areas ? - completely depends upon the wishes of the individual Member States and upon what we can agree to in the Council of Ministers .
I should like , however , again to say thank you for the sound cooperation we have had with the European Parliament .
I am sorry that I was a little late .
We have to manage the forthcoming enlargement by ten new Member States , and at the same time we still have to carry out a number of reforms in order that the EU is able to function as an economically robust global player .
The European Parliament of today is a major co-legislator in matters concerning the development of the internal market .
As President of the Competitiveness Council , therefore , I feel that this is a natural and particularly necessary topic for discussion with Parliament today .
It is 15 years since the idea of an internal market was put on the agenda .
The internal market is one of the most ambitious goals ever set in the history of the EU.
The internal market has brought more and better products at lower prices , freedom of movement across borders , and especially an increase in competitiveness .
The Danish Presidency has chosen to accord this area top priority .
Secondly , the development of technologies and markets necessitates the removal of the remaining barriers to cross-border trade .
It is of crucial importance to have product and capital markets which function well .
The forthcoming enlargement is vital .
The candidate countries are working hard in order to be ready for accession .
I am fully confident that they will do their utmost to cope with the legislation we have adopted over many years , and it is our responsibility to assist them as best we can - even after their accession .
An internal market with 100 million more consumers in fast-growing economies will mean faster economic growth and more jobs in both the present and the future Member States .
For the existing members , the overall increase in GDP will be 0.7 % .
One of the greatest challenges we face is the completion of the internal market in the areas in which it is not functioning as intended
