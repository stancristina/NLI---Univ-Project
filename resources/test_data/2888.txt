at this issue back in 2004 , and the Publications Office has already issued a report on the future of the Official Journal .
A refusal to issue a document classified as confidential must be justified in precisely the same way as a refusal to make any other document available .
Parliament’s rights in this area are controlled not by the regulation but by Annex 1 to the framework agreement between our institutions .
The interinstitutional committee appointed through the regulation in question last met in November 2005 and decided to appoint a working party to look at those issues , so a solution may be nearer than we think .
Public access to documents is about scrutiny and credibility and , when it comes down to it , democracy .
The purpose of this overhaul is to produce the same rules for all three institutions .
The minutes of meetings of the Council must be published when the Council acts in its legislative capacity , which does not mean that details of all the Coreper meetings have to be made public .
Either that , or the opinions would be of lower quality .
The alternative would be opinions of reduced quality .
The rights concerned - openness and data protection - complement and reinforce each other .
I have every confidence in Mrs Wallström .
Where is the Council ?
Why do they not open their doors ?
There is an easy way of remedying the situation : open the doors so that we can see what is happening .
We in Parliament have , of course , come out in favour of the Guidelines being long-term three-year cycles and of their being integrated .
That is true , but the employment situation in Europe is anything but encouraging .
I do not believe in the French model or believe , as a number of other parties expressly do , that employment is boosted by making one particular group or another less secure .
I turn , finally , to gender equality , which must permeate everything .
The first of these is that it is those European economies that are most open to globalisation that now have the best economic development .
A Swedish politician once said that ‘if things are allowed to go on operating as they have done in the past , things will proceed unchanged’ .
We now have more than 20 million unemployed .
In this area , the Commission has a number of tasks with which it must get to grips .
It also means the ability to establish new cross-border companies in Europe that can be ‘global champions’ .
Those who are in favour of social protection and economic development are also in favour of more flexible labour markets .
The symbolism was clear and , standing there , I felt strongly that people did not feel that they were entering something new but felt that they were being reunited with something of which they had always been a part .
In the run-up to this reunification , Sweden’s Social Democrats had painted horrific pictures of how our country would be invaded by foreign workers who would dump our wages and exploit our social benefits .
We won the battle , and Sweden never introduced any transitional rules .
I have to say , moreover , that it was with great disappointment that I learned of several countries ’ decision to extend their transitional rules .
Quite a few of the amendments we voted on today are , however , unnecessarily bureaucratic , and the extra cost and the administrative burdens that these would entail are disproportionate to the potential benefits .
Those decisions that have permitted transitional rules that discriminate against workers in the new Member States are a flagrant departure from the principle of the freedom of movement of labour and an absolutely disgraceful way of acting towards the EU’s new Member States which have been very enthusiastic about joining the EU.
This is an important democratic principle if voters are to be able to hold elected representatives accountable .
We are , however , strongly opposed to the way in which , in the context of this important issue of openness , the European Parliament’s majority has interfered in the debate on the future of the Constitutional Treaty .     This own-initiative report sheds light on the EU’s double standards in international trade policy .
There is a lot of enthusiastic talk about the need for developing economies to open up their markets to European companies .
Account must , however , be taken of different countries ’ levels of development .
The fact is that the number of EU laws has risen dramatically in recent years , and the EU is now legislating in a host of new areas .
Out-of-date legislation can be repealed .
Impact analyses are fine , but it is not always so easy to measure what we want to measure .
This means that there is a need to be rather careful in this area .
We should therefore thank the Dutch and French voters now as well .     Mr President , our group did not vote in favour of this compromise in the conciliation committee , and we shall not vote in favour of it in plenary tomorrow .
Given , however , the very weak position in which she found herself following Parliament’s second reading , she was unable to achieve the only reasonable objective , namely that of having environmental Article 175 adopted as the only legal basis .
More rapid progress can be made in abolishing these very dangerous greenhouse gases .
We shall then not know what is to happen , and there will again be a danger of these countries actively being forced to curb the legislation they already have .
By their action , the Council and the Commission are preventing new technology from being produced
