However , although it acknowledges that it would be advisable to further harmonise Community radio spectrum policy to an extent , as far as pan-European services and applications are concerned , it does not accept the European Commission ' s proposal for a new regulatory framework at pan-European level , considering this to be both premature and hurried .
Other practices , such as auctions and a secondary market , would result , with mathematical accuracy , in the prevalence of stronger economic interests , which would then monopolise the market .
The huge sums paid will not come out of the companies ' profits ; they will be paid for by users .
At the same time , it has brought practical applications which have changed our lives .
Space is the one sector in which international cooperation is particularly important .
The Commission ' s working document being examined today comes as a response to the Council ' s resolution of 22 June 1998 calling on the Commission to take practical measures to promote cooperation between the European Union and the ESA .
It has therefore set up a consultative structure for space and related matters with the active participation of the ESA .
At the same time , it takes the view that space policy must not be wholly dominated by the market and that account must be taken of long-term assessments of the benefits and risks of exploiting space , not only from the point of view of the interests of industry , but also in terms of the welfare of mankind as a whole .
It stresses the importance of international cooperation , the need for all Member States to participate in space activities and the importance of collaboration with third countries , and points out that the ESA has functioned efficiently and has played a leading role in space research and space applications in both Europe and worldwide .
It calls on the Commission , in collaboration with the Member States , to take all measures needed for effective use of space-based systems for monitoring the environment and for security , in order to protect citizens ' lives and natural resources , identify at an early stage , or even avert natural or man-made disasters and help combat fraud .
In view of the forthcoming UN conference in New York , I think it is opportune that we claim a more active and effective European and worldwide policy in all sectors , a policy which will reach as far as Afghanistan and the Gulf states , where women are still in a most unfortunate position and are denied fundamental human rights .
Today we need to extend our action to eradicate discrimination on the labour market , involve women in social dialogue and deal with violence against women .
As the speakers have said , a great deal has been done and a great deal remains to be done .
I should like to inform you that the Commission has been endeavouring for a long time now to collate information on all the Member States , to obtain answers to questionnaires sent out more than once , to obtain answers to individual issues of legislation , infrastructures , action and statistics .
The first is new changes in the information society .
And , of course , there is the traditional problem of the representation of women , which all the speakers have already touched on .
I think that these are the basic points which need to be assessed and , more importantly , where we need to renew our commitments .
I think that , since all negotiations depend on preparation and on being fully aware of one ' s own situation and the situation of those sitting on the opposite side of the table , we at the Commission and the European Parliament need to cooperate very closely with the Portuguese Presidency .
( EL ) Despite the objective of increasing productivity , investment and employment levels in the Union , the Commission ' s broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community are a set of negative guidelines : continuing budgetary restrictions which go beyond the requirements of the Stability Pact , wage restrictions , tax reforms for the benefit of the better off , further disintegration of the labour market and the crucial importance of competition policy , which brings pressure to bear on the principles of social justice .
- ( EL ) The legislative proposal of the European Parliament merely accepts the proposal by the Commission of the European Union , which confines itself to finding that " Greece fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency .
Personally , however , I have strong objections to and reservations about the policies of EMU, which tie the Member States into rigid budgetary austerity , rising unemployment , worsening social conflict and unbridled competition , without being able to offer a strong European currency which is able to stand up to the dollar worldwide .
I am also totally opposed to the way in which the Greek government has achieved our accession to EMU, pursuing nominal rather than de facto convergence , making Greece one of the countries of the Union with the highest rates of unemployment and continually selling off the state ' s assets in order to cover treasury deficits .
From a technical point of view , Greece has undisputedly managed to fulfil the criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty for entering the third stage of EMU.
Both the obligations imposed by the Stability Pact and the strict recommendations accompanying the reports by the Commission and the European Central Bank prove it .
The experience of other countries already in the euro zone proves that one new measure after another is introduced in order to reverse what has been achieved over previous decades and the " American model " is now
