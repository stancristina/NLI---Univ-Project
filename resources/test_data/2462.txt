Allow the Member States themselves to decide the best way of framing the rules so that the directive ' s required objectives are met .
That is almost a personal record for me this autumn !
The people of Europe are waiting impatiently for results .
The negotiations concerning the new Treaty take place too often behind closed doors .
For us Liberals , it is an obvious fact , and one that needs to be crystal-clear , that the present intergovernmental conference must be the last before new Member States are admitted .
Expectations prior to the meeting in Biarritz are running high .
Mr President , the proposed Charter of Fundamental Rights does not mean that citizens ' rights are to be reinforced .
The Charter can therefore only be seen as an attempt to transfer responsibility for citizens ' rights from the institutions in which they at present reside to the European Union .
This would also reinforce pan-European cooperation in this sphere instead of weakening it , as there is a danger of the EU Charter doing .
It is the most modern in the world , and it has been drawn up in the world ' s largest continuous legal area .
Our European identity and community of values will be strengthened .
This individual protection is an important basis for enlargement of the Union - the EU' s priority for the next few years .
Today ' s young people take peace for granted , and mistrust has been exchanged for reciprocity .
Everyone was surprised by the dynamism of that process , which was so skilfully handled by Chancellor Kohl .
It will totally change the EU.
I have been entrusted with the task of acting as rapporteur where Estonia is concerned .
We have a lot to gain from more trade and more interchange .
They are not to be judged en masse or on the basis of some special geopolitical position they might occupy .
It must be the results of the negotiations which count .
I am impressed by the political consensus that exists and by the leadership exercised by Prime Minister Mart Laar .
There seems to be no let-up in the desire to devise detailed regulations .
As a conservative , I am incredibly thrifty with taxpayers ' money .
If it completes the negotiations effectively and purposefully , Estonia has a good chance of becoming one of the Union ' s new Member States .
I am a little concerned about the way in which Parliament has handled this report on enlargement .
In the opinion on the Brok report , for which I was responsible and which has been backed by the Committee on Budgets , the conclusion is the same .
Through enlargement , we shall be participating in the largest common market in the world , with almost 500 million people and 25 per cent of world trade .
Together , we shall be able to solve Europe ' s cross-border environmental problems .
Negotiations must , in the first place , be aimed at easing the way to accession by the candidate countries .
Naturally , they must comply with EU legislation , but I think it is sometimes rather hard to say that these countries must do this from day one .
It is being said in certain quarters that a country must meet the requirements before it becomes a Member State .
We cannot afford to lose more of the momentum that existed at the beginning of the Nineties .
It is time to lead European opinion in the right direction .
I believe that the opportunity for transforming the EU into a form of pan-European cooperation lends legitimacy to the enlargement process .
It has to be recognised that it is about joining forces economically , but this can also give rise to major economic gains in the future as our market increases and there is increased growth in Europe .
That is our common task .
I should now like to comment on the following points .
Thirdly , gradually devise target dates for each candidate country .
Let us unify Europe .
We might well hope that , before the whole of this package is in place , there will be very many more of us , as citizens , who are affected by these rules .
The rules are designed to apply in the first place , however , to feedingstuffs for those animals we eat ourselves .
The Commission ' s proposal removes those rules which entitle local and national authorities to local derogations .
The percentages are increasing slowly and continually in the earth , in feedingstuffs and in food .
We know that dioxin and aflotoxin are carcinogenic etc .
We shall never escape this altogether .
In the long term , it is very important that we should be able to begin an investigation in peace and quiet and try to stop the increase in a particular substance before it reaches this emergency limit value .
It is important for us to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that we can cope successfully with increases in foreign substances .
I have therefore made a lot of the language more straightforward and tried to simplify matters and make them crystal-clear .
We cannot find the culprits .
The people of Europe cannot , however , properly rely upon such control ' s really being carried out if there are major differences of approach between Member States and regions .
The second thing we must take into consideration is the fact that differences in the application of these inspection rules will mean serious disruption of the internal market .
That would be an extremely undesirable situation .
Unfortunately , a lot of inherited knowledge and farmers ' lore has been lost in industrial agriculture , where animals have been reduced to production units and commodities .
These proposals also mean a step
