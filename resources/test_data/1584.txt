we proceeded in an arbitrary fashion without regard for these interests .
We have tabled a supplementary amendment on this and I would be very grateful if it could still be considered .
One aim of the European Commission 's action plan , which we support in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , is to promote their use in primary and secondary schools .
I believe that the move to an information society signifies a radical change in our society .
Social change must also open up opportunities for the individual on a broad front .
For the many small and medium-sized firms that , after all , represent the backbone of European tourism , the key to the success of tourism will be not just the supply of information but accurate and rapid information .
To say that there is a shortfall here would also mean that 40 years of coeducation was just a waste of time !
We only have two large firms , accounting for just 10 % of the market , that are European .
There is nothing wrong with satellites that bring in money , with satellite applications .
I am not saying this out of hurt vanity ; I do not think that is so important .
I do not dispute that we will have to make further efforts , which we are indeed doing ; but I do say that there is no better means of helping the disadvantaged than by reducing the costs that have to be paid to obtain information .
So you can see that the situation has scarcely changed for these four main competitors , and very often their loss was the developing countries ' gain .
Alas I must tell you that both we and the forum are disappointed by the participation of MEPs .
For the problem is that people obviously have different ideas about what the reality is .
I also thank Mr Rübig .
Here too there is a gap between the ideal world we might imagine and the real world .
That is the reason for our reaction .
The final report is expected at the end of the month , which is why the Commission does not want to adopt a position before the panel has completed its work .
Mr Bangemann , I ask you to take the appropriate measures in the Commission to enable us in the European Union not just to present the scientific evidence offered by the WTO but also to look into it .
We have to resist that .
In fact we missed the opportunity to start a debate on this subject at the last WTO round .
By and large , the FIFG commitment and payment rates in Objective 5( a ) regions are average compared to those for all structural assistance objectives in the EU.
In the past , large road-building schemes in the cohesion countries have destroyed more than they have really achieved .
This in itself raises the question of the success of the structural policies .
We must ensure that this does not turn into a disastrous trend for certain regions .
On the whole , utilization of resources was very good .
Here more account must be taken of the direct political responsibility of the regional players in setting the structural objectives and determining the assistance priorities .
Should we not make more use than before of the TACIS programme resources ?
I ask you to call on Mr van den Broek finally to apply a procedure that has been on file since 1995 so as to ensure that these promises really are kept .
I do not want to criticize anyone specifically , but I do want to point this out and ask the Commission to take greater care when it disburses these funds that they are used efficiently .
The question is whether that is the right road to follow .
I also regret the fact that the Commissioner responsible could not attend today .
At that meeting we and the Slovak parliament noted that the Commission had done very good work there .
But there is no desire at all there to develop a civil society , which means that hardly any money goes to this sector in Poland .
It has referred to the need to rationalize their execution .
We need further institutional reform before the next accession .
Yet they do allow for some action if the political will is there .
In the field of foreign and security policy , we have managed thanks in particular to Parliament 's activities to ensure that the Commission is involved in planning and analysis and in other areas too and that it is no longer just the governments and the Council alone that decide .
Treaties on enlargement , association agreements and many other agreements with third countries require the assent of the European Parliament .
We finally need a broad social debate , a democratic discussion on the forms of the 'information society ' .
Towards the end of his remarks he said that Mrs Bonino 's statement had nothing to do with BSE.
Mr President , I should like to support what Mr Gutiérrez Díaz has just said .
Mr President , this is the first fisheries debate since Amsterdam .
But I can say with complete confidence that it will not allow itself to be used as a tool and will not get involved in any differences of opinion , including differences with other parliamentary committees , which may be harmful to those who depend on fishing for their living .
The funds for international fisheries agreements are , of course , non-compulsory expenditure .
It can rely upon the support of Parliament in this matter - that much is apparent from the opinions of the Committee on Economic Affairs and the other committees
