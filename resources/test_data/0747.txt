not have such a strong commitment to a transitional period ?
The Commission ' s proposal is based on the notion that a third tariff quota should be introduced where the tariff preference for ACP countries would be EUR 300 per tonne .
The transitional period , as outlined by the Commission , is sufficiently long to introduce an appropriate aid scheme .
Mr Dary ' s report shows due concern both for the banana producers in the Community and the ACP countries .
There are , however , some which cannot be supported under any circumstances .
At the same time , it stresses how important it is for the Commission to listen to the European Parliament and consider the interests of all parties at every stage .
I oppose Amendment No 27 as it would water down the transitional period system totally and , in practice , would deprive Latin America of its opportunity to sell bananas under the new quota 'C' .
Ladies and gentlemen , let us not have occasion to change the name .
We who make the policy decisions in the EU must not , through our own actions , weaken European competitiveness .
Naturally , I agree with the Commission ' s proposal and with all my colleagues who have spoken here today that the distortion of competition that now exists in the market must be eliminated as soon as possible .
I therefore support those who want to totally exempt European companies from tax on electronic products , for the present at least .
In my opinion , reading the morning paper in a street café is quite different from reading it on the Internet where you work .
We are talking about a different product .
Question No 49 by (H-0912/00 ) Subject : Transport links across the straits between Vaasa , Finland and Umeå , Sweden Shipping in the narrows of the Gulf of Bothnia is to be discontinued , since it is unprofitable now that shipping firms have no opportunities for tax-free sales .
The king might be elected for a fixed period from among the most deserving Finnish MEPs !
Mr President , Commissioner , I thank you for this reply , which raises our hopes .
That project would have a clear impact on employment .
For example , in Vaasa , the city I mentioned , 550 jobs have been lost in the last two years in the travel and tourism industry alone , which may have been the result of stopping duty-free sales .
Mr President , there has been so much discussion of this issue , and we are so like-minded with regards to it , that the report does not actually have to be presented in the proper sense .
We know that the Commission is now drafting a programme for sustainable development for the whole of the European Union , and that should be ready in six months ' time .
The rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann , has quite rightly recommended that the Commission ' s proposed budget should be increased .
I hope that these resources will be used specifically for developing European cooperation from the point of view of our citizens .
In the report now adopted , just a fraction of postal services would be liberalised and no final date has been set for that liberalisation .
A fixed date would act as an incentive for the post office to develop and modernise its services and would make planning and market investment easier .
It is impossible to struggle against this inescapable development and , for that reason , we should start to prepare for it as soon as we can .
Our Group is in favour of adopting it .
The report has quite rightly stressed the importance of including the participation as well as the cooperation of regional and local players .
In my opinion , it is important to create conditions that are as equal as possible in the different areas by exploiting modern technology .
The basic idea behind innovative measures is the creation and utilisation of new operational models .
Tourism is an important means of livelihood in many remote areas as well .
The measures must also serve the interests of regional sustainable development .
Regarding the budget , some serious words were said here in the previous speech : EUR 400 million is really just the minimum for financing , and we will have to utilise the additional financial possibilities offered by the flexibility instrument in the second half of the period , as the report states .
Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are appropriate , as the Commission should not use appropriation reserves for unexpected projects , as was the case a few weeks ago .
As the report states , important restructuring of the shipbuilding industry has come about by adjusting quantity and quality .
Improvements to the competitiveness of shipyards must be extended with the help of internal measures and agreement procedures .
Neither will operating aid , not even specifically-channelled aid , solve the Korea problem : that has to be firmly dealt with by means of trade policy , for example .
The century that has now begun will unfortunately become known as the century of exile .
That is not enough , however : we must give our determined support to the UNHCR , both in political and economic terms , to ensure there is a balance between the issues of predictability , flexibility and geographical location .
We agree largely with her ideas and we are satisfied with the result of the work of the committee .
All the countries of the European Union have the same problems and the same prospects .
For us , the question is how we can keep elderly people in the job market and what that requires of the labour market in general
