common principles governing the election procedure .
In that way , the political group has one MEP fewer , with the same workload having to be distributed among fewer MEPs .
The same thing must also apply , of course , to Parliament as a place of work .
Estonia , which has closed 26 of 31 chapters , has fulfilled all the necessary conditions for becoming a member of the EU in 2004 .
When Estonia joins the EU , I hope that the country will continue its work in favour of less bureaucracy and better basic conditions for businesses .
Timetables presuppose action .
That is why it is disgraceful that Sweden is now putting the timetable at risk and making enlargement conditional upon agricultural policy .
There can be nothing more important than that the EU honour its pledges and that the last chapter in the reunification of Europe be written in Copenhagen this autumn .
To unify Europe and finally incorporate the countries of central Eastern Europe into the European Union is the historic challenge of our time .
As Mr Brok said , there is no longer any excuse for delaying enlargement .
The EU cannot reasonably meet all the wishes of the candidate countries .
One Paragraph of our report proposes that the Commission should provide help and support on the issue of Romania 's and Bulgaria 's continued work with a view to accession .
It is possible that the Commission has already come up with these ideas .
I do not say that that should apply generally , because it is sensible not to allow any increase over and above previous levels .
There are , however , connections , and we believe it is a matter of urgency for both EU and candidate countries directly to begin to discuss how a future agricultural policy might look .
I want to make a recommendation to the Council and the Commission : negotiate with knowledge , sensitivity and love , and we shall achieve a good result .
In the candidate countries where referendums are to be held , a lot of people are probably wondering what they are getting themselves into .
The leaders of the candidate countries must resolutely continue with the required reforms before the negotiations can be concluded .
They have done an impressive job , and a number of questions still remain .
Those of us within the EU also have a big responsibility : to tell people about the huge importance of enlargement and about what is at stake .
I believe the European Parliament has accepted its responsibility .
It is an historic opportunity to unite the whole continent .
The alternative is chaos , uncertainty and a fatal division of Europe .
Having myself worked on the food safety package for nearly three years now , I have reflected upon the incredible degree to which the reform will affect each and every one of the candidate countries .
Mr President , allow me , in common with many others , to thank Mr Böge for his extraordinary work on a report in which the focus lies so incredibly clearly upon enlargement and its necessary economic conditions .
Continued delays and conflicting signals on the part of the Council concerning the ground rules in the common agricultural market for established and new Member States in an enlarged EU are in danger of causing us not to have the privilege of welcoming ten new Member States at the beginning of next year .
Anyone who tries to prevent or halt this process is assuming a very large responsibility .
In a poem , the Swedish Nobel Prize winner , Erik Axel Karlfeldt , writing at the turn of the nineteenth century , highlighted five dangers in life : sheriffs and their constables , alcohol , women and the Devil .
There is also anxiety that , as Mrs Villiers and Mrs Honeyball pointed out , the next step after the common exchange of information might be the harmonisation of taxes , including direct taxes .
We therefore support the Commission 's proposal and the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , we endorse the rapporteur 's observation concerning the VAT system and country of origin principle and we also support the amendments by the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Allow me to emphasise how important it is for issues concerning personal privacy and the use of personal data to be dealt with in accordance with existing EU and national regulations .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am replacing Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , who has other important commitments this evening .
This proposal will make it possible to make cross-border offers of insurance while providing a high degree of consumer protection .
The regulations must be designed in a way that creates confidence in those who constitute the market , that is to say the consumers .
Allow me to mention the most important amendment which , in important respects , alters the whole proposal .
We shall therefore vote against this amendment .
In the White Paper on Transport , the Commission writes that we must halve the number of people killed by 2010 .
The case for safety is self-evident .
It is not always clear how it is to be implemented , and the EEVC tests are not taken seriously , in spite of the fact that they have been developed over a period of more than 22 years .
It is now important to proceed on the basis of road safety and consumer demands .
The third was to recommend a framework directive .
The committee therefore proposes a framework directive , as mentioned by the Commission too in its communication .
It means that we in the political assemblies establish the objectives , whereupon experts oversee the implementation under the supervision , and with the participation , of the Commission
