crucial to the future ratification of the so-called ‘European Constitution’ .
We must take stock of the costs of the euro , which is hampering sustainable development .     .
We need to keep a closer watch on instances of malpractice and excessive rounding up that may occur during the transition and to warn the population of a slight rise in inflation .     .
I therefore feel that we should agree on a more wide-ranging and complete communication plan , especially at institutional level .
A further important point to bear in mind is that , in order to foster sustainable development , it is also necessary to encourage research into , and innovation in , new technologies focused on prevention and the restoration of natural , cultural and historical resources .
I should also like to point out that one of the conclusions of the review of the Lisbon Strategy was that the state of the environment and improving employment should be seen as an opportunity to fulfil the objective of creating the most competitive knowledge-based economy .
The fact that children do not attend school leads to a vicious circle , in which poverty becomes more widespread , access to culture and education becomes ever more difficult and literacy levels in society are kept low .
In Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean , millions of children are exploited in work places .
We all know that this is a complex phenomenon rooted in social and economic problems that are difficult to solve .
These are the reasons why I voted in favour of the Mavrommatis report .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , the European Social Fund ( ESF ) has a history dating back 40 years .
I shall now deal with the first of those , the Lisbon Strategy .
The first of these concerns social inclusion .
Talks between the Commission and the political groups involved have led to a compromise solution that is consistent with policy and that ensures that resources are channelled into regions with the greatest development needs .
Lastly , Mr President , I should like to highlight the highly cooperative atmosphere between the Commission and the various interested political groups while this report was being drawn up .
As far as we are concerned , the figure of 0.41 % of EU gross national income is woefully inadequate in terms of achieving the proposed objectives and of meeting the cohesion needs of an enlarged EU.
The reports before us also fail to address implementation needs , with regard to pre-financing and cofinancing amounts , and to the issue of pegging the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact .
The purpose of the European Social Fund , one of Europe’s founding principles , has always , in tandem with cohesion policy , been to help people , and has consequently been the policy that people have identified with most .
The time has come to make sure that objectives are met and that the statistical effect does not make the innocent carry the can for the guilty .
I view this Presidency with a mixture of apprehension and hope .
A strong , revitalised European cohesion policy with adequate financial resources is one of the crucial factors in meeting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
Given the fact that the financial envelope for the 2007-2013 period is virtually the same as the one in the Community framework still in force and that Europe has enlarged from 15 to 27 , it strikes me as both logical and necessary that the overall financial allocation for this Fund should be increased .
I feel that the Commission must rethink its positions on replacing Community fleet vessels .
Yet I must also mention what , to my mind , are the major omissions in your proposal , namely the Natura 2000 network and its presence on the oceans , and the undertakings made by the Commission as regards the Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic ( OSPAR Convention ) .
The high costs of patents would hinder SMEs , which would not have the wherewithal to pay for patents and might even see their ideas patented by third parties .
I feel that this is the best means of preventing the adoption of a document that would clearly have undermined the interests of small and medium-sized software businesses , not to mention consumers ’ interests .
In the parliamentary process , it has become clear that the large European businesses have sought to guarantee exclusive use of programs for computer-implemented inventions , and this is at variance with the provisions of the Munich Convention and the case law of the European Patent Office .
Accordingly , I feel that tools must be created to raise public awareness of questions of an environmental nature and that better implementation of environmental legislation must be promoted .
Consequently , we have once again made a number of proposals , including an increase in amounts for the structural funds , aimed at guaranteeing full compensation for the regions affected by the ‘statistical effect ’ and at implementing phasing out mechanisms for the Cohesion Fund .
Those population-based criteria , which are contained in the Luxembourg Presidency’s negotiating package for the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 , are devoid of any objective foundation .
We feel that one of the key issues with regard to the current proposal for a regulation for the Cohesion Fund – already covered in the previous regulation – is the pegging of the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact , in other words , the possibility of suspending all or part of the financial aid from the Fund to cohesion countries , such as Portugal , if the decision provided for in Article 104(8 ) of the EC Treaty is adopted .
