It is also worth addressing some of the concerns which my fellow Member , Baroness Ludford , expressed about pre-emptive strikes .
The resolution gives its full approval for the EU 's anti-terrorism package , and that includes the EU 's list of terrorist organisations .
The problem is that these groups constitute a quite crucial part of the network involved in peace negotiations in the Philippines .
In any event , Parliament has adopted two resolutions which actively support this process , and I think Mr Haarder even voted for one of them .
If that does not go completely against all of the pretty words on crisis prevention , I do not know what does .
There continue to be totalitarian regimes , to which resistance must be offered ; and if we in the EU are unable to tell the difference between terrorists and freedom fighters , it is a very sad world for us all .
I would like a definitive answer to the following questions : is it true that Sison , the NPA and the Communist Party of the Philippines are to be included on the EU 's list of terrorists ?
Is it true that , in so doing , we are busy dooming the whole of this peace process to failure ?
It is not possible to prevent and combat terrorism effectively while so many million people are living in a hopeless state of ignorance , poverty , political and economic stagnation and lack of freedom .
European leaders , with the exception of Tony Blair and the Danish Government , live in the dishonest belief that the whole problem can still be solved from within if we contribute with diplomatic chatter , by playing 'wait and see ' and criticising the USA in the hope that the terrorists will not really strike in a European city .
Europe has simply come to where we were in 1938 , when Chamberlain returned from his meeting with Adolf Hitler in Munich and proclaimed that there would be peace in our time .
Europe will not become a player by adopting who knows how many resolutions .
The dictatorial regimes in the countries which produce terrorists and pay for terrorism do not enjoy popular support , but the peoples are so oppressed that they are unable to bring about the necessary revolution .
If we mean anything by our professions of freedom and democracy , it is our duty to stand together with the USA in the showdown with the whole clutch of dictatorship states which are responsible for breeding terrorism .
I would thank Minister Haarder for his clear emphasis on the need to do this .
Mr President , the events in Bali have underlined that there is a need for a multilateral approach to the fight against terrorism .
We acted rapidly in Europe following 11 September : we can congratulate ourselves on this .
Anyone who has been following the European debate on relations with the USA in recent months will have started to have misgivings about the imbalance and one-sidedness it has shown .
Immediately after the terrorist attacks in September of last year , I am sure many of us saw these as an attack on ourselves and our values .
We must stand firm on this .
We must exert our influence on the USA within the framework of a multilateral approach to the fight against international terrorism , something which knows no justice .
Madam President , I should like to express my thanks for a long and exciting debate , and I should like to make a couple of comments .
If we wish to create an international community founded on the rule of law , in which states bring matters before the courts instead of taking the law into their own hands , what is also required is the resolve to act - if necessary using force - against those powers which , using violence and terror , try to drain the lifeblood of open , democratic and constitutional states .
I do not believe that preventive action can be excluded if there are clear indications of impending attack or of exposure to terrorism or such like .
With regard to the EU 's role and position , I want to say that we are actively involved in this confrontation with international terrorism .
In the EU , we are very aware of the fact that the combating of terrorism must not involve infringements of human rights .
With regard to financial resources , the Council has , as a follow-up to Resolution 1373 , taken steps to freeze funds belonging to terrorists and terrorist organisations .
Since then , the EU 's terrorist list has been revised twice during the Spanish Presidency , and a further revision is anticipated in the very near future during the Danish Presidency .
It would be wrong to comment on possible changes until the list is ready , so I shall avoid doing that .
As quite a few rapporteurs have also mentioned , the relationship between the EU and the United States is basically rock-solid and founded upon a community of values .
We need the United States , and the United States needs us .
At the extraordinary Council meeting on 21 September of last year , we sent a strong signal of solidarity and cooperation to the United States .
It is the case in this field as in others that , when the EU and the United States stand shoulder to shoulder , there is a lot we can do for justice and freedom in the world .
It is well over a year since the European Parliament adopted a decision on the existence of a global system for intercepting private and commercial communications - what is known as the Echelon interception system .
The decision was based upon a report from the
