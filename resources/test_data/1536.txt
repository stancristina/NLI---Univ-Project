equality and economic development go hand in hand .
If we are to create a strong and competitive Europe , there is a need for women to participate as much as men in the labour market and , it should be noted , with equal wages and the same conditions of employment .
Finally , I wish to express solidarity with all those women around the world who do not enjoy basic human rights and who are victims of persecution , violence , trafficking in human beings and all other forms of threat , discrimination and assault .
We in the ELDR Group shall continue to work towards improving conditions for these women .     Madam President , the Santini report concerns one of the pillars of European cooperation : freedom of movement for EU citizens .
A flexible labour market is identified again and again as one of the preconditions for increasing growth in the EU.
One of the most important barriers to mobility is constituted by the limited opportunities that exist for people to take their families with them to other EU countries .
It considerably simplifies matters .
It will facilitate mobility by doing away with the requirement for people to have residence permits before going to live in other EU countries .
One of the big matters discussed in the report , that of the definition of ‘family’ , ended with a compromise according to which the Member States’ current legislation is to be followed .
Besides , it contains too many improvements upon the status quo .
I believe we have been able to do perhaps a little more than might have been thought possible .
We have most certainly achieved more than we could expect to achieve in a new Parliament representing an EU of 25 Member States , many of which have a far more restrictive definition of ‘family’ .
The establishment of the common border agency , coordination between border authorities , with joint training involved , and the preparation of common risk analyses and of common projects for exploiting the new technological advances are all elements that will strengthen control at the external borders .
Firstly , it was stated that the establishment of a common European border police neither should nor can be hurried through .
In the end , the setting up of such a corps requires a political decision to be taken for which there must be very good reasons .
Otherwise , the border agency would quickly be branded as an agency for sending people home .
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I am able to say that we shall support his report in the vote .     Mr President , I should like to support the proposal not to begin the debate until the Commission is present .
Otherwise , we should not of course have needed to ask the Commission to come and report on anything at all .
I would prefer that the first speakers respond to the Commission ’s contribution , which will form the background to my own response too .
I do not think that we can go ahead with the debate .
Anything else would be absurd .     Mr President , it is quite incredible that the Commission has still not found a solution to the issue of the export from Israel of goods with preferential access and that , knowing how Israel has so far insisted upon its own interpretation of its own area , the Commission wants now , into the bargain , to leave it to Israel to propose a solution enabling the Member States to identify which goods have been produced in the illegal settlements , so that duty can be claimed on them .
Moreover , the EU has a duty to comply with its own trade agreements and , unless Israel very quickly comes up with a proposal that makes this possible , I think that the only solution to this issue is for the Commission to inform the Member States that they must subject all Israeli certificates of origin to a verification procedure .     We have voted in favour of Mrs Fourtou’s report ( A5-0468/2003 ) on measures and procedures to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the negotiated compromise package .
Moreover , the directive ensures further harmonisation of national legal regulations on the enforcement of intellectual property rights and helps ensure that the legislation is complied with .
It excludes offences by consumers who have acted in good faith and strengthens people’s right to carry out private copying in accordance with the Copyright Directive .
Moreover , adoption is in accordance with the EU’s global obligations in relation to the World Intellectual Property Organization It also means that there is proportionality in the proposal and that obstacles to trade must not be created .
Adoption following enlargement could mean that future legislation would only be adopted in several years ’ time , which could lead to increased illegal activity .     Mr President , Commissioner , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has always given the highest priority to the fight for human rights .
It means a lot to us that individual persons each be guaranteed both their fundamental freedoms and their basic rights .
It is therefore a special honour for me to be rapporteur for this report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the Guantánamo detainees ’ right to a fair trial .
There is therefore no intention behind this report to place a question mark over the fight against terrorism .
In this case , it is , as has already been pointed out , particularly a question of the right to a fair trial and to treatment in accordance with international law .
