a special unit for work-related health problems in the 1999 survey on employees .
According to IKA estimates , 39 % of accidents are reported , which compares with Denmark , Ireland and the United Kingdom , although we must bear in mind that 45 % of Greeks who are self-employed are insured with IKA.
It is very hard for the European Commission to monitor the situation at national and regional level , let alone at enterprise level .
So it is important for each country to set up national mechanisms to monitor health and safety issues .
I understand perfectly that , in order to achieve the objectives which you set in the Social Agenda , you need the national governments and the social partners as your allies .
We are in the initial stages of drafting this report as I speak .
Commissioner , you said that 47 slaughterhouses meet certain Community requirements , while others can operate freely in Greece .
The second question I wish to ask you is if you have any news on spongiform encephalopathy .
Then there is the serious question of the central meat market in Athens , where the Commission has ordered an investigation .
Further liberalisation is still the main objective , that is , opening up the markets in poor countries to the industrialised products of the developed countries which , at the same time , will import agricultural produce to compete with our own , together with raw materials at derisory prices .
Any interest evinced in the problems of less developed countries and the environment is lip service and , as such , mere hypocrisy .
Health must be a priority , over and above political or economic compromises , and cannot be treated as a commodity .
I should like now to make a few comments on the programme itself .
I should point out here , given that it is three months to the day since the terrorist attack on 11 September , that we need to include a category to deal with health threats from natural , biological and chemical agents caused by unforeseen circumstances , such as accidents or defective infrastructure or machinery , human error or even acts of terrorism .
I should like to highlight two points in our amendments to the common position .
Although we are in almost total agreement with the Council on the objectives of the programme and on individual issues , there is still a great deal of discussion as regards coordination and the budget for the programme .
We have now confirmed this approach in the Committee on the Environment , which voted for a second reading .
The programme must be adequately funded .
Finally , strengthening the foundations of our European Structure depends on convergence , not just at the level of economic strategy and policies , such as the single market and EMU, but in individual sectors , such as the health sector .
Madam President , Commissioner , this is the second reading of the public health programme and it is important that the European Parliament re-address a number of issues which it considers to be of fundamental importance .
As far as the budget is concerned , I shall not mince my words because , if we really want to respond to the needs and objectives of the programme in question , we need to provide the resources required in order to implement it .
Finally , I think it is important that the exact objective of the programme under discussion be made clear .
Mr President , Commissioner , as the last Justice and Home Affairs Council demonstrated , the system for taking unanimous decisions on matters of justice and home affairs has come to the end of its cycle .
The only sector in which the Council has evinced any particular interest or enthusiasm is in the fight against terrorism , under pressure from and at the suggestion of the United States which , I am afraid , is trying to export and impose its system of justice on Europe , a system which clashes with European customs and values .
The end clearly does not justify the means .
.
Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted by the European Union Council in Nice in France on 7 December 2000 does not allow anyone to be sentenced to death .
And that is a huge step backwards .
It is Europe 's duty to react .
The rapporteur , Mr Watson , suggests how we can become peaceful and legitimate demonstrators , the first requirement being to work together peacefully and avoid any manifestation of violence . Ôhe question is , who is guilty of violence and terrorism ?
It is easy to conclude that , if they do not , they run the risk under the forthcoming terrorism law of being sentenced as terrorists for the crime of supporting terrorist action .
It also suggests that we need to agree on a common definition of "dangerous person and dangerous behaviour " for all the Member States .
In fact , especially in Genoa , the demonstrators faced unprecedented violence on the part of the police , with illegal charges , hundreds of illegal arrests , dozens of injured and the cold-blooded murder of a young man .
The reasons behind the grass-roots movement are increasing social inequality and the attack on fundamental social rights .
The main excuse for the Commission 's refusal is that the information and documents requested would disclose sensitive personal data .
Mr Perry also referred to the Lloyd´s affair .
Good cooperation is sometimes marked by a degree of tension .
Without doubt , as the rapporteur himself acknowledged today , the right hand of the proposed non-military rapid reaction unit and European police force will be the European army , which the Laeken Summit will be busy preparing in a few day 's time .
