the opportunities provided by structural and research policy .
We must construct a legal area in which everyone feels protected by law , irrespective of where they are in the area of the EU.
These are precisely the issues also touched upon by Mr Wiersma .
As a rule , the members of the June List cannot therefore vote in favour of the various reports within the agricultural sphere that are presented to the European Parliament .     The purpose of the regulation with which the report is concerned is to employ support measures to improve social conditions , employment and the completion of a free-trade area for the area of Europe and the Mediterranean .
We believe that the European Communities should not have that competence .
Among the Convention’s just over one hundred members , women , young people and critics of the EU were seriously under-represented .
No votes took place in plenary , and Giscard himself decided how the majorities looked .
The June List recommends instead that those countries that are affected by loan guarantees and that benefit from these should themselves stand as guarantors of those loans or find other players in the free market to do so .
Measures concerning illegal immigration and residence , including the repatriation of illegal immigrants , should be an issue for the Member States’ national parliaments .
The EU institutions can , of course , have a standard document portfolio for those seeking employment with these institutions .
I wish to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on his very skilful work , for his considerable sensitivity to views from the various committees and , in general , for his efficient handling of our deliberations .
We must protect our long-term development programmes if we are to have a chance of making a constructive contribution to the work on achieving the millennium objectives .
When it comes to the specific focus in heading 4 , I am very pleased to have gained a hearing for the demand that the budget be more clearly oriented towards poverty alleviation .
More resources are being earmarked for the work on reducing the spread of HIV , malaria and TB.
It will place a restriction on the annual budgets right up until 2013 .
This means a significant rise in expenditure .
They demanded that the financial perspective should include an expenditure ceiling of 1 % of gross national income .
After 2013 , there will be no way of expanding over and above general economic growth unless all the countries agree to give up their right of veto .
Without monitoring by the individual Member States , there is no limit upon the EU’s ambition to grow into a federal superstate .
It is not only a cost in terms of money but also a cost to the environment , which I think is incredibly important .
My question is based on the fact that there are many who would limit the opportunities for public service to operate .
Recently , OLAF revealed that economic aid for Lesotho did not get through and that the resources were thus not used for the purpose intended .
In northern Europe , onerous special conditions apply that have not disappeared .
This means , among other things , that it needs to be possible for all waste water , including that from Saint Petersburg , to be cleaned .
The research priorities must support development of whole regions that have lived apart for historical reasons , such as the Baltic region and Central Europe .
Most Swedes , especially parents , are in favour of the latter approach .
Penalties that enable drug addicts to choose care instead of prison are not a crime against human rights .
Instead , we wish to give clear and unambiguous signals that reject drugs .
Our approach is directed towards releasing people from drug dependency , not seeing them hooked on drugs .     Mr President , the Swedish June List is strongly critical of the report we are debating today .
For us , it is important for Sweden’s restrictive drugs policy to continue in the future too .
We object to drugs being classified as soft or hard , as well as to the assertion that so-called soft drugs are not addictive .
In conclusion , I would note that drug problems in the EU are in large measure a consequence of the prevailing poverty in many countries in the world .
Shall we give up and just limit the damage ?
According to Mr Catania’s report , the restrictive policy has failed .
The restrictive policy has led to dramatic reductions specifically in the number of drug users recruited .
In countries such as the Netherlands , too , the attitude has changed over the last ten years .
Now , only a third of the country ’s so-called coffee shops remain .
Anyone who wants to see fewer drugs in Europe should vote against Mr Catania’s report .     Mr President , I would warn against the terms ‘soft ’ and ‘hard ’ drugs .
I have visited many different treatment centres for drug addicts where just about all addicts have agreed that what are mistakenly called soft drugs started them off on the drug misuse that destroyed their lives and robbed them of their future .
The small increase we have seen in Sweden in recent years has been due partly to the open borders and partly to the influence of the legalisation debate taking place elsewhere in the EU.     Mr President , the draft law we are debating in this House today will be of great significance for public health in Europe and for Europeans ’ confidence in food safety .
The internal market is incredibly important .
We are also adopting a position on a standard for good agricultural practice .
It is good that there have been improvements to the Food Safety Authority in terms of both time and resources .
