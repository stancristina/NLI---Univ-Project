.
Over a year ago , the Commission presented a regulation on which State should be held responsible for studying asylum requests , known as the ' Dublin II Regulation' , which , I hope , will be concluded by the end of this year and the Commission will , in November , present its action plan for returns policy , as well as a framework for financial action for cooperation with third countries in the fight against illegal immigration .
And if we wish to combat secondary movements , if we wish to combat 'asylum shopping ' it would be of little value merely to include only the Geneva Convention .
It is not the Commission proposals that are blocking the Council 's decision-making ability .
This is the situation in thirteen of the fifteen Member States , and has recently also been incorporated into German law .
The Commission is seeking to establish a degree of approximation in legislation at European level , but which is in line and coherent with the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention of November 2001 .
The proposal caters for aggravating circumstances and also seeks to force Member States to designate operational points of contact , available around the clock and seven days a week , with a view to facilitating the exchange of information on attacks against information systems .
As a matter of fact , this was the solution adopted for the issue of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography .
Hacking , in whatever form , is an economic risk , risks a loss of confidence in electronic commerce and also poses a threat to individual privacy .
It is , in fact , extremely important to boost the diversification of funding sources and to strengthen sponsorship policies , with the corresponding tax relief likely to attract sponsors .
What makes no sense is to reduce supply and funding for supply without seeing any significant growth in audiences , which are still lacking .
Nevertheless , I am in favour of the original initiative received in Parliament , because , in line with the Tampere European Council , we advocate the approximation of rules in the field of refugee status , and of other subsidiary measures , with regard to those persons who , although denied the aforementioned refugee status , are in need of identical protection .
Furthermore , the Commission proposal betrays an obsession with regulation , an attempt to harmonise criminal law and a suppressive rather than preventive viewpoint , with which we cannot agree .
In short , I think that Parliament has contributed to improving the proposal for a framework decision intended to provide a response to cybercrime by seeking to approximate the legal provisions of the Member States in order to guarantee that all attacks against information systems become a criminal offence and by promoting police and judicial cooperation .
Lastly , to follow this train of thought , I think that we must attach particular value to private initiatives - because these are the spontaneous expression of the Community 's cultural heartbeat - instead of devoting our energies to direct action by the State or by public authorities .
The most important aspect of this situation is the revision of the financial perspective .
Having said this , I should like to say something about a particular case : that of East Timor .
I therefore believe it is right and crucial that the situation that has been created should be rectified in plenary .
Child pornography , both on - and offline , is also covered .
The age of sexual consent , as defined by national law , is , however , used as a dividing line for different levels of penalties .
Europol has produced a report on this subject , demonstrating that it is very active in combating child pornography .
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the framework decision just adopted by the Council will be part of the acquis .
For instance , in the case of material that comes from third countries , we need to use the common cooperation agreements on mutual legal assistance to request the authorities of those Member States to act against those who produce such material .
They have been recognised by Article 6( 2 ) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
The political nature of the offence cannot be put forward as grounds for non-execution .
Secondly , I would like to emphasise the role of police cooperation and the exchange of information between intelligence services on terrorist activities , based in particular on Europol 's anti-terrorist unit and the special team of anti-terrorist magistrates in Eurojust .
I would say that , from this point of view , this is a legitimate concern and that the wording chosen is perfectly reasonable .
I should also like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of this aspect .
This is clearly the aim of the new financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities , which will enter into force on 1 January 2003 , and , specifically , the aim of the new implementing rules proposed by the Commission .
The report by Mr van Hulten whom I welcome and congratulate personally , therefore deserves the support of the European Parliament .
Let us add solidarity to this list .
President Chirac is mistaken .
This is a question of the EU 's loyalty and honesty towards its partners .
I also wish to highlight the need to support the creation of reporting systems on a regional basis that would be linked to the integrated network of national incident reporting systems , thereby providing an entire region with information about various situations .
