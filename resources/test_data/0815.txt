The victims of this type of crime are particularly vulnerable human beings , in particular children .
In relation to the situation in Mozambique , the Commission has contacted the Office of the Attorney General , who has assured it that investigations are under way .
Albania , as I mentioned earlier , is one of the countries alleged to be the scene of activities of trafficking in children 's organs , whose destination is , allegedly , the European Union .
In this context , and in view of the weaknesses detected when trying to move forward the Greek initiative , it is important to mention that Europol 's competences were extended in January 2002 to include illicit trade in human organs and tissues .
This shortage of organs can encourage illicit trade .
From the point of view of ethics , I have no interest in discussing the reasons behind this criminal activity , whether it be for reasons of witchcraft , organ trafficking or whatever .
I should like to make three points on the matter .
This brings us to my second point .
I called for an integrated Community approach and for the definition both of offences in the trafficking of human organs and tissues and their respective penalties to be harmonised .
In so doing we are not diluting , but strengthening the instruments and resources to combat this common evil .     Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , we are pleased to see that the question that we raised on the trafficking of human beings and children in Mozambique has sparked a broader debate on the illegal trafficking of human organs and tissues , not only in the EU , but on an altogether wider scale .
Mystery surrounds the existence or otherwise in Mozambique of an international child-trafficking network for obtaining organs .
At its root is greed , and it knows no scruples .
As this gruesome market is allowed to operate , when insufficient numbers of organs appear for sale , the criminals then , in cold blood , bridge the gap in supply by abducting , or even killing people .
The framework decision proposed by the Greek Presidency must be approved without delay , in order to ensure that all Member States can eradicate this trafficking , as suppliers , as receivers or as a field of operation .
It is possible that in Nampula there has been not one but many tragic events , possibly involving the trafficking of human beings and children , or the trafficking of organs for witchcraft or other non-medical uses and the trafficking of human organs to support international networks .
This is precisely , however , why we must put across , with patience and perseverance , the notion that it is not the embarrassment that is the problem ; the problem is the trafficking and the crime .
These are the areas where we must act , in cooperation with the competent authorities , in order to raise awareness , to offer encouragement and practical help , to process and exchange information , to prise out the whole truth , to put people’s minds at ease and to dismantle the networks , wherever they may appear .
Thirdly , there is a certain complexity as regards the enforcement of criminal measures , given that , as we know , the beneficiaries of the transplants of illicitly obtained organs are , more often than not , European , although those transplants are carried out in third countries , which raises the question of criminal punishment based on the principle of the national territory in which the criminal act was committed .
The Greenland Protocol has been subject to serious criticism in the past .
As a response to the lack of transparency , a budgetary support programme has been introduced , and the Greenland Home Rule Government has committed itself to performing a structural reform of its fisheries policies .
This is in full respect of the principle of relative stability and Article 20(5 ) of the basic regulation .
I also welcome Commissioner Vitorino’s intervention .
We now have the chance to rectify this injustice , and this opportunity to rectify injustice consists of allowing quotas not taken up by the States holding them to be used by Portugal and Spain .
Firstly , I shall try to clarify the Commission 's position concerning the amendments that have been tabled .
Indeed , the budgetary authority must give the Commission the means and the legal basis to ensure the sound financial management of this agreement .
The determination of the fishing possibilities is made on the basis of scientific reports .
I want to say that in 2003 the commercial value of the catches , including the real catches of the transfers made to Norway , Iceland and the Faroes amounted to EUR 50 million .
On Amendment No 3 , we agree with the spirit thereof , but we believe that the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information in line with both the current interinstitutional arrangements and , in particular , with the framework agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament .
This review introduces a range of adjustments , but does not alter the level of financial compensation , which remains at EUR 42 820 000 per year .
We feel , however , that the wording of Amendment No 5 is more acceptable , and that this Amendment should , accordingly , be approved in plenary .     .
More than 3 300 vehicles are stolen every day , which corresponds to approximately one theft every 25 seconds .
Why direct access ?
It would be too much for the police to check all these cars systematically in the SIS.
Including an article in the Schengen Convention would confer greater transparency on the entire
