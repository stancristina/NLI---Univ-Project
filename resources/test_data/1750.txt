1999 Country Report .
Young Tamil men in particular can find themselves being a victim of violent coercion by the Tamil Tigers and violent interrogation by the security services .
It is clear that thousands of people have been displaced within Sri Lanka .
Thousands more have sought asylum and the whole population lives in fear of violence .
We cannot say what the exact state of affairs is at the moment as there is a complete media blackout in force as part of a set of new restrictive laws introduced in May .
The resolution is clear .
Those laws must be lifted before the elections in August .
Something has to change .
We have to do what we can to work for a peaceful and lasting settlement .
It is clear that the international community is no longer prepared to see internal armed struggle as only a problem for the state concerned and that long-term political investment and negotiations are necessary rather than arms sales .
Northern Ireland is a clear example of the difficulties of such a process , but also the possibilities .
This resolution is important in its call for immediate cessation of hostilities and the lack of preconditions is a welcome move .
The situation would also be helped by agreement between the Sri Lankan political parties themselves and we welcome the efforts of the Norwegian and other governments and feel that the Commonwealth could have a very valuable role to play in this situation .
Mr President , this is an historic day and an historic debate because , after 17 years of war in Sri Lanka , the European Parliament for the first time is actually debating how to bring peace to this war-torn island .
In 1948 , when Sri Lanka obtained independence , it was one of the most prosperous countries in South Asia .
In 1952 , Lee Kuan Yew , the newly elected Prime Minister of Singapore , said : " My ambition is to make Singapore emulate Sri Lanka in prosperity , education and standard of living " .
Forty-eight years later , that beautiful island of Sri Lanka has been smashed by a terrorist group now recognised as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world .
There are four million Tamils in Sri Lanka and there are 15 million Sinhalese .
One million Tamils live in the north ; the other three million live in peace in the south with the Sinhalese .
They hold high office in Colombo , the present foreign minister is Tamil , the country ' s leading businessmen are Tamil , so are judges , doctors , lawyers and cabinet ministers - the list goes on .
Yet this pointless war also carries on , to serve the single purpose of a terrorist leader pursuing his own ambition .
The resolution states how many people he has killed .
The LTTE has to be stopped .
I ask Member States to proscribe this terrorist organisation and to help build peace and stability in Sri Lanka and strongly support the initiative currently being taken by the Norwegian and Indian governments .
Mr President , I yield to no one in my desire for peace in Sir Lanka and in my condemnation of all violence .
However , I say to Mrs Foster and Mr Heaton-Harris that they want to check their stories and sources because it needs both sides in a conflict to be committed if a lasting solution is to be achieved .
I know Sri Lanka , I have been there .
I can give you examples of what I have seen .
I have seen Tamil men being harassed on the streets by government troops .
I know that Tamil people need 11 pages of documents just to travel from Batticaloa in the east to the capital , Colombo .
And like everyone here in this Parliament , and all European journalists , I have been unable to go to Jaffna recently , nor have I seen any television coverage of the battle at Elephant Pass .
I have seen the fighting in Sierra Leone , Chechnya , Kosovo but nothing from Sri Lanka because the Sri Lankan Government does not allow press coverage .
That goes back longer than last May .
This is a government whose defence budget has risen by 11 % in a year and which , one day , will have to answer allegations of involvement in the assassination of leading Tamil figures and other human rights abuses .
Let us have a peace for all Sri Lankans , based on citizens ' rights , humanity and in which government resources are directed at building communities , not helping to destroy them .
The struggle in Iran for reform and freedom is of great interest .
There have been considerable reasons for optimism in the election of President Khatami and the overwhelming vote for reformist candidates in the February elections but , as Human Rights Watch notes , the struggle to control the press is , in many ways , the struggle to control the future direction of the Islamic Republic as a whole .
The very success of the reformist agenda seems to have provoked a backlash by the conservative reactionary forces and an attempt to punish the majority who voted in February for reform .
They are targeting the independent press because it is a major channel for reformists .
These attempts surely cannot succeed in the long run because the youthful population is impatient for change showing that Islam and guarantees of rights and freedoms are perfectly compatible .
We must do all in our power to encourage and support reform , including especially basic legal safeguards for freedom of expression as required by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Iran is a signatory .
