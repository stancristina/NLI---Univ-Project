if the Seguro resolution is passed tomorrow - and I would have liked to make it even stronger - we have to recognise that it is a proposal contradicting the recent statements by Mr Jospin and the French government .
We have already endured that situation .
The Nice Summit exhausted the intergovernmental method which necessarily involves difficult mediation between national interests .
What is needed now is a constituent convention to define , before the European elections , a model capable of guaranteeing democracy and efficiency in Union action .
Parliament must promote a debate going beyond the pragmatism that ties the hands of the national governments .
He did not tell us what the outcome was though , which suggests to me that not much was achieved .
Mr President , it is very significant that Parliament is devoting a large part of its agenda today to a debate on the future of the Union with three reports - the Hulth√©n , Blokland and Myller reports - dealing with three complementary aspects of the same strategy .
We must succeed in ensuring that all the instruments provided by the programme - legislative , fiscal , financial , scientific , cultural and informative - can actually be used .
In this connection , extending the scope of the directive to a whole raft of plans and programmes co-financed by the Union represents a great step forwards .
Behind us we have numerous decisions of the Court of Justice but , most importantly , we have the Treaty of Amsterdam which , from the legal standpoint , gives us the opportunity to consolidate and make more effective the legal instruments which , as we are quite aware , are instruments , but vital instruments for implementing active policies and for putting the principle of equal opportunities into practice , even as regards access to employment .
I know Mr de Roo will forgive me as he is a very nice man .
If we want a Europe we should also have European parties .
If the environment can be clean and accessible for the elderly , it will also be so for those who are young like you , Mr President .
Even if there is just one single woman minister , it will mean that Mr Berlusconi has listened to my explanation of vote , which will make me very happy .
Mr President , Mr Blokland has presented a report on the environment and the economy , on the needs of the environment and on economic policy .
Naturally , I voted for the motion .
Mr President , after complimenting Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Klamt on their fine work , I would like to make two comments , one general and the other institutional in nature .
We imagine that by giving our children everything they ask for , through the benefits of consumerism - I say this as a father - we are giving them some kind of happiness .
All this is in the face of a massive offensive by organised crime and the shadiest traffic , like money laundering and tax evasion .
Mr President , while complimenting the rapporteur on his work I venture to raise some doubt about the approach whereby , whenever a problem turns up , the response is to create an agency , a body appointed to deal with it or resolve it .
I am of the opinion that this Authority should first and foremost concern itself with issues of food safety and scientific opinions , not , as the text advocates , to avoid contrasting scientific opinions , but indeed , on the contrary , to ensure that all the different scientific opinions see the light of day and perhaps even to allow the democratic assemblies to consider , compare and debate the solutions proposed by science .
Mr President , with today ' s vote , and thanks to the truly exceptional work of our rapporteur , we are taking a fundamental step towards responding to the expectations and , perhaps , the anguish of the European public .
In voting for Amendment No 215 , therefore , we call for the co-decision procedure to be applied .
From this angle , the establishment of a European Food Authority represents the base line , the first step towards bringing protection up to speed and responding to consumers ' demands and also their fears .
Mr President , I would like to welcome my mother , my sister and my wife who are sitting in the public gallery .
The White Paper on Food Safety is dated January 2000 .
I have to say that this had been done even before the directives were passed .
By-products in the first and second categories should be traceable through the use of dyes or odorants and should be prohibited .
Only those in the third category are to be permitted as ingredients in animal fodder .
I should add that I associate with many older people as national secretary of the Italian Pensioners Party , and my mother is also one of them .
The Alleanza Nazionale group has frequently denounced the urgent need to intervene and impose strict controls and prohibitions on the Internet , which represents one of the main channels of communication and distribution of both audio and video child pornography , making the service provider criminally responsible for the content of the services provided .
The Commission must take responsibility for dealing with this unspeakable situation and negotiate with international organisations and governments to block the use of the Internet for illicit purposes .
' You did well to vote for the report against trafficking in human beings !
' Ah ! ' she exclaimed .
Mr President , I hope you and all the interpreters and officials who have had the patience to stay in the Chamber with me have a very good lunch
