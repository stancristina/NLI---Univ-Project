of areas that are controversial ?
I am also very pleased that individual producer liability has been specified again in the food legislation .
Some of Europe 's most important food exports in fact consist of traditional cheeses and hams and so on which require special production methods without , however , being hazardous as a result .
That is an extremely emotive issue , and I think we have arrived at a good compromise which both pheasant and elk hunters will be able to live with .
In one area - namely , that of the way in which game is dealt with - the Commission 's proposal would have created major problems if had been put into effect .
I am therefore especially grateful that account has been taken of the fact that game can be monitored in different ways , that we have different climatic conditions and therefore need different refrigeration periods and that we can also organise training in different ways .
When , in September , we begin hunting in the morning , it is often freezing , and the climate at that time of the year corresponds to the temperature in a refrigerator .
The EU directives must hold good in all parts of the EU.
It is important to emphasise that they are mistaken , for the EU has no legal powers to regulate hunting for household requirements and the use of game for private consumption .
.
It is necessary to obtain a clear and unambiguous picture of the zoonoses situation in Europe .
Even in our own time , the most common causes of mortality among infants are in actual fact infectious illnesses and diarrhoea .
The problem is greatest for children and young people .
The most important thing of all about the monitoring directive is that we should obtain common standards so that the information collected is comparable between the different countries .
That is probably the most important feature of the monitoring directive .
The control regulation is perhaps more controversial .
There are also Member States affected by salmonella panic of the kind that exists in my own country .
It took our country 25-30 years to put in place a system that worked .
I think that the proposal is extremely cautious .
It is strange that , in certain places , only two kinds are included , even though it is precisely these that account for 80 % of illnesses among people today .
How can the Commission know what type of salmonella will explode onto the scene tomorrow ?
Species of animal are also missing from the Commission 's proposal .
We know , for example , that a very great source of infection with salmonella aruba is Brazilian soya .
It is , after all , life with which we are concerned here , life which is in some ways as intelligent as ourselves , even if the intelligence concerned is not perhaps to be found in the same place or does not express itself in the same way .
The constitutions of four EU Member States protect the sanctity of life to the extent that they prohibit research on stem cells taken from embryos , or unborn children .
There are therefore serious shortcomings in the ethical standards for the Sixth Framework Programme , especially with regard to research involving human embryos .
Member States must not be obliged , as is currently the case , to fund research that is illegal and unconstitutional in their own countries .
As a Swede , I can only deplore the fact that Russia now has greater influence over NATO than does Sweden .
Yet the accusation is extremely unfair .
I really would like to believe that they might work in the Middle East , too .
There can be no peace as long as they continue .
It is also deeply tragic that the independent UN investigation into the events in Jenin did not go ahead .
Naturally , as Commissioner Patten says , Israel must provide evidence for the very serious accusations that the EU has funded terrorism .
I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for taking the matter seriously , and for attempting to find out what is happening and report back to us .
This is not the first conference .
What should actually be on the agenda , then ?
There is no agreement here .
Mr President , openness will be one of the most important yardsticks for citizens in assessing the results of the EU 's efforts concerning future reform .
The EU institutions must show citizens that they are prepared to live up to their expectations .
The Inter-institutional Committee has an important brief and it must push ahead and implement existing legislation in a spirit of greater openness .
Particularly in view of Spain 's earlier reticence , it is now important to demonstrate a more positive approach to openness .
This would be the logical follow-up to your earlier comments .
The answer I received has much to say about agreements .
Would German soldiers be able to assist Finland in guarding its external border with Russia ?
Indeed , the EU acquis is no game of dominoes , but affects 370 million people .
Mr Lamassoure 's report is therefore an extremely important contribution to the Convention and to the domestic debate in our Member States .
The proposal provides a clear , instructive catalogue of what the EU is and should be doing .
The EU must be stronger in certain areas , but there must also be safeguards against the EU taking on new duties that would best be carried out by citizens themselves in municipalities , regions or national parliaments .
If we want the EU to be able to function with thirty Member States , then it must focus its power and commitment on the genuinely cross-border issues
