I should like to state the following for the record : I have nothing to take back as regards my statement that the extreme right is abusing this House for rabble-rousing purposes .
In November 1999 , we here in Parliament , and I assume you too Commissioner , believed that we were on the home stretch and were finally going to be able to implement EURODAC.
I personally take a different view on this .
A common immigration law means that we have no more internal borders and take responsibility for the people entering the European Union at the external borders .
We tabled a proposed amendment seeking to reduce this period to two years and it became clear during discussions with the Commission that it too was willing to go along with this proposed amendment .
These new data bases will form part of the bovine animal labelling and registration system set out in the regulation .
Hence , Mr Byrne , when you say I should consider withdrawing the amendment , I should like to ask you to consider if you do not agree with it , especially as it complies with the decision on comitology .
All in all , our Group will vote in favour of this trade agreement , which we welcome .
The second is scientific and technical cooperation .
It was under this banner that the Mexican civil society called a few days ago for the Senate to improve the agreement and not to rush into signing it .
In my opinion , the following priorities should be taken care of by the Union and should have been addressed as core points in Mrs Read ' s report , for which I should like , at this point , to thank her .
I have inadvertently run over time , but allow me to use my closing sentence to stress once again that I welcome the e-Europe initiative and to say that the suggestions which I had made would have been taken into account in my intervention .
For example , there are numerous initiatives to promote the Internet and computers in schools .
First : Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam clearly calls for the principle of sustainability to be integrated into all policies .
This goal , in my view , does not justify the concerns raised here about a possible division in society between the haves and have-nots as far as access to information is concerned .
Schools without computers must become the exception .
Mr President , one other brief point .
Now more members may have left from one group than from other and that may well distort the vote on the Ludford report .
The rapporteur has stated that she agrees with your suggestion , i .e . with the President ' s suggestion .
However , it will do nothing to improve the living and working conditions of the Mexicans , on the contrary .
These are subject to the employment law of the Member States and the autonomy of the social partners .
By giving in , the Commission has lost the confidence of many who see sustainable development as a chance for the next generation .

We too are required to grant Chechens political asylum in our countries .
The European Union - and we have debated human rights , xenophobia and discrimination at length over the past few days - must fight against this extremism with all the means at its disposal wherever it occurs , at home , in the candidate countries or throughout the entire world .
The political and military situation needs to be further stabilised in order to create a climate for bilateral talks .
This is a practical example of the difficulties inherent in the fight against organised crime and clearly illustrates the need for a cross-border , or rather a pan-European approach .
That was our reason for withdrawing them .
Firstly : the Ludford report flouts and violates the underlying principle of subsidiarity by calling in points 4 , 6 , 27 second indent , 11 and 20 for measures such as the recruitment of third country nationals to public office or formal requirements to change curricula and teacher training programmes .
