In my opinion , Mr Trentin was right to refer in his recommendation to the age-old , noble values of which the Europeans are traditionally the champions ; the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore made good progress along this road , which is the road to the practical creation of an essentially inclusive European State with a sound economy .
This is , of course , an excellent proposal , but we are overlooking the fact that two years have passed already and that the European economy is still at the starting post , that the necessary reforms are being postponed or diluted from summit to summit and that the hopes of Europe 's unemployed of economic growth bringing them work are still linked to the resumption of growth in the US economy , which is the motor for growth .
Mr President , Mrs Maij-Weggen 's report refers to the list of documents to be made accessible to the public .
I was reflecting that the security envisaged for us by Mrs Foster is so very secure that I hope aircraft do not lose that swaying , rocking motion which enables us to sleep even when we are up among the clouds .
Well then , Mr President , when I went to catch my flight at Milan Malpensa airport , instead of the group of pensioners who usually come to see me off , I found the notary , Mr Barbati , who is my own notary .
' What are you doing here , notary ? '
When are we going to concern ourselves , then , Mr President , with the bad debt of States as regards pensions ?
In the dream , however , Mr President , Mrs Pack picked up a club and set about beating me , she beat me , reproaching me : ' What are you going to say tomorrow at the European Parliament when you explain why you voted for the motion ? '
I am sorry , Mr President , but I reflected that , with the passing of time , young people and workers become pensioners if they are lucky .
The great Dante Alighieri writes in the Divine Comedy that , after crossing the Pillars of Hercules , Ulysses set off again across the sea for further adventure .
The answer , Mr President , is that the Pensioners ' Party has a section called ' Young people for pensioners' , and it has a great many young members on its books and in the assemblies where it has been elected .
Like Uncle Scrooge , he was swimming in euro coins , and he said to me : ' My dream is that all the candidate countries will adopt the euro immediately : indeed , the whole world should adopt the euro . '
with three buildings , and three offices for each Member and each employee .
Mr President , before the Members of the European Parliament and the citizens who , in order to be able to work properly and express their opinions , are raising an issue concerning the European Parliament and the fact that a third of the budget is being used to maintain a circus which is of no use to anyone , this is being held up as an example of populism .
Mr President , I am afraid that Mr Duhamel cannot tell the difference between what is populist and what is popular .
It is impossible to deny that a biblical exodus towards the Union countries is taking place .
We must distinguish between the regular immigrants who have been living in our countries for years and those who enter them illegally , often without a real excuse , who are serving , sometimes even unwittingly , the purposes of certain criminal groups .
I should like to say that if , as he says , ' Holland is full ' , so is Italy , so is Padania , so is Europe .
The approach proposed by the Commission involves a comprehensive policy which addresses all the issues - economic , social , political and humanitarian - and provides for close cooperation between government actions and initiatives of the social partners , the associations and local and regional authorities .
Immigration is seen solely as a threat against which the country must defend itself , people 's fears are fed and it is promised that the problem will miraculously disappear ; populist slogans imply that the State and the police are justified in anything they do to secure order .
The failure to carry out pension reform in the principle European countries is preventing savings benefiting from economic growth , is jeopardising national budgets and is a source of intergenerational injustice .
The calls for pension reform are repeated year after year , month after month , but no action is taken in the Member States : do you not think that it is necessary for the Commission to make more specific statements , giving more specific figures and requiring more specific undertakings , not least in order to inform the public of what is happening , of the risks we are running in the area of pensions and the risks we are continuing to hand on to the new generations ?
Now , however , the sceptics - or many of them , at least - acknowledge their mistake and have changed their views .
