appropriate committees .
For the potentially most dangerous substances , it is of fundamental importance for these to be evaluated between now and the 31st December of this year , and if not prohibited from the 1st January 1998 .
Today we do not have to debate the substance .
It was past noon and we should have started the votes .
In reality , a conditional censure is a phoney censure .
With fixed customs on internal frontiers having been abolished and documents which accompany goods having been eliminated too , controls are becoming very difficult .
This is why I have signed the tabling of the motion of censure and will of course vote for it tomorrow .
I will also vote for immediate censure , on Thursday .
What will the effects be on human health in ten years , in twenty years ?
It has thus prevented States such as France and Germany from protecting their nationals from contaminated meal imports .
No way is it a question of overturning a pseudo-government which is not the Commission .
There should also be regulations which encourage the integration of all real costs in the pricing of different modes of transport .
The determining question in this respect is as follows : how , in a completely open and unprotected economy , can a country or group of countries decide tomorrow on a higher social policy than that of its neighbours , without increasing its charges and thus disqualifying itself in competition ?
Is it Utopic to hope that in Amsterdam , in June , the Council will establish social convergence criteria aiming to ensure , for all citizens of the Union , the highest possible level of social protection , while safeguarding and renewing our social security systems ?
In particular , it requests that the social security regime continue to rest on the principle of solidarity , and pleads for a transfer of the tax burdening labour to other sectors .
It might therefore be useful for the Commission to continue its reflection by examining in particular to what measure the introduction , for example , of a parental wage instead of the existing specific allocations , would encourage the development of informal family services which our society , in its current structure , needs most and from which it would draw the most benefit .
Even less by posing as lesson-giver through resolutions which risk reducing dialogue between members of Parliament and Algeria , with the issue of successive resolutions which lead to negative reactions .
Nevertheless , the Algerian authorities do not appear to be unduly concerned about this terrorism , which they qualify as 'residual ' .
The Euro-Mediterranean agreement must be targeted on development projects and projects which recognize the important role of women .
It is an entirely democratic , humanistic duty .
With reason , we are giving lessons on Turkey .
Because I believe that we should push each other towards a certain laicity .
At all events , my country , which already has many towns in the hands of racists and xenophobes , would be in a particularly bad position for doing so .
Within the Arab world , sound States constitute the best possible counterweights against the propagation of an Islamic fundamentalism which generates instability .
You know well that the calls issued from Boulevard Saint-German in Paris or from this floor will not save a single Algerian life .
This burden has become crushing .
Barbarism should never be answered with barbarism .
A few days later , President Boudiaf was assassinated .
Mr President , Commissioner , my dear colleagues , the Council 's draft regulations submitted to us have received the approval of our group , but I am led to make two comments , one on procedure , and the other on substance .
The constitutional Council in France , the constitutional Court in Italy , the constitutional Court in Germany and the European Court of Justice in the Kalanke judgement , have condemned the measures which systematically favour , in an equal situation , the recruitment of women in the name of the famous principle of equality .
We must never forget : if there had been no Commission , if there had been no Parliament , we should still be dealing with fifteen totally partitioned telecommunications markets , fifteen monopolies or virtual monopolies .
But if the United States had followed Mrs Read 's policy , it would never have arrived where it is .
I would remind the House that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights rejected Mrs Lindholm 's report and that , at the end of a long debate , we unanimously agreed to submit the Commission 's proposal to Parliament unamended .
However , this system does not cover every situation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are a few months away from completing the liberalization of the European telecommunications market , and we already have a number of directives on the subject .
The second point I would like to challenge relates to the implicit recognition of homosexual marriage .
( The President interrupted the speaker ) who betrayed the inter-institutional agreement ...
They failed to do so , because it was Mr Major who took that initiative last spring .
I shared that point of view and supported the joint motion for a resolution , which recommended that procedure in point 7.
That is one of the beneficial effects of this operation .
Furthermore , the way in which President Santer has just left the Chamber once the vote had gone his way might give us cause for scepticism and anxiety .
The motion of censure which I sponsored , and for which I and my colleagues in the Europe of Nations Group then voted , was aimed first and foremost at the Commission because of its irresponsible behaviour in the mad cow crisis
