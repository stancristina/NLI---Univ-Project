same constructive approach when it comes to solving the major outstanding problems , above all in category 4 , concerned with external expenditure .
Now that we have reduced this deficit and in actual fact anticipate a slight surplus for next year , we note that , in a long-term perspective , it is , in all likelihood , specifically 2003 that will be the big problem .
Allow me to emphasise that there are now only two and a half months left before the final decision is made on which countries are to become new Member States .
There are six months to go before it will be possible for 147 observers from future Member States to be present here in the European Parliament .
It is the year when , hopefully , ten new Member States will have taken their places , the year when we take decisive steps towards the reunification of a Europe that has always been divided into East and West .
The necessary reforms , especially here in Parliament , are in full swing , and it will be possible for them to take place within the set budget framework and within the time we have available to us .
As a first step in the right direction , Parliament and the Council have agreed on the broad lines of the administrative budget .
Rather , it is a commitment on the part of all of us .
That is what we call frontloading .
When it comes to the provision of information on the common currency , this ought as far as possible to be focused on those countries that are members of the EU but that have still not introduced the euro .
Regarding programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises , I note that the Commission 's draft budget has included the change proposed last year by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs concerning access to venture capital .
Finally , I want to emphasise that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believes that the amount introduced into Parliament 's own budget for studies and the provision of advice may be insufficient , given the expressed objective of using more external expertise in connection with complicated legislative matters .
Alongside the budget , we are working - as you know , Commissioner Nielson - on the directive that you are responsible for and that is to lay down the rate for the next four years , for which the Commission has proposed a total amount of EUR 300 million .
Mr Howitt has already mentioned focusing on health , education and efforts to combat poverty .
I should like to say to Mr Nielson that one of the reasons why we are returning to these areas in order to clarify them is that the Commission 's work in the field indicates that it is specifically health care and education that still receive an extremely small proportion of the aid , something we regard as being manifestly wrong and clearly not good enough .
The second is the draft mid-term review .
The 2003 budget is not influenced by the mid-term review .
I share that perspective and I wish , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , to explain that we fully support that assessment .
I believe this is necessary and , even though we do not have any formal influence , our support is badly needed as a matter of urgency .
The economy has stagnated , and the European Employment Strategy faces major challenges .
This pattern must be broken .
The national and regional parliaments must be allowed to debate and decide on the national action plans .
That is an incredibly important issue .
It is not enough for officials to cooperate better across borders .
Secondly , the Commission 's synchronisation report is concerned , to my surprise , with only two processes , namely the economy and employment .
I wonder what happened to the social process .
If the social process were to be squeezed out , integrated overall solutions would soon be replaced by the perspective of the employer alone .
The method is still in its infancy .
We also need important changes in the Member States if we are ever to obtain a coordinated and effective European employment process .
He has been very constructive .
Nevertheless , there remains a lot to be done , just as the Commission 's document states .
There are also big regional differences within Europe .
On the other hand , the adaptability pillar , which is a little more difficult to understand , has not been as successful .
When coordination takes place , no area must be given precedence over another .
I regard open coordination as a complement to legislation , not as an alternative to it .
It goes without saying that they must be debated and decided upon in the national parliaments .
It is important for them to be involved in devising policy , both at European level and at the other levels .
It is also important , as mentioned in our proposal , for the candidate countries to be integrated into this process at an early stage .
Consequently , the candidate countries need to be involved in this process soon .
We must not forget , however , that economic policy , employment policy and the respective councils must be accorded equal value .
It is not possible to measure the gain that nonetheless results when we see that more people have access to water , proper sanitation , food and an environment with fewer chemicals .
Many have compared our wish list to some sort of Christmas tree with an overabundance of decorations .
Our frustration also expresses itself when we are not able to make use of our abilities and our knowledge at summits
