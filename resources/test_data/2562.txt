has been at the forefront of the discussions we have had during debates on the Fifth Framework Programme .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I should like to thank Parliament and in particular its Vice-President , Mr Vidal-Quadras , for this high-quality report .
It is , indeed , generally accepted that this delaying strategy , which has also been implemented by many Member States , is in fact extremely costly and that faster decommissioning would make it possible to manage the sites and the waste generated , as well as the available resources , better .
Obviously , from a personal point of view , I would prefer a much more structural solution , as you stressed in your report , and in your proposal to convene a trialogue you are sending out a clear message : the matter is specific and sensitive enough to warrant being examined by experts from the three institutions .
The Commission also mentioned that the solutions adopted by Member States are not easy to apply at Community level .
Apparently Commissioner Bolkestein was opposed to extending this derogation .
In comparison with other Member States , Finnish excise duties on alcohol are the highest , and for beer , for example , they are 17 times those in Spain and 44 % higher than those in Ireland which , in the hit-parade of excise duties , comes in second position behind Finland , which is the champion of the European Union , though , admittedly , it is beaten by Norway , which is not a member .
Make of it what you will !
It would be much better for their health .
At the instigation of the chairmen of your Parliament ' s main political groups , Mr Poettering , Mr Bar√≥n Crespo , Mr Cox , Mrs Hautala and Mr Lannoye , you asked the Commission to state its position on a very important and topical issue : the status of political parties in Europe .
Firstly , the requirement for speed : things have perhaps dragged on for too long over a period of ten years , without any solution being found .
That is my first point .
We need this collaboration between the three institutions .
That is what I wanted to say , Mr President - with a few personal observations , of course - on the reasoning behind the Commission ' s position as I explained it just now .
The determination created as a result of that crisis , shared by more than two-thirds of public opinion in the Fifteen Member States of the Union , will not achieve results straightaway .
Unless we take advantage today of these favourable circumstances , we fear that this new policy may become bogged down in various procedures that will , in fact , paralyse it .
With regard to our relations with NATO , I paid great attention to what you said , Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
It would be useful to know whether the Council feels that the upturn in growth in Europe is such as to favour this essential turnaround and how the Council intends to promote it .
This desire to ensure the continuity of American domination in the field of defence , expressed by Vice-President Al Gore , is not in itself reprehensible from his point of view .
All of these amendments are designed to render the Protocol on setting the venues of institutions , which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam , meaningless .
As far back as 1997 , the anti-Strasbourg faction suffered a major defeat at the Court of Justice , having tried to completely remove one of the twelve ordinary monthly part-sessions .
Furthermore , we might think that it is a contradiction to cut the week of the ordinary Strasbourg part-sessions , whilst maintaining the additional part-sessions in Brussels .
.
In such circumstances , we are well aware that the Commission , as is often the case , is currently using a praiseworthy cause - in this case , the anti-smoking campaign - in order to award itself new competencies , in spite of the wording of the Treaties and with no thought for subsidiarity .
A legislator can prohibit or authorise , but should not make sermons in legislative texts , which is what we do here all the time .
Moreover , we should not deceive ourselves as to the problems we are facing , with the decision to threaten aid to Community tobacco production .
To the anti-prohibitionists , who feel that this ban would , on the contrary , make cigarettes more attractive to young people , I would answer with an ethical argument .
In this respect , we can only share this report ' s proposals , which seek more effectively to warn , make aware and inform consumers of the risks to which they are exposing themselves through excessive tobacco consumption .
I imagine that this is what led the rapporteur to "take note " of the Commission ' s proposal , without actually putting it into practice .
For a Union delegation to experience only two problems is quite reasonable , but they are crucial ones .
Even in the working parties , we were not allowed to take the floor , which was always given to the Portuguese Presidency .
Why should we discuss Tunisia ?
Hundreds of prisoners of conscience , who are locked up in intolerable conditions , must be released .
Following the high-school students ' uprising , Taoufik Ben Brik ' s hunger strike finally brought into the open , into the public domain , what international human rights organisations and some Tunisian democrats had been saying and writing for several years : the repressive police regime uses harassment , random punishment , torture , imprisonment , attacks on personal dignity , and prohibits people who wish to live freely from speaking , writing , travelling and meeting
