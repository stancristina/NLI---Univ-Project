taking advantage of the equality policies .
We are not naive : as long as equality is not achieved , implementing horizontal policies which incorporate this objective across the sectors are not enough .
I am firmly convinced that only with us making decisions jointly with the men can that equality truly be obtained .
As Mrs Kokkola has emphasized - and we would like to compliment her on her work , together with all the other rapporteurs - they must not represent just new advances in theory , with no practical effects , and there must no longer be just a few fine words like those about mainstreaming , but quantitative and qualitative ex-ante and ex-post evaluation .
Without prejudice to a desirable and useful link between tourism and culture , it would certainly be perverse and profoundly limiting if support for cultural promotion were to be conditioned by and/or subordinated to the strategies of the tourist industry .4.Attention is drawn to the consequences that the budget cuts required for fulfilment of the nominal convergence criteria are likely to have by weakening or reversing the growth trend in employment in cultural activities , as these depend , at least in part , on government finance , whether national or regional. - Kestelijn-Sierens report ( A4-0257/97 ) Mr President , Mr Commissioner , the European Union has a priority obligation to defend , at all times and in all circumstances , the interests of the Member States and their regions , and also to honour the commitments it has made with third countries .
We think it would be appropriate to affirm now that , along with this policy of quantitative management , the European Union must continue to have available a system of income support , already in existence moreover , and that it must not only be maintained but must be fundamentally strengthened .
That is exactly the perverse effect that has been achieved .
It was this Parliament that gave it strength , it was this Parliament that fed it , and it is this Parliament which now bewails the destruction wrought by the monster it created !
That is a solution because , in fact , there are no alternatives , there is no protection , no protectionism , at this time , only the free traders enjoy it , because they have judges who are , of course , biassed on issues of this kind .
Will it prevent this crop being abandoned so as to maintain the beneficial effects on the countryside and the environment , factors which have so much influence on the tourist industry , itself the generator of tens of thousands of jobs in the ultraperipheral regions , including the Autonomous Region of Madeira ?
I would like to ask the Commissioner what the Commission intends to do to prevent this discrimination between countries , as this is a difficult political issue which we , the politicians , must try to resolve .
In continuing and deepening this policy , the Commission published a document on the next steps in relations between Europe and Japan .
Three , political dialogue with Japan should include human rights issues , especially in other Asian states .
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report is part of a strategy for change working through the privatization of sectors of activity which are linked to a notion or concept of public service .
But it should not prevent us from denouncing it and reconsidering the logic , the process and the dynamic .
And to be so big , so huge , so vast , they are all the same on various scales , and they squeeze out local commerce and oppress the citizens with their ostentatious arrogance and insidious financial facilities .
It is clear today that commerce adds immense value , monitoring the tastes of consumers , letting them know about products and providing them with complementary support on the one hand , while expanding the sales opportunities of those engaged in production on the other .
Recognizing its importance - including political importance , in the best sense of the word - traders and authorities need to join forces to smooth away its limitations and realise its potential .
The report also gives due importance to the unique capacity of commerce to promote border areas .
The fourth annual report of the European Observatory for SMEs provides an extensive and valuable overview of SMEs and the craft sector in all the Member States of the Union .
At the present time it is estimated that 60 to 80 per cent of assisting spouses work in the small and medium-sized business sector .
Adequate social security provisions must be introduced and the areas of law I have just mentioned need to be reformed .
In particular , the high level of inheritance and gift taxes is an important factor inhibiting business transfer in several European countries , so the possibility of reducing or eliminating these taxes should be taken into consideration .
The current companies tax system in many Member States still holds back many small businesses with potential for growth by favouring the investment of profits outside rather than inside the company .
The great question is whether this attention and interest is genuine or just circumstantial and instrumental to mitigate the real destruction working against a relatively balanced network of economic agents so that public opinion recognizes that some effort is being made to counteract a predatory dynamic .
Finally , returning to the attention SMEs deserve , the Industry Round Table where the great directors of vast businesses and multinational groups get together , published a study last July on the establishment of concrete partnerships between large and small companies , setting out five rules of good conduct
