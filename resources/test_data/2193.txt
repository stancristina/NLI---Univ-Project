The Commission 's report on barriers in the internal market for services shows that there are many barriers of both a legislative and a non-legislative nature .
As soon as the Commission has submitted its proposals , the Council and Parliament must consider how the remaining barriers can be removed as quickly as possible .
In the face of global financial markets , regulation must take place at EU level .
The economic benefits of the implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan have been analysed by the so-called 'Gyllenhammer group' , amongst others .
The analysis suggests that financial integration will bring about an annual increase in growth of up to half a per cent of GDP.
Freedom of movement for persons and businesses is also essential .
Many changes to company law , among other things , have been implemented , but a need for further harmonisation has become apparent in the light of such things as the Enron scandal .
The Presidency attaches great importance to ensuring impetus in this matter .
A dynamic consumer policy in an enlarged EU must take account of market developments and the real level of consumer protection needed .
The Green Paper forms a good basis for continued work in this regard .
At its meetings in May and September , the Council reached agreement on the amendment of the public procurement directives , and the Presidency is now working towards communicating a common position to Parliament as quickly as possible .
We must work together to ensure the simplification and improvement of EU legislation by means of effective implementation of the Commission 's action plan .
Studies carried out by the Commission show that better lawmaking could save businesses approximately EUR 50 000 million per annum , corresponding to 4 % of GDP.
In the Council 's conclusions from its meeting on 30 September , priorities included the work on simplification of EU rules , and also impact assessments and methods for following up the implementation of the action plan .
This depends , of course , on the course of the negotiations currently taking place with the European Parliament and the Commission .
The Competitiveness Council , together with the European Parliament and the Commission , has a responsibility for ensuring that we give an impetus to the work on boosting growth and competitiveness in the EU.
Achieving competitive businesses and securing continued economic growth are tasks requiring a concerted effort .
I should like to confine my speech to the European Patent .
This is in line with what Commissioner Bolkestein and the majority of speakers here have said - although the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention it in his speech .
We should give the Council a firm push and urge it to implement a European patent as quickly as possible .
When we take out a patent in the EU , we usually take it out in the USA as well , which means that we have to translate it into English , so why not decide once and for all that a patent taken out in the EU only needs to be issued in English ?
They say : I have an innovative idea , I can sell it worldwide , and therefore I have to translate it into English .
It would increase competitiveness , and would be in keeping with the costs we have to incur in any case .
As I mentioned in my opening speech , we are together making decisions on many proposals affecting the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness of the EU.
I have noted the views expressed today .
Many people have given examples of areas in which the internal market is still stalling .
I can say that I agree with several of these views , and I should like to make the following comments on them .
I support the Commission 's work in keeping an eye on this area .
We must of course achieve the goal - set by the Heads of State and Government at the Stockholm European Council and then in Barcelona - of implementing 98.5 % of the directives by the 2003 spring summit .
It is an extremely important matter .
It was concluded that the Danish Presidency should focus on the judicial system , and we have therefore held discussions in this field on the basis of a consultative document from the Commission that we received in September .
In this connection , I have of course noted Parliament 's position as regards the judicial field .
The Community Patent is a high priority for the Danish Presidency , but despite strenuous efforts it has not been possible to create the necessary basis for a joint draft compromise .
The countries are still too far apart , and I should like to say to the Members here that I too am very impatient in this matter .
At the meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 14 November , therefore , it will be a case of reviewing the status of the negotiations and working out how we can make headway in this extremely important matter .
A technical examination of the proposals is currently taking place , so that they can be forwarded to Parliament together .
It is my hope that Parliament will approve of the proposals , so that we can see the new , improved , public procurement rules in the EU as soon as possible .
There is political support in the Council for the Commission following up the conclusions , and a work schedule has been drawn up under which the Member States and the Commission are committed to a number of supply contracts in 2003 .
The Member States undertake to actively comply with and implement the judgments of the Court of Justice .
The Danish Presidency accords the completion of the internal market a very high priority .
We are looking
