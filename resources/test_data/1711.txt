Forty-six million inhabitants of the EU have as their mother tongue a language other than that spoken by the majority of people in their countries .
There are no short cuts .
Many of them are now very hard pressed .
We now face a similar issue .
I therefore definitely recommend that , on the same grounds as those that applied just now where Parliament was concerned , the Chamber , in this case too , postpone its decision and refuse to grant discharge today to the Committee of the Regions for its work during 2004 .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not believe that Parliament has in this case fulfilled its task of demanding accountability .
The Member States should , however , ensure that these costs are kept to an acceptable level .
We are also opposed to the idea of changing TV technology by decree and through political decisions instead of letting people’s own choices prevail .     This own-initiative report is about the form to be taken in the future by cooperation between the EU and Latin America .
The June List objects to this proposal .
It is , of course , up to the countries concerned to decide for themselves how their interparliamentary cooperation is to be organised .
The Member States must adopt positions on this matter without political lectures from the EU institutions .
The introduction of eCall entails costs and technical harmonisation .
In both resolutions now being dealt with , the European Parliament is shamelessly trying to get involved in language teaching and the adjustment of education systems to , for example , new technology and digitalisation .
I believe that the Council of Ministers is the best place in which to find out how far there is a need to go in terms of cooperation in the aforesaid area .     I wish to join in thanking the rapporteurs , Mrs Scheele and Mrs Poli Bortone , the shadow rapporteurs , the Commission and the Council for the work they have done on ensuring that , tomorrow , we have an agreement on which to adopt a position and that will make it much simpler for consumers to make healthier choices , because they have access to more accurate and more comprehensive information .
Companies know that we wish to make healthy choices and therefore do everything to make food appear beneficial , even if it is sometimes the very opposite of that .
If , in future , companies wish to highlight the presence in an item of food of a particular ingredient that people perceive as beneficial , then that item of food should not , in principle , have an unduly high sugar , fat , salt or alcohol content .
They converge in the Sargasso Sea from throughout Europe in order to meet each other and produce offspring , irrespective of national borders .
This also means that it will be many years before we get to see the results of the measures , so it is time for all countries to help each other .
We come now , however , to this illegal fishing agreement , which is a piece of pure neo-colonialism .
They are experts on international agreements and they completely condemn the fisheries agreement .
Morocco has stolen Western Sahara , and anyone entering into fisheries agreements with Morocco becomes guilty of receiving stolen goods .
This time , however , it is much more serious because the EU intends entering into an agreement with a colonial power of the worst sort .
They prevent poor countries from developing their own fishing industries and are partly responsible for depleting the oceans of fish .
They also cost EU taxpayers huge sums of money .
This agreement in particular has a very great deal of politics associated with it , and there are many uncertainties where Western Sahara is concerned .
The legal analyses are contradictory and , as many of these point out , the position under international law is unclear because the boundaries of Morocco’s territorial waters are being erased .
I think it important for the EU not to recognise the policy of occupation .
It is , to the very highest degree , about politics , and that is something we must realise .
The Geneva Convention bans an occupying power from exploiting occupied areas ’ natural resources for its own gain , but that is precisely what this agreement involves .
The Presidency clearly does not think it worth taking part in this debate , either .
What is missing is leadership .
A certain amount needs , of course , to be done in the institutional sphere .
On this issue , the light appears to come from the east .
I hope that we can produce practical proposals within the very near future .
Among the matters debated a lot in Europe and featuring among the top subjects on the Commission ’s web site are institutional issues and the issue of Parliament’s seat .
A huge number of people throughout Europe find it bizarre that the European Parliament meets in two locations .
As many have said in this House , we must obtain a more environmentally friendly transport system in Europe .
The Marco Polo project also reveals the different conditions under which we live in the various regions of the EU.
The Marco Polo project ought not , therefore , to lead to employment in the EU being relocated .
We believe that all the customs duties on rice should be removed , since duties are to the detriment of the exporting country , consumers within the EU and general economic development .     We have voted against this report .
The reason why the agreement is being cancelled is that the Commission has certain views on the Angolan legislation concerning biological aquatic resources .
We thus have a
