Mr President , this disaster , without going into the issue in depth and in view of the information becoming available to us , currently involves at least four Community countries : Spain , France , Portugal and Denmark .
This is an historical step which should not make us forget those people who are still deprived , as Oswaldo Payá puts it , of the right to rights .
Therefore , in the expectation that the plenum will express its opinion , we believe that , by means of its President or whatever channels he deems appropriate , we must express our condemnation of the lamentable electoral farce which took place yesterday .
In other words , the current decision-making process , based on constitutional modifications being made unanimously , is a procedure which does not lend itself to the development of an institution such as our Community , which so far at least has been effective .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must firstly congratulate Mrs Damião .
In cases of demolition , workers can and must come into contact with asbestos despite the fact that this is prohibited globally .
To ask the Member States to lay down sanctions which are effective , dissuasive and proportional - I believe that in the Spanish translation it should say 'proporcionada' , since it is not a question of establishing a particular proportion , but rather of taking account of the seriousness of the violation , time of exposure , risk , etc .
It will therefore be the best method for horizontalising policies , for research , compliance with the law and establishing health and safety conditions or , to put it another way , for respecting human dignity .
Many of the people invited to the committee occupied very important posts during the management of the last outbreak of the disease .
The current policy of not vaccinating prioritises the political and commercial aspects and this is something that must change on an international level , taking the approach initiated by the International Office of Epizootic Diseases and the FAO.
In the same way , the temporary committee is asking the Commission to draw up a global strategy for diseases and zoonosis in the European Union .
Commissioner , in view of paragraphs 20 and 21 and of what I experienced myself during the dioxin crisis , mad cow disease and now the Prestige , I believe the Commission should take its ability to directly provide Europeans with information very seriously .
In summary , we believe that the Nordic dimension has been very beneficial to the interests of the European Union and therefore today we are debating the draft budget for 2003 in a situation which those of us with long budgetary experience could describe as exceptionally calm .
Codecision must be generalised , without thereby jeopardising agricultural and structural spending which must be guaranteed .
I ask myself whether this is the right way to administrate the European Union , whether this Parliament should agree with this way of acting .
Of course , my group is going to support this agreement at second reading .
It goes without saying , therefore , that I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs , Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck , and the chairman of our Committee on Budgets .
I would like to say to the Council that it cannot ignore or diminish the political priorities of Parliament and that the loss of appropriations must not be repeated , as is going to happen with the Community funding for Europol for certain actions in the fight against terrorism , simply because the Council does not want to be subject to the control of this House .
Therefore , many ports have adopted specific regulations and procedures which regulate such activities and the Commission , for its part , in accordance with the Treaty , monitors compliance with the Community legislation on environmental protection and therefore , on 24 January 2001 , brought a case before the Court of Justice in relation to the non-application by the United Kingdom of a whole series of environmental rules in Gibraltar , including Directive 93/12/EEC on the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels .
The problem is that direct taxes are not paid either , taxes on companies , which also have an impact on prices : 35 % in Algeciras and nothing in Gibraltar , as Commissioner Monti knows very well .
In this regard , it has promoted and facilitated the development of Community research and legislation on control in the fields of both radiation protection and on the control of the use of nuclear materials .
On the contrary , I came here to inform Parliament of the initiatives I had proposed in Brussels .
Mr President , rather than supplementing the question , because I consider the Commissioner 's reply to be correct , what I will do is inform her that in that case they used her name and those of two officials from the Directorate-General for the Environment wrongly .
Mr President , I am surprised that such experienced Members of Parliament should confuse a complaint to the Commission with a petition to the European Parliament .
Mr President , there has perhaps been a degree of confusion , as the honourable Member has said .
Certain measures will refer specifically to two-wheeled vehicles and , in this regard , I would like once again to highlight the excellent work done by Mr Bautista Ojeda in this area .
Furthermore , it is necessary as always within the European Union to monitor true compliance with the existing traffic rules and codes , such as wearing helmets when riding a motorcycle , because we have detected that , on many occasions , what happens is that the legislation approved is unfortunately not applied or enforced strictly enough .
Their only answer -
