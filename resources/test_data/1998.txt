Mr President , first of all I would like to state that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party intends to vote in favour of this report .
It is hard to discern any connection between Brussels and its bureaucratic decision making machine and normal , everyday life .
The bridge over the abyss can be built only through partnership , involving both the institutions of the Community and the Member States .
It must bring our citizens closer , with the aid of regional information outlets and local media .
For example , libraries make an excellent place for this kind of activity .
That is because the legitimacy of the whole Union rests very much on the image that people get from our work - the very people who directly elect us .
This means that democracy has , as it were , been bypassed by mainstream information systems , as global companies attract international notice and , in certain countries , are already entering our schools .
The Tindemans report as approved stands for a thinking that at least partly reflects Cold War attitudes .
It is wishful thinking , considering the Amsterdam Treaty and the four militarily non-aligned countries , to talk about integrating the WEU into the Union .
We do not see Russia as an enemy and we hope that the ties between the Union and Russia will be strengthened , creating an even larger area of peace , stability and prosperity .
The Tindemans report is not based on clear-headed thinking about European defence and security needs .
Mr President , I also would like to thank Mr Fischler .
As has been stated , bacteria become used to antibiotics after years of use and build up a resistance to them .
In recent years the hypothesis has been put forward that these resistant bacteria can get into a meat-eater 's bodily system and weaken that person 's immunity to infectious disease .
Some vets think that the use of antibiotics as a growth stimulant must be unconditionally prohibited .
In many other countries , however , they use the so-called safe antibiotics , as listed by the Commission .
Is not merely the fact that there is doubt enough ?
Consumers cannot be treated differently from one country to the next .
I think the EU should most definitely adhere to a principle of caution , especially when it is a question of protecting the health of our citizens , and be strict in the use of antibiotics in animal feed .
Mr President , Commissioner , the issue dealt with by Mr Olsson and others of the use of antibiotics in animal feed is a timely one .
Antibiotics are drugs which are this century 's best discovery in the war against disease .
For that reason , drugs are constantly being developed to overcome the problem of such immune strains .
So there is an attempt to prevent the outbreak and spread of illness by , for example , introducing even more antibiotics into the animals ' feed before any really serious disease manifests itself .
This kind of indiscriminate use of antibiotics is common in the EU , but is even more so in powerful countries that practise industrial agriculture , like the USA .
This is considerably harmful to public health .
The question is whether we want to copy the American agricultural production model , with its large-scale use of antibiotics and hormones , which would mean pushing the issue of public health aside .
The use of antibiotics in animal feed is a big problem that is tied to sustainable development .
Mr President , the issue here is the problem of factory farming .
Especially problematic in the EU is Holland 's pig and chicken economy .
The use of growth hormones is forbidden in the EU area , but one and a half billion ecus worth of them are sold .
We have to recognize that the Commission does not have the resources to solve this problem .
Mr President , I understand that Germany is a big net payer to the EU.
I quite understand that the Germans would like more out of the EU for their membership subscription .
What I do not understand is why Germany is swindling the EU out of its money .
He says that those who have received overlapping funds have not necessarily been the same people .
It is still unclear to me whether leucosis-infected beef is being sold to Russia or other trade partners of the former GDR.
I would have liked the report to enlighten me on this .
We know how , after the BSE slaughter , much meat at compensated prices was exported from Britain .
I wonder what happened to the meat after the swine fever slaughter .
I do not understand how the report could have been accepted in its present unsatisfactory form .
The added benefit of combined production is that it gets us much closer to the aims set out in Kyoto .
Thus , the time has at last come when we can raise the strategic profile of this issue at EU level , especially as we cannot afford to let slip away any means we have available to us to reduce and eventually rid ourselves of the damage caused by the greenhouse phenomenon .
Producers of electricity can still restrict the number of new players entering the market .
Free access to gas is a key factor in profitability when it comes to constructing private or smallscale power stations .
The method is said to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by raising the overall efficiency of the power plant .
The combined production of heat and power has been a feature of industry for over fifty years .
Today it is found , at least to some extent , everywhere in the EU.
Its promotion is tightly bound
