from these two considerations : either Mr Barroso is responsible for these choices , in which case that is a serious matter because he has made bad choices ; or he has allowed these choices to be imposed upon him by the governments , which would be even worse .     Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I very much want , first of all , to thank those MEPs who , in the last part-session , refused to place their confidence in the Commission proposed by you , Mr Barroso , for it in no way corresponded to the values of tolerance , solidarity and transparency that should characterise the European Union .
Today , you have promised us a genuine partnership , which is imperative because the European Union is facing huge challenges .
Mr Barroso , you organised the Azores Summit for President Bush and today , eighteen months after the start of the war , that war has not yet ended .
I should like to respond in particular to three points : firstly , the composition ; secondly , possible conflicts of interest ; thirdly , cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission , thinking in particular of the framework agreement .
No!
I shall read them in English because I have the original in English .
This responsibility depends first and foremost on the person , on the individual .
That is where the problem lies .
We often say that we must defend the European social model , and that is true .
What I cannot do is change the balance between the institutions established by the Treaty .
They will be difficult years .
Is Mr Barroso in charge of inter-group discipline ?
The first implementation report only covers the year 2001 , and so we do not yet have the hindsight needed to put forward a proposal on an interinstitutional code .
Quite the contrary , I have always given you constructive answers , which were proof of my desire to cooperate with your institution .
The independence of these great democrats is truly astonishing .
In this respect , your refusal to hear the objections which came from all quarters as a result of your approach to the competition portfolio is unlikely to appease people’s fears .
No, Mr Barroso , you were neither held hostage to the extreme right nor were you its victim , as you wrongly claimed ; you fell victim to your own errors of judgment .
If Mr Barroso had not climbed down at the very last moment in order to avoid a crushing personal defeat , I would of course have voted against this Commission .
Mrs Kroes is still to be in charge of competition , despite her links with multinational corporations , and Mrs Fischer Boel is still to be in charge of agriculture , despite the fact that her husband farms pigs in Russia , which creates an obvious conflict of interest .
That is why , although we do not agree with the unbridled euroliberalism of the budget austerity pact or with the Turco-Europeanism that you will be obliged to apply , we decided to support your resistance on this point of freedom .
Parliament has benefited because we have demonstrated that we can control the executive and that we have an influence on the formation of the executive .
I also agree with the point that an increase in the complaints to the Ombudsman over the past year may not necessarily be seen as a bad thing , as the facility is becoming more widely known throughout Europe as a practical port of call for complaints .     Mr President , I raise this point while keeping in mind the difficulty that the President was facing .
We therefore want to see the European Union steer a totally different course regarding Côte d'Ivoire and all the African countries so that all these aspects might be reconciled and so that we are not content merely to react – react though we must – to extremely difficult crises .     Mr President , nine French soldiers killed and 38 injured ; 15 000 civilians in danger , and unacceptable violence .
Secondly , Mr President , if the EU-Russia summit did not bear fruit , then that must be debated .
In light of Ukraine’s history , such an approach may only exacerbate the split between the two main sections of the country .
Our power will be terrible for the Muscovites , the Jews and the Poles who refuse to adopt our faith , etc. ’ .
Each year some three million live animals are transported around Europe .
Let us not forget that .
I am grateful to Parliament for expressing its opinion so promptly .
After all , we cannot pursue such a policy solely with a softly-softly approach , by taking the soft law route .
They secured a transitional period during which they will be authorised to withhold tax instead of exchanging information .
Nothing changes because Europe has become a huge bureaucratic machine in which no one is really responsible any longer , a conclusion also reached through the analysis in the Independent Experts ’ Report that led to the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999 .
The best way in which Europe can help promote peace in Colombia is to support initiatives of this type and the local authorities in Colombia that follow these up .     – Mr President , as chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , I should simply like to provide some information .
I applaud the report 's recognition of the need to implement measures to encourage reporting of illegal content in addition to the assessment of the performance of filter technologies and the benchmarking of these technologies
