.
It would be unfair to authorise only a single asylum request for the countries of the European Union , given that it does not have the same chance of success from one State to another .
In order to grant the right of asylum , the States require proof of persecution .
This amendment admittedly aims to protect data on the information gathered .
Giving support in this area is absolutely no use at all and merely enables the European governing bodies to ease their conscience .
First of all , learn to take responsibility , learn to govern .
.
It therefore becomes important not only to learn how to be efficient in implementing these guidelines but also to be aware of potential obstacles to their implementation , and always proceed in the knowledge that the Community also has an objective in terms of employment .
Mr Vice-President , I cannot repeat here what those young people were shouting because I feel that it would be unworthy of this Chamber to do so , but I would be quite willing to testify to what was said at any given moment .
Extremely serious remarks were made regarding the President of the Commission , the Republic of Italy - our country - and 25 April , which is the date of liberation of Italy from the Nazis .
Mr President , I would also like to speak for personal reasons in order to clear up some of the confusion .
Should the need arise , the offended party can always take the necessary action through the appropriate channels .
We are judging the behaviour of these young people because of the things they said , but I would like to know whether what Mr Speroni said is true , for if it is true that a Member of Parliament threw water over these people , the behaviour of the Member of Parliament is also reprehensible .
Moreover , the extension of this system to a greater number of products would facilitate sound , effective management , which would lead to simpler procedures for both the Executive and farmers .
Of course I voted for the report .
I propose that , instead of granting farmers financial aid , we should grant them tax reductions and reductions in their social service and pension contributions relating to their activities .
Decisions are far too centralised .
The current accounting system will have to be revamped so that the real costs of activities can be traced .
The amendments made by the Committee in agreement with the rapporteur , which have been incorporated into the proposal , are intended to exploit the opportunity presented by this agreement with Norway to give fresh impetus to the Centre ' s work .
Mr President , we are examining two proposals for partial revision of the working procedures and methods of the Lisbon Drugs Monitoring Centre , in particular two proposals on relations with the candidate countries and Norway .
At this point , the Commission must table a proposal on how the data can be harmonised , or the whole exercise will be completely pointless .
Firstly , this is a positive evaluation which is consistent with the Commission ' s proposal .
I would not like the Monitoring Centre for Drug Addiction to be likened to the Monitoring Centre for Food Quality and Safety !
In particular , I did not understand whether Norway will start to participate in the work of the EMCDDA after it has been reformed , that is , whether it is the Commission ' s intention that Norway should be allowed to participate in the work of the EMCDDA immediately or whether it should wait until September , when the reform is scheduled to take place , when the Management Board will issue its recommendations .
Of course , the regulation follows the same line as the directive , and it therefore contains all the same strengths and weaknesses as the directive on such a contentious , competitive issue where there are a large number of interests at play .
In the end , the directive did not deal with the issue of spare parts for the purpose of repair .
I would therefore advocate that a ceiling of 25 years for the protection of registered design rights would be quite sufficient .
Mr President , I share Mrs GrossetÃªte ' s regret : the construction of Europe must involve the creation of a legal area , and the diligence we have shown in timetabling such a major report for a Friday morning is certainly not reassuring .
This need is all the greater in that those who are in contact with the law and justice are often unfamiliar with the rules of Community law .
Madam President , yesterday , at the Euro 2000 final between France and Italy , an unfortunate and extremely serious incident occurred .
Fortunately , they were not sentenced to death , and that may be due to the intervention of Parliament which monitored the proceedings to ensure that the defendants received a fair trial in Iran .
As far as the Rotterdam incidents are concerned , I am in complete agreement with Mr Tajani .
I feel that in holding a topical and urgent debate on this matter we would be acting upon our discussion earlier this morning , which you agreed to champion , Madam President .
I feel this is a reasonable suggestion , for if we do not make an effort to act in some way we would certainly be guilty of reluctance to do our duty .
Greater democracy means political control of the economy and its institutions , starting with the Central Bank , and not the reverse .
The Commission proposes in the directive to lay down an obligation to provide information , but we are worried about the handling of the information .
