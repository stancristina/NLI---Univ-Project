As the draftsman of the opinion on this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I will concentrate on economic and monetary policy perspectives .
If we are open and honest with each other , then we have a good chance of further developing the strategic partnership in a sensible way .
As long as there are human rights violations in China , there should be no lifting of the embargo .     – Mr President , the late reaction of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has quite astonished me , since there was plenty of time in the long process leading up to the resolution for it to express its opinion .
I will defend the One China policy , but only if it is based on the free decision of all interested parties , and this cannot be achieved through violence .
The excitement about this China report shows us that in our own House there are double standards of morality .
We call upon China to grant unimpeded access to the abducted Panchen Lama , the second highest spiritual authority after the Dalai Lama .
Here there are still many resources that can be developed in the future .
Political ends must not be treated as superior to fundamental rights .
By way of conclusion , one has to consider the economic damage that would ensue if the United States were to threaten to prevent our airlines from landing there if we did not sign this agreement , and I would also like to ask why nobody within the European Union has ventured to remind our trans-Atlantic partners of this .     Mr President , Mr Vice-President , it needs to be said loud and clear that this House was right to appeal against the agreement on the personal data of flight passengers ; the European Court of Justice has already ruled that the legal basis on which it reposed was false , and it is only regrettable that it has not therefore had anything to say about its substance .
Even so , when discussing the protection of our cultural heritage , which focuses primarily on preserving the cultural achievements of the past , what should be borne in mind is that culture is a dynamic and diverse process , so , while cultural policy has to be concerned with the maintenance and conservation of our cultural heritage , it must also take responsibility for the creation of cultural networks for contemporary culture and artistic trends that serve as a basis for the cultural heritage of the future .
I regard Sibiu , formerly known as Hermannstadt , in Transylvania , about which there was an exhibition of photographs in this House yesterday , as an example of the degree to which the European Union can promote and support our cultural heritage .     Mr President , we too would have been happy to endorse this important report on China , but , as it does not accept the ‘one China – two systems ’ concept , we cannot vote to approve it .
In our dialogues with government and opposition , human rights activists , Buddhists and Muslims , we have always put the case for the peace initiative mounted by the Norwegians , who , this year too , tried – and failed – to act as mediators .
This , I believe , is where Thailand should hold fast to its own great tradition , which it first demonstrated decades ago in its handling of millions of Cambodians .
What can we do ?
What action has been taken as a consequence of this ?
Prior to the July vote in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , and looking forward to the vote we are about to take in this plenary , all three of the main groups in this House negotiated a package of compromise amendments , which can be summed up as aiming for , on the one hand , ambitious limit and target values , with , on the other , greater flexibility and consideration of the difficulties that individual Member States face with the transposition of the current directive .
However , the data obtained in Europe on PM2.5 are as yet uncertain , and most Member States have had insufficient experience with measurements of it .
At national and local level , too , everything proportionate and necessary must be done to improve air quality , and we are creating the right incentives for that as well .
The industry must come to understand that standards of this kind are ultimately an opportunity for it to sell modern technology throughout the world , and that is why car industries , and the manufacturers of other industrial equipment as well , must realise that these standards present them , today , with an opportunity to develop new technologies and work at research and innovation .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur , particularly on his willingness to engage in dialogue .
If we want to make progress in areas such as the conservation of resources , energy policy , air quality and so on , one thing that is absolutely necessary is closer integration of the policies made in cities and those made at the European level .
The first is that , with effect from 1983 at the latest , the authorities charged with the management of this wonderful building , the European Parliament , stopped doing anything about the leases that they had concluded with the city of Strasbourg .
I think it has been done rather well , and Mr Ferber’s report deserves our support .
A contract has been cobbled together under considerable pressure of time , without the purchase price being renegotiated in view of what has
