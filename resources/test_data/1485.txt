I therefore share the rapporteur ' s and Parliament ' s concerns .
The Commission asks you to note that , in response to your concerns , our concerns and the requirements of the Tampere mandate , we intend during this year to submit all the main instruments of the asylum policy to Parliament and the Council .
These consist of the joint procedures , the revision of the Dublin Convention and the final Eurodac instrument .
However , at the same time , the Commission intends , in the autumn , to submit to Parliament a communication on immigration policy in the European Union .
We must review the 1994 communication and update the approach to the questions of immigration policy in the Union in light of the Tampere conclusions .
As for the inadequacies of the legal services which have been underlined during this debate , the Commission does not intend to tackle some of these albeit very interesting theoretical and practical questions , such as the career structure of national judges or the duration of trials in several Member States .
This is because we should respect the principle of subsidiarity and recognise that the basic options must be the decision of each Member State .
The Commission would underline in this respect that a green paper on legal aid represents a worthwhile contribution , both to the requirement to define common rules on the protection of defendants , such as the guarantee of assistance from interpreters and translators in cross-border trials , and to the establishment of a wider programme of mutual recognition of legal decisions .
As for civil justice , the communitisation of several civil justice instruments is an efficient way of ensuring the effective legal consideration of human rights .
The Commission has already proposed communitising all existing conventions not currently in force , particularly the one on the service of documents and the Brussels II Convention and the convention on bankruptcies .
We have also proposed making the very important Brussels Convention of 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters into a regulation .
All these instruments are currently being examined by the Council .
Even the United Kingdom and Ireland have decided to join the Member States on this and Denmark , which does not have the same capacity to participate in work on civil legal cooperation , is also seeking solutions which are currently being examined .
Finally , with regard to children ' s and women ' s rights , although these matters specifically come under the competence of Member States , I can remind the House that the Commission and I have undertaken to submit a package of measures on these questions by the end of the year .
These measures will aim to go beyond the joint action of February 1997 .
They will consist of definitions , charges and penalties in the fight against the trade in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation and measures against the sexual exploitation of children .
Turning now to the Ludford report , I very much welcome the opportunity to respond to Parliament ' s report on racism and xenophobia .
The Union ' s commitment to supporting fundamental rights and fighting discrimination was made very clear in the Amsterdam Treaty and this is , for me , a crucial development of the European message .
Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union introduces new powers to react in case of serious and persistent breaches of fundamental rights by a Member State .
Article 13 of the EC Treaty provides for measures to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex , religion or belief , disability , age , sexual orientation and - of greatest relevance to us today in this debate - racial or ethnic origin in which ( to clarify the question raised by Mr Brie ) we include the fight against antisemitism .
Many forces came together to reach agreement on Article 13 in the last Intergovernmental Conference , as the representative of the Council has already reminded us , and the Commission is determined to honour the Treaty commitment to a discrimination-free society .
That is why we put forward our package of proposals to fight discrimination only two months after taking office last year .
My message today , in the follow-up to the Ludford report , is that we still hope that Parliament will give priority to giving its opinion on this package so that we can adopt the two directives and the action plan by the end of this year .
But besides that , I think that in many quarters there is growing recognition of the need for European action against racism .
That is why in the Article 13 proposals we are able to make greater progress , I believe , on racial discrimination than on the other matters .
We felt that it was politically possible .
We sincerely hope that the facts will not deny our hope .
As you know , the package of proposals that the Commission has put forward consists of two directives and an action programme .
The two draft directives provide a legislative framework for legally enforceable rights including provisions on a number of key issues such as protection against harassment , scope for positive action , appropriate remedies and enforcement measures .
The proposed directives are complemented by a proposal for an action programme .
We know that , to combat discrimination , practical action is needed to reach out to people and help change discriminatory attitudes and behaviour on the ground .
Getting the Member States to adopt the anti-discrimination package is now our top priority .
Although it is important , the Article 13 package is only part of an on-going process to develop new ways of tackling racial discrimination .
The Union is committed to mainstreaming the fight against discrimination
