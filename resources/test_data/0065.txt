The resolution before Parliament notes the fresh debate which is currently in progress in the United States , not on the abolition of the death penalty at all but on a moratorium intended to ensure a more reliable but no less merciless system .
I believe that the high quality of the law faculties in the United States is due to the fact that the attorneys are very highly paid , but they are only highly paid by those can afford to employ their services .
At this point , I would like to protest at the behaviour of the Dutch police towards some Italian journalists who were filming the humiliating treatment of a group of disabled people who were being carried up the steps because there were not enough free seats for them .
In my opinion , we must continually remind our young people , including those who are the most fervent fans , those who are most emotionally involved in these events , that football is a game .
Would it not lose all credibility if it did not also criticise similar events within its borders ?
There are no airlines offering flights to Baghdad , although there are no UN resolutions banning such flights either , because the USA and the United Kingdom have declared a no-fly zone .
Mr President , I voted for the Redondo report which regulates European Union interventions in the event of fires and atmospheric pollution .
For objects that might be used by pensioners or the elderly ?
Mr President , I will endeavour to comply with Mrs Peijs ' wishes and keep my speech short .
This morning , the Italian newspapers contained the news that medical treatment for dogs and cats will be tax deductible .
If there is enough money to spend on dogs and cats , there ought to be enough for women on maternity leave , who are not ill but people who have the right to a full allowance .
I can see a certain contradiction and I am concerned , and I believe I speak for the rest of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well , that behaviour within the Commission in relation to the issue appears to be somewhat contradictory .
Mr President , the framework decision put forward by the Council merely reproduces the Council of Europe Convention of 1998 on the prevention of environmental crime , a Convention which has not yet been ratified by any of the Member States of the Council of Europe .
Few European countries provide for the liability of legal persons in their criminal law , but others are taking steps towards this .
However , in addition to repeating the positive things that have already been said , it is important to stress some of the limitations of Denmark ' s initiative , precisely to help us to take more effective action in the future .

This morning , a pensioner telephoned me from Liguria and said : " It is really hot .
Furthermore , it has given its opinion on specific cases , including the case in question - the execution of Derek Barnabei which was announced in July .
Having said that , it goes without saying that if some of the general rules are stupid or petty , then it will , of course , be much more difficult to uphold them .
There must be political and commercial dialogue and cultural and financial cooperation .
The Mediterranean is , in actual fact , an area which is still marked by zones of real poverty , and it is an area where the standard of living and quality of life are such as to require a major European presence .
This is to ignore the reality that what we have at the moment is a discordant , incoherent chorus of European countries and their 14 thousand or so diplomats , compared to the 3 500 diplomats of the United States .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have the great honour of presenting , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , this report on the liquidation of one of the projects which appears to have been more successful or which has been more positively appreciated in the field of North/South cooperation : the ECIP ( European Community Investment Partners ) project .
