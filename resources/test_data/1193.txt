It isolates woman from social life and the labour market .
However , in order for there to be results , violence must be expressed and that is why confidence in the authorities , in the departments responsible , in the courts , needs to be increased .
We note that , despite the economic slowdown , employment among women is increasing .
The proposals in the Estrela report were , I believe , the subject of unanimity in our committee and I too maintain that a national strategy is needed with well coordinated objectives in the Member States which , on the one hand , promote mainstreaming in all policies and , on the other hand , apply the measures for the abolition of discrimination where it exists .
On the pretext , again , of changing communication conduct , the report paves the way for the definition of the universal service to be re-examined .
Having said which , I would highlight two important points : firstly , the improvement to the working conditions and rights of drivers and , secondly , the assumption of responsibility by the Member States towards employers on safety matters , with the result that it will be possible to improve insurance even more in the immediate future .
And how many times , in truth , has the error been made by professional lorry and bus drivers often forced to work under exhausting conditions ?
It is therefore a very good thing for there to be harmonisation of these matters at European level , given that road transport by definition goes beyond the borders of one Member State .
In order to combat female unemployment , it is proposed to extend 'flexible forms of employment ' .
For the lack of state welfare structures , it is proposed to shift the burden to the family , but equally .
We condemn as disorientating the talk about changing the gender composition of power .
The basis for equality can only be laid within the framework of grass-roots power , in which grass-roots wealth comes through production and the goods produced .     – Mr President , two months ago we voted here on Mr Alavanos 's thoughts on telephone tapping .
Secondly , as it is so easy to tap telephones , and I refer here to the telephone of the Prime Minister of Greece , I refer here to the telephone of the Hellenic Minister of Public Health , I refer here to the telephone of the Hellenic Minister of Foreign Affairs , how sure can we be that the telephones are not being tapped here , in the European Parliament ?     – Mr President , two weeks ago in Greece the action of an extended gang of telephone call thieves was uncovered .
Thirdly , the incident was also discovered by the independent national authority responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of communications .
By contrast , the Cashman report is to be presented tomorrow on a case on which a decision is pending before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and proceedings are under way before the national courts .
I believe that there are not two conflicting worlds – and I am certain that most of my honourable friends believe likewise ; I believe there is one open world in which we are forced to coexist .
Ladies and gentlemen , the world we live in does not belong to us .
Although the death sentence imposed on them was recently quashed by the Libyan Supreme Court , in view of a repeat trial , we can send them a message of support and , at the same time , call for the Libyan authorities to guarantee that the new trial will be held fairly and objectively .
We are calling on the European Commission to stop this procedure .
However , I believe that this proposal , as it stands with many of the amendments tabled , is a balanced , logical proposal , which strikes a balance between the need for better handling of animals , for the welfare of the animals , especially in the chicken sector , on the one hand , while at the same time taking account of the financial cost and burden which it may cause to industry and undertakings in this sector .
Consequently , it may , if you look at it superficially , appear to be a cost for entrepreneurs , for producers , for farmers ; however , in actual fact , it is a benefit which will result in savings and will bring producers financial benefits .
Labelling – voluntary at first – we shall be presenting a report on compulsory labelling – will give producers the opportunity to make full use of the fact that they follow a policy which is well received by European citizens and , on the basis of our studies and research , they will be able to charge something extra , because European consumers are prepared to spend more .
I know that European producers may often feel that they are at a disadvantage to third countries .
Constant efforts are being made to introduce terms and conditions for the welfare and proper handling of animals on the international market .
Nonetheless , bearing in mind the very high level of sensitivity of European consumers , we believe that labelling could give European producers an advantage .
To look at the bigger picture , I say that this demonstrates our humanity towards all our fellow inhabitants of this planet .
This is unfortunate on two counts : both for the poultry farmers , a class for which we should show solidarity , and for the chickens , because we shall arrive at the point , in a few years ' time , where chicken products will be imported from
