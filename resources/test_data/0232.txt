show that the modulation and gradual reduction measures are required in order to safeguard compliance with the financial ceilings set by the summit in Brussels in October 2002 .
As the presidency , we shall endeavour to ensure that the solutions adopted are within the framework of the financial frameworks decided for the European Union budget .
These decisions have always been founded on the Community method , which means cooperation between the institutions and compromise between the Member States within the framework of the Council .
I can assure you that I have noted all your proposals with particular interest and shall take them into account in the compromise proposal which we shall submit to the Council of Ministers for Agriculture to be held in Luxembourg on 11 and 12 June .
I think that all the ministers are calling for greater transparency in the payment of subsidies .
Mr Cunha 's analgesic proposals such as , for example , the partial decoupling method , in other words making decoupling gradual rather than universal , with fewer products in the first year instead of all products , revoke none of the above and , on a medium-term basis , they will have the same catastrophic results on the rural economy .
The famous multifunctionality of agriculture , with resources being reallocated to the second pillar for supposed rural development , is nothing more than a very poor pretext to conceal the pursued objective of marginalising the rural world and changing its social and environmental role .
We take the farmers ' side and support them in their proactive fight , which is the only way to secure their survival and protect the quality of products , the consumer and the environment .
I would not want to be in his shoes , but I congratulate him on what he has managed to produce .
We consider that the EUR 5 000 limit is very low .
I welcome the prospect of making agricultural production a business .
Commissioner , the people whom the European Union calls human rights activists are nothing more than agents of the United States of America , as proven in the Cuban courts .
I should also like your comments on Mr Bush 's message on 20 May , promising freedom to Cuba , and your comment on the fact that the United States have not punished the hijackers who forced aeroplanes to go to Cuba .
And , finally , what do you think about the detention by the United States of five Cuban patriots who have barely seen 80 % of the bill of indictment , because it is supposed to be confidential ?
The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the transposition and will take a decision following a careful examination of the dossier .
A first reading of the presidential decree shows that article 5 makes provision for the above and that it expressly stipulates that the renewal of fixed-term contracts of employment is allowed if justified by an objective reason and examples of objective reasons are given .
There must be objective grounds based on the nature of the object .
As she understood , the question does not concern the objective reasons and the implementation criteria , it concerns the scope .
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she could estimate when we shall have this opinion from the Commission .
There are legal procedures , but there are also internal committee procedures .
The Commission 's recommendation at the time concerned the possibility of access for senior citizens to all resources provided by decision of the Member States to their own senior citizens , from museums and cultural activities to free subsidised transport .
No Member State and none of the pan-European senior citizens ' organisations in this group , to which the final study was submitted , supported the idea of the card or the proposals contained in the report .
They are consumers .
I agree with you that this sort of card would facilitate the mobility of pensioners even more , but an idea also has to be adopted by those who will be called on to apply it and by those who will be called on to enjoy its advantages .
Both the text presented this precise moment to the Convention and the Charter of Fundamental Rights retain the wording concerning the issue of discrimination based on age intact .
There has been no change to the sectors to which the area of discrimination refers .
Usually , it is the youngest workers who move .
Studies which we have carried out show that mobility from the 10 future Member States to the present European Union of the 15 will be relatively limited .
However , they are fairly convincing if you think that they have taken account of all the prevailing conditions in each of the Member States .
The second point concerns transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers decided at European level .
The third point concerns the strategy on employment , the application of policies in which the European Union has an added value .
Immigration flows and the study of the phenomenon with possible forecasts .
The discussion also relates to which areas funding from European resources should be directed at and to the priorities of the sectors which have to be financed .
It is not my feeling that , with the agreement that already exists , significant resources will be safeguarded for the new countries .
Is this feasible ?
We have the brain drain phenomenon , the fact that these countries are losing human resources at their most dynamic age , the cleverest , most spirited people , and it is very important for these countries to keep their human resources , which is also why our approach , especially with the Structural Funds , is to invest in human resources , especially at these ages .
