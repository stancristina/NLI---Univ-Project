The European Parliament delegation could not understand this requirement .
There is no such link .
That is why I attached particular importance to the amendment which calls for the internal market to be further developed into a genuine European home market .

We shall have to see .
The single buyer concept is a new idea which has succeeded in reconciling ownership and the need for competition .
The arguments are the same there too .
This will mean that we fail to achieve our climate policy objectives and result in a climatic disaster .
The directive is only a first step , however .
He takes the view that it destroys the compromise .
Madam President , Mr Herman is right that we are having to deal very quickly with changes to directives that we adopted only a few years ago .
This means that the present situation , in which these national authorities are operating , will not be without a European framework , and we shall of course monitor this , Mrs Read , since whenever European legislation is adopted , the Commission has to monitor the application of these laws and intervene where necessary .
