wages , and most certainly to an undermining of the standard of living of the people .
We , as the European Parliament , Mr President , asked the Commission as far back as in 1996 to produce a study , a comparative study into good examples of how the working week can be reduced ; into how the reduction of social security contributions can give a new impulse to shorter working hours .
This is the essential difference between the Amendment No and the original text of the resolution as passed by the Social Affairs Committee .
I have submitted two amendments on behalf of the Committee on Transport to include explicitly in the risk categories people living near airports .
One or the other ; either Mr Engwirda has expressed himself incorrectly , or he was quoted incorrectly by Dutch radio .
The principal decisions have been taken .
Because we believe that the situation in Iraq could , in fact , change at any moment , and any resolution we submit tomorrow could be superseded within an hour ; however , we think it is necessary for us to be well acquainted with the Security Council resolutions , in unabridged version .
The Legal Commission considers the Treaty of Amsterdam to be not a half glass of water , but a full glass of Mouton Rothschild .
Whether the treaty will succeed will depend primarily , however , on the way the Member States and European institutions implement it .
This means that guidelines can be adopted , and that trial projects can be set up .
A sober , yet correct analysis and evaluation of the treaty and a recommendation which , as Jean Racine put it , contains neither this excess of honour nor this indignity .
I can imagine that the gap is regarded with great satisfaction by all those who want neither intensification , nor enlargement .
These federal states have become constitutionally independent with their own address , own house , own budget , own management .
In itself it is very positive that the national parliaments , or at least some of them , have asked for our opinion , and do not want to proceed to approval before they know this opinion .
That , incidentally , shows that the relationship between the national parliaments and the European Parliament is much better than many people think , and that is a good thing , because we have many common interests .
Otherwise we cannot always be satisfied , unfortunately .
That is a sound proposal .
First of all the Commission submitted a proposal that anticipated far more liberalization than was present in the text which is we are now waiting to vote upon .
That not one of the Member States has not regarded this as a reason for voting against may be regarded as a sign of the birth of the integration ideal of Europe .
Aviation competition in Europe tempts the Member States into adopting a flexible attitude towards unreliable airlines from third world countries .
In many countries it is women , after all , who not only keep the economy running , but who also support society .
That at least will achieve something !
But , Mr President , the problem remains for this Parliament too , that no parliament exists without a relationship with the people : democracy .
Mr President , I think the problem is starting to seem as if there is no remedy ; that , as price for enlargement , further bureaucratization will occur , and this further bureaucratization can be an important obstacle in the democratization of Europe , and I think we made very little progress on that issue in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I therefore hope and expect that Congress will abandon this wrong track , and return to its traditional liberal attitude regarding free trade .
It is also problematic that no account was taken of the dissatisfaction of the citizens of the Member States about a governmental structure which has been imposed from above .
We reject the Treaty of Amsterdam and that is why we have voted against the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Tsatsos report .
That would be inconsistent in the light of our criticism .
Neither the European Parliament nor the national parliaments look like they might have a grip on what will be concocted in the Council 's fortress in Brussels .
A tax on energy must be implemented throughout Europe , otherwise it will lead once more to market disruption .
But to achieve this the Union will have to do a great deal of work ; also in the internal market as well .
But how can we adjust this trend ?
Furthermore it is also urgent to arrive at an increased duty on energy , or the introduction of duty on energy sources which up until now have not been taxed at all .
My colleagues highlight all these issues .
Nonetheless I think we need to set a realistic date .
The concentration of power and the problems which arise out of this is one of the Commission 's special responsibilities .
The Commission has bitten off more than it can chew .
A number of debatable parts , such as the unification of rates of tax and duty , and the abolition of all types of border control within the European Union , definitely cannot be implemented in the short term .
The original draft resolution by Mr von Wogau was very good and concise , but unfortunately it has been expanded by the Committee on Economic Affairs into a long wish-list which would leave even Santa Claus at a loss .
According to the famous maxim : he who has the standard has the market .
Countries like the United Kingdom and Portugal think they can allowed themselves an optout .
