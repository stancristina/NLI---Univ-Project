Even though a number of basically positive signs can therefore be seen , a number of points should be noted that cause us to feel a certain anxiety .
In this connection , the Commission proposes a greater increase in payments than in new commitments , something which is naturally a step in the right direction .
The other problem , which is also worrying and needs to be discussed , is the way in which enlargement is to be dealt with .
It is possible that we shall be forced to do this , but I believe we must increase the pressure on the Secretary-Generals to produce new , radical proposals , for example concerning increased cooperation between the institutions so as to reduce the costs and thus avoid having recourse to the flexibility instrument .
These bodies do not in themselves present any problems , but they create problems in terms of budgeting and the ability to obtain an overview of the EU 's costs .
A further point we need to discuss , and which the Commissioner too mentioned , is , naturally , foreign policy , for which the Commission proposes a budget margin of EUR 60 million .
We do not know in detail or with any certainty what demands will be made when it comes to Afghanistan or overall efforts at tackling poverty-related illnesses and so on .
In conclusion , I want to say something about the longer term future .
Let us begin this discussion in time .
.
If , at its summit in Copenhagen in December , the European Council decides in favour of a 'big bang ' whereby ten new countries will become members in time for the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004 , this will present extraordinarily large demands .
There is no greater challenge for the European Parliament than precisely this .
It is estimated that the enlargement-related costs for 2003 will amount to just over EUR 32 million in total .
This sum amounts to EUR 51 million .
I believe that , in common with myself , a good many MEPs have heard remarks over the years along the lines that this is not a proper parliament .
If that is to be possible , Parliament must be strengthened in its key functions .
If room for everything - the costs of enlargement and Parliament 's necessary reforms - is to be found within the framework of the third priority - that is to say , with ever greater expenses being dealt with within the established budget framework - a strict budget process is required .
A few months later , the majority of institutions responded positively to the challenges from Parliament and the Council to focus on the key activities and so reduce its estimates .
If it is accurately to reflect today 's decision , the amount should be adjusted somewhat so that Parliament remains under the ceiling of EUR 1 051 million .
The latest version of the report arrived this morning , and it has not been easy for any of us on the committees to cooperate under these conditions .
I would especially emphasise basic education and basic professional training .
We shall have the opportunity to return to this subject in Parliament a little later when we debate a report from the Commission about developing local employment strategies .
.
( SV ) Tourism is an important engine for the development of economic activity in many parts of Europe .
The introduction of a legal basis and a common framework for tourism would encroach too far upon the subsidiarity principle .
An open coordination method and a strengthened role for the advisory tourist committee would be important factors in this connection .
Nor is it possible to give tourism policy it own legal basis in the Treaties .
Mr President , I too voted in favour of Mr Stenmarck 's report , which is very sound and makes clear the costs of all this taking to the road .
So do I. We make ourselves a laughing-stock .
The waste of resources for ourselves as MEPs is also considerable , and there are always problems in getting here , what with cancelled and delayed planes etc .
Are we in the EU the only people to be concerned about human rights , freedom of expression , media pluralism , the environment and , perhaps too , the position of the organisations representing citizens ?
What is happening with the environmental partnership in the northern dimension ?
The Presidency and the Commission touched upon the issue of responsibility for nuclear waste , and specifically the MNEPR Agreement .
I would also appeal to you to address difficult issues in the negotiations with Russia .
I would say , finally , to the Presidency that other summits and other heads of government have not hesitated to address the situation of kidnapped children .
Unfortunately , we have many examples of this .
The real results , which is to say those that should be of crucial importance to the environment I live in , are not apparent , however .
It has been stated in quite a few newspaper articles that the Commission intends linking demands for liberalisation of services in other countries to a reduction in , or removal of , EU export subsidies in the agricultural sphere .
I should like to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her constructive answer to my question .
I therefore believe that we must get the Member States , the Council , the Commission and Parliament to implement an action plan together in order for conditions really to be changed .
Is there a genuine desire to really do something about the problems together with the Commission and Parliament ?
Should EU research not be concerned with areas about which there is consensus instead
