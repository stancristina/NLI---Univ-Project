forward a range of points that I consider essential in the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries .
We recall , for example , the recent proposal to ban deep-water trawling off the Azores , Madeira and the Canary Islands , a position that we advocated in Parliament .
These regions are characterised by permanent structural disadvantages which set them apart from the other regions of EU Member States .
Of these , I wish to highlight the need to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks and the activities of fishing communities in these regions .
Despite our different perspectives and approaches , we came together in support of , firstly , the strategy proposed by the Commission for the sustainable development of the EU’s outermost regions , as regards the priorities , the instruments and , most importantly , the setting up of a specific programme to offset the additional costs relating to the specific , permanent constraints suffered by the outermost regions , such as remoteness , insularity , small size , difficult topography and climate , economic dependence on a few products and activities and the limited scope of local markets , and , secondly , the establishment of an action plan for the wider neighbourhood .
I therefore support the adoption of this report , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as it represents a further step in the right direction in response to the Commission ’s welcome proposal .
Other indicators must be used , as a matter of priority , such as the amount of activity in research and innovation , the level of education and training , the extent of diversification of productivity in the area and the unemployment rate .
That response must be characterised by solidarity and responsibility and requires territorial cohesion and the political courage to create the conditions whereby the EU can become a prosperous area , without discrepancies between north and south , east and west , between mountainous areas and outermost regions .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Guellec and my compatriot Mr Marques on their excellent reports .
Consequently , if the resources at its disposal become weakened , selfish interests will prevail and solidarity will be the loser , and without solidarity the feeling of belonging , the key element characterising European identity , will not be able to flourish .
An example of the latter is the proposals to amend the specific supply arrangements proposed by the Commission , which , if implemented one day , would lead to total economic paralysis in the Azores .
I therefore appeal for common sense to prevail , so as to ensure that the interests of a European cartel are not confused with the general interest and that a root and branch review can take place of the Commission ’s legislative proposal .     – Mr President , Commissioner , being more environmentally-friendly , safer and more cost-effective , rail transport ought to be used more by both European business and private users .
This does not benefit users in any way , shape or form .
In our view , the directive should apply to both in order to make the system simpler and more coherent .
I welcome the position taken by the Committee on Transport and Tourism as regards the Zīle report and , as a whole , I endorse the reports , in particular the Savary report , for its social and safety elements , and the Sterckx report .
Even if we are able to overcome these doubts regarding national transport and cabotage , we feel that establishing 1 January 2012 as the date for the liberalisation of national transport services is unacceptable , which is why we are seeking a rethink whereby the final say on the matter is left to the Member States .     – This report is , in a word , unacceptable .
The purpose of liberalising the railways is to hand this sector over on a plate to the private sector , leaving the railways subject to the profit imperative , and yet massively subsidised by the Member States .
We also object to Turkey’s continued ban on vessels flying the Cypriot flag and vessels from ports in the Republic of Cyprus from entering Turkish ports , and to the ban on Cypriot aircraft from flying over Turkish airspace and landing in Turkish airports .
Firstly , by rejecting the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats clearly stating that ‘…most importantly… , from the outset , the negotiations must be conducted with an open mind , and ways forward other than full accession should be considered’ , Parliament clearly refuses to incorporate a Plan B into its resolution , which I feel is essential if we are to avoid the possibility , at some point in the future , of the opening of the negotiation process being taken as full commitment to accession .
In a market that , naturally , cannot be completely assessed by the consumers , it is therefore the public authorities ’ responsibility to provide these much-needed guarantees .
It has come to light that the rules currently in force in this area do not guarantee the key factors in this extremely important task , namely , market transparency and freedom and independence for those carrying out audits , by which I mean properly carrying out audits .
It is true that the liberalisation of international transport has the potential to help revitalise rail transport , by fostering its growth and putting it on a more equal footing with air and road transport .
It is calling for the ‘opening up of the markets ’ throughout the passenger rail transport sector , and not only international transport , as the Commission ’s proposal had envisaged for this stage .
