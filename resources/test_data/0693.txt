response capacity in the event of potential future incidents .
It sometimes appears that the myriad consulting companies that hover around the European institutions , often composed of former officials or of officials on temporary leave , are more important than the citizens .
In a complex high level intermediation system it is sometimes easy to forget the citizens in favour of the pressure groups , overlooking those in greatest need in favour of those who are able to exert the most and the most effective pressure .
It seems that the Erika was not enough but the Prestige must be enough for this type of thing never to happen again !
I would highlight the aspects of this revision that are most worth saving : a permanent derogation governing access to resources within the 12-nautical mile zones of Member States ' territorial waters is crucial to traditional fishing and to the socio-economic fabric of regions that are dependent on fishing , defending small-scale coastal fishing , protecting fish stocks and the most sensitive part of the coastal rim .
As we have pointed out , there are other alternative ways of reducing the fishing effort , which have already been referred to here , such as the system based on regulating days at sea , the adoption of biological recovery periods and technical measures geared to more selective fishing .
We must nevertheless bear in mind that any reduction of fishing effort must go hand in hand with an increase in the financial resources for the FIFG and the Union 's internal policies , in order to compensate for the socio-economic effects of such a reduction .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the reports we are currently discussing are well structured , contain useful explanatory statements , put forward good arguments and , as Mrs Figueiredo said , are broadly to be welcomed .
In other words , the freedom to fish must be conditional on the marine resources available .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I represent a country of whose history fishing and the sea are an integral part and in which the fisheries sector still provides around fifty thousand jobs .
Lastly account must be taken of the efforts that some countries , in this case Portugal , have already made under the Multi-Annual Guidance Plans for fisheries , where the effort that has already been made to reduce the fleet should now be considered and deducted from their targets .
I would point out that there are other measures that are not irreversible and which will cause less upset in achieving a balance between fleet capacity and available fish resources .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Commissioner has already addressed the basic issue : the report adopts the results of the negotiations between the Commission and Angola , and even welcomes the way in which the negotiations were concluded and the protocol offers interesting fishing opportunities for the Member State fleets and is today the second largest , I believe , after the agreement signed with Mauritania .
EUR 5.5 billion are going to specific measures for research , control and monitoring , as the Commissioner has already rightly pointed out .
Angola 's fishing industry is extremely interesting .
The texts also state that fishing in Angola represents 3 % of the gross national product and so any effort to support the Angolan fishing industry is to be welcomed .
We are seeing a great deal of illegal tuna fishing , especially in tropical waters , such as the Gulf of Guinea , in which the tuna are killed before they even have time to reproduce .
I believe that we must not show any prejudice - in other words , fishing agreements must be made an integral part of the common fisheries policy : they can be of benefit to third countries , aiding their development and to the European Union , by improving the supply of its markets .
One of the key elements of dismantling networks that exploit migrants lies in obtaining information .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to begin by thanking everyone for their contribution to this debate and for the support expressed for the Commission 's proposal .
We are talking about short-term residence permits and these measures will not only have a major economic impact but will above all provide an important incentive for cooperation with police authorities .
I wish once again to thank Parliament for the support it has given this Commission initiative .
In addition to various proposals and concrete solutions that we will be discussing in the Convention and which of course reflect the position of the Commission and its idea of increasing internal power within the existing institutional framework , the main conclusion we drew from your words was the concern to answer one key question .
We feel that confidence in the Convention is , in fact , growing , because , in addition to the now traditional Community institutions , it also encompasses national institutions , in other words , the governments and the parliaments of the Member States and of the candidate countries .
Everything , then , is at stake and rightly so , because this is how debates should be undertaken .
We have confidence in the peoples of Europe and therefore believe in a Europe that means greater democracy and not the opposite , which is greater bureaucracy .
The Convention is now entering the critical stage of its work , and so we hope that the proposals that it puts forward , which we would like to be politically realistic and consensual , fulfil their task of enabling the Heads of State and Government who are present at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take the best decisions on behalf of the Member States and the peoples that they represent
