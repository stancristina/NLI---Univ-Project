, is continuing at unacceptably high levels .
The increase in the GDP in 1994 and 1995 was converted , in the case of household economies , into savings and not into a recovery of consumption levels .
In the second place it must be said that , apart from the structural measures - which generally , as I said , are expressed from the point of view of the supply economy - we must not forget policies for revival of demand which , in spite of all that is said about the death of Keynesianism , remain applicable even today , and which must be organized or coordinated at European level , at the level of the Union as a whole , since there is very little margin left at the level of the Member States for anti-cyclic policies .
They all emphasize environmental conservation .
I have always said that Community law is amongst the most advanced in the world if we were able to see that it was enforced .
The EEC Treaty set up an area without borders for the single market in which the free circulation of goods was guaranteed .
These categories of cultural goods include paintings - Category 3 - and drawings - Category 4 .
If , in the end , water colours , pastels and gouache cannot be classified in all cases as either paintings or drawings , both for purely terminological reasons and on financial grounds , only one solution remains : these types of work must be placed in a separate intermediate category .
Do you not think that the Commission should tackle that subject of employment and the training for our human capital , which is so important for the future ?
For Morocco this agreement is a fundamental political option aimed at anchoring its economy and society firmly to Europe , but it must not be forgotten that there are also economic risks inherent in carrying out the agreement .
We must not forget sources of energy vital to the European Union necessarily pass through Morocco .
The agreement we are discussing has an economic and commercial content , aimed fundamentally at the economic and social development of the Kingdom of Morocco and the growth of economic and commercial relations between Morocco and the European Union .
We shall say 'no ' because we believe that this type of agreement should further the economic and social development of the countries with which they are concluded , but it should also further their political development , which includes strict regard for human rights .
In the Committee on Budgets we gave an opinion favourable to the association agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco in a letter signed by the chairman of the committee himself .
But , ladies and gentlemen , let us give it a chance and let us have patience to sort things out .
Precisely for that reason , because it deserves this confidence , because we believe in a democratic Morocco , more democratic than the present one , because we believe in a Morocco in which there will be room for economic and social progress , for that very reason we have to say 'yes ' to this agreement .
In view of Spain 's subsequent experience I am in favour of this agreement and of support for the most active sectors of society .
Two days ago I had the opportunity to meet the Croatian Foreign Affairs Minister , Mr Mate Granich , following a week-long tour of Bosnia-Herzegovina where , after seeing the situation in Mostar in fair detail and having spoken to refugees of Serbian origin who had left Croatia , I was able to discuss with the minister the various issues , which Mr Fassino also mentioned , such as the main reasons for deferring Croatia 's accession to the Council of Europe .
Croatia has a direct responsibility for that and only by the will of Croatia can the present situation be prevented from dragging on .
It has not been possible for the recommendations of the group of experts to be incorporated in the fourth framework programme , and that is really serious .
We should like to draw attention to two of them .
The only place in which it lived was the Risco de Zamara in the Island of Lanzarote .
But if blocking the Community institutions does not count as political pressure I cannot imagine what does .
It must be made clear that decisions are based on rigorously scientific grounds so that it may not be thought that economic interests and political pressures are taking precedence over protection of the public health .
Mr President , I think the attitude of the United Kingdom on this question is not only regrettable but fundamentally reprehensible .
Only that will really help to restore consumers ' confidence .
Here the Union 's solidarity in the face of this serious crisis is demonstrated .
One Member was saying that in a similar matter - African horse sickness - her country was left to cope alone , and that should not be the position either .
We must not play with these things .
We therefore welcome the fact that Mr Linkohr has incorporated into his report our amendments concerning the elderly and health care - areas which will present the most urgent problems in the coming years .
One cannot fail to take account of the different conditions prevailing in the various Member States .
Mr President , I have listened carefully to the speeches of all those have taken part in this debate , and I was particularly struck by Mr de Silguy 's comments .
We accepted Mrs Randzio-Plath 's amendment to paragraph 10 in committee , but the second part of that paragraph - referring to the role of the EMI - has been left in by mistake .
