Therefore , in a report in 2005 this Parliament called on the Commission to submit a directive for this sector .
Incidentally , we should be having this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg .
In future , when we will have an even stronger European internal market and will gain European powers , as Mr Sarkozy has of course planned , then the European Parliament as an elected institution in Europe must be involved in genuine control , a control that we have in the national parliaments , but do not yet have in the European Parliament .
The same goes for reducing corruption .
Madam President , I would urge my fellow Member Mr van Orden to consider the fact that the only person here who supports him is the German far-left extremist .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposals in the so-called pharmaceutical package which I am presenting this evening at Parliament 's request have a common theme .
We have discovered fake medicines at different stages of the supply chain .
Finally , the pharmaceutical package includes a proposal for improved patient information .
As things currently stand in Europe , if a medicine is American , then the information is available , and if it is European , the information is not available .
Work on the database is going well and it will be available in the foreseeable future .
The medicines which are being faked have already been approved , which means that any issues of intellectual property have been resolved .
I have said something about the grey area , in other words , the surreptitious advertising which you also mentioned .
There is no doubt that dichloromethane is hazardous to human health because it is highly volatile .
In addition , protective respiratory equipment must be worn when the workplace limits are exceeded .
This is the reason why the Commission presented its proposal in the way that it did , because we wanted to produce a proposal which had a chance of being accepted and this is now what has happened .
This parliamentary term started with the Dutch Presidency , headed by Mr Balkenende , and no one remembers what he said here and what we replied .
If the European Union wishes to assume the global role described by the Commission President , among others , in the matters of energy security or the Gaza conflict , it cannot allow itself to disintegrate ; we need the Union of 27 as a strong economic and political bloc .
So far , this conflict has claimed 1 000 lives in 17 days .
For example , there is the Quartet , and one of the possible tasks of the European Union within the Quartet is to enable such mediation on dialogue .
Over and above this debate about Russian gas , Europeans collectively must answer the question as to what relationship they actually want to have with Russia in future .
Who is helping him and thus placing themselves and him under an even greater burden of guilt ?
I wish to thank the Commission for its efforts .
Unfortunately , there is no mention of this in the resolution .
I firmly believe that it would make a distinct improvement if the call contained in this report for greater diversification of the gas corridors were answered .
Where the report is untenable , however , is in its call to the Commission to draw up a specific road map for nuclear investments .
That did not happen .
There has , of course , been a certain amount of friction , in particular here in Parliament between our committee , the Committee on Regional Development , and the Committee on International Trade , relating primarily to the compatibility of this agreement with the rules of the WTO and especially the issue of parliamentary scrutiny .
We can only combat this abuse successfully by attacking it at the roots .
However , it must be used for civilian purposes .
However , it is important that we never lose sight of the welfare of children and make appropriate , affordable childcare facilities available .
The most senior Islamic cleric in Saudi Arabia has described girls aged 10 or 12 as 'marriageable ' and has demanded the right for child marriages to take place .
Unfortunately , torture takes place all over the world and we constantly condemn it .
It is disastrous , because our behaviour is worse than those people who , like Barack Obama , go there and say that despite all the risks that they themselves are taking , despite the opposition among the military , despite the opposition in the USA , because the people there are also saying 'leave them in Guantánamo , do not bring them here , here they represent a bigger risk' , who say that despite all this opposition , there is a symbolic power which results from the fact that a new president is returning to a respect for human and fundamental rights , including the rights of those who themselves have not shown any regard for human and fundamental rights .
It was important that the European Parliament constantly repeated its call for the closure of Guantánamo over a long period .
We had invited quite high-level experts such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Rajendra Pachauri , and experts in science , research and , of course , politics .
For that reason , the report also states that it ultimately points the way and indicates the way forward - particularly for Europe , as in Europe we have a vast amount of environmental technology , the volume of which is comparable with the European car industry .
We have produced a roadmap to take us to Copenhagen , which naturally contains signposts as well as stop signs and unrestricted travel
