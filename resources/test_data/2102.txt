I would also like to say to all of those people who have always noted a degree of rivalry between the national Parliaments and the European Parliament that our main allies in this Convention have been the national Parliaments .
I believe this is a triumph for the European citizens , who are going to have a Union capable of producing better results , a more transparent Union and , above all , a more efficient Union .
At the end of this process , moreover , Mr President , I believe we must put it to a referendum .
Without making a very detailed analysis and assessment - this is a job we will have to do during the summer and which will have to be carried out by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - and in passing , Mr President , I would like to complain on behalf of my group because Mr Napolitano has not been given speaking time as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
Furthermore , I believe we must welcome something which is also very positive , at a time when we have observers from the future member countries , and that is that they have participated fully in the work of the Convention before actually joining the Union .
Mr President , it is a great pleasure once again to be able to participate in this plenary session of the European Parliament to discuss issues which are essential to the European Union and to the World in general .
On the positive side , I would highlight the Quartet meeting on Friday of the envoys to the region , headed by Mr Moratinos representing the European Union , which has been positive and which will allow us to hold a new meeting on Sunday of the Quartet in Amman , which will be attended by its principal leaders .
You are well aware of the intra-Palestinian negotiation .
On Monday , in Luxembourg , the General Affairs Council met in the morning with the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority , a friend of many of us , Nabil Shaat , and in the evening we received the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister .
It is the political aspect which affects me most directly .
In this first speech I have been asked to give you some brief information about Operation Artemis , the operation currently being carried out by the European Union in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , in the region of Ituri and more specifically in the city of Bunia .
I am glad to be able to say this , because many people in the Council , the Commission and the General Staff of the European Union have worked day and night producing high-quality documents which have allowed forces to be deployed in absolutely record time .
The operation is being led by a French commander , and France will act as the framework-nation for the operation .
I would therefore like to thank , on behalf of all of us , the country which is heading this operation , France , and all the members participating in it including - as I have said - countries from outside the continent , and I would like to address very directly our friends in Canada , which has not had the least hesitation in involving its forces in an operation led by the Europeans .
In other words , everybody loses here : the Israelis lose their security and the Palestinians lose the possibility of economic and political development , in other words the possibility of well-being for its people .
And therefore , Mr President , I believe it is very important for Parliament 's Bureau to invite him here so that he can give us his impressions and share his views with this House .
Iran is indeed a great country with which this Parliament - as we all hope and wish - must strengthen its friendly relations .
And just as , in the previous debate , I criticised the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister , Mr Sharon , did not receive the High Representative when he visited the Middle East , I also believe we must ask the next President ?in-Office of the Council , the Italian Prime Minister , when he goes to the Middle East , not just to visit Israel , but also the Palestinian Authority .
We must also - and in this regard I would point out that Commissioner GÃ¼nter Verheugen has just been in Israel - tell our Israeli friends that we are prepared to intensify our relations at all levels , as long as they also want to do so and are prepared to treat us as we deserve , particularly in view of the political will we have demonstrated .
What it does not need are new points of conflict , because we are facing a multiplication of points of conflict from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean rim .
In all honesty , I am not convinced at the moment that Ariel Sharon has any great enthusiasm , either for the process or for the document .
.
Secondly , there can be reservations , on the part of all those involved , provided that all Members of the ' Quartet ' are willing to implement the Roadmap in its entirety .
A Europe of these dimensions , with 25 democratic countries , which will soon have a population twice as large as that of the United States of America and four times that of Japan ( and I take as examples the large countries that , like ours , have a strong currency ) , a Europe which accounts for approximately one quarter of gross world product must not fail , I repeat , to be an
