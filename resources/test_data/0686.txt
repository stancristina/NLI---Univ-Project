the issue here .
Secondly , the national and regional basic areas would be defined in each Member State to allow the penalties to be applied more fairly , restricting them to the regions responsible for the situation .
Parliament was asked to extend the co-financing period .
The Committee on Budgetary Control and this rapporteur decided to accept as sufficient the promises made in a letter from Commissioner Fischler that by 31 December this year , that is , a year later than should have been the case in theory , all the Member States except the three new ones would have this system up and running .
There is not even enough control over the money which is intended to improve the control itself .
The issue does not have to be resolved now but we are obviously going to have a disagreement on this point in the Committee on Budgetary Control , which is responsible for analysis of the settlement of EAGGF accounts .
I was able to visit him on a number of occasions and was able to see at first hand the progress made there , as Mr Titley described it .
Although his precise whereabouts are known , nothing is being done to help him .
It is a model of mechanical alternation between the two majority groups of the European Parliament .
As a member of the European Parliament and Group President , I can give testimony to the work carried out by Mr Gil-Robles as Chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs , as Vice-President of the European Parliament , a dimension of his pro-European fight over many years in the European Federal Movement - a critical pro-European at that - which has put this man at the centre of the importance of European construction .
Mr President , in the Minutes of the sitting of 13 January , my name does not appear on the attendance register - no doubt through some error of my own .
We regret the fact that no provision has been made for genuine progress on the issue of citizenship , and we have the impression that the most important decisions on the reforms will be taken at the last minute , without transparency and without directly informing either the citizens or those who represent them , so that they can discuss things in a responsible way .
And we strongly disagree with the thrust of the pact on stability and growth .
The subject of majority voting in the Council - which is a crucial issue in the present Union , and will be even more so following enlargement - is not addressed .
In this context , I should like to ask the President-in-Office two questions .
He reminded us what economic and monetary union actually means and , further still , how it is interpreted by what might be called the Union 's economically and financially strongest Member States .
I believe that Parliament must call on the Dutch presidency to demand that President Milosevic recognize the results of the municipal elections of 17 November in their entirety .
As if these remarks were not unfortunate enough , he added that the southern Member States which were seeking to form part of the first wave of the third stage of EMU were guilty of hysteria .
In a show of generosity , he could also applaud the endeavours of governments such as that of my country , which are making tremendous efforts to form part of the first wave , full of enthusiasm for the latest phase of the process of European integration , which is the third stage of economic and monetary union .
To my mind , it is essential for your presidency to devote itself to clearing the Council 's desk .
The Council is the institution which most delays the adoption of draft directives and regulations .
I refer in particular to environment policy ; in this respect , it should be pointed out that we have been waiting for the realization of one of the proposals which you highlight in your programme - final implementation of the agreement on the CO2 energy tax - since 1992 , the year in which the Earth Summit took place , when we made a formal international commitment to bringing this legislative measure into effect in the European Union in the near future .
Mr President , as other speakers have said , at this final stage of the debate , we have to concern ourselves with the message that we are sending to the public .
With this joint text , moreover , the Union 's institutions are bringing to a close a debate which has gone on far too long , and it is good that Parliament has taken such an active part in that debate .
Mr Bertens said that the European Union had neglected these markets .
We need more resources for this programme , Commissioner , because we consider it to be extremely important .
Mr President , Commissioner , Fellow Members , I was interested to read the text of the report produced by Mr Bertens and the opinions of the various committees which contributed to shaping it .
I think that the European Union must adopt a global approach to its relations with Latin America which appreciates the very plurality of this continent .
Latin America and the European Union need each other , and on the basis of an equal footing and with commitment to a climate of cooperation , they need to reinforce the instruments of political and trade cooperation .
The European Union and Latin America should come together in every possible area of cooperation .
We must remember that , after tripling in the '80s , Latin America 's traditional trade surplus with the European Union diminished at the beginning of the '90s , practically disappearing in 1993 .
