Yugoslavia started and the country fell apart .
Does the Council agree that a supporting role from Europe might be useful ?
Japan has a golden opportunity to make up what it has caused in grief and suffering to the people of these areas by its occupation during the war .
We are on the eve of the last preparatory conference before the Rome Conference .
Against that background it is very important that the European Union and at this moment the European Parliament should exercise new leadership .
Regrettably , the ad-hoc tribunals in Arusha and The Hague on Rwanda and Yugoslavia have not managed to catch the perpetrators most responsible for the atrocities .
Mr President , in view of the mountains of papers on the necessity of this tribunal sent to my office in Brussels , I am becoming a little suspicious as to who is so keen to get through .
On behalf of the Green Group I would therefore like to express my support for the principle of a well-functioning international criminal court , but with the understanding that it should have sufficient resources .
The tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda , however , had a very clear objective .
I think that our entire group is very strongly in favour of the resolution before us .
It is clear that up until the year 2015 , Poland and Slovakia will see a modest increase in both the total population and the working population , but it will be lower than that of the EU.
Population growth is irregular , but in many regions appears to be evaporating towards the year 2015 .
Modernizing care for the elderly can save a great deal of money .
That is why I believe that the demographic data should be included in the annual report on employment , and that the solutions which are created for the Member States should continue to be discussed in the form of benchmarking .
Education and training in central and eastern European countries form the basis for social integration , lasting development and successful processes of economic transformation .
There is still a lack of clarity over the Foundation 's role in the preparatory stage of PHARE/TACIS measures in the field of vocational training .
Education and training plays an important part in these countries too , in areas such as the economy , the environment , and the strengthening of democracy .
It is a well known fact that education also instructs people in the way they think .
By giving them the basic elements , we can show them that the market economy is not an isolated entity , whilst at the same time sharing with them the perception that the market economy is also subject to preconditions .
The Foundation has developed itself successfully amidst the significant problems involved in a foundation , and which are , after all , entirely typical to this community .
Mr President , I have a comment regarding the Minutes .
With his proposal he has not only increased the role of this Parliament where it concerns taking suitable measures in case a Mediterranean partner fails to comply with the agreements on human rights ; he has accepted all institutions for what they are , but he has also done the Mediterranean partners a service , and in doing so made a practical interpretation of the Barcelona Convention possible again .
What Mr van Bladel said about that was correct , of course , namely that finances brought it to a standstill .
Thirdly , the Council is not even present .
Mr President , there was some misunderstanding yesterday on the Commission 's cooperation on this point , but it has been cleared up , and the report is now ready to be voted on .
Mr President , in the explanatory statement to his report , which was accepted yesterday , Mr Oostlander talks amongst other things about the criteria Slovakia must meet if it wants to participate in the talks on accession to the European Union .
The objective of today 's resolutions is to call on the Slovak Prime Minister Meciar , as well as the entire Slovak parliament , to put serious effort into resolving the political problems dividing the country .
Evidently , the Slovak government is not open to any criticism , and declares everyone who criticizes it to be enemies of the Slovak state .
It is a pity that the passage referring to this in the Green motion for a resolution did not find its way into the joint resolution .
It is about time that a country like Slovakia , which still wants to be considered - or so it says officially , in any case - for membership of the European Union , starts casting a serious glance at European environmental legislation .
This does not mean that the human rights organizations and the refugees do not thoroughly deserve our support , however .
I am an optimist by nature and in attitude , but I think it will become an extremely difficult task , and I fully agree with Mr Telkämper that we must ensure that the neighbouring countries discuss what should be done with Cambodia .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Mrs Álvarez has just pointed out , Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in the world . 60 % of the population is unemployed , many people are no longer able to afford a doctor , hospital care , and so on .
I sincerely hope the donors will save the country .
Mr President , we are going to help North Korea .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , last year Mr Sassou-Ngesso seized power once again , after heavy fighting
