on a purely constitutional basis , be the Member States that are responsible for health care within the European Union .
The objective of harmonisation , or of creating a European catalogue of social rights without linking this to funding by the Member States , is very dubious .
We have therefore chosen to vote against this report in its entirety .     We have today voted in favour of this report .
It is a modern form of colonialism .
We believe that a possible simplified procedure for changing the Constitution in the future must not mean ignoring the demand for ratification in all the national parliaments .
Large parts of the resolution go further than the Convention’s proposals .
We also oppose Parliament’s being given full right of codecision regarding the EU budget .
We wish to see a reference to Europe’s Judaeo-Christian and Biblical inheritance in the Preamble to a future European Constitution .
I therefore welcomed Amendment No 7 , involving support for the Presidency’s efforts to have Europe’s Judaeo-Christian inheritance incorporated .
Parliament voted against this , however ( by 349 votes in favour , with 147 against and 49 abstentions ) .
In and for itself , the resolution as a whole contains many good viewpoints and demands .
This is basically a question of democracy .
Now , a compromise is being presented between different owner constructions and owner interests , but still no concern is being shown for the employees .
In other contexts , we talk solemnly about the social dialogue in the European employment strategy as progress in EU policy .
There can be no legislation on takeover bids that is not in some way grounded in the fact that a company is also its employees .
It must be possible , in one way or another , to use information for something .
I think that the offeror should also be required to present an adjustment plan for the new company that is coming into being .
It is the dynamic companies that can be restructured that create jobs .
For fourteen years , we have tried to bring about these fair and common ground rules .
Over time , the various voting values tend to consolidate deficient corporate structures .
I also think there are important legal objections to retroactive legislation , and I can also see the point of entrepreneurs being able to go to the stock exchange to obtain extra capital for their life’s work without losing complete control of it .
We could have obtained more , and more is what we wanted .
If we continue in this pattern , we shall never become dynamic and competitive .     Mr President , a huge task has been carried out by a lot of people over many years .
Many believe that this has rescued the Nordic system of shares with different voting values .
It is the business of no one other than the shareholders themselves how they organise their shares .
The Swedish Government maintains that this revision clause is a victory because the revision is to embrace more forms of shareholding than simply the system of shares with different voting values .
Different voting values are a clear and straightforward system .
The fact is , however , that the number of takeovers in countries in which different voting values are applied is not in any way lower than the number in countries where this system is not permitted .
Public operators have a competitive advantage over those customers who are not able to claim back VAT , such as private individuals , charities and banks .
It is against this background that the Commission proposes that the exemption should be removed and that VAT should be charged at the standard rate for all items of mail over two kilos in weight .
All my proposals were voted down by the committee .
I also hope that Commissioner Bolkestein is able to live with them .
The amendments are along the right lines and will mean the start of a more properly functioning market .
Allow me , in the first place , to address those fellow MEPs of mine , in particular the British ones , who have been concerned about price rises .
Talk of price rises is seriously exaggerated .
On the assumption that this was all spent on sending standard letters costing 28 pence , the impact on the household would be that the annual cost would increase by £ 1.05 to £ 30.45 if the national operator were to increase the postage by one penny .
Finally , all those of you in this House who believe in a better , efficient market without obstacles and injustices cannot reject this proposal .
Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mr Goebbels , who have such good judgment on so many other issues , I am relying upon your judgment tomorrow too .
It might conceivably involve a deterioration in relation to the position in the majority of Member States .
Allow me to take a practical example .
I wanted to mention this in order to show how unreasonable it would be to adopt the reservations , now chosen by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , relating to existing levels of knowledge and to exemptions from liability if permission has been given .
This matter also affects the local authorities to a very great extent , and this fact must be taken account of in the vote .
The fundamental prerequisite of the control that will take place though the directive on takeover bids must be respect for the right of ownership .
The directive on takeover bids is , however , along the wrong lines .
If the directive is adopted , the Swedish system of A and B shares will continue as an exception .
There is no evidence for assertions to the effect that the system involving differentiated vote values impedes company takeovers
