Nor is the question being asked , why is it not working , which is surely the central point .
For the majority of the peoples of Europe , the legal system adopted by their National Parliaments is a matter of identity and democracy .
It is even claimed that this will increase democracy and bring Europe and its peoples closer together .
Is this what we want ?
We must abstain from voting on this report .
These are Judaism , Christianity , Hellenism and the Romans .
In point 23 , the rapporteur recommends that the Commission prepare material for schools covering the history of Europe which 'shall be introduced as an obligatory school subject in Member States ' .
Madam President , I think that , on the whole , we have a good report before us .
This is why I think that point 13 in the report , which discusses the Directive and the environmental implications is especially important .
It is extremely doubtful that this Directive was considered when the decision was taken to build this bridge .
I would also like to express my support for amendment proposal No. 2 from the Green Group which concerns the provision of financial support for environmental organisations which participate in the supervisory committee .
I would like to congratulate Mrs Weiler because , in my opinion , she has put her message across very clearly prior to this discussion .
A large proportion of the Union 's activities actions are currently concentrated on promoting markets and competition .
Under no circumstances must this be allowed to fall below the current level of the minimum existence wage .
For this reason I consider that harmonisation is neither possible nor is it desirable .
The requirement for the regulation of unsocial working hours is also an important point in the report as is our amendment proposal on financing social systems .
We must look seriously at the idea of alternative forms of taxation , i .e . to move the burden of taxation from work to environmentally related taxes , such as the carbon dioxide tax .
The EU can assist through coordination and cooperation .
The level of knowledge is constantly changing .
Mrs Weiler 's report is very positive in many respects .
We have , in fact , three or four different social models in Europe .
The greatest challenge is of course unemployment which affects the cost of the system and its income .
I also think it is important that the decisions for this sector are adopted by a qualified majority .
We will have a greater proportion of elderly people in Europe but this will also introduce an opportunity to create jobs .
On the other hand , Mrs Weiler does indicate a number of possibilities for finance .
I do not think so .
I do not want to see a social system with basic protection or standard security but a system which contains both of these and a system which as far as possible is financed through solidarity in order to minimise the need to look to the private sector for solutions .
It has crossed national boundaries and facilitated the spread of disease via animals and foodstuffs .
The free agricultural market is an outdated idea , it must be replaced , root and branch , before an even greater crisis befalls us .
Despite this , we have not undertaken any form of analysis worthy of such a name before taking a decision on the matter .
If we weigh it all up together , we are talking about a reduction in income of perhaps 4 million ECUs and approximately 100 000 jobs throughout the EU will disappear .
Mr President , I have a further question concerning the same subject so I am attaching it to Mr Stenmark 's question .
Then the question is whether we should stick to our principles or adapt to reality as it stands .
They will not believe a word I say about tackling unemployment .
To cite a concrete example : many ferry lines cross the Baltic Sea .
This would break up the close cooperation between these regions which are in otherwise receiving support from the EU via Interreg , support which is particularly allocated to cooperation on lines of communication .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer even if it was rather negative .
This is a line which will quite obviously be used to link Northern Sweden and Northern Finland , and also North Western Russia at a later date , with the other European railway networks .
The fact that it is not included in current plans is simply because the decision to build it was only taken quite recently .
Thank you for your response , it was not as bad as I thought .
My next question to the Commissioner is : What else does the Swedish government have to do to further its request for sufficient funds for this line ?
Mrs Ahlqvist is lying in bed with a temperature some 2 000 kilometres from here .
I think that Commissioner Cresson has really demonstrated a willingness to embrace the opportunities for the handicapped created by new technology .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mr Tamino for his well written report .
The Tamino report is about improving combined transport .
These are already widely divergent in the various EU Member States and all too often this is a great disadvantage to countries which already have long transport distances and high freight costs .
The fact that Europe 's railways are continuously losing their market share of goods transport is a big problem .
My third question is : If the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the Treaty , how will we be able to distinguish what was originally the
