express its view on the proposal for a Council decision on the adoption by Cyprus and Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008 .
For 2007 the forecasts made by the Commission in spring this year are for an unchanged deficit of 1.4 % of GDP.
The Commission ought to notify Parliament very early of all requests for convergence reports submitted by the Member States and should decide together with Parliament and the Council on the timetable for the procedure .
I believe that these common values must form the basis for our agreements , relations and partnerships with non-EU countries .
I believe that the Euro-Mediterranean dimension of Europe should be further strengthened in this area , just as Europe plays a part in the east , as regards the Balkans , the Caucasus and relations with the Russian Federation and Ukraine .
As the President-in-Office of the Council has said , with the United States of America we have two sets of difficult negotiations in progress .
This agreement , albeit on a less ambitious version of the framework decision than the Commission 's original proposal , in fact ensures that from the moment the framework decision enters into force and is transposed in each Member State , there will no longer be any safe haven in Europe for those who incite racial hatred , racism and xenophobia .
This represents a political success .
We have worked hard on this aspect and I believe that the final result is satisfactory .
This is an important principle , and I believe that the fact that all 27 Member States have accepted it unanimously puts the European Union in a better position to uphold this key value listed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mrs Roure for her persistent work with the Council in putting together this framework decision .
As Mr Frattini has said , we need to establish the limits within which there is a balance between freedom of expression and the fight against racism and xenophobia .
I do not agree , however , that the European Court of Justice should be given greater powers on asylum , thus taking jurisdiction away from Member States .
I believe that this is indicative of a problem that we have within the European Union . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , for a few seconds the display for the sitting said 'Iraqi refugees ' .
Instead , I believe that we should call strongly for a review of the European Union 's common position and for a review of the embargo .
The Union is not and must not be a State ; it is a communion of States , and requires visual symbols to represent it .
This has produced the text we are considering , which was adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , but I would like to try to clarify one point .
The problem is to achieve these objectives in a balanced way , and certainly to avoid trading safeguards , such as safeguards in companies for the safeguards of the employment market .
This is unacceptable .
This is why we are not convinced by the concept of flexicurity , of weak contracts replaced by welfare benefits : no , the benefits must be in the contract and they must act as safeguards for the worker , as a European citizen .
This means working to use alternative fuels or the same fuels with more efficient engines , trying to organise more efficient journeys with the aid of logistics but also , and above all , adding principles and logic to our need to insist on the better use of more energy-efficient and climate-friendly transport , as well as organising our lives in such as way as to reduce unnecessary mobility demands .
The EU 's transport policy is riddled with inconsistencies .
We have been afraid to tell the whole truth about the costs .
There is talk of transferring goods traffic to rail , yet the plans are for a high-speed passenger line .p The objectives of a socially acceptable and environmentally-friendly transport policy need to be : reducing unnecessary traffic flows , moving to more environmentally-friendly transport methods , being honest about the cost - which means transport prices must include all the costs of construction , maintenance , addressing environmental and health problems , and the cost of accidents - and sustainable taxation of transport based on CO2 emissions , including , most importantly , for air traffic . on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at a time when the European Commission has begun talks with China with a view to a new partnership and cooperation agreement , Parliament 's Committee on International Trade feels a duty to draw the attention of the Community executive to some well-known issues , which characterise relations with the Asian giant .
China has a right to economic growth and development , which equates to well-being for its citizens , which also constitutes an opportunity for the world economy .
Above all , food-related counterfeiting , which has recently been an increasing problem , deserves the greatest attention because it affects the health of ignorant and defenceless citizens who trust in the appearance of labels .
We must note that the repeated requests for wage moderation , under certain conditions that have a solid basis from an economic point of view , are in fact far from the daily lives of individual citizens , and it is therefore clear that , at the moment , some Member States , including Italy , which is experiencing severe social tensions , are having real difficulties in channelling all additional revenue towards debt reduction .
