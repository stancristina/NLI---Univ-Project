I ask the European Commission to make further efforts in terms of scientific research to find a way of dealing with this serious disease , by banning any type of phytosanitary treatment during flowering periods .
Citizens should view the European institutions in the way in which they view the buildings that house us : our institutions ought to be accessible .
Similarly , we advocate extending the blue card to those already resident in the Member States and lengthening the extension in the event of job loss to six months .
The family consists of the mother , the semi-paralysed father with heart problems and five children , a family that have been refugees from their land since 1948 , thrown out of a house in East Jerusalem , along with thousands and thousands of other Palestinians .
I therefore believe that , as Mrs De Keyser also said , the policy towards East Jerusalem is a colonial policy by Israel that is not recognised by the international community .
Too many funds have not been used , too many have been wasted on measures and projects which have produced no results .
Exploitation and illegal activities cannot be tolerated at all in any form .
There is a real campaign of criminalisation being conducted in Europe against the Roma community .
It is our honour and dignity which are also at stake .
I am not , however , specifically criticising Israel ; far from it !
As we are all well aware , we have received information to the effect that , compared to the initial forecasts which the REACH system was based on , the number of pre-registrations has not only been high , but actually far higher than predicted .
We have had problems because REACH has even been operating too efficiently and has uncovered substances that are actually unknown , which are starting to pop up .
I would like to ask a question , if I may , which is perhaps premature as it is not possible yet to probably have the relevant data and an assessment of this matter .
It is essential that these two conditions be combined , as having one without the other would frustrate all our efforts and could even have irreparable consequences for our industry .
Greater energy efficiency and the widespread use of renewables are the key to leaving the economic crisis behind .
This should also be the case to ensure the future of the renewable energy-based system .
I would like to say to the French Presidency , whom I thank nonetheless for their commitment , that sufficient effort was not made to talk effectively with Parliament .
Secondly there is the whole issue of the concept of on-call time , which in practice tends to be considered equal to a rest period .
I hope that they are accepted .
We have concluded a piece of work which , as the President pointed out , is age-old and has been debated for many years .
I would like to take the opportunity , however , to emphasise Morocco 's repeated violation of human rights and failure to respect international obligations in relation to the Sahrawi issue .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting for this report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski , which provides for improved cooperation with Albania .
This is so that we do not run the risk , as often happens , of economic cooperation proceeding more swiftly than social development .
I agree with Mrs Madeira that we ought to act in an integrated manner and take a coherent approach to strategies in policies on the environment , energy , the sea and transport , so that the various measures to promote tourism are consistent , benefiting those living in coastal areas and the European economy in general .
It is the duty of the European Parliament to continue to monitor its effectiveness and the attainment of its objectives .
We have welcomed and supported the political vision of a Presidency that has repositioned politics at the centre of the debate , and as a result has repositioned Europe at the centre of world debate .
We thank the French Presidency for having brought the proposal back to life .
The agreement reached in the Council and the will of the European Parliament send out a positive message : we cannot tackle this serious economic crisis without changing our strategy .
Those , like Mr Berlusconi , who mocked the European 'three winds ' directive and called it a quixotic plan , have been proven wrong .
We have the right credentials to go to Copenhagen next year with authority and in a position of strength , able to ask all the other countries of the world to do as Europe has done .
We know that Mr Berlusconi 's words were propaganda , because that is not the reality of how things work with this package .
I too would like to mention Mr LÃ©glise-Costa , who led this initiative with great professionalism .
Finally , we have introduced greater flexibility , as I said , because , as we have managed to strengthen the regulation , it has been possible , reasonable and fair to allow businesses to take a gradual approach , phasing in the new measures between 2012 and 2015 .
For the first time , in fact , we have regulated CO2 emissions from passenger vehicles by imposing an ambitious and binding long-term target of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020 , at a time when the serious financial crisis and the subsidies given to the motor industry in non-EU countries are , together , severely testing our own industry .
It is quite easy to work out , and you do not need an impact assessment to get the answer .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin
