I should therefore like to ask you directly , Commissioner , whether I heard you correctly and whether you do in fact interpret Article 11 of the directive as saying that the Commission undertakes to present a new proposal as soon as there is new knowledge of the long-term effects of electromagnetic fields .
I should be very glad if the Commission could confirm this .
It is quite simply because I want to take the opportunity to praise the work done by the European Women’s Lobby .
I believe , however , that it is also safe to say that , if the European Women’s Lobby were not active in this area , it would be much more difficult to push through a number of gender equality initiatives .
It is important for the Women’s Lobby , together with the organisations of MEPs in the individual nations , to be active so that we can continue to pursue the work concerning women , even though there are cultural differences between the new and old EU countries .     Mr President , if there had been any doubt that this proposal for a directive were also about men and money , there was , in any case , no longer any such doubt when a number of jacket-clad men appeared on the rows furthest to the back during the discussion of this subject by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
When they came to my office with views opposed to the proposal , a number of insurance people said that they just wanted to see a fair system .
Their conception of fairness was obvious .
This means , for example , that women who cannot have children have to pay for those who can , while , from this insurance point of view , the children’s fathers do not participate in any form of financial solidarity at all .
I am of course in complete disagreement with the insurance industry .
Equality is a fundamental principle in the EU.
It is also stated that the EU must take initiatives to remedy situations in which these principles are not being complied with .
I should like to say that , in my view , there is much more at stake than just this proposal , for it is in reality the future of the EU that is at issue .
When women now look at the ‘family photo’ , it is difficult for them to identify with the EU they see there .
Only because of the rapporteur’s persistence and huge efforts have we got so far as to have the report on the agenda for this part-session .
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I have tabled an amendment that limits the journey time for animals for slaughter to eight hours .
I am genuinely pleased that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted my amendment concerning differentiated places in the case of journey times of less than four hours , for this will contribute to still more journeys taking place over short distances and , thus , to animals remaining in their countries of origin and being slaughtered there .
In addition to journey times , there must be a lot of focus upon the conditions under which animals are transported , for even a journey time of two hours can be too long if the conditions are not as they should be .
I am therefore delighted that the proposal on the table contains so many good decisions about ventilation , temperature and gradients of loading ramps .
The implementation of the internal market has required the elimination of the veterinary borders .
It must be possible to transport livestock freely around the whole of the EU like any other goods .
The Commission ’s proposal is a consistent implementation of this idea .
A small pig born in Sweden can be fattened in Portugal and slaughtered in Poland , as long as savings are thereby made .
Animal welfare has nothing to do with it .
Veterinary safety is threatened , with animal and human health suffering as a result .
For example , we now have the multi-resistant salmonella DT104 in Denmark .
This must be stopped .
Amendment No 100 exempts livestock from the rules governing the internal market .
It must be possible to introduce veterinary inspections at the borders with attendant quarantine arrangements .
Moreover , this will apply to all animals , both those that are going to slaughter and those that are for fattening .
That is necessary in order constantly to evaluate whether the journeys have been defensible in terms of the animals ’ welfare .
In the amendment , I also propose that animal transport exceeding eight hours should be subject to a levy towards the funding of checks and supervision .
The expenses linked to this aspect of livestock production must be defrayed in the form of a charge paid by the haulage contractors to the local authorities .
There is no question of an EU tax .     Mr President , the Commission has given its proposal for a regulation the title ‘Protection of animals during transport’ .
I should probably say that , in my view , there is a considerable disparity between the title of the proposal and its content .
In my view , that cannot be called protection of animals during transport .
Because it is defensible in terms of animal protection , that would be the proposal to implement .
There is a long list of amendments that I think would remedy some of the shortcomings in the Commission ’s proposal , so that animal welfare is given precedence over the financial considerations that otherwise govern the transports .
I believe that these would be some of the most effective measures that could be implemented .
It cannot be right that
