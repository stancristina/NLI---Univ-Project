Between 1994 and 1999 ( Delors II package ) 51 % of the population of the ÅU received support , of which only 25 % corresponded to Objective 1 , which funds NUTS II type regions .
Some countries benefit even more because the NUTS III type administrative divisions are very small compared with other countries .
The only thing achieved with any degree of satisfaction is that people have been paid to turn a blind eye and mechanisms have been created to promote the interests of the large monopolies , which have benefited most from Community programmes .
.
At the same time , more mass redundancies are on the cards in important sectors of the economy , such as transport , tourism etc .
Geographical mobility of the workers serves no purpose except to strengthen the concentration of human resources and wealth in the rich areas of the ÅU , which get richer by absorbing the best manpower and scientists .
The policy which the ÅU persists in applying , despite an average rate of growth of 3.3 % in 2000 , does not appear to be reducing the unemployment or the poverty which is the bane of the lives of 22 % of the population of the ÅU.
And quite rightly so .
It is one of the most important texts to pass through the European Parliament .
The rapporteur demonstrates that a great deal can be done in the area of both democracy and efficiency without revising the Treaties , merely by applying them more accurately .
The General Affairs Council should meet more frequently , but with the ministers present , not just in Brussels but , if possible , at the meetings too .
The members of the Council need to make a reasonable division between their national and European duties if they are to make a more effective contribution .
The first is item 9 , which refers to the Council 's two areas of work , namely the legislative and the executive .
It would be unfair to the Council not to say that certain steps have been taken , but that does not mean that more are not needed .
The High Representative needs to learn that his relations with Parliament come within a certain framework and are governed by certain rules which he would do well to understand .
It is an issue which concerns all the institutional bodies of the European Union .
Allow me , therefore , to point out that very little progress has been made with women 's rights in Turkey , rights which we , the Committee , consider to be a sine qua non to the integration of Turkey into the European Union , because women 's rights are human rights .
It is quite unacceptable to introduce changes to the Civil Code that only apply to future generations and I know that women 's organisations in Turkey have expressed their total opposition to this .
So all that remains is to ascertain the extent to which Turkey will basically respond to the good will and to the spirit which dominates the report , by which I mean the spirit of constructive criticism of numerous Turkish shortcomings , the deliberately indirect reference to the continuing Turkish military occupation of Cyprus , which is unacceptable in a civilised society , the fact that previous Turkish crimes , such as the genocide of the Armenians , have been passed over in silence , contrasting with praise for any minor progress made by Turkey or any circumstantial compliance by Turkey with its contractual obligations , such as Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty .
That is its basic message .
Turkey 's efforts to modernise started at the end of the nineteenth century .
Turkey suffered the historical accident of basically coming out unscathed - not unscathed as such , because it suffered a great deal - but it was not defeated in either the First or the Second World War .
Sometimes it is better to lose than to win a war .
Turkey is a third world European country which needs to learn the same lesson as France and Germany , that is , that if we want to move on , we have to stop waging the wars of the 1920s or the wars of the 1940s in the present day .
It sees progress where there is none , it extols the famous 'national programme ' and a number of individual reforms which , basically , do no more than pull the wool over the eyes of the world in order to conceal the continuing and , from certain sides , the worsening situation for the working classes .
Arrests , over 10 000 political prisoners , torture chambers , murders , inhumane conditions in prisons , which are extolled in the report , are on the agenda .
However , the key point of the report is Paragraph 29 , which extols Turkey 's contribution to the fight against terrorism , clearly dismissing the Kurdish fighters , and its peace-brokering efforts in the Balkans , obviously meaning its open support for the KLA criminals , and it incites it to facilitate the application of the ÍÁÔÏ treaty .
.
As regards the "enemy within" , the summit is planning to speed up anti-democratic legislative arrangements on a common definition of terrorism and a common European arrest warrant at a speed which is revelatory of their intentions .
The demonstrations , which were attended by demonstrators from around the world , were one of the deciding factors in bringing down the talks .
In the agricultural sector , rapid restructuring is being called for in order to concentrate the land in a few hands and forge another link in the chain controlled by the network of multinationals .
The rules which govern international economic relations and trade should serve
