The Green Paper on energy efficiency forms the basis of the Commission ’s Energy Efficiency Action Plan , a highly important document that plays a key role in combating climate change , environmental pollution and the abuse of natural resources , and in safeguarding energy supplies .
The report also states that , in spite of all the resolutions laid down by all the European and international institutions , women do not take part in areas such as conflict prevention and resolution , and peace keeping operations .
I regret that the rapporteur emphasises the suffering of women in conflict situations in order to impose and export her notion of ‘sexual and reproductive health’ , including the promotion of abortion , which is certainly not accepted by all Member States .
It is essential that the sexual exploitation and trafficking of women be repudiated and that every measure be adopted to stop the promotion of prostitution and the trafficking that is generally associated with it , since it is actually a genuine form of slavery , as has already been stated here .
Together with Mr Seeber and other fellow Members , I visited some of the countries most affected by the flooding and we were able to observe the damage caused by the 2005 floods .
Already this year as well , thousands of people have had to abandon their homes and many factories have had to stop work , not only in Germany but also in other countries such as the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary and Austria .
Well , let us be ambitious in preventing disasters and creative in finding answers to questions like : What can we do to stop a natural phenomenon from turning into a disaster ?
In today’s world , the global economy presents us with new difficulties , and yet also with new attractions .
We are all aware that the European tourist industry is one of the sectors that can best react to the challenges set by the global economy .
Let us look at the evidence : why has the Commission not followed up on our proposals to address the problem of seasonality , specifically by strengthening the mechanisms to develop senior tourism in the low season ?
As far as initiative and dynamism go , we have to recognise that that is not nearly good enough .
Even so , one would expect greater vision , greater political willingness , and the ability to make decisions and , above all , to send out clear signals to private economic operators and the Member States themselves .
To conclude , Commissioner , let me reformulate the question that prompted this debate .
I shall mention two points in support of European action : the major economic and social significance of tourism , associated with the importance of the new information and communications technologies and with the innovation that it promotes , will make this one of the sectors that will contribute most to competitiveness and job creation , in line with the Lisbon Strategy .
Research must also be carried out into solving the energy problem .
This includes producing high-quality traditional produce , safeguarding the natural environment , protecting against natural risks and conserving the beauty and the value of the landscape .
At this stage , the main challenges are twofold : firstly , to ensure that the extension of the scope of the directive complies with the subsidiarity principle ; and secondly , the effects of certain measures on farming practices and the need to introduce some amendments should , as the rapporteur says , lead to Community aid under the CAP being granted .
This will be remedied by the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , who has also endeavoured to ensure that this complies as far as possible with the framework directive .
At present there is no legal instrument at European level for flood risk protection .
All of those who have always condemned this unacceptable , brutal and inhuman situation have a duty to condemn these practices .
In this war , there are no properly uniformed and identifiable combatants , in line with the Geneva Convention .
Nevertheless , although the international legal system does not have an adequate response to the new reality of the terrorist threat , I feel that the Member States have a duty to seek a fresh solution that is humane , just and secure .
Yet what is emerging is that Europe lacks a common area with a shared project in the field of criminal law .
What this shows is mutual recognition of individual criminal justice systems without any essential base of harmonisation .
The recent adoption of the proposed directive on retention of data was accompanied by a clear call for adequate guarantees to be adopted as part of this framework decision .
Consequently , the adoption of this framework decision is both urgently needed and extremely important .
Hence the need to strengthen mutual trust whereby legal decisions are mutually recognised .
The principle of speciality , whereby the person is not tried for acts other than those for which he is serving his sentence , must also be upheld .
A solution needs to be found quickly to the problem of data being unavailable or hardly comparable in some Member States , which hampers general monitoring of the European drugs situation .
They sidestep the fact that the main reason for people 's discontent is the current social crisis , which is dealt with only marginally in the proposed Council conclusions and postponed until a report is submitted by March 2007 .
Its role is to collect , analyse and disseminate objective , reliable and comparable data and in turn to provide an accurate overview of the phenomenon in Europe .
I also wish to highlight the importance of improving the exchange of information on best practice in addressing drug issues and making that exchange more flexible .     .
We therefore voted in
