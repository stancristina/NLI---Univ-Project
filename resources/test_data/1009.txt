Their aim is that the EU will play a leading role in the international struggle to slow down climatic change .
According to an estimate made by the European Environment Agency , greenhouse gas emissions in the EU are expected to increase by 6 % during the period 1990 - 2010 .
For that reason the committee is encouraging the Commission to make proposals in its new Green Paper to alter attitudes to transportation in densely built-up areas so that greenhouse gas emissions may be permanently reduced .
The EU' s own input is vital , especially as the outcome of the sixth conference of the parties to the agreement cannot yet be certain .
As politicians , we are used to making compromises with regard to almost anything , and we have learnt that the world is shaped that way - shaped for compromise .
But now we have before us a party we cannot negotiate with .
This is such a simple fact that I almost feel ashamed to mention it , but I believe this is the main source of confusion in the way we think .
Individual countries are responsible for implementing the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol and the obligations related to the Union ' s distribution of the burden .
Although a given sector might be amongst the world ' s best in terms of environmental efficiency in one country , and I can say that is true of many sectors of industry in my country , Finland , for example , it might have to agree to a more stringent quota for emissions than its less efficient competitor in another country .
Along with France , my own country , Finland , is at present the only EU country where the building of additional nuclear power stations is being considered .
I wholeheartedly support the building of additional nuclear power plants , as it would give our energy-intensive industry a greater competitive advantage both in terms of economy and emissions .
I would also like to emphasise the importance of voluntary , negotiated target agreements .
For the Commission this is an important and very successful achievement , it must be said .
In just a few weeks we in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy have dealt with this issue and have , under the leadership of the rapporteur , succeeded in negotiating this proposal with the Commission and the Council , a proposal that must surely be adopted tomorrow without amendment .
This is my firm belief .
Local networks have , I would say , been the greatest bottleneck in the European telecommunications market and now it is being removed , and if it is not , then the national authorities can intervene , and if the prices are not right we then have recourse for compensation .
This is just the right measure as far as consumers are concerned , and it will help us too .
On the other hand , in the parliamentary amendments we have given consideration to the fact that the owners of the network and those who built it should not go penniless : they must receive a fair income for their work and , furthermore , their future investment in the network must be made possible for the future organisation of the infrastructure .
The auction of radio frequencies , however , is promoting developments in the opposite direction .
It is pushing up charges to the consumer and has led to something like chaos in the market .
States are losing their ability to control matters .
This is therefore a matter of a sort of private agreement , which means that the market can no longer function properly .
I share the concerns of those of my colleagues who have already spoken and agree with what they have said .
This morning the euro sank to an all-time low .
That is a new record .
This is excellent work on the part of the Commission .
On the other hand , the largest item of expenditure in cross-border credit transfers is manual handling , and a decision should be taken quickly to dispense with that .
We cannot force banks to engage in unprofitable business , but , as politicians , what we can do is support the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , which calls for measures to be implemented before the end of next year , and , preferably , for these standards to be in place when the euro coins and notes come into circulation .
Helping democracy to take root and establishing the rule of law are vital .
The main area of focus must not be how the flood of immigrants and refugees may be brought under control , but how conditions in the region can be improved so that people can stay in their homes .
But it is just as essential to protect the rights of the minorities in Kosovo : the Serbs and the Romanies .
Economic growth enables difficulties to be overcome in crisis areas .
It is not enough merely to pile up aid : we need enterprise at grassroots level and we need to encourage people to stand on their own two feet .
Money , as is well known , brings peace .
Right now the region needs a guiding hand .
Madam President , I would like to draw your attention to a certain written statement that my colleague , Mr Ebner , is putting forward .
I would like to tell you and all my colleagues that this statement is being marketed in a way that makes it appear favourably disposed towards birds , as promoting their welfare , but I can tell you that that is not
