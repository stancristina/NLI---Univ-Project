, when some time ago we drafted the emissions trading directive , it was hard to imagine any other report that would have so much influence on the situation in Europe and about which the decision-makers knew so little .
As we are now extending the front where the fight against climate change is taking place , we can no longer afford to make the same mistakes again .
It is in this context now that the call in this report for the EU to show leadership in the fight against climate change by taking regional and early action reminds me too much of an attitude for which at present we are paying rather a high price .
It is obvious that we have to address the problem of emissions from aviation , but the success of the project itself will be decided by the remedies chosen to achieve the goal .
On the basis of my initiative and in the name of our group , we have tabled an amendment in which we insist on a clear evaluation of the effects being made , caps on emissions being defined , and an explanation regarding what agency will in practice be responsible for the action to bring about reductions as called for , and , in particular , how we are to ensure that airlines outside the EU are also involved in emissions trading .
The priority remedies are , for example , the development of technology and the smooth flow of air traffic itself , because a good number of emissions are the result of using obsolete fleets and airport congestion .
Mr President , the regulation on applying the provisions of the Aarhus Convention to Community institutions , which will finally be voted on regarding its adoption in tomorrow’s plenary session , will complete a process whose principal beneficiary will be the EU citizen .
The issue concerns important environmental legislation which applies to access to environmental information and public participation in decision-making .
The end result itself is , I believe , a balanced one .
After some initial problems of interpretation , we found a common policy , which we successfully upheld .
That is why I am especially happy that we were able to improve the transparency of the institutions while retaining the powers , but also the accountability , of the institutions to which they are relevant .
That is why I did not consider it right to go down a path where politicians would be delegating power away from themselves to less open and less transparent agencies .
The Aarhus Convention , ratified by the EU and the Member States in the European Community , will be implemented by means of three directives , the two first so-called pillars of which have already passed through the codecision procedure , with conciliation .
The fate of the third pillar , the directive on access to justice , is , unfortunately , still unknown .
Parliament’s amendments contained technical and legal errors , which was one factor in the reason why our Conciliation Committee was closer to the view of the Commission and the Council than was still evident after the second reading .
Legally , however , it would have been impossible , as the directive is only intended for the Member States .
The other difficult area where we abandoned the view reached during the second reading was the right for the public to participate in the drafting of action plans and programmes funded by the EU institutions .
Right at the start there had been some confusion over concepts relating to this amendment .
We nevertheless negotiated a good compromise .
Furthermore , with regard to access to justice , Parliament succeeded in extending from four weeks to six the period during which NGOs may avail themselves of access to justice .
I wish to thank the environmental organisations for their involvement and their input during the Aarhus legislation process .
If the regulation is to work in practice as well as the two earlier directives , it will raise transparency in the EU to a level which will serve both our common inclinations and the public in the best way possible .
Finally , I wish to say a special thank you to Austria for the excellent work it did as the country holding the presidency of the Council .
My experience of the Austrian representatives ’ expertise , familiarity with the subject and negotiating skills was incredible , and I therefore have every reason to give Austria top marks for its presidency .
The importance of the occasion is highlighted by the opportunity to participate in the final draft of the package of regulations , which is crucial to the Union’s coherence and regional development .
Talks on the cohesion policy regulations have taken two years of hard work on the part of the various institutions .
In the various ways in which it has approached the issue , Parliament has particularly stressed the importance of matters which are crucial for the public and civil society , such as partnership , paying attention to environmental values and the participation of disabled people in the implementation of programmes .
It was a precondition for Parliament that the Member States should adhere to consistent practices with regard to the criteria for calculating cofinancing in the Community and management of VAT.
I have mentioned here only a few examples of matters that Parliament has worked to promote .
The Member States will establish their national strategic frame of reference on the basis of such guidelines , and this will guide the drafting of regional development programmes .
Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development completed its report on the strategic guidelines back in May .
In such a case , the Commission can adopt the Single Programming Documents so that they can start to be implemented in early 2007 .
