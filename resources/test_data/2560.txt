It is also important that the dynamic balance between two factors is preserved , namely the coordination of activities and promotion schemes on the one hand but also the necessary competition for the best solutions on the other .
The reasons for the higher proportion of women self-starters lie in the marked improvement in the vocational training of women , and another factor nowadays , of course , is that on completion of their vocational training many women have no prospect of finding a job or have to work under the constant threat of unemployment .
In the same context I should like to refer to a study that was compiled by the Commission a few years ago about the different attitudes of Europeans and Asians to things like the living world and the inanimate world .
We shall have to guarantee compatibility .
Given the shortage of funds , that is something we simply cannot afford to do .
The one is really no substitute for the other .
It is true , Commissioner , that the products to be derestricted - gelatine and tallow - do not belong to the most dangerous category and are ultraheat-treated , but , as you will also be aware , the latest findings show that this process does not kill the pathogens but only reduces their activity .
We should therefore take a first step towards that goal by rigorously culling the BSE-infected herds .
That is why the ban on these products has been lifted too soon !
At the same time the European Parliament called for the production of bone and animal meal as ruminant feed to be authorized only if it involved heating and sterilization at 134 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes at a steam pressure of bar 3 .
Two hundred and fifty infected animals are still dying every week in Britain .
Several U.S. withdrawals from various negotiations in recent times makes one wonder where U.S. trade policy is headed .
I should like to thank all of my fellow Members for helping to put this through so quickly .
Here too , you negotiated exceedingly well , for which I offer you our special thanks .
To rush through in this way , without time for careful scrutiny , an agreement with such far-reaching implications for people 's lives cannot be justified to the voters who gave us our parliamentary mandates .
Nor are the human-rights violations a new phenomenon .
As long as scientists cannot rule out a health risk , we must try to have the export ban maintained .
We must in fact recognize that interoperability is an inherently European topic .
But huge sums of money are to be spent on aeronautics and fusion and other such gimmicks .
Even though money is not all that is needed here , it certainly does help !
With regard to Central and Eastern Europe , the following ping-pong effect , which might not be immediately apparent , will play a major role : because of the chronic lack of foreign currency in these countries , the upgrading work is to be funded by so-called payment in kind .
I would implore you to vote in favour of urgent procedure in this case .
Unless stability in the exchange rate between the euro and the other currencies of the Union can be maintained , there will be a danger that the European single market could break up , even after the transition to monetary union , in other words even after 1 January 1999 .
The UK is therefore obliged to keep the rate of the pound stable against the euro ; whether that happens within or outside the exchange-rate system is a secondary issue .
Parliament has asked a number of questions which the Commission has taken up in part , very tentatively , and which the Council has not even acknowledged .
Unfortunately , the House does not yet have the power to force a change , but the governments would be well advised to react now , because otherwise the problems will seek out new governments .
The House stated very early on that currencies not participating in European monetary union should be linked to it by means of an exchange-rate mechanism with the euro as its anchor-point .
A chapter on employment in the new EU Treaty will not in fact create a single extra job , but the foundations are being laid for an active policy on employment .
We regret this , and call on Parliament to devise a procedure for similar decisions in the future which enables us and others to make our criticisms of substance in an appropriate way , without at the same time having to reject the EU 's whole research policy .
The Member States and the fishing industry must heed these authoritative voices .
However , the report focuses too narrowly on the maximizing of fishing opportunities and fails to take account of some important aspects which should certainly have been addressed in an own-initiative report of this kind .
Also , our request is by no means out of place , since the UN agreement on the conservation and management of straddling stocks and discrete stocks explicitly obliges coastal states and countries engaged in deep-sea fishing to cooperate in laying down conservation and management measures .
This did need clarifying , because despite the Court of Justice ruling of 30 November 1995 in the Gebhard case , doubt is still being cast on this right .
I therefore warmly welcome the presentation of a directive which will solve precisely this problem , and will in principle grant lawyers the rights enjoyed by all other European citizens in the practice of their professions in Europe .
In the light of our discussions with the Commission , I take it that the Commission is likely to accept in principle the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs
