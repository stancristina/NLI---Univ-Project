.
There seems no possibility of our having a well-thought-through and properly argued position .
Madam President , while enlargement was being discussed at the Nice Summit , the French Government was practising a kind of contraction , stopping 1200 young Italians at Ventimiglia as they were on their way to take part in a union demonstration .
Much more needs to be done .
The obstinacy demonstrated here reveals a striking lack of realism .
That means they need to know about the arrangements for changing to summer time in all the Member States in advance .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this directive , before us today for the second time , falls within the delicate context of international competition in pharmaceutical research and major health challenges , particularly in paediatric medicine .
So , although there are still some points of disagreement with the Council , I would like to remind you that the result we are seeking to obtain through the adoption of this directive is the outcome of lengthy and fruitful compromise negotiations between Mr Liese , our rapporteur , whom I thank and congratulate on his inclusive and constructive approach , and the Council , which has proved cooperative and open to the amendments adopted at second reading in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
In these amendments we also refer , not once but twice , to the fact that the interests of the patient are always more important than those of science and society .
Mr President , I just wished to point out that I forgot to sign the attendance register yesterday evening .
The second important aspect of the Council ' s second reading concerns Letter of Amendment No 2 , which enables the Commission ' s new provisions in the field of agriculture to be implemented .
It therefore means that payment appropriations requirements for the preliminary draft budget will be reduced by EUR 700 million .
By the same token , within this Interinstitutional Agreement , the Council has left substantial margins within the ceilings of the financial perspective established in 1999 , largely for heading 3 - internal policy - and for heading 4 - external action .
I think that , together , going beyond the priorities of each of our institutions , we have created , step by step , a budget for the 2001 financial year , which reflects the ambition that we all advocate , of a Europe at the service of its citizens .
You are all familiar with our aims .
As we promised , there are no leftovers from Nice .
This cooperation will always be open to everyone .
This process will by no means constitute a precondition for enlargement and will therefore not delay this project .
Finally , the adoption , not without difficulty , of the social chapter for European society took place at Nice .
Perhaps you remember that I mentioned in this very Chamber France ' s desire to ensure that the Union took greater account of the specific characteristics of sport and its social function .
Your Parliament gave a firm commitment , on 30 November , to a preliminary package of measures which , next week , will be submitted once again to our Transport Ministers .
We set objectives for ourselves and they were achieved .
We can welcome the fact that the Union was able to announce that it would be dedicating some EUR 13 billion to the process over a period of seven years , including , of course , the loans from the European Investment Bank .
I therefore welcome their speeches .
In an area as sensitive , as politically sensitive , as this , for which there is popular support , I consider this to be a serious political mistake .
We must therefore find a new method .
The problem facing the Fifteen lies , I believe , less in their difficulty in providing sound responses , than in their refusal to address the right questions .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights , which was supposed to be a figurehead for this summit was dispatched without ceremony .
Any clear-thinking person can see that they herald the very serious consequences to which the project of a Federal Europe of 27 or 28 Member States is leading us .
Is this a decisive agreement ?
We must bring an immediate end to this insane abdication of the sovereignty of the European Nations .
All that has been proposed to us is an increase of its President ' s powers and I doubt that even this would have prevented the dysfunction demonstrated by the Santer Commission .
Furthermore , we could adopt the formula suggested by the Economic and Social Council and say that Europe is experiencing a serious lack of public debate .
It is all very well to integrate Europe as quickly as possible , but if we come up against a refusal that threatens the whole structure and which leads to everything grinding to a halt , then this is not what we want to see at all .
There are , therefore , also constraints that must be appreciated .
First , I entirely endorse your support for the convention method , and I will tell you the whole truth : when I heard that the convention method had been chosen for drawing up the Charter , I was sceptical .
That is wise , and we must always remember it .
But when it comes to globalisation , which calls for very broad public debate , we need to find ways to allow everyone to express their views somehow , in a calm atmosphere .
But , after all , I do know and appreciate the subtlety of Charles Pasqua' s thought , I have known him a long time and consider him a friend
