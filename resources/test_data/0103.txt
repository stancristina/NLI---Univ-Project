issue as bridging the gap between citizens and decision makers .
The difficulties at European level are largely the same as the difficulties we encounter at national level .
I would like to remind you of the possibility of holding public Council debates .
However , a debate is planned when the Swedish Prime Minister attends the European Parliament ' s plenary session in July in order , as is tradition , to report on the result of the European Council in Gothenburg and on what the presidency country achieved during the period as a whole .
It is easy to agree in principle with Mr Newton Dunn' s wish that coordinated messages on what is happening in the Union be disseminated as widely as possible .
I hope that , together , we will be able to work to disseminate good , solid and interesting information on what is happening in the Union .
The Council agrees with the honourable Member that dialogue with the citizens of the EU must be improved in accordance with the decision taken by the European Council in Nice in December 2000 .
We are also trying to make press conferences and press releases increasingly informative .
This decision will enter into force on 1 May 2001 .
I would like to thank the Council for that answer .
We are in complete agreement on this .
With my country , Sweden , holding the presidency , this naturally becomes even more of an issue for me as the Council ' s meetings are held around the country .
Debates can be followed live not only on TV , but via the Internet too .
I do not know whether it is possible to extend the venture by opening a chat room as well , as suggested by Mr Rübig .
The decision , which we anticipate it will be possible to take on 19 March , does not go as far as the Ombudsman has proposed , but must be seen as a step in the right direction .
The Council would like to make Mr Sjöstedt aware of the fact that the Schengen provisions do not regulate the issue of passports and ID cards as far as EU citizens are concerned .
Once the Nordic countries have joined in the practical Schengen cooperation , the citizens of the Nordic countries will still have the right to travel within the territory of the Nordic countries and spend the night at hotels , camping sites etc . without having to show their passports .
The basis for my question is Article 45 of the Schengen Agreement , which states that anyone who books into a hotel in another Schengen country must produce a means of identification and prove their citizenship , but the only document a Swedish citizen has which shows their citizenship is their passport .
I think I have probably already answered the additional question posed by Mr Sjöstedt .
What I was talking about were the rules for internal control between the Nordic countries , and I naturally stand by what I said .
And it is , as I 'm sure Mr Gahrton understands , impossible for me to comment on information in particular newspapers and publications .
I can assure Mr Gahrton that the Swedish Government will do all it can to ensure that citizens are as informed as possible .
It is , of course , one of the three ' E 's with which the honourable Members are well acquainted .
This exercise has already started , and Parliament will be informed as soon as possible .
The conclusions from the ECOFIN Council , which were submitted to the European Council in Nice , are still regarded as valid .
The Swedish Presidency 's work programme for development cooperation contains the discussion of a strategy for integrating concern for the environment into development policy .
As regards the budget-related aspects of this work , there has been continual upgrading of the resources used for this work since the Cardiff process was started .
I would like to point out that it is not exactly an easy task , but it is the presidency 's firm goal that this integrated strategy for integrating concern for the environment into the work of different sectors will now also include a proper monitoring mechanism so that everyone can monitor this work on a continual basis .
As the honourable Member will surely agree , this is more difficult for some policies than for others .
The ambition is , however , to be as precise as possible in order for it to be possible to inspect not only what the Commission and the presidency are currently achieving , but also what future presidencies achieve .
Opinions may differ on whether or not it would be desirable to have common criteria .
However , it just so happens that even with regard to advisory bodies , the appointment of representatives is entirely a matter for the Member States .
The acquisition or loss of citizenship in a Member State is the responsibility of the Member States themselves .
As has just been explained , this issue falls under the jurisdiction of national governments .
It was also pointed out that the new transatlantic agenda signed in Madrid in December 1995 has strengthened the opportunities for these entities to manage their tasks in Europe on a more structured basis on both sides of the Atlantic and elsewhere .
A number of Member States have stressed how important it is to maintain global stability and contribute to disarmament and non-proliferation by means of an agreed framework for security .
The European Union also emphasised that it wants to keep this treaty .
This is why I called attention to the fact that a number of Member States have made comments regarding this issue , but there is nevertheless no common position on the part of the Union
