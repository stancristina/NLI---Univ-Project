itself with being located in Brussels , so that we could work effectively on this issue too .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is an important report that we are adopting today , and I am glad that the subject in question is now being focused on .
I am particularly pleased about the emphasis now being placed on women as peacemakers .
Women are exposed to horrifying acts of cruelty such as violence , rape and even worse things .
Women can make an important contribution to bringing about peace , reintegrating child soldiers and creating political dialogue between the warring parties .
It is important that we bring about greater cooperation with local women’s organisations and that we insist on the need to integrate the gender aspect into peace research , conflict prevention and conflict resolution .
We warned that both industry and agriculture were endangering this precious resource . ‘Prophets of doom’ they shouted at us , ‘it will take at least 30 years’ .
In many places things went much quicker than that , but in some Member States we have , however , been able to keep the groundwater clean and to avoid having the dubious permits sought by all those who , instead of clean water , talked of healthy water with an in-built allowance for what humans and animals can tolerate .
We have had a more or less serviceable Groundwater Directive , which allowed the Member States to preserve the requirement for clean water .
Then we got a really good Water Framework Directive – a directive that has been a credit to the EU.
What happens , however ?
Fortunately , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety was able to repair the demolition work .
The European Environmental Bureau ( EEB ) has pointed out that 87 % of European agricultural land is more polluted than the current guidelines recommend .
At issue , in particular , are Amendment 22 , part 1 and Amendments 24 , 26 and 38 , all of which are aimed at clarifying the regulations , and also Amendments 36 , 42 and 43 , which remove the absurd exemptions from the directive applying to agriculture – exemptions that would be an outright disgrace in terms both of the groundwater and of the reputation of the EU.
It prevents the Lisbon objectives from being achieved , and it is a barrier to European competitiveness .
It is a fact that women find it difficult to obtain research posts , simply because they are women .
That is a state of affairs we must do something about .
It is therefore important that , in implementing the Seventh Framework Programme , the Commission take account of the gender issue and help bring about a situation in which young female candidates have the same opportunities as men in competing for research funds .
The composition of the new European Research Council is quite simply nothing less than a scandal .
The EU has a list of general rules governing equality , and these should , of course , also apply to the European Research Council .
Commissioner , I do hope you will consider what kind of a signal we are sending out to the European research world by having so unequal a representation of women and men .
The Framework Programme for Research is therefore an important tool for enabling the EU to cope successfully with international competition in the future .
Moreover , it is precisely in the diversity we have in Europe that we shall find an important key to greater creativity .
International cooperation is no longer a separate part of the programme but , rather , is integrated horizontally into the individual themes and special programmes .
I hope that this prioritisation will also be reflected in the number of international projects .
Europe’s peripheral areas are currently undergoing depopulation , and it is imperative for us to maintain research in the outermost regions by creating attractive working conditions for researchers .
I am therefore pleased , too , that it is now possible to coordinate efforts made under the Seventh Framework Programme and in the context of the Regional Fund .
The time is past when researchers could sit in their ivory towers .
If society is to reap as many of the benefits of European research as possible , we must ensure that the results of research make a difference to individuals , authorities and trade and industry .
Energy research has become a thematic priority of its own within ‘cooperation’ .
I taught law for many years at various universities , and this report by the committee for which Mr Gargani was rapporteur would not be given particularly high marks by the Faculty of Law at the University of Copenhagen .
Point 47 of the judgment states that criminal legislation and the rules for dealing with criminal matters – that is to say criminal procedural law – do not fall within the Community’s competence .
It is my humble conviction that this procedure – whereby , in the absence of an existing legal base , we ourselves create a legal base on political foundations - is absurd .
Moreover , it will most certainly meet with serious resistance in the best developed democracies in the European Union .
In this connection I would be so bold as to refer to the Nordic democracies .
There is therefore no legal base , and I would for that reason recommend voting in favour of the amendment tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group .     Mr President , what we should do , rather , is start afresh and set up a new , directly elected Convention to devise proposals that can then be put to referendums in all the Member States simultaneously .
The Summit’s document on openness is a fig leaf .
