I would like to issue a final warning : do n't come back again and speak about the SLIM programme if we have not got any concrete proposals .
I hope the Commission takes this seriously and that it revises it , since this proposal would lead to double bureaucracy and double nomenclatures for companies , and go in precisely the opposite direction to what all of us here wanted .
It is also good that the level of detail is examined properly , so that more of the principles are left to EU rules and EU law and more details are left to individual Member States regarding whatever may be concerned in agriculture , such as cucumbers , bananas or strawberries , so that this debate is avoided .
It is the mass of new rules and details which makes the problem so great .
This report by Mr Bardong on the EU 's own resources , which the Member States are responsible for collecting , says that the Member States have a duty to take greater responsibility for what is required in matters of bookkeeping , collection and so on of the funds , in order to ensure that it works .
However , there are significant weaknesses in the system , as has been shown by the European Parliament 's ad-hoc committee of inquiry into questions of customs transits , among others .
This technical report is not going to solve all the problems , but it is a simple first step in the right direction .
That is quite clear .
The European Parliament should not cooperate in being a democratic alibi .
One of these , as several speakers have already mentioned , is that the flat-rate processing coefficients have not been changed for a full 24 years .
During the years 1991-1994 , export refunds for cereals amounted to ECU 11 billion , a substantial sum .
It is absolutely essential that the Commission does something about this fact .
Finally , I would just like to draw the attention of my Swedish colleagues to the fact that there is a mistake in the report in paragraph 1 , where it says in the Swedish version that Parliament regrets ( beklagar ) the flat-rate processing coefficients .
So it is a good thing .
This is important because it is in fact an agreement which is being made between the EU and these countries , and means that these agreements will be financed approximately equally by the two countries and the EU.
However , I have an important point to add : namely , I think it needs to be very clear that the programme should not only be about a one-sided adaptation to the EU 's institutions , to our approach , our level of training and our training requirements , but it should be a versatile , mutual exchange between the EU and the countries which have now applied for membership .
Only then will these programmes be good .
The Green Group is therefore going to support this report .
That is the case in Sweden .
We must have food production which means that there are no residues of chemicals or medicines , for example , in our food .
For example , because of EU rules , Sweden has already been forced to permit banned feed additives , relax controls against salmonella and relax labelling requirements , especially with regard to allergy risks .
Would that not be better than total harmonization , which is fundamentally a commercial rule aimed at promoting commercial interests , not food quality ?
It is also necessary and logical for any income of these bodies to be shown in the EU 's budget so that we can get a complete picture of the financial situation .
The Green group is therefore going to wholeheartedly support the KelletBowman report .
Around Europe there have been several very big ferry disasters in recent decades .
The decision we are going to take today is another step in this direction .
Anything else would presumably be totally unacceptable .
The Council 's common position says that the information should be collected before departure , but not necessarily communicated to the registrar until 30 minutes after the ferry has sailed .
With the help of computer technology an immediate registration will go to the registrar .
It is limited to 20 nautical miles between two ports , below which passenger lists are not considered necessary .
The European Parliament has been demanding this for a long time .
People say this will be the basis of the global economy .
I am extremely disappointed with the Swedish Trade Minister who has sat in on these negotiations since 1995 without giving the slightest sign that they had taken place .
And as the previous speaker said : ' Stop the agreement until we have had a proper dialogue ' .
I think that first and foremost we should establish that a set of rules is needed when globalization in fact happens , and the EU and Parliament have an important role to play .
Also , I hope the Commission supports the Member States who have strongly demanded that the agreement should forbid a relaxation of environmental and social standards in order to attract investment .
I also hope it puts an end to the 'shopping ' for subsidies which can be observed in many places .
What are the rules on evidence ?
I also think this agreement is necessary in the long term , so that developing countries can join voluntarily if they meet the standards required .
Who has the right to draft global constitutions ?
In the OECD countries negotiations have taken place in secret with the minimum possible parliamentary supervision .
I do not like everything in this report .
When Sweden became a Member of the EU we were given a unique derogation because we do
