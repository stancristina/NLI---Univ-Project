I must say that I was especially pleased that Carlos Costa Neves headed the mission , as this shows that Parliament and the Commission are now working even more closely together on election observer missions .
As the electoral process has not yet been completed , the results have not yet been announced and accusations and appeals have not yet been filed , it is too soon to draw any final conclusions as to how the elections passed .
Eritrea
We hope that the committee set up to safeguard the future of the press in Eritrea will be able to help get the restrictions on the private press lifted soon .
Because of the tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia , the Commission believes that every effort should be made to prevent the conflict from escalating .
Once again , Mr President , Commissioner , tragic events have forced our attention on Turkey , following yet another earthquake recently .
However , we do have the means and the centres and the researchers and I wonder , Commissioner , if we are using them properly .
I hope that those who lost their loved ones and those who were left homeless or lost their possessions will soon find the strength to recover from the shock of this unforeseen disaster .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it goes without saying that we all sympathise with and support the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and which , as a previous speaker said , is the second earthquake to hit Turkey in under two years .
If buildings had been built to earthquake standards , we would have had fewer victims .
Mr President , the Commission shares the European Parliament 's interest in and concern for the humanitarian situation of the victims of the earthquake in Turkey .
As far as the specific question of the earthquake in Turkey is concerned , our representation in Ankara has assured us that the Turkish authorities responsible for dealing with emergencies have not asked for help and that no help with civil protection or humanitarian aid are required at present .
This is the situation so far , according to information from our representation and the Red Cross .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am particularly honoured to present the report on the first five years ' implementation of the working time directive .
That is why the Member States must safeguard this acquis as the cornerstone of social cohesion .
Implementation so far has given rise to a series of disputes and/or straightforward infringements .
Here too , the Court of Justice 's ruling that the right to leave is a basic right to which even temporary employees on a limited contract of less than one year are entitled will help in the fight against infringements .
This is a matter of general interest .
Finally , again in connection with arrangements under traditional industrial relations , there is the problem of special arrangements for specific categories of particular types of workers such as women , mothers , persons with disabilities , children etc .
If we are to replace traditional job security with employability , we need a new approach to working time arrangements because new problems are emerging , such as how to turn part-time employment into full-time employment , what to do about weekly rests and the ban on working on public holidays , how far to adjust working time arrangements where paid work is turned into self-employment , how to control the application of specific working time arrangements in the case of teleworking , what new balance must be struck between home life and work and , finally of course , how can we make time spent on lifelong learning count as working time .
This policy undermines workers ' rights by applying flexible forms of work and working time arrangements and undermines full and stable employment by replacing it with part-time and temporary employment .
In addition , making part-time employment the rule not only hits workers in their pay packets , it also makes it practically impossible for them to acquire pension rights .
The result of the European Union 's policy is an increase in under-employment which , in some countries , already stands at over 30 % .
We support full and stable employment , eight hours a day , five days a week , more extensive social rights and pay rises commensurate with today 's needs .
The Commission report on the implementation of the working time directive contains a general review of how the Member States implement the directive .
The Member States have been given considerable room for manoeuvre in transposing the directive .
The report calls at various points for the Commission to monitor transposition and take the necessary steps if the directive is not transposed correctly .
There is a clear reference to the specific term in Article 18( 1 ) allowing the Member States to deviate from the upper limit of 48 hours , provided that the worker is happy to work the extra hours .
And I can assure you that the Commission will be submitting the evaluation report in question .
Obviously it is hard to apply traditional working time to new forms of work and the debate on lifelong learning and time compression is a major issue .
My special thanks to the honourable Member ; this is indeed an exceptional issue which is a top priority not just in the European Parliament and the Commission but in each individual portfolio , because an electronic Europe is at the top of everyone 's agenda .
There is the matter of flat-rate charges for access - as you quite rightly said , there is a problem of terminology and how to translate terms into all the languages and I have to say here that there were words which I
