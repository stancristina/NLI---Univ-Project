Providing our budget with sufficient payment appropriations does not mean failing to comply with the austerity objectives , but to help the European Union 's growth by means of its policies .
We would therefore like to know , Commissioner , whether there is really sufficient room in the budget to be able to take account of the approach taken by the PPE by means of its amendment .
With regard to the figures , our priorities are the funding of actions to promote children 's rights , funds for combating AIDS and malaria , increasing funds for Latin America and the Mediterranean : between the 2000 Budget and the draft 2004 Budget the funds intended for cooperation with these regions have plummeted ; they have been reduced by 10.8 % for Latin America ( EUR 37.2 million ) and 16 % for MEDA in real terms ( EUR 193.9 million ) , despite the new priorities for these two regions and the summit which is going to take place .
We must also promote information in relation to the common agricultural policy .
We agree with the sum of EUR 150 million proposed by the rapporteur .
We have been working in great harmony over all these years and this has been the case once again in the discussion of these budgets .
Once we have agreements , I believe that we must conserve them and maintain them and I would therefore refer back to what we approved and adopted at the time .
These networks also take account of neighbouring countries such as Russia , Belarus or the Ukraine .
I would also , however , like to stress certain aspects which seem to me to be very positive .
Perhaps in this way we are also demonstrating that we are responsible politicians .
In the face of the weight of the third pillar , fear must be alleviated and business interests excluded .
It is true that , on certain points , ladies and gentlemen , some governments and the Commission have expressed reservations .
Otherwise , new consensus cannot be achieved .
We are making it clear that the draft represents a step forward , an important step , but we are not giving up the idea of making further progress when the time is right .
It is in this spirit of integration , construction and genuine Europeanism , that I am hopeful that the House will vote in favour of our report .
I would like to make a more specific reference to the future reform of the Constitution .
That cannot be the case .
We are inviting the members of national parliaments who were members of the Convention to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
One example of this is achieving an institutional balance within which each country is suitably represented .
It is true that the draft Constitution takes up certain principles which we believe to be valid , but it does not include the guarantees we called for in order to associate the regions with full legislative powers with the European institutions , nor does it guarantee that they have access to the Court of Justice , nor does it ensure the inclusion in its linguistic system of languages which are official in the Member States .
I would point out that the President-in-Office of the Council has indicated his agreement with this amendment , because it may help him at the Council .
- ( ES ) Although the amendments approved have improved the content of the McCarthy report , the legislation represents a step backwards for the development of innovation , the spread of knowledge and free competition , all of which are essential to the good functioning and stimulation of the European software industry .
We regret in particular that the Group of the European Peoples ' Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have voted against our proposals to recognise and associate the regions with full legislative powers with the institutions of the Union , and also that the idea that the Ombudsmen of the parliaments of these regions with full legislative powers should be associated with the work of the European Ombudsman has been rejected .
As the report confirms , the unique nature of the Union is drawn from its member states and citizens .
Neither is it established that those regions have the possibility of bringing cases before the Court of Justice when its competences may be affected .
Frankly , the only legitimate and morally acceptable way to get rid of Arafat is by means of the elections laid down in the roadmap .
Incidentally , however , if you wish to listen to an Israeli voice on the subject of Yasser Arafat , then please listen to Simon Peres , who - on reaching 80 years old - has said : firstly , that Arafat has accepted the theory of two states , abandoning that of the destruction of the state of Israel ; secondly , that he has accepted the 1967 borders , abandoning those of 1948 , and , thirdly , that he has agreed to negotiate .
A decision such as the war in Iraq , a unilateral one , has led to a worsening of the situation and an increase in acts of terror .
Europe cannot depend on the media war , on statements and threats .
The question we should be asking is : what has Europe done to strengthen the system of security and justice ?
The first , and I am saying nothing new , is to dedicate ourselves to saving multilateralism within commercial relations .
We must be careful when we say that we must reform the World Trade Organisation .
Commissioner Lamy is right when he tells us that it is one thing
