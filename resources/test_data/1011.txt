We believe that , on that basis , and with that commitment , it will be possible to do much more for our Europe .     – Mr President , this debate is taking place at a particularly difficult moment for the social situation in the European Union .
If that does not happen , we will have a rise in social tensions among the people in our countries in protest at the policies we are implementing .
On another point , the text emphasises the need to mobilise European public opinion so as to convince it of the benefits of the Lisbon Strategy and to make it accept them , but there is not a single word on cultural policies at either a European or a national level .
Without them , the Lisbon Strategy will remain little more than a nice list of good intentions .     . – The relationship that has developed between the European Union and the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries deserves our recognition and our applause .
These relations are fundamental in a Europe that wants to be open to the world and is committed to strengthening dialogue with its strategic partners , along the lines of its historical ties .
Without such factors , and trapped between the robbery that is external debt and the imposed interests of the major US , EU and Japanese multinationals , those countries will continue to have a peripheral and subordinate status .
In that context , and as the rapporteur explicitly mentions in his explanatory statement , ‘the GSP therefore needs to be consistent with development policy objectives and compatible with the Doha Programme’ .
Lastly , I wish to highlight the simplification achieved by cutting the number of arrangements from five to three , so that now there is a general arrangement , a special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance , and a special arrangement for the least developed countries ( ‘Everything but Arms ’ – EBA ) .
The report before us highlights the areas in which it is important to guarantee that available appropriations will be increased and properly used .
Good democracy is founded on absolute respect for the citizens ’ rights , and that respect historically encompasses the citizens ’ right to table petitions to parliaments .
In this context , I wish to express my disappointment that due attention was not paid to the petition calling for the inclusion of a reference to Europe’s Christian heritage in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty , and that , as such , the wishes of the million-plus people throughout Europe who signed the petition were completely disregarded .
Having said that , it cannot be denied that Europe is the best continent to live in .
The stagnation affecting the European economy since 2000 has certainly not helped .
Lastly , I feel that we need a substantially more realistic outlook that is not confined to condemning failure and repeatedly justifying everything by accusing the Member States of a lack of motivation and of non-compliance .
Given that this is an intergovernmental matter , the ‘Lisbon Strategy ’ depends almost entirely on the Member States’ ability and commitment to carry out far-reaching structural reforms .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning we discussed in detail the new strategy for growth and jobs and managed to achieve perfect convergence between Parliament and the Commission .
This requires more than just words .
That is why the European Council should make a clear commitment to the new governance mechanisms , the new integrated guidelines and the national and EU Lisbon programmes , with simple reporting and better coordination of reforms at a national level .
Yesterday’s ECOFIN discussions were inconclusive .
When the economic situation is buoyant , budgetary policy must remain sound .
I await with interest the political impetus to come from the European Council towards a European charter for sustainable development , which the Commission will certainly follow up and support .
The public , the electorate , would simply not understand if we were unable to achieve a breakthrough , or if the summit ended not with a success but with winners and losers .
We have a competent and determined Presidency .
That is what is at stake at the spring meeting of the European Council – to ensure that our vision is translated into action .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr  Frattini , I welcome your response on data protection and in relation to the announcement of the Commission ’s initiative .
We would advocate a ‘push’ system accompanied by the appropriate filters and would like to see the necessary guarantees with regard to the accuracy , security and supervision of data .
We would be faced with a relocation of sugar beet production from the present production areas to more competitive areas , accompanied by a drastic reduction in prices , which would seriously affect the development of the numerous less-developed regions of the European Union , including Portugal .
Lastly , I would like to emphasise that as the necessary funding for the development of the activities of the Community institutions has already been earmarked , we need to be strict about the prudent and judicious management of public monies , which come from the pockets of our taxpayers .     This motion for a resolution arises from the identification of a surplus in the 2005 budget because the 2004 salary adjustment , which was approved by the Council at the end of 2004 , was just 0.7 % instead of the 2.6 % envisaged when the budgets of the institutions were being drawn up .
Furthermore , the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy that we voted on yesterday calls for greater determination and creativity
