There is already a legislative framework in place that establishes a system of cooperation in the area of sea pollution , and a Community mechanism designed to encourage closer cooperation in emergency interventions in the field of civil protection .
Bearing this in mind , the Commission has pointed out the difficulties encountered by users of current intermodal loading units ( ILUs ) – in other words , containers or boxes usually used in transport – which range from the diversity of handling and securing devices to questions of security and methods of monitoring .
This proposal arose following the Council’s decision authorising Member States to sign or ratify , in the interest of the European Community , the Protocol of 2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage , 1992 .
This protocol establishes a supplementary fund , which multiplies the ceiling by five ...     .
By significantly raising the ceilings for compensation established by the existing international system , the Protocol on the supplementary fund plugs one of the most important gaps in international regulations on oil pollution liability .
By raising the compensation ceiling established in the existing international system , the Protocol plugs one of the most important gaps in international regulations in terms of liability for oil pollution , as the compensation ceiling set by the supplementary fund will be fixed .
Hence our vote in solidarity with the workers , the unions and the population of Terni , in the hope of maintaining a high-tech production hub .
The future instrument should therefore be adopted in the form of a regulation .
The world must not forget the Afghan people , who continue to suffer from the impact of wars waged by those who value their economic and geo-strategic interests ahead of people’s well being .
The Bush Administration should be condemned for the appalling situation in these countries and for the terrible suffering of the majority of the population .     .
While these are important steps , they are insufficient in themselves .
Firstly , however , the Commission must refrain from implementing measures that , in practical terms , may result in further erosion of quality public services in the various countries of the EU.     Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to take this opportunity to say that I share the opinion that the market and free competition are important values .
Though it pained me , I felt obliged to accept the reason given , namely that of safety .
It is through dialogue with those who genuinely want democracy , with secular forces , that we will be able to see the situation change towards democracy in this most important of countries , as all those here recognise .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on Monday , the Commission granted non-European wine producers – in South Africa , Australia and the USA – authorisation to use three denominations of Port wine : Tawny , Ruby and Vintage .
This takes neo-liberal , federal and military development yet another step further .
We oppose this project .
Blatant bias is shown against the public sector ; the struggle of the workers and of others affected by these anti-social policies is ignored ; social issues are deemed of secondary importance ; and employment policy is based on making work more flexible , on unstable work and on wage restraints .
This is also why we have insisted on pressing for the Stability Pact to be suspended , and replaced by a social progress and employment pact , in line with the objectives of full employment , sustained economic development and economic and social cohesion .
The country is deep in recession , with a reduction in GDP that might exceed 1 % and the highest levels of unemployment in the EU , which is jeopardising not only economic convergence with the EU , but also , for the third year in succession , the very conditions needed for a swift and sustained recovery .
I therefore request , on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , that this crucial issue should be put before Parliament for consideration .
It is , additionally , an essential requirement of any Western European-style representative democracy , a factor in eliminating inequality and an increasingly important factor for progress and development .
We therefore call on the Members of this House to rethink and revive the role of the school in access to culture , not only in terms of the basic skills that schools can teach and of the key components in each national identity that each Member State feels should be a part of its programmes , but also in terms of Europe’s enormous cultural heritage , in its almost infinite variety of language , literature , fine art , music , theatre , tradition ; in other words , everything that provides each of us with our essential mechanisms for relating to and identifying with the world .
It would be a contradiction in terms to comply with the Lisbon Strategy and at the same to pursue the aims of a knowledge-based economy , if culture were limited to the status of poor relative in this area .     With regard to the accession of the new Member States , this report supports the Commission 's proposal to assist farmers in these countries to comply with Community legislation during the transition period .
These two measures are accordingly interlinked and should operate in tandem .
Readmission agreements are an extension of the EU 's asylum and immigration policy , which is focused on increased border controls , repression and deportation , but which continues to ignore the causes of immigration , such as poverty , exploitation , war , and many others .
Alongside those agreements , standard readmission clauses
