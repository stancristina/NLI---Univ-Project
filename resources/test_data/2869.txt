I wish to ask for clarification on two points .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our guiding objective is the creation of a great European area of freedom , security and justice , in which it is vital that we strengthen the security of European citizens and the fight against organised crime .
We are all keen to have the results of the evaluations of the remaining countries , one of which is my own country , Portugal , conveyed to us quickly .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission would like to congratulate Mr Ferri on the excellent report he has presented , which contains a very astute and clear-sighted analysis of the problems we face in the field of judicial cooperation and presents an ambitious and exacting vision of the efforts required to overcome these problems .
This process of professionals in the field exchanging information , whether it is carried out in the framework of mutual evaluation , in contacts within the judicial network or , quite soon , I hope , in the framework of cooperation within Eurojust , is crucial and must be pursued .
One of the measures recommended by the draft resolution is the creation of a European Public Prosecutor 's Office , with jurisdiction over the whole Union .
I wish to close , Mr President , by stating that I share the concern expressed by the rapporteur that , in this field , all legislative initiatives must be implemented with respect for individual rights and fundamental freedoms and that this respect for citizens ' rights and freedoms is inextricably linked to the fight against organised crime .
Budgetary and Community constraints cannot be used as an excuse for not adopting the necessary measures to solve the problem , and , at the same time , we must support livestock breeders .
Mr President , I wish , first of all , to congratulate Mrs O'Toole on her pertinent report , on which I should like to say the following : these days it is not only the concept of the book that is changing ; the concept of literacy is also changing .
It makes no sense to adopt divergent or even perhaps contradictory measures for policies on electronic publishing and books , copyright or e-learning .
For these reasons they deserve our applause .
Madam President , there is also a possible compromise on the following vote .
It is true that in some versions , such as the Portuguese , Dutch and others , where it should say 'strategy for peace ' , as is written in the Spanish and English versions , which take precedence , it says 'Plan Colombia ' , which is wrong .
This is due to political reasons , including the complex peace process in the Middle East , which is an important factor but not the only one .
I should like to address a few words to the rapporteur , my friend and colleague , Cristiana Muscardini .
Na√Ør report ( A5-0009/2001 )
Madam President , I should also like to say that the Portuguese Members who flew here today on the Lisbon-Frankfurt flight had to wait 45 minutes for a vehicle , sent from the Parliament in Strasbourg , to come and pick them up and then had to wait another forty minutes - together with our Italian colleagues , who were already there and who had been waiting for two hours - to be taken to Strasbourg .
I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Savary on his openness to dialogue , on his competence and on his demonstration of how crucial the action of the European Parliament is to improving standards as important as those with a social aspect , improving the position of rail users and eastwards enlargement .
They ignore the crisis caused by ultraliberal globalisation which has been challenged , specifically in Porto Alegre , and say nothing about the huge disappointment that was Nice .
They find it difficult to conceal their own failure , which is in direct proportion to the political arrogance that they showed and which they have unfortunately rushed to assume once again , having learnt nothing from their past mistakes .
There is the question of what direction to take , but there is also the question of pace .
It will be a shame if the federalists continue to prefer their ivory tower to the real situation faced by the people of Europe , if they persist in repeating the frustrating experience of Nice and to weaken Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , the cases of industrial restructuring which are most traumatic , because they are unforeseeable , are those dictated by aggressive , acquisitions-seeking behaviour in the market .
The Lisbon resolutions were designed to respond to these points by giving priority to employment , to the viability of social protection , to combating social exclusion and also by preventing changes to the economy .
Commissioner , we have also heard it said that the market is not governed by the laws of nature and that the political authorities should act by means of legislation , institutional action and social dialogue .
In other words , hope remains for authors and performers that this Parliament will have a change of heart , if not today then tomorrow .
Unfortunately , the Commission proposal and the Council common position reveal a degree of thoughtlessness that warrants our criticism .
Furthermore , our languages will be of little use if , at the altar of technology , they become merely the remnant of the identity that gives any European uniqueness in the eyes of the world .
I also wish to say that it would be much better if the directive were to give this satisfaction to authors now and were then to be reviewed within eighteen months .
