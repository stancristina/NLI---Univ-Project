I am of course aware that this is not enough , but we must recognise that it took place .
I therefore feel that it is essential that the European Union - why not at the suggestion of those countries ? - approve a joint action to commit itself to democracy and human rights , and also that it talk to another country that is extraordinarily interested in Guinea , not due to these matters , but because of oil , that is the United States .
For oil .
This deterioration casts doubt on whether President Obiang 's regime has a genuine desire for democratisation and respect for human rights .
We are therefore aiming to promote democracy and respect for human rights .
I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the Union 's strong condemnation of the recent terrorist attacks , which cut short the lives of more than one hundred people and seriously injured many more .
The result of the trial against Colonel Budanov is not a positive sign , but quite the opposite .
In this sense , it is the Commission 's desire and hope that the planned visit to Chechnya by the Parliament Delegation for relations with the Duma , which has again been delayed , will soon be able to take place , which will undoubtedly help to make the European Union 's voice heard in the conflict in Chechnya .
As you are aware , on 31 December , the mandate of the OSCE assistance group for Chechnya expired .
Intensive negotiations are currently going on in Vienna with the aim of ensuring that the assistance group remains in Chechnya and the issue is being raised today in Athens amongst the political leaders of the Union and of Russia .
The international situation is not good and the time has come for us to hold a debate within this institution to consider how the most burning issues currently on the international scene can be viewed , and if possible resolved , from a European perspective .
I will begin with the first point : the situation in Iraq .
And we Europeans cannot ignore this problem , a serious problem for which a solution must be found .
Therefore , whatever the implicit or explicit requests - and I insist , implicit or explicit - of the inspectors to the members of the Security Council , I believe Europe should help them .
And we must make the two things compatible in the eyes of the population , of the citizens of Europe .
I believe and I insist that the centre of gravity of this process must continue to be the United Nations Security Council and I therefore believe it very appropriate that the information that certain countries currently have should be debated within it and that , if possible , that information should also be passed on to the inspectors .
That is the first point to stress .
We must analyse why this situation has come about .
Ladies and gentlemen , the situation in North Korea is serious .
We are currently working so that in March we can for the first time in history deploy a peace-keeping force in that Republic .
But I would like to say that we are living through a relatively difficult time and I would go as far as to say that this is perhaps the most difficult time those of us in this parliamentary sitting , during this period of European parliamentary life , have had to live through .
Why ?
And since Mr Solana is going to congratulate Mr Sharon on having won the elections in Israel , I would ask him to add something else , and that is to tell Mr Sharon to stop spurning Europe and to take account of our will for peace and cooperation .
If they were working for eight years , why can they not work for two more months ?
Has the UN considered this ?
In order to genuinely work for peace , what we have to do is act decisively against violations of international law and against repeated non-compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations .
Democratic and responsible governments must not make decisions on the basis of opinion polls , which are variable , but by informing the public , engaging in political debate but defending the higher principles at stake , such as international peace and security , not the price of oil .
Nevertheless , I believe we should be pleased to see the continuous growth within the Member States of a movement rejecting war , and positions such as that of General Schwarzkopf who , taking the approach of Erasmus , has just accused the Minister for war , Rumsfeld , of undervaluing the army and of relishing the idea of going to war , or such as that of the Democrat Senator Joseph Biden , who has accused Bush of promoting the greatest wave of anti-Americanism for 30 years .
Are these televised comments by Aznar in which he states that he will back Bush unconditionally in a unilateral attack loyal ?
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the many honourable Members who have accompanied me during this sitting for their tenacity and perseverance .
We are talking about something extremely grave ; life or death .
Amongst all of us we managed to ensure that that operation , which appeared to be under way , was brought within the context of the United Nations .
They were kind enough to speak with the President of the European Parliament yesterday by videoconference .
But despite all of this , we must continue and we have therefore asked the countries of the European Union to give all possible assistance to the inspectors .
As the honourable Members may imagine , I am in constant contact with many people
