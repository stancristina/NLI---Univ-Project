allow consumers to make a fully informed choice .
Unfortunately , although the two aims are compatible , there is some tension between them where the details of the regulation are concerned .
This is particularly the case in relation to Article 13 and Article 13( 2 ) primarily serving the first and Article 13(5 ) the second aim .
Amendments Nos 26 and 28 to 13(5 ) therefore seemed rather confused - one seeking less and one seeking more detailed information for consumers .
For this reason , whatever the final form of Article 13 , I regard Amendments Nos 15 and 29 as being of the first importance .
Amendment 29 in particular will allow areas of the EU that are justifiably proud of the quality of their product to identify it as such .
For my own constituency of course , Aberdeen Angus beef is already justly renowned throughout the world but I am sure the same is true for other regions in the rest of the UK and other Member States .
Madam President , I signalled I wanted to raise a point of order , although it is not actually on the Minutes .
I do not want to delay the House unduly , but I think that as we prepare to debate the construction of Europe , it is important to take note of a landmark court judgement in the UK.
The so-called historian , David Irving , has lost his libel case against the American academic , Deborah Lipstadt , who accused him of manipulating evidence to deny the Nazi genocide of the Jews .
The judge has ruled , in a devastating judgement , that he was " an active Holocaust denier , anti-Semitic and racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism " .
This judgement is important , not just for Europe ' s past , but also for its present .
With the rise in racism and anti-Semitism and the electoral success of extremist parties , this judgement boosts the fight to make Europe a society free of racism and at ease with diversity .
Madam President , item 2 of the Minutes on page 5 , which is in fact the first substantive page , refers to the points I raised about certain political groups apparently not respecting the Rules of Procedure in that they appear to allow individual members of their group to table amendments in plenary , supposedly in the name of the group , although this cannot possibly be the case because contradictory amendments are tabled in the name of the same group .
I would like to underline that although the Minutes mentioned specifically the EPP Group , it is in fact not the only group to have acted in this way .
For instance , the Technical Group , the TDI Group , which did not table any amendments at committee stage whatsoever , has now arrived in plenary with between 20 and 30 amendments , many of which are contradictory .
They are tabled by different members within that group taking different positions and therefore cannot possibly be a group position .
That does not respect our own Rules of Procedure , which allow only 32 members or a group to table amendments in plenary .
Madam President , with rather more levity .
Last night in the Committee on Budgets when the refreshments were being distributed , Mr Colom pointed out that the small cartons of milk were marked " for distribution in schools only " .
Had it said " for schoolchildren only " one could understand why it was being distributed in the European Parliament , but it was marked " for schools only " .
Could we find out why this has happened ?
It is so embarrassing .
I know we campaigned for more school milk but , on this occasion , we did not want it here .
Mr President , within our groups in Parliament and within the IGC itself we are still struggling with the problems that proved fairly intractable at Amsterdam .
These issues are tricky because they expose both the exaggerated self-importance of small states and the folie de grandeur of the big states .
These issues can only be resolved by a greater sense of trust between partners - such trust that is the essential glue of successful federal pacts .
This trust is precisely the quality that is needed so that we are able to ensure the successful accession of the new Member States .
The fact is - and somebody should say this - that if the IGC fails to resolve the Amsterdam questions , enlargement must be postponed .
The Liberal Group supports the efforts of the presidency and of the Commission to build up the extra trust required .
We support the main thrust of this report .
We support especially those elements which expand the European Union ' s capacity for action in global affairs : those that strengthen the status and the profile of the citizen , including the Charter ; and those that will postulate further political reform in the interests of a strong executive and a mature parliamentary democracy .
In this respect the splitting of the Treaties is vital .
So is retention of unanimity within the Council exclusively for the most serious questions .
Liberals everywhere support ministers that will subscribe to the development of European parliamentary democracy .
But we will be savage critics of those who prefer narrow self-interest and threaten the accession of new Member States .
Mr President , I support the enlargement of the European Union because I know it will consolidate the new democracies in eastern and central Europe .
I know it will also increase the size of the European Union as a trading block which in time will ensure that the Union as an economic entity becomes more competitive .
