citizens ?
That is the situation .
The European Parliament would be committing a grave error if it sent a delegation to observe the elections , since this would be interpreted as support for the coup d 'état ; the OAS has already ruled out sending an observation mission to the elections .
Mr President , on 30 October , the parties in this conflict signed an agreement , the San José Agreement , and decided that by 5 November , a national unity and reconciliation government would be created and that Congress would reinstate Mr Zelaya until the current period of government ends , on 27 January 2010 .
We are calling on the parties to show their generosity by returning to dialogue , even though the OAS has already said that this is becoming increasingly difficult .
It is possible that the Council will be tempted to try to act so as to favour itself for very urgent budget matters , such as the European External Action Service , but , clearly , the three institutions will be on an equal footing and , on Parliament 's part , what there will be is a significant sense of responsibility .
In our view , external relations ought to be based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states , and not on creating spheres of influence .
For this reason , by voting for the report , we wanted to give him our backing in his role as an external control mechanism and as a valuable source of proposals for improvements to European administration .
The key objectives of this digital agenda should include : enabling everyone , as consumers and citizens , to have all the resources needed to access and participate through the internet and , of course , developing an internal digital market that is open and competitive .
So that it can carry out this important task , the competent authorities in the Member States need to send comprehensive , up-to-date , accurate information to Europol .
The need to collect and process information means that a legal instrument must be created that guarantees full respect of fundamental rights .
I therefore urge my esteemed fellow Members to join in rejecting the proposed instruments , without lessening our support for the European Police Office - which we do indeed support - until the Council allows Parliament to be part of the decision-making process .
It has to be involved because it will have that legislative role in a few days ' time , and because this is not now a matter of parliamentary control , rather that we want to make further proposals .
Mr President , I would like to express my deep respect for the European Police Office , which I certainly support .
This is the ' A ' in this ABC , Mr President .
We have seen how important this debate is , but we have not been able to go into great depth because Parliament itself and its services have made it impossible for us to do so , as we are required to deal with no less than six reports at the same time .
As I think it is time to summarise , I want to say that we naturally agree with the whole report , but with regard to the reforms and amendments still pending , I would like to say two things that I think are appropriate .
It gives powers to private companies to introduce restrictions on the use of the internet , and is one more example of the liberalisation of the European telecommunications market .
Mr President , my group considers that it is impossible to separate the part of the Euromed project that is concerned with trade , immigration or funding from the political part .
I refer to the establishment of a free trade area across both regions .
None of the EU 's Member States are succeeding in addressing these problems on their own .
We call for military escorts to be provided , because that is the most effective solution and also the cheapest and the one recommended by the International Maritime Organisation .
That is why we should increase the protection offered to vessels of this type .
It is not a case of replacing armies with private security firms equipped with the weapons of war .
Our values are those on which the ILO was founded .
It now seems that you must take much more ambitious action .
Madam President , the European Union imposes on Community producers the highest standards in the world in terms of food security , health , animal welfare and the environment .
Given that the WTO prevents us from imposing the same standards on imports as we do on European stockbreeders , however , the Commission must , at the very least , guarantee that all meat that crosses Community borders comes from farms that have undergone adequate inspections .
Consequently , both in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and today in plenary , we have supported the amendments that were in line with our viewpoint .
Moreover , I think we need to put an end to the pirates in Somalia , but also to the foreign pirates that are pillaging in Somali waters .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the economic crisis has affected the whole of Europe .
The European Economic Recovery Plan , which was adopted at the end of 2008 , is a plan based on fiscal stimuli which have logically been more powerful in the large economies of the euro area in Western Europe .
Unfortunately , the Council did not support a Commission initiative for the European Social Fund to provide 100 % of the funding during the crisis ( 2009 and 2010 ) for a series of activities to support workers and active policies in the labour market
