the end result of genuine democratic cooperation .
We might ask whether this model of successful cooperation should be continued in the future ?
We have to pay particular attention to relations between the people and the Union ' s institutions .
For that reason , I am very glad that the Charter on Fundamental Rights emphasises the principle of transparency , although it could still be put in stronger terms .
I use the word 'merely ' , although I believe that , despite its declaratory nature , the EC Court will have to apply the Articles of the Charter in their judicial practices as self-binding principles , with which the interpretation of the court must naturally be in harmony .
For the implementation of human rights to be monitored in practice also , however , the Union must have clear rules regarding possible sanction mechanisms to be used against Member States .
According to ancient Finnish wisdom , you should examine a person first before hitting him .
Mr President , the purpose of today ' s discussions , in the opinion of my group , must be that we restore faith in the idea that we are in earnest when it comes to enlargement .
Our job here today is to speed up the process whereby we can begin to discuss these issues .
This should not be , however .
Let me mention Estonia , as an example .
We also have to take this criticism seriously .
Our group requires target dates to be set at the Nice summit or immediately afterwards , by which negotiations on membership should be concluded .
Commissioner Verheugen mentioned corruption , but I would like to mention the fact that we cannot infect future Member States with bad administrative practice either .
Our group believes that it is quite possible , if we are so determined , to include the first group of applicant countries already in the next European parliamentary elections , if there is determination on both sides to do so .
We support the Commission in its quest for a realistic , serious and honest debate on the political questions of enlargement .
Finally , I would like to speak about financing .
Our group does not entirely believe that the present level of financing agreed in the financial framework is sufficient , and so we are prepared to discuss any amendment to the financial perspectives .
Above all we need commitment and that is what the European Parliament , for its part , must demonstrate in this debate and when taking decisions .
Peace brings hope and war destroys it .
Enlargement should not be achieved , however , by choosing the new NATO countries first .
The applicant countries must have equal status and their accession must depend only how much progress they have made .
Certain notorious parties offering a shortcut are like dishonest judges at a sports competition .
It will inevitably lead to conflict , and even more instability caused by extremist movements .
The ignorant and the excluded cannot make up the information society : they are a sure sign of its failure .
The best way to simplify bureaucracy is to concentrate on those issues for which we must find a solution together .
Mr President , I suggest that the Commission give Parliament its assessment of how the internal preconditions of enlargement are developing , in the light of unemployment , exclusion and digital discrimination .
The environment , for example , is an area that will benefit enormously from enlargement , along with many others .
We speak a lot about how enlargement should be financed .
Only in this way can we ensure that the acts will be implemented .
So it was very cheering to hear Klaus HÃ¤nsch , speaking for the PSE Group , hope that he Commission would make a real appraisal of the effects of enlargement , including the economic impact if enlargement were not to take place .
Just consider the costs we would incur if the divide were to continue , and what this would mean both socially and in terms of the environment .
Mr President , there was relatively little comment regarding Elmar Brok ' s idea expressed today of an arrangement similar to the EEA Agreement as an alternative for those applicant countries that do not meet the Copenhagen criteria .
The EEA could act as a kind of hatchery , where EU embryos would mature into fully fledged members If full membership is granted in the context of a brief timetable , a big cause for concern for companies in the Member States will be the long transitional periods , as competition will be distorted .
This would mean greater commitment to the implementation of EU legislation than what is required in the present convergence agreements .
The eastern Central European markets are said to be so open as a result of the convergence agreements that western businessmen might selfishly wonder why enlargement is still required .
The answer is the implementation of the acquis communautaire .
In the end we also need to protect ourselves from it .
An EEA model , which led to membership , and , at the same time , was a reward scheme , would be productive also as far as public opinion was concerned .
In practice it is impossible to demand that animal feedingstuffs should contain no undesirable substances at all .
Now we are confirming the maximum quantities beyond which a batch of feed could not be used .
This sort of practice has fortunately been unknown in the animal feedingstuffs industry up till now in many Member States .
The committee proposes the Commission ' s proposal on this matter should be put into practice .
Compensation is necessary , although it is obvious that farmers themselves are concerned about the wellbeing of their animals
