would exclude the important proposal for improvement .
To explain what I mean , the Committee on Women 's Rights has pointed out , in the opinion it has drafted , that women comprise only 10 % of the employers and 20 % of the employees on the advisory committees , and it has urged that the proportion of women be increased .
In the Nordic countries there are excellent examples of this , and for that reason I recommend that Amendment No 1 be rejected .
I also wish to raise the subject on behalf of the Committee on Women 's Rights .
It is most distressing that half of all women who are killed in Europe do not die as a result of violent crime by someone unknown to them , but are murdered by their own spouse or partner .
I would add that the Treaty of Amsterdam places entirely new obligations upon us and provides opportunities to promote sex equality at many levels .
This means that we have to work more single-mindedly than ever to promote equality .
Nothing of the sort has happened as yet .
We want these campaigns to be carried out as this is a very serious social problem .
A report compiled under the leadership of Marianne Eriksson raises the issue of so-called zero tolerance in matters of violence .
An important report was also put together under the leadership of Susan Waddington extending the debate to cover the issue of the trade in women .
Our committee is very worried that if the Commission now gives in to those Member States which do not agree that the Daphne programme should be made law under Article 235 , the scope of the programme will not be adequate to the scale of the problem .
All credit goes to Mrs Gradin for her attempts to meet our demands that the notion of public health must be understood in as broad a context as possible here .
A law came into force at the beginning of this year in Finland under which the police or a court can impose a restraining order on a person who has behaved violently .
As for the global nature of this problem , I have received , in my capacity as chairman of the committee , a letter from an Iranian organisation pointing out that women in Iran are still being stoned .
We should also remember that we are sure to become involved in these global aspects of the issue with this programme .
Perhaps we can try together to convince those reluctant Member States I mentioned that they should agree to consider Article 235 as a legal basis .
Mr President , I would like to say , concerning the previous speech , that Mrs Gradin has our full support to get the Daphne programme under way , and we will certainly be in a position to cooperate fully on this issue in the future .
However , Parliament was rather perplexed as the Commission did not really make any decisions on the basis of the report , but sent it directly to us and the Council .
However , we should realise there are new kinds of health threats which target women , such as the fact that more and more women have to be solely responsible for looking after their families , as single mothers .
As is well known , they have many financial problems in such roles , and it is clear that the capacity and resources available for all the different kinds of health care are perhaps not perfect either .
Take , for example , eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia , though it has to be said that , surprisingly , young men too have started to suffer from these .
It is a very interesting time to raise the matter of women 's health , as the European Union is committed under the Treaty of Amsterdam to including at least two matters connected with this as part of all its activities .
Thus we really must examine the Union 's future public health policy particularly , in this case , from the point of view of women .
But they are clearly under-represented on the managerial ladder and on decision-making boards in the healthcare sector .
I know of research that shows that when women are also included in the management team the whole perspective changes .
This is a very interesting example , and one that shows that women also have their own way of working when they are allowed to take decisions .
Then there are complaints that affect women in a different way from men : heart and vascular disease , and alcoholism .
This in now way implies that the principle of preparedness should not be vital for everyone , for example , in the elimination of the adverse effects of non-ionising radiation .
The basis here must , however , be the results of research and the WHO recommendations , as well as the principle that the degree of exposure to electromagnetic radiation must be kept as low as is reasonably possible .
This a very new subject area , and research into possible problems and their prevention must continue .
While there are calls for an increase in research into the possible problems of non-ionising radiation we have to ensure that resources are used effectively in the health sector as a whole .
Assessment of the social costs is the job of politicians , and acquiring information on the possible risks is that of researchers and scientists .
Mr President , for some twenty years now there has been research into the effects on health of electromagnetic fields produced by low-frequency electronic equipment and the electrical power network .
The Commission 's estimates of what would be health-endangering values reflect the outcome of the research carried out
