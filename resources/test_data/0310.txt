I believe environmental taxes and charges to be a key way of combating pollution and overexploitation of natural resources .
Instead , the Commission largely just cites current practice in the Court of Justice , where the prime consideration is and remains the free market , not the environment .
Against this backdrop , I find the Olsson report very positive .
Set at the right level , environmental taxes and charges serve to enforce the extremely important polluter pays principle .
The report is sympathetic to the need to provide scope for political intervention in the market , if we are going to save our environment .
However , I think the Commission should await the findings of studies into the efficacy and effect of environmental taxes and charges before pursuing initiatives to introduce such charges .
I also think the report should focus more on the possibility of coordinating environmental taxes and charges in a broader international context , perhaps under the auspices of the UN.
One characteristic of a tax is the sovereign right to require taxes from one 's citizens .
The EU is not , and must not become , a State .
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations , I would like to congratulate Austria on assuming the presidency .
Five years down the line after the Maastricht Treaty , we now have 50 % more regulations to keep track of in Brussels .
Subsidiarity now means that 20 Commissioners in Brussels have sole rights to propose whether a decision should be made by themselves or by the citizens and their elected legislators .
Can 15 foxes agree to protect a chicken ?
One single special interest on the part of one country can prevent power from being handed back to Member States , national and regional parliaments and elected representatives .
I will make a gloomy prognosis that when Austria hands over the reins to Germany , and when Germany in turn - after much talk about the principle of subsidiarity - hands over the reins yet again , the mountain of legislation will be stacked as high as the Alps .
Another example is the recent adoption of the proposed rule governing Members of Parliament , giving us a uniform , higher salary .
In the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations , we believe it is better for us to represent the Member States in the EU.
Who has been out demonstrating for us to have higher salaries ?
I think the report does justice to that .
Regulations and directives have not done much to improve the welfare of animals in transit .
The 1995 directive and the 1998 regulation both indicate that there is a need to establish requirements for the methods of transport used for animals .
That is what we are addressing today .
That is difficult .
But we will get there .
This directive gives us the basis for improving animal welfare during transportation , but farmers and abattoirs in Member States will have to ensure and check that future transportation - including the means of transport - will be monitored .
What is the good of creating optimum conditions in the abattoirs when the animals are traumatized on the way ?
That prompts me to mention that even though we are improving animal welfare , the spread of infection is still increasing .
There is good reason to contemplate what ought to be done from here on .
There is good reason to put a damper on trans-European animal transportation , but other than that , I support Mrs Hautala 's report , and I hope the Commission and the Council will be able to come up with something sensible .
I must say it has been several years since we have had quite such a charming representative here .
We are in the process of amending the regulation , but consideration has still not been given to the fact that there are people of the same sex who wish to live together , and that this should be respected .
I would like to put the following question to you : the Swedish government has given official support to a Swedish public servant working for the Council who has taken a case of discrimination against him and his registered partner to the Court of Justice .
The citizens of these countries should be consulted , but this is not done , because if the citizens of these countries were confronted with the project presently on the table , they would either laugh out loud or go away in tears .
This project is being implemented to the chant of 'an ever closer Union ' as its main thrust , together with the wonderful realization that monetary union and economic policy would , of course , force citizens into a political union .
Then it goes on to state that only the Community system is able to give the necessary guarantees with regard to democratic control , judicial control and solidarity .
Thus , the entire basis of national democracies is swept away , and paragraph 10 goes the whole hog in stating that a qualified majority , rather than unanimity , will now be the norm .
Safety in transport is of concern to us all .
Human and technical errors should be prevented by proper procedures and training .
We can draw a parallel with shipping , where we have port state control , which means that ships are monitored , and we can say that some success has been achieved in singling out the really bad ships .
Suspicion is not enough for me .
But neither commercial considerations nor kindness should play a role in these judgments at airports .
I very much hope that Mr Kinnock , together with the committee and the Council ,
