they are covered by the provisions of Article 1(e ) of the Second Protocol to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities ' financial interests .
The reference to ascertaining the seriousness of the offence is , indeed , not very clear .
In this connection , excessive passing on of data for information purposes , for example , in banks to intermediary bodies , or in the professional categories to auditors , is eliminated .
It is worrying that the Commission says it considers that it makes more economic sense to increase imports of soya meal .
According to him , I was not consistent and correct in upholding human rights while I was in Cuba with Mr Wiebenga and Mrs Eriksson for a meeting of the Interparliamentary Union .
I repeat - he does not need to apologise - next time , he will be the one to defend me against any totally unfounded accusations or criticism .
I feel that the European Parliament 's amendment is timely , and that is what convinced me to vote for the report .
It does concern pensioners .
Mr President , I supported this document on the establishment of a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters , particularly because it lays down that information sheets - vade-mecum - are to be issued so that those who are involved in this European Judicial Network know how to apply it practically .
Mr President , it is often said that Europe is not capable of producing a foreign policy , just as it is not capable of adopting a unified position on international affairs .
We must , in fact , ask ourselves whether a political position such as that we are adopting , a position putting pressure on the public , is enough in this matter , or whether more tangible action might not be required .
Mr President , on such a sensitive issue as that of the urgent subject under consideration , we are genuinely perplexed .
The Holy See is not a State of which every Catholic is a citizen ; the Holy See serves the universal community through its authority but it cannot be held responsible for every action of all the Catholics in the world , whether priests or lay people .
It is vital that the temporary Somali Government does everything possible to initiate constructive dialogue working towards peace , stability and national reconciliation with all the parties involved , Somali community leaders and the authorities of Somaliland and Puntland .
Madam President , I would just like to point out to Mr Poettering that the problem in this Parliament is ensuring that Members receive equal treatment .
The reason is quite obvious .
The situation in my country is very delicate .
Madam President , I do not think that anyone could doubt the uprightness of your actions .
I would like to take this opportunity , Mr President , to point out certain aspects of immunity , all or , at any rate , some of which I would like to explore in greater detail , despite the fact that they have already been mentioned by Mr Zimeray .
Today , someone has raised this issue , which seemed to me , in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , never to have been analysed before .
However , I would like to take this opportunity to remind the previous speaker - not the rapporteur , the Member who spoke before him - that the immunity is Parliamentary immunity , not immunity of the individual Members , that the European Parliament expresses its self-protection through its Members and that the will of the Members who find that they are the subject of a request for waiver of immunity has no bearing on the situation , because each one of us represents the entire Parliament , not himself or herself .
It may be that , had we adopted it earlier , we would have been able to avoid some of the consequences as well .
Today , Europe is doing something more to help : the greater the European interest in Macedonia , the greater the stability of Europe .
Thanks to Mr Swoboda and his initiative and the cooperation of some of the Members , we have , at last , recouped the time lost , and I am extremely grateful to Mr Swoboda for that .
I would point out that , until the Kosovo issue is resolved , it will be difficult to find a solution to the problem of Macedonia .
There are federalistic solutions - and I refer to the case of Belgium , for example , which invented the concept of community federalism , in which , for matters more directly related to the relationship between the citizens and their institution , which may include culture , education and even health , it would be possible to conceive of a federalism which would not bring about territorial division in Macedonia but which would provide the substantial Albanian minority with institutions to represent it too and , therefore , with autonomous control at least over the areas which concern it most directly .
Mr President , I would like to start by asking the Presidency to pay greater attention when Members are asking for the floor .
This is not a libellous book at all ; it is a book which brings to the attention of the European Union documents which are of interest also and precisely for Parliament , for us to consider when we debate - I do not know when - the request for waiver of the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Members , Mr Dell 'Utri and Mr Berlusconi , who should , at last , be brought to justice for these matters .
Thus , I could not fail to vote for the motion
