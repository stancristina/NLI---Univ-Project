strengthen works councils and the directives concerning these .
We can work on information and consultation .
Restructuring is something that we have to live with , but it can be made a success if employees are allowed to participate actively and if the companies involved demonstrate social responsibility .     Mr President , Commissioner , I shall not continue the themed link with football .
At heart , it is political decisions that govern the impact of globalisation .
I would like to point out that the basis for all successful research and development is a large degree of freedom within research , with as little regulation and control as possible .
What research needs is not more regulations but more freedom and resources .
If the Lisbon Programme’s research and development programme is to be a success we must exploit the skills of female researchers .
In other words , I believe that there is reason to emphasise what has been said in the debate in this House today , namely that the European economy is more dependent than other parts of the world on the global economy .
When we look back , it is indisputable that it is through being open to enterprising spirit and to entrepreneurs that Europe has seen its biggest and strongest industries rise and prosper .
We must instead open the way for European companies to be active throughout the world .
We thus need an openness that ensures that Europe can be a world-beating economy .     Mr President , what we are debating can be regarded as a technical matter , but what we are actually concerned with here are two very fundamental issues that we have taken up in the European Parliament .
To what extent is it possible to work difficult hours and still maintain a high level of safety ?
Pilots and cabin crew are the key personnel in the air when it comes to safety .
For us as passengers it is never acceptable for safety to be interfered with in order to keep prices down or in order for companies to be able to drive each other out of business .
Regulations on working time must be backed up medically and scientifically within EASA by Europe’s foremost experts in the field of working time , rest , sleep and fatigue .
As a final point , the agreements in place differ between Member States .
I look forward to a solution being found to the Services Directive during the Finnish Presidency .
At the same time , such agencies are growing in importance all around Europe .
This is an area in which the Finnish Presidency can act .
There are other instruments for promoting flexibility .
We have seen how enlargement of the European Union in recent years has totally changed our world thanks to European cooperation , in the context of which the Baltic Sea is now eminently a sea that links countries together .
Finland is also an example for those of us who expect a lot from your Presidency .
With characteristic openness and single-mindedness , Finland should also , of course , ensure that it turns the European Union into a form of cooperation that is open , transparent and easily accessible to its citizens .
I have been pleasantly surprised , however .
The CIA’s solutions are unsustainable , both in the short and the long term and for both the EU and the rest of the world .
The committee needs more time .
Mr  Frattini has some interesting thoughts on the security service , necessary future controls on aviation and getting the balance right in combating terrorism .     Mr President , Mrs Lehtomäki , Mr  Frattini , the fact that the western Balkan countries are being walled in by visa requirements is a tragedy for those countries , whose people have been able to travel freely in Western Europe for 20 years .
In today’s knowledge-based economy , mobility is just as important a requirement as access to modern information technology .
It must be made clear to the countries that are our neighbours what conditions they have to fulfil in order , firstly , to see visa procedures genuinely simplified and , secondly , to see the compulsory visa requirement one day done away with .
We give out the wrong signal if we place people in different categories , such as students and cultural figures as distinct from farmers and parents of small children .
Not even the fee is to be reduced .
In parts , this report has a different perspective to mine , and in places it seems almost to strive for the opposite .
For me , this is socialism and something very bad .
Despite the fact that Fair Trade labelling is an expression of consumer power and something very positive , I would still like to conclude by calling on everyone , both politicians and citizens , to continue to be critical consumers , particularly in relation to goods bearing Fair Trade labelling .
The Oxfam orange juice sold here in Parliament , for example , comes from Cuba .
I am opposed to the inefficient new funds that are proposed and that the EU will be unable to administer successfully .
Doing so requires confidence , both in the WTO and in multilateralism itself .
It is , after all , the only system that has delivered real liberalisations of world trade .
This is a crucial matter if poor countries are to develop , but also if our own European companies are to have access to new markets .
The economic reality should be enough to convince all the parties to make that little bit of extra effort , particularly the EU-Brazil-USA triangle that was so much in the spotlight over the weekend in Geneva .
