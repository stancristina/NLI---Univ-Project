OLAF Regulation is not sufficient for this .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the miracle of Bonn : the Kyoto baby learns to walk .
He who walks out of negotiations , loses .
The European Union persuaded them by teaching the Kyoto baby to walk , but now it needs to learn to run .
We must make a start on this project as soon as possible , not only in Europe , but also in other parts of the world .
Sustainable development must lead to sustainable growth .
In each Member State , action programmes must be introduced and clear political choices must be made on the way in which Kyoto is realised .
The setting up of EASA and the provisional definition of its responsibilities are an important step on the way to complete harmonisation of safety rules in civil aviation .
The amendments by the European Parliament make it clear that the independence of the Agency has priority .
I have submitted an amendment to define the Authority ' s overall responsibilities more precisely .
We consider it important that all these independent agencies should be accountable to Parliament .
Finally , Mr Lynn submitted a number of amendments to stress the fact that airlines should to their utmost to alert passengers to the danger of aviation-related thrombosis , even on short flights .
Seven years after this compromise , the Commission is trying unilaterally to deprive Austria of that right and at this late stage to give free rein to north-south road traffic , even if the limit of 108 % is exceeded .
The present system in Austria - does not seem to be flawless .
Hence my question to the Commission if it is going to tackle this topic in the long-awaited White Paper .
It is therefore in that capacity that I am here today attending the discussion of the report and of the resolution of the temporary committee and that I wish to express my sympathy with Parliament ' s concern in this matter .
The Council also stressed that although a telecommunications interception system may be an important tool to combat crime and to defend national security , under no circumstances , however , should this system be used to gain commercial advantage .
That is why the Union is trying to promote a dialogue with third countries , as well as a transatlantic dialogue with the United States and Canada .
It would , therefore , be totally unacceptable , on grounds of principle , for communications to be tapped without a very legitimate reason indeed and without those tapping the communications being subjected to any kind of democratic control .
In addition , the sixth Framework Programme concerning research , which is currently being discussed in the Council , should also emphasise all aspects related to security of networks and information traffic .
This is a general principle , which we can only support .
On behalf of my group , I should like to express my great appreciation for the work that the rapporteur , but also the President of the Committee , Mr Coelho , have done over the past year .
With this , it must be ensured that the strict rules which currently apply in most countries for tapping a country ' s own citizens will , in the near future , apply to all EU citizens .
A bit of both would not only lack credibility , but is also practically impossible .
Mr President , the Temporary Committee on ECHELON has resulted in a thorough investigation which is being backed virtually across the political spectrum , at least where its analysis is concerned .
There is no reason to doubt that military and security targets are the primary concern of the intelligence services .
Similar arrangements can also be sought in a larger context , not least with the US.
That is why agreements must be made globally , preferably in the context of the World Trade Organisation .
However , a temporary committee has been set up , which is something .
It is our task to stop this snowball effect by making clear , political statements against the violation of human rights .
( NL ) Madam President , I am making this suggestion in order for it to gain broad approval .
In that framework , as rapporteur , I support this amendment .
( NL ) There is a grave risk that the aviation industry is facing chaos .
( NL ) Mr Brok ' s assumption is based on close ties between NATO and the European Union .
.
( NL ) Unfortunately , the country reports hardly mention the risk of eastern newcomers reverting to their traditional situation pre-1940 , when they were the West ' s poor relations .
Queir√≥ report ( A5-0257/2001 )
A peaceful solution on the basis of free will is now only possible thanks to a confederation .
It is a major step forward that it is now openly being admitted that an EU Member State has been working with the United States , Australia and New Zealand on worldwide espionage for a long time , something which may well adversely affect people , organisations and businesses within the EU.
Since the end of last year , the summits of the European Council have also become the subject of massive protest campaigns .
Over and above that vital concern , it must also respond to the anxieties and questions of all the protesters .
The Commission and the Council will publish a detailed rationale of the already very positive role played by the European Union in this regard .
I will therefore not make the same mistake , but what I would say , on behalf of the presidency and on my own behalf , is that anti-establishment activity in itself is a good thing .
