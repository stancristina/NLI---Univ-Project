I hope that we can make better use of funds than we do now for programmes to promote equal opportunities .
The increase in fixed-term employment contracts has created an air of insecurity in the lives of women .
It should be patently obvious that people should be paid the same for doing the same work , regardless of gender .
Campaigns are under way in Finland to increase women 's interest in the natural sciences and technical subjects .
Are the old attitudes learnt at home still firmly rooted in us ?
There is still room for improvement in our own attitudes .
We do not dare to take on demanding jobs or try something new .
I believe the Commission should carry out more detailed research into the cause of the problem and prevailing attitudes throughout the EU.
On the contrary , girls outperform boys at school , and there are more women than men at college or university .
There is no equivalent for women .
As I said , there is room for improvement in the attitudes of women .
I believe that the long and stormy parliamentary debate on Mrs d'Ancona 's reports has strengthened the view of most that the battle against drugs cannot be won by proposing that the harmonisation of EU Member States ' drug laws should be achieved merely in terms of a liberal approach to the drugs problem .
We are all , in our own way , victims of drug abuse .
Simply focusing on the control of problems that are the result of drug abuse is not the right approach .
We urgently need to develop and enhance systems for sharing information among the relevant authorities and setting up joint databases for the registration of new narcotic substances , with the help of EU funding .
Mr President , over the last few months it has become commonly accepted that the IMF has failed in its task of rescuing the world 's organisation of its finances .
In all its operations the IMF has been guided by an invisible hand : liberalist logic .
The IMF , with our money , has baled out supranational banks , instead of individual countries .
For that reason , according to Mr Hoppenstedt 's report , we have good grounds to include all the financial institutions in the minimum reserves base as well as many of their off-balance-sheet items .
The banks should not be paid market rates of interest on their minimum reserves .
The ideology of the European Central Bank is the logic of free capital markets .
Mr President , I would mainly like to speak about Mr Hendrick 's report , which concerns the powers of the European Central Bank to collect statistical information .
This information is in principle collected from various agents in confidence , but as the rapporteur and the committee state , this proposal for a regulation is not absolutely clear from the point of view of confidentiality .
It can even contain industrial secrets , and it may be that inner-circle problems will be caused if this information , surrendered as it is to the Central Bank , does not main entirely confidential .
The ECB should therefore draft general rules on the public 's right to access documents in its possession without delay and to acquaint themselves with the open regulations on restrictions and exceptions .
In the present economic turmoil of Asia and Russia , we can see that money and monetary policy are inevitably tied to the economy , social relations and politics itself .
Confidence in the market is not enough .
That means the need for more democracy , supervision of the Central Bank and responsibility to democratic bodies .
For that reason , I am in favour of the idea of creating a secretariat in contact with ECOFIN , for example , to prepare questions relating to finance and economics .
We seem to have given up the monitoring and control of money , which has resulted in money controlling us and currency speculators controlling entire states .
Changes have to be made .
The ECB must be accountable and that is because neo-liberalism , which has wrought havoc in the lives of ordinary people , has come crashing down in all major recent elections .
We have to address the big issues like the control and regulation of speculative money and the global giants .
It falls entirely outside the scope of taxation .
This is the wrong sort of ratio .
Ruthless speculation on the stock market causes a great deal of damage .
The speculators are the ones who enjoy the fruits of human labour .
And there can be no good grounds for this .
Only 7 % have started to prepare themselves in this way .
This being the case , I hope that the Commission will produce a guidance package for the SME sector as we move towards the single currency .
The banks in the euro area will thus be placed at a major competitive disadvantage compared with non-member countries .
The worst situation of all will be the one that bank employees will face here in Europe before long .
For that reason , I think that the next EU summit should have on its agenda the question of currency speculation , its taxation , and its control in general .
There are examples of many types of operation , such as the administration of TACIS funds , that must be properly in place .
The changeover to the euro will reduce losses of income for those who practise agriculture , at least in the respect that exchange rates will become stable .
The position of those Member States remaining outside monetary union will become a problem .
The prospect for the currency of the euro area would appear to be one of stability .
In Finland they are
