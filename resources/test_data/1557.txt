or that they risk jeopardising the proper functioning of economic and monetary union , the Commission may address a warning to the Member State concerned ' .
At a time when the Iberian peninsula holds two important presidencies ( the Council of the European Union via the Spanish Prime Minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , and the European Commission via Portugal 's José Manuel Barroso ) , I regret that the Spanish Presidency has not demonstrated its capacity to bring added political value to relations with the continent of America outside the United States and Canada .
The priority given to renewable energies , the obligation for multinationals operating in ACP countries to declare their profits and taxes , the incorporation of the concept of food sovereignty and the criticism of the externalisation by Europe of the management of migratory flows are all proposals that we support .
No response to the conditions laid down by Parliament has been received .
Personally speaking , and without committing my group , I think the issue of a carbon tax at our borders will have to be addressed .
Next , the government will eventually have to produce reforms , which will inevitably have to lead to a new draft constitution .
Tunisia has achieved substantial progress , which has resulted in a very high standard of development with socio-economic results acknowledged by international institutions .
I am therefore extremely optimistic about the future of relations between Tunisia and the EU , since they are being forged against a backdrop of mutual respect between partners who respect one another and have an understanding on the fundamental issues .
There have been putsches in almost all of the associations that showed a certain degree of autonomy with regard to the authorities .
I fully support the remarks made by Mrs Flautre , and share her alarm at some of the comments made .
Why did it refuse to host EU observers if the elections are as democratic as it says they are ?
All over the world , crimes are being perpetrated against minorities , be they Christian , Jewish or Muslim .
It is this respect that is missing in the resolution .
We cannot accept a government engaging in Internet piracy and denying Internet users their freedom of expression .
The European institutions must join forces and take action on this matter .
( Applause ) Mr President , I do not deny that Mumia Abu-Jamal 's situation is critical and that the case certainly deserves to be heard .
It can decide in favour of the automatic exchange of every conceivable type of data between tax authorities in Europe and , at the same time , reject the SWIFT agreement with the United States in the name of individual freedoms .
In this context , there is much talk of public deficits , the spending of Member States is being attacked , but the fall in tax receipts is allowed to fade into the background .
By making the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities the norm , they give the Member States the means to tackle tax fraud seriously .
Madam President , honourable Members , the present debate concerns a question of great interest to the European public : the public financing of the restructuring of the Opel/Vauxhall group by one or more European governments .
I understand the concerns caused by the announcement of thousands of job losses at that plant .
And you , you are endorsing the closure by telling us in advance that a small amount of social aid will be used as a sticking plaster to ease the workers ' pain whilst General Motors continues to reaps its profits !
I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to supply accurate statistics on the impact of the crisis on women and men , and on the Member States , before they implement any budget austerity policies , to carry out gender-based impact studies so as to prevent women from being disproportionately affected .
Sexual and reproductive rights are an important chapter because women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights .
The Commission shares the rapporteur 's view that it is essential to continue with our efforts .
The third notable initiative is the introduction of the European Institute for Gender Equality .
Why has this discrimination persisted so ?
Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate the Commissioner on this final effort - yes , I who have often challenged him in other forums - and to simply thank everyone for this very rich debate , in which many Members have spoken .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission shall promote the general interest of the Union and take appropriate initiatives to that end .
Then what ?
The answer is 'not yet ' .
Our Europe 2020 vision is both a structural and comprehensive reform strategy and an exit and recovery strategy .
So it is most welcome that a key change in the treaty is the strengthening of all the European institutions .
Because let us never forget that our Union is founded on values : respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights .
With this in mind , Mr Barroso , we are also counting on your personal commitment and on your leadership .
The absence , for six months , of a Commission equipped with real powers is something that should not be repeated in the future , especially in this period of economic and financial crisis , in which there are major issues such as climate change , Copenhagen , and so on .
Be ambitious on this point , Mr Barroso .
You are not the President of Parliament yet !
That is the new mathematical formula of the Barroso Commission .
