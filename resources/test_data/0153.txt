The lid is still on the pan , but the moment when all the steam could escape is imminent .
What would be your answers to these questions ?
Following the devastation of the Second World War , the nations of the world created the United Nations as the instrument which was to guarantee world peace , and , as Mr Patten says , there is no alternative to the UN when it comes to maintaining global security .
It would amount to rejecting and deliberately opposing the UN.
What would happen then ?
There is no excuse for dictator Saddam Hussein 's breach of the UN resolutions .
The EU has to make it clear to the world 's largest democracy , the USA , that all countries must abide by international law and that the law of the street is not acceptable , even against dictators .
It is good that there has been an evaluation after five years .
It is important to see what has worked well , what has not worked so well and where there is room for improvement .
There has been an increase in active employment measures , unemployment has fallen , and employment has risen accordingly .
There is one more aspect that no one has mentioned , which is that sustainable development must be integrated into employment strategy as it is into the other two strategies .
I also share the view as regards focus .
They already play a central role , and there are reasons for increasing their participation in the employment strategy .
We cannot let such important issues be decided behind closed doors by employees ' associations .
All of this is important .
First of all , I am pleased that both the Commission and the Council so clearly identify with and advocate the Lisbon strategy , with its clear aims and its talk of economic growth , full employment and social considerations in balance with each other .
It is important that the European Employment Strategy be coordinated with national employment policies .
It is good that the parliaments are to play a greater role .
That is a practical question .
I believe that we must keep a grip on reality and focus on what is tangible .
May I say by way of conclusion that both the enlargement process , with its very particular problems for the candidate countries , and the recent rise in unemployment present new challenges which demand a sense of reality .
Madam President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , we have discussed this matter for quite some time in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , with reports and hearings .
We know that serious human rights violations are being committed in Algeria .
Much remains to be done in Algeria in the domains of freedom of the press , freedom of association and the establishment of the rule of law .
The Liberal Group has made constructive efforts to contribute to this resolution .
It would be a shame if these points disappeared , because it is very important to put pressure on the Algerian Government .
Madam President , by way of conclusion I wish to address a few words to the Commission .
If we do not lead from the front on this issue , we will actually make ourselves look ridiculous , and we risk not being taken seriously in the field of foreign policy .
I also note with interest that the Commissioner made specific reference to the RDR , which is the Liberals ' sister party in CÃ´te d'Ivoire .
At that time , it was said that the EU certainly was concerned about the fact that the 2000 elections were characterised by violence , infringements of human rights and exclusion of some major political parties , and talks were held pursuant to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement .
We are concerned about the troubles spreading out in the region .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his very extensive work , but above all for being really skilful in his cooperation with other groups and for trying to find wide-ranging solutions .
After all , this is a very complicated subject .
The trade in emission rights at global level within the Kyoto Protocol is a system involving many risks .
We want as many sectors as possible to be covered , and we naturally support the proposal for an extension to more sectors .
We will therefore vote on the various parts of the proposal in accordance with this .
Also , I would like to express thanks for the Commission 's document , which provides a very good basis .
We have three commitments to take into account .
In order for the system to function , I think that the following six points must be complied with .
After all , we cannot create a playing field where some players say : ' No , I do not want to join in right now , so I am quitting and sitting on the sidelines instead ' .
The compromise now to be voted on is based on up to 95 % allocation free of charge and 5 % by auction during the first period , and I think that this is a good solution .
There has also been discussion as to whether it should be possible to carry over emission rights from year to year , and I think this is right .
Above all , I wish to urge the Council to ensure that it makes a decision on 17 October .
Allow me to begin by placing this debate in a wider context , that is to say , what we know about climate change .
We know that the thickness of the
