not serve anyone else .
We have no choice but to categorically oppose the policy to commercialise and militarise space .     Mr President , today is an excellent time to be debating the very good report by Mr Laschet on the relations between the European Union and the UN as , at the same time , we are receiving Kofi Annan , not just as a person , but as an institution , as a symbol of an irreplaceable need for the UN.
However , until they are expressed effectively , the UN is irreplaceable .
Proposing a strategy for the UN and the European Union , however , we note that we ourselves have serious gaps which we need to plug.
If the new distribution does in fact result in the European Union 's gaining a place on the Security Council , without other countries losing their place , this will allow it , from that position , to support policies for peace , cooperation , security , democracy and all the claims of mankind , which are objectives which we must attain .     .Satellite navigation is a particularly important space application with many uses : in shipping , in aircraft navigation , even in search and rescue operations .
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote .     .The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution on space policy in accordance with everything I said in my position yesterday and , furthermore , because the amendments which we proposed against the use of space for military purposes and to serve defence and security policy were not accepted .
It is a disgrace for the socialists who made the proposal and for everyone who accepted it .
We condemn all external intervention and call for all governments to stand by the side of the grass-roots forces in Columbia so that the bloodshed and the activities of the paramilitary forces stop , peace is protected and human rights are respected .
It revives a spirit of vindictiveness which only presages hardships for our peoples .
They want to strike the pioneers of this fight , the communists who remain faithful to their ideals , because the followers are their friends and protégées .     .
Of course , we must not overlook the fact that , although the legal framework is the health and safety of workers , it also relates directly to the productivity of enterprises .
First , the derogations regarding reference periods and how the maximum working week is calculated .
Of course , these two issues cannot be addressed without taking account of recent developments in the case law of the European Court of Justice , which qualifies the time which a doctor is at home on call as working time , insofar as he is called to the health centre during the period he is at home .
Consequently , the Commission communication expressly concerns itself with the results of these judicial cases .
That is why the Commission has started a broad consultation procedure .
Nonetheless , there are various points on which I think we are fairly clear and which I support .
Of course , this does not mean that we must not take account of various important problems , such as in the field of health which , following the rulings by the Court , could be extended to other branches with similar problems .
There are various types of approach .
If there are also rulings of this type in other branches in the future , then other branches will have similar problems .
That is also why there are countries in which we have systematic abuse of 'opting out ' in all branches , in all categories of enterprise , with very serious problems for the workers .
I think that Parliament has the first word in this consultation process .
They increase the level of exploitation of the working class and maximise the profits of big business .
The right to insurance and normal leave is being violated , while greater flexibility in employment relations is being promoted .
We support the reduction in working time , the introduction of a genuine 35-hour week of seven set working hours a day , five days a week , an increase in wages and full insurance and employment rights which will apply universally to all workers and all enterprises .
Thus , I think that the Commission 's genuine interest is clear , as is its close and efficient cooperation with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
Secondly , I believe that the setting up of the Women 's Forum is very important .
I should like to take advantage of the seventh plenary Assembly in Addis Ababa to inform you , even though you already know , that two of our colleagues , Pοul Nielson and Pascal Lamy , will be speaking , and I should like to express my best wishes for a successful Assembly .     .
Mr President , the Commission welcomes the report by Mr Modrow and the support which it gives to the application of the two communications .
We outlined the experience which the Commission has as regards the support of the private sector , the benefits which derive from action at Community level and the need to harmonise the various means .
We avoided adopting easy or simplified ideological approaches .
We recognise the huge importance of domestic investors , as well as the investments which European small - and medium-sized enterprises can make , especially those which have experience and knowledge .
The two communications are complementary and have been drafted on the criterion and with the ultimate objective of further reducing poverty .
