, with Russia trying to create Chechen-free buffer zones .
Does the European Union want , for example , to be involved , through a pact of partnership and cooperation , in increasing Russian military expenditure , which will be used to punish Chechnya in the future ?
If , and only if , these acts of terror are the work of Chechnya , then they are the wrong way to go about things on the international level .
They can be resolved in the EU and NATO through violence , precision bombing raids and attacks on independent countries , all of which runs counter to the decisions of the international community .
This way of solving problems is the wrong one .
We wish to achieve a solution through dialogue , and that will require talks between the leaders of Russia and Chechnya .
As was pointed out in the discussions , it is clear that the continued crisis is increasing pressure to put Union cooperation with Russia on ice .
It has been said that , with increased tax revenues and economic growth , there may well be more funds at their disposal .
But , as has been claimed , the longer the war goes on , the more negative the attitude will become to any kind of aid to Russia .
Mr President , it would indeed appear that the Chechen war in Russia is also part of an election campaign , although there may be many other reasons for it .
The cessation of this aid will obviously affect the poorest and those who need help most , it has to be remembered .
The example of Armenia - the murder of the Prime Minister a few hours ago today - is again a deplorable indication of that .
Is the Commissioner ready to support this sort of northern dimension action ?
I would like to say to her that the birth of the euro is a very important thing for us young people too .
Although Parliament also decides the framework and main policies of the programme , it is important to remember that the successful implementation of programmes can only be carried out at national level .
The programme ' s application procedure has to be further clarified and be made more user-friendly , which is what has already been said here .
Experience , however , has shown that a target group that is too heterogeneous increases the amount of administrative work required to assess applications and might even adversely affect the chances of certain special groups to use the programmes .
Youth programme evaluation must clearly be improved .
Programme evaluation should also pay attention to the programme ' s cost-effectiveness .
This is an important step forward .
Programme resources can easily be used up in mere sporting events unless restrictions are imposed .
The importance of national cultures is being emphasised with globalisation .
The audiovisual sector is one of the most global of cultural sectors .
Neither must we forget the sector ' s impact on employment .
Although the sector may be run by large consortiums , we have to remember that its new jobs are created primarily for SMEs .
They mean greater competitiveness and more diversified production for Europe ' s audiovisual sector .
The Audiovisual Observatory will improve the operating prerequisites of European companies in this rapidly developing area .
The collation and dissemination of information particularly helps SMEs to cooperate and , hence , develop .
It is unfortunate that , as a result of a vote taken by the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , it is being proposed that financing for the observatory should be safeguarded for just three years , going against the position of the rapporteur , the chairman of the committee , Mr Gargani , among others .
At the same time , however , it must be remembered that savings should not be made in the wrong areas .
Madam President , I am not now referring to the Minutes , but I would like to turn all my colleagues ' attention to a certain tragic event that took place yesterday in Yerevan , Armenia .
I would ask you to consider holding a moment ' s silence as a result of this incident , which we , as Members of Parliament , can in no way endorse .
On the contrary , we must do all we can to restore parliamentary peace there .
Madam President , draft Amendment No 503 concerning promotions is in this voting group .
The remarks are therefore unnecessary , and just the numbers should remain .
Mr President , in the name of the principle of transparency , I must make one observation on the course of events .
On this I agree with Mr Bar√≥n Crespo in an earlier discussion .
However , we made another agreement as well .
In this way the groups had a whole week to debate the sensitive points in this proposal .
As the Council has stated , no precise estimates of the aid requirements have been presented other than those regarding Kosovo .
Regarding point 11 in the report , I think that Parliament , for its part , committed to reviewing its statute already last spring , so that travel expenses would be paid according to bona fide costs incurred .
Although I am also personally committed to reviewing the expenses arrangements on the basis of bona fide costs , I call also on the Council ' s commitment to push through Parliament ' s proposal .
Mr President , Commissioner , this debate and situation have come at the worst possible time for the EU and is causing a lot of harm .
This is an absolutely inconceivable situation !
That was a very commendable thing .
Let us take the example of Poland .
