I find that very unfortunate , and it illustrates of course the importance , in the chemicals area , of our being able to reverse the burden of proof so that it is the producers who have to show that the substances they use pose no risk to the environment and to human beings .
That is why I shall vote in favour of the conciliation proposal and the outcome of the conciliation in the final vote tomorrow .
I have today voted in favour of Mr Bourlanges 's report ( A5-0425/2002 ) .
I nonetheless regret the reference to management and labour .
In my view , that would give rise to an inappropriate third party in the social dialogue .
That was a great and positive experience .
I am delighted to be here today with an equally clear result .
It is our common dream that is coming true ; it is our common aim that is being achieved .
The European Parliament , the Commission and the Presidency have fought together for enlargement .
I was especially pleased , therefore , that the President of the European Parliament took part in the final solemn occasion when , on Friday evening , we welcomed the new members into our Community .
Parliament , the Commission and the Presidency have stayed the course together , and in Copenhagen we passed the finishing line .
I should like to express my thanks for all the efforts made and for the unfailing support and the help along the way .
We put an end to a century characterised by wars and conflicts .
At the same time , we opened the door to a new era in the history of Europe : an era characterised by freedom , peace , growth and prosperity .
The enlargement of the EU was the Danish Presidency 's main priority - but we have a large number of other considerable achievements under our belt .
This can be seen from our achievements .
Before I move on to the Copenhagen Summit , I should like to outline a number of the other tasks that the EU has carried out in the last six months .
We have successfully continued the fight against international terrorism and redoubled efforts against illegal immigration .
We succeeded in reaching agreement on fully opening up the EU 's electricity and gas markets .
The rules on the Single European Sky have secured the basis for fewer cancellations and shorter flight times , benefiting passengers , the environment and airlines .
First there was the flooding in Central Europe .
Most recently , we reacted to the tragic loss of the oil tanker Prestige .
Agreement has been reached on the emissions trading scheme in CO2 .
We succeeded in finding a solution to the question of transit to and from Kaliningrad that is acceptable to all parties .
Lastly , I wish to emphasise the positive and effective cooperation we have had with Parliament : the work on the codecision and budgetary procedures , amongst other things .
For the first time in many years , we actually succeeded in reaching agreement on large parts of the budget as early as first reading .
Together , we have shown in the last six months that the EU can deliver the goods ; that - despite national , institutional and political variations - we can together produce results , create a better , safer daily life for our citizens , create better conditions of competition for our industries and increase Europe 's influence in the world .
We concluded enlargement negotiations with ten new Member States : Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Slovakia and Slovenia .
That is the nature of the beast : it ensured that we ended up achieving the right balance between the wishes of the candidate countries and the possibilities of the present Member States .
The ten new countries can become members from 1 May 2004 .
The first stage in this process - which in many of the countries will entail referendums - is the completion of the accession treaty .
I shall call on all three institutions to do their utmost to keep to this timetable .
The conclusions from the Copenhagen Summit also deal with the question of the participation of the new Member States in the institutions of the EU.
We have laid down that the ten acceding states will be able to participate in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament as members .
Once the European Council has appointed a new President of the Commission , the newly elected European Parliament can approve a new Commission , which will have to take office on 1 November 2004 .
Here , too , I shall call for cooperation between the institutions to find flexible solutions that ensure the best terms for our new Member States .
The issue of Turkey came to be one of the main topics in Copenhagen .
We acknowledge the important steps that Turkey has taken towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria .
If the European Council decides in December 2004 , on the basis of a report and a recommendation by the Commission , that Turkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria , the European Union will open accession negotiations with Turkey as quickly as possible .
This is the way it has to be .
Turkey must be treated in the same way as all the other candidate countries .
Then there is Cyprus .
I would urge the parties to the conflict in the strongest terms to seize this unique opportunity to resolve this unfortunate conflict .
In Copenhagen , we sent out a clear message to the new neighbours of the enlarged EU : to the countries of the western Balkans , to Russia , the
