They are the conversion into specific negotiation documents of political guidelines that were drawn up in December 2000 , following discussions with the other European institutions - the Council and Parliament .
One last point on this matter of transparency : I have decided to make all our proposals public once they have been finalised .
It is this freedom of manoeuvre that we used commonly to call 'cultural exception ' and which has been renamed 'preservation of cultural diversity ' .
The Union is also called upon to promote at international level both preservation of and respect for this diversity , which is the essential basis for intercultural dialogue and cultural exchange at world level .
The most important thing to remember is that public services are not under threat from GATS.
I would , however , like to say one more thing .
Nevertheless , we would prefer it to be a more binding obligation , as you , of all people , are aware .
I believe we must not put that kind of pressure on the developing countries .
Mr Lamy , you think that more competition will provide the poor with high quality drinking water .
In order to avoid running the risk of culture being seen as just another product one day in the future , we must provide it with a new legal framework so that it does not have to be part of the negotiations on world trade .
Is cultural exception really sufficient if we only exclude the audiovisual sector ?
I visited the country to speed things up and I made sure our point of view on this was very clear , particularly to Congress , so that it would move forward with the necessary legislation .
In this case , opening up the services market is the best way to improve the management of the economies of developing countries , make them more competitive and integrate them more effectively into world trade .
Nobody , however , has approached me to say that the detailed proposals do not correspond with what I had previously announced .
There is no wolf here .
On the other hand , we have the debate on issues relating to external negotiations .
I recognise these are sensitive issues .
I do wish to take a harder line on this matter but I believe I should take account of the misgivings expressed in different quarters .
I agree with all the Members who stated that one is called for .
In the forthcoming Treaty , we must be allowed to retain our ability to protect cultural diversity of all kinds within the Union .
Modernity lies in the ability of governments to guarantee fundamental rights and not in a determination to satisfy the financial markets .
I want to know the impact of this on other sectors .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although this draft directive has been considerably amended , I do not think it is any more appropriate now than it was at first reading .
If accidents happen , the European Union and its institutions must act in accordance with their accountability to the citizens of Europe .
Mr Hatzidakis wondered why we should not liberalise everything now that we have liberalised one sector .
All those who work at ports must benefit from the same conditions of salary and social protection , modelled upon the most advantageous available .
Mr President , there must be no doubt at all about the objective of the harsh measures proposed by the Commission and endorsed by the Council concerning cod stocks in the North Sea .
The aim is , in fact , long-term restocking designed to preserve as many jobs as possible in the fishing communities that have been netting white fish for years and that are to be temporarily and fairly compensated and not required to diversify once and for all into other areas of activity .
It is a display of what I would term blind optimism .
It is shocking and cannot easily be explained .
I would also note that the Council is not present today , and I do not know what conclusion to draw from this absence .
Might I ask you , President Prodi , what your own reaction was to this proposal and when you think it could start to be implemented ?
This method alone will make it possible to strengthen the democratic nature of the European budget decisively and to bring the citizens closer to our institutions , as we want with all our hearts .
These disasters will no longer take place along our coasts , like the Erika and Prestige shipwrecks , but within the ports .
The strategy implemented has made genuine progress possible , and , as has been stated , Commissioner , we fully support the proposals regarding the way in which you plan to follow up this work .
Must we prevent ourselves from taking a look at these experiments and drawing the conclusions that , in my opinion , are generally extremely interesting ?
We are told that it will no longer be possible to vote when there are 25 Members .
The truth is that , in fact , the institutional solutions we adopt with regard to the Central Bank are sometimes frightening , because we sometimes have the impression that they could be imposed on other institutional mechanisms , or even the Union itself .
I wonder whether we are really in the process of subcontracting the management of migration to our neighbours , so creating a buffer zone between the European Union and the rest of the world , which would probably be less laudable .
We must consider why there is a lack of productive public and private investment .
Europe must devise a policy of her own .
I will therefore only comment on
