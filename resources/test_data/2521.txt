view to realizing genuine equality , and the EU should help them to do so .
Mr President , consideration of the proposal for a Directive on posting of workers has taken an agonizingly long time .
This state of affairs has caused suffering in many countries , as the pay of workers posted to them temporarily has considerably undercut national wage levels .
The procedure in any case merely transfers unemployment from one country to another and increases pressure for cuts in pay and social security in Member States where levels of wages and social security are high .
The exemptions , in particular , weaken the directive and will lead to problems of implementation .
Bearing in mind that the first exemption already permits national decisions to be taken on the treatment of cases where the length of posting does not exceed one month , it could be asked whether this does not sufficiently cover cases where the amount of work to be done is not significant .
The general applicability of collective agreements is the cornerstone of Finland 's employment contracts system ; Finland bases its regulations concerning the terms of employment of foreign workers precisely on this principle , and will now be authorized by this Directive to do so .
I should like to thank rapporteur Peter for his work and express the hope that the Council will bring this Directive into force speedily .
Mr President , the 6 + 6 model has been experimented with in Finnish industry , and it has yielded many benefits .
Thanks to increased productivity , it was found possible to continue to pay the same wages to workers in these experiments , despite the reduction in working hours .
It is difficult to attain in public services all the benefits to which I have referred , which were achieved in the private sector .
Cuts in unemployment will permit significant savings in public expenditure .
Employment initiatives should also be promoted , not only by means of subsidies but also by revising the principles concerning the levying of social security contributions .
Now practical examples are needed , and must be publicized .
Now voluntary nature conservation organizations have started to sell such certificates to the forestry industry .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Bangemann for his reply .
However , it has been claimed in the Finnish press that once its packaging has been opened , breast-milk substitute should not be kept for long .
It has also been claimed that these endotoxins were enabled to multiply because poor raw materials were used , hygiene was inadequate and the product was kept for a long time : all indicators of poor quality .
Madam President , Michel Rocard 's report on the distribution of work is an important document .
Only if we succeed in it will the preconditions for European integration exist .
Unemployment causes huge problems to the individual in person .
I hope nonetheless that , when we consider the importance of sharing work , we will not forget that Europe 's industrial base must be bolstered .
Since Europe cannot compete with the rest of the world as regards the cost of labour , we should invest in knowhow .
It is also justifiable to give employees who are approaching retirement the option of working part-time .
It is also important that organizations representing the two sides of industry should be involved in this development work .
In order to bring about genuine improvements in air quality , we all need to know where we stand .
This is essential , as the European public should be allowed to know about threats to their health .
It causes 62 % of carbon monoxide emissions and 50 % of nitrogen dioxide emissions .
In a market economy it is effective to use the means afforded by that economy - i .e . to provide price incentives .
Better-quality fuel should be priced more cheaply .
Now however this approach may be under threat from the EU 's rules on taxation .
Some wish to get rid of their waste cheaply , and others wish to obtain raw materials from it at low cost .
It is laid down in the Basel Convention that waste for recycling must not be exported outside OECD countries .
As the rapporteur , Mr Virgin , has observed in his own amendments and as stated in Parliament 's earlier standpoint , the rules laid down by the EU concerning hazardous waste currently fall short of the requirements of the Basel Convention .
The EU and its Member States have a responsibility to ensure that no loopholes endanger the health of people in poor countries .
It was good to hear the rapporteur express the view that , here too , the Council once again seems to be coming round to the views expressed in Parliament 's report .
In general , it is necessary to be cautious about transporting waste , and the principle should be adopted that waste ought to be processed and exploited as close as possible to its place of origin .
Mr President , peace has prevailed on this continent since the 1940s .
However , the fundamental mission of the EU is seriously incomplete , as what peace means nowadays is partly that people should feel a sense of belonging to society , that children should not be abused and that the economy should be brought into line with the requirements of environmental protection .
Sustainable jobs can best be created by means of ecological tax reforms .
It will then be possible to do something about child labour , to improve environmental protection and to make proposals to reduce global speculation .
Mr President , I should like to thank you and the Presidents of the Council and Commission for your constructive statements
