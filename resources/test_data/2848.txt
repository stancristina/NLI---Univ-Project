The Rothley report also opens the way for the patenting of methods of treatment , as the term known as the doctor 's exemption is missing in the report .
So I must say that if this directive is adopted it will not only be a defeat for democracy but also a disgrace for the European Parliament .
I have a question for the Commission .
It is important that numbers which are used often are kept and that we do not change a system which otherwise perhaps functions well .
Secondly : is this not a reason to press on with the introduction of a regulation on the labelling of beef products ?
The framework agreement is not necessarily only of use in big projects .
Such success ought to form the inspiration for continuing in other areas as well .
More and more people are doing the same .
In many ways this is a positive development which creates new opportunities for a large number of people .
But we must also be clear in our minds that it creates new risks as well ; risks which we must attempt to minimise .
The most important thing now is to ensure that an annual increase does not become the new trend .
There are two things which I would particularly like to emphasise as part of this work .
The second point I would like to make is that of including safety as a feature of the competition between airlines .
This will include information on pilot training and education , the average age of the airline and on accidents and incidents of different types .
The European Union has failed in practically everything : unemployment , economic policy , agricultural policy , environmental policy and control of fraud .
Ultimately , there must be some reaction to the way the Union is dictating the applicant countries ' domestic policy and that they must subject themselves to the Union 's destructive economic dogmatism , just as if these other countries have no values of their own to bring with them but must be treated instead like colonies , whose assets are to be bought and whose people dominated .
On the other hand , a sign of a real democracy is when the victor gives the loser both personal security and the opportunity to criticise his way of ruling .
Recently there has been an election in Albania .
I think that this , in spite of everything , is a success for Albania .
We in the European Parliament hope to be able to see continued democratic successes .
You are extremely keen for speakers to keep within their time limits .
This is something we must all respect .
I would like to ask two related questions of the Council of Ministers .
That was the first question .
We must do something concrete .
We know what it is like for the people .
I am not sure that it will do so .
I would like to ask the Council if , following a number of questions from many Member States , it would consider asking the Commission to carry out an impact analysis of the effect on employment and tourism in those countries affected by the abolition of duty-free shopping so that we can gain a proper insight into the consequences of such abolition .
I would very much like to congratulate Mrs Dybkj√¶r , even nominate her as an 'honorary green ' for her persistent attempts to persuade this Union to secure the necessary means to fulfil the environmental promises which it has itself included in the fifth action programme for the environment .
Mr President , last time we discussed this issue I was forced , on behalf of the Green Group , to ask the Commissioner responsible for environmental issues , Mrs Bjerregaard , to reconsider her position as Commissioner for the Environment because of the rare display of arrogance shown in her treatment of Parliament 's demands .
I very much hope that I will not have to do the same this time as well .
I also think that it would be something of a personal disaster for the Commissioner for the Environment .
It is fundamentally concerned with the EU 's credibility in environmental policy , its capacity to progress from fine words to action .
There are a couple of other amendment proposal which I think are of great importance as well and these are amendment proposals 2 and 37 , point f which concern the new Member States and state that they do not have to lower their environmental standards .
On the climate issue , the report proposes that greenhouse gases be reduced by 20 % by the year 2005 , 30 % by the year 2010 and 50 % by the year 2030 .
This is a level which it is possible to reach .
This gives a snapshot of what will happen if several other countries follow Sweden 's example .
From a study of the material in the Commission 's external report it is possible to calculate that nuclear power has saved approximately 20 000 lives in the EU over a ten year period if a comparison is made with a situation where the same amount of energy had been produced using coal powered power stations .
This would be a decisive environmental victory .
While we are all aware of how many cases of cancer are caused by tobacco - the Commission itself has stated that around half a million people die annually because of tobacco - we continue to discuss the amount of subsidy to pay to the tobacco growing sector .
Is it possible that this situation has arisen because the cost of health care in the EU Member States is paid by the Member States themselves , while EU agricultural policy and the aid
