which have been made in the various speeches I have heard have been perfectly reflected in our motion for a resolution .
A few points are still unresolved , however .
This is very important , because this kind of thing used to happen in the past .
There is a text in the resolution before us which I can only describe as messy .
Broadly speaking this cannot be said .
The opinion poll also showed very clearly that xenophobia thrives best on feelings of insecurity , but above all , and this is important , on fear of the future and lack of faith in democratic institutions .
I hope that all democratic parties will sign this charter very soon , but also implement it , please .
In view of the fact that the original Commission proposal was not particularly great , and the Council text a lot better , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs obviously used the Commission text as its starting point , but used the Council text as the basis for discussion .
I therefore hope that the Commission will incorporate Parliament 's proposal for a form of permanent delegation with representatives from industry , consumers , and so on .
This is also something , I think , that Europe should start to take action on , and I hope that on this point a few things will happen from within the European Union .
Firstly , I would like to congratulate Mrs Read on this report and on her efforts to come to a common rule in this field of universal service .
I would like to speak up once again about public emergency services .
We know that in Europe there are approximately 1 000 organisations belonging to what we might described as zoos and related parks and so on .
Using Rule 131 to spring surprises on Parliament does not fit in with the mores of the House .
This is unparliamentary behaviour .
It does not fit in with the mores of the House .
The riot threat in 1994 , thankfully , strengthened the country .
Yemen is an extremely poor country in which democracy is still showing considerable gaps .
I would like to thank Mr Pettinari and to voice my respect for his excellent report .
Quite rightly , the Council in Edinburgh blew the whistle on the Commission .
In view of the seriousness of the situation in many zoos , it seems to me that a recommendation would be in order .
In short , an environment existed in which there was plenty of scope for irregularities and fraudulent practices .
The fact that up until now the projects have not been subject to effective evaluation is a serious error .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , I would like to start by also congratulating Mrs Mann on her excellent report .
This concerns first and foremost the choice of projects .
I therefore did not need to submit further amendments , although I intend to support Amendment No 16 by the Christian Democrats .
An experiment has been carried out with this plant , which was funded by the European Commission , in fact , and showed exceptionally good potential .
The necessary instruments for the implementation of the new Community pillar with regards to free movement of people cannot come under the third pillar .
Substantial investments will indeed have to be made , but technically it can all be achieved and it is vital for air quality .
Is the Commission considering binding legislation at European level ?
Some Member States will have some catching up to do if they want to meet these targets .
The packaging directive contains incentives to stay as highly as possible within the waste hierarchy , but real life is often more unmanageable than the theory .
Mr President , it is obvious that the technical system which became operational yesterday , does not function properly , and it is provoking debates which damage the dignity and standing of this House .
But the media does not see us as an important , successful and authoritative Parliament .
( Applause ) Mr President , I asked if I could speak twenty minutes ago ; I pressed the button , and it is still alight , so I can prove it .
Mr President , the Liberal group attaches great importance to respect for international rule of law , and to the opinions and resolutions of the Security Council .
I must confess that it is just a touch embarrassing to note yet again that Europe is deeply divided on this .
A longer term strategy therefore also requires that attention be focused on other countries in the region .
The European citizens , according to the opinion polls , think that the European Union is above all responsible for foreign affairs .
There was certainly none of this clarity in Bosnia .
Mr President , it is a good thing that the European Parliament is defining its position on the Iraq crisis .
Should you threaten violence in a situation like this ?
The Security Council should play a part , but there is a difference of opinion about the interpretation of the UN resolutions on Iraq .
We wish to draw particular attention to two countries , Nigeria and Burma .
As regards Burma , Mr President , there , too , a President who was elected by 80 % of the population was removed by military force .
We do not wish to see a repeat of last year in the next session in Geneva , and we hope that the British Presidency will manage to see to it there is one line , and to see to it that there is tough action , especially as far as the two countries mentioned earlier are concerned
