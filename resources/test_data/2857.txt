On behalf of Portugal 's fishermen and producer organizations , who have been heavily penalized in recent years , I would like to voice an appeal for action without further delay .
Mr President , I would like to offer Mr Aparicio SÃ¡nchez my warmest congratulations on his report .
Firstly , it has become apparent that the absence of a legal foundation in the Treaty - and in the revised Treaty of Amsterdam - for the tourism industry totally rules out or seriously hampers the execution of any programme that seeks to promote or enhance the competitiveness of the sector .
Furthermore , as the rapporteur states , measures are required in connection with the practise of overbooking , both for transport and in the hotel sector .
This type of tourism calls for special attention and appropriate protective measures .
The anticipated rapid expansion of the sector in the coming years will necessarily exacerbate existing problems , with the result that the Union will be required to intervene on several fronts , for instance , in ascertaining that existing directives and regulations are enforced .
Madam President , I would like to begin by stating that I fully agree with Mr Elles ' suggestion that the discharge should be postponed on account of the errors and omissions reported by the Commission in the administration of Community funds .
Moreover , I also consider it appropriate that due account should here be given to the opinion issued by the Council with regard to the matter of the Economic and Social Committee ; it is appropriate that that opinion should be taken into account in the general discharge to be given to the Commission .
Why is it that monetary convergence - which requires sacrifices by so many states - can be implemented , while crime cannot be effectively combatted ?
We share this view and agree that the European Union should not submit proposals that might jeopardize the agreement 's ratification .
Our second point , briefly , relates to the rigorous compliance , application and monitoring of the new legislative framework .
The objective here is to fulfill the principles enshrined in the Treaty by providing the shipbuilding sector with fair and uniform conditions of competition within the Community so that , subsequently , the sector may survive without state aid , in compliance with market rules and conditions .
The United States ' protectionist measures , China 's total freedom to ignore commitments of this type , together with the crossed subsidy mechanisms made possible by the vertical and horizontal composition of the Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders undermine the objectives of achieving uniformity .
If that is not the case , then it should be extended , until at least 31 December 2003 , the date on which this regulation expires .
I say overall , because we do not consider the proposals relating to trade to be satisfactory .
In that connection , we direct attention to our group 's proposals that the overseas countries and territories and the ultra-peripheral regions should be involved .
The post-colonial period should be brought to a close .
I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere support for Commissioner Pinheiro for the intelligence he has shown in presenting and developing the new strategic approach which he proposes for such a very important issue .
Today , the Rocard report not only consolidates Parliament 's earlier guidelines , but it innovates and proposes a number of measures which the Commission will , again , be very pleased to pursue .
Therefore , we must seek alternatives .
We must be realistic , and I feel such realism to be present in the Rocard report , as I previously felt it to be present in the Martens report .
Those who have been present throughout this discussion , particularly during the first reading , will understand how much I regret having to say this .
Therefore , under the competences enshrined in the Treaty , the European Parliament holds virtually exclusive responsibility for this monitoring .
Democratic accountability must also preclude the dictatorship of a monetary policy that is drawn up without regard for other economic policies in general , for each national economy , or for the Community economy , or for its social ramifications .
In Portugal , one of the most controversial and widely discussed subjects is the European Central Bank 's lack of democratic accountability .
European citizens will then know that the European Central Bank will hear and render accounts to those who legitimately represent them in Europe .
Madam President , notwithstanding the serenity mentioned by Commissioner Liikanen , we are aware that the current budgetary process is particularly important and complex .
We welcome the clear request that , regarding Structural Funds , Edinburgh should be respected , and we draw attention to the importance accorded to monitoring execution and to the efficient use of funds .
In this connection , we consider that the proposal of the Committee on Regional Policy , contained in the amendment relating to this point , is much more reasonable .
We are in no doubt that the aim is to contain spending , since the creation of the reserve is explicitly connected with reducing the "burden on taxpayers ' .
The European Parliament has considered this phenomenon , this problem of disasters , with remarkable regularity every month .
According to a note I received today from the Brazilian Embassy , the most recent reports indicate that there are twenty fires burning along a line stretching nearly 400 kilometres .
In our opinion , so far as Amazonia is concerned , there should be an international treaty or agreement involving all the countries of the Amazon , under the auspices of the United Nations , clearly defining a policy of protection and sustained development for the whole of that area .
We do not think
