No religious or cultural practice can be allowed to take precedence over the basic principles of human rights or someone ' s physical and mental integrity , on which European democracy is based .
This must not be compared to male circumcision , where this practice has been adopted in some Member States .
But we also have to take action where the crime of mutilation has already occurred , with penal measures and sanctions .
It seems only reasonable to examine these problems together , as in that way we could succeed in reducing emissions in the most cost-effective way .
On this basis , the Commission in its proposal had calculated for each Member State the ceilings they should achieve by the year 2010 .
The Commission stated in its proposal that at this stage it was unable to set 'final targets ' for critical loads and levels : to achieve a final , long-term objective it was necessary to proceed via some interim target values , which the Commission set for 2001 .
By the time it had reached the conciliation stage all positions were clear , and the Council clearly gave us to understand that it was unable to alter the figures , which it had approved within the framework of a common position .
Approval of the Council ' s common position would have meant that we would have been raising our hands in favour of improving air quality and protecting the health of our citizens .
Indicativeness means the Commission is obliged to reappraise the directive in its reports for 2004 and 2008 , taking account of future scientific and technological developments and hence the possibility of achieving stricter emission limits .
With these investigations it must also be considered to what extent the long-term objectives can be achieved by 2020 .
It was quite an achievement to have this long-term objective included in an Article of the directive , but it was perhaps the most important accomplishment during conciliation .
I would also like to thank Ria Oomen-Ruijten for her excellent show of co-operation during conciliation .
I am grateful for having been involved in tabling the amendments of compromise and that first the rapporteur and then Parliament adopted them .
These amendments are still visible in this directive even after conciliation and , among other things , make possible combined heat and power production , which is essential from the point of view of sustainable development .
That would clearly have meant a step backwards .
National limits for emissions and emissions from large energy plants are matters in which Member States have traditionally looked after their own interests and tried to prevent the setting of targets that could jeopardise the competitiveness of Member States themselves or that of the EU as a whole .
In spite of this , the result can be considered to be an ambitious one .
We still expect the Commission to make several important proposals this autumn to combat climatic change .
The two reports now to be decided on promise good results .
In the face of the facts of climatic change anything less is out of the question .
Commission officials have admitted that Finland has in fact failed to remove the discrimination to any significant degree .
Will the Commission take independent legal action , because waiting for new rulings by the Court of Justice will hardly bring any additional clarity especially after the recent ruling on Portugal (C-393/98) ?
Questions to Commissioner Verheugen Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your efforts .
I feel reassured to hear your answer and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission officials for their work .
The Finns are desperately waiting for those EU rights that they are entitled to and which they were promised .
Mr President , racism is one matter on which there exists a great cultural unanimity : that it is wrong .
We Members of the European Parliament , too , have seen with our own eyes how anti-semitism appears in the form of naked racism in Palestinian textbooks .
The tone of debate was unfair to Israel when account is taken of its past and the obvious desire of hostile States to deny Israel 's very right to exist .
But no solution will be generated by obfuscating facts in one way or the other .
As a friend of the civic society and of NGOs I particularly regret this : by its lack of consideration , this body has weakened its own credibility and future operating prospects .
What , then , should have been discussed ?
And , unfortunately , this is what happened .
The Indian untouchables , for example , made strong efforts to bring up their own plight in the NGO forum on racism .
So , now innovation is to form the basis for know-how - a knowledge-driven economy .
Of course it is true that bureaucracy is one barrier in this work of innovation ; we ought to have programmes which act like fast lanes for innovations - this is the first requirement .
Fourthly , protection of the creative input of employees must be up to scratch , so that barriers to such input do not arise , and the same goes for reward .
Allow me once again to repeat that this creative leadership is very important , and it is not very common .
It would also be a good idea to set up 'innovation banks ' , from which firms and other players could purchase and acquire innovations for practical application , and to which inventors and innovators could transfer them .
Madam President , Commissioner , my colleagues , knowledge and know-how are the basis of economic competitiveness and of the well-being of society as a whole .
As European legislators , we should pay particular attention to simplifying legislation and
