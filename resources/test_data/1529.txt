It is of course very bad that we say to a country that is in such difficulty , a country that in theory could be one of the richest countries in the world and that perhaps one day will be again , that we say to it : ‘No , we can give you 200 million , ’ – although money is always given back by the European Commission at the end of the year – ‘More is out of the question and anyone who asks for more is behaving irresponsibly . ’ Then it seems we are concerned with bookkeeping and not really with the resolution of problems .
Now that this reform is a fact it seems as if the Council , witness its draft budget , does not understand what the said reform actually means for farmers and country people in the European Union .
Madam President , as rapporteur for the agriculture budget I have on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development submitted the following change proposals for the treatment of this first reading .
We would also like EUR 18 million extra to be set aside for the animal diseases emergency fund .     .
Mr Garriga and Mrs Dührkop have expressed their concern about the progress of the codecision procedure on the A 30 lines , etc .
Nonetheless , I think that even in the first reading we must adhere to this principle as far as possible .
As for Mr Kuckelkorn , so far I have been pleased with the satisfactory level of cooperation with regard to the agencies .
So if they themselves say that , then who am I to give them extra money ?
These budget lines must come under development cooperation and not under external relations .
You have already answered a number of other questions I was about to ask .
The Commission therefore takes the view that the provisions of the public service contract directives are applicable to this entity when it awards a contract falling within the scope of these directives and that the environmental impact assessment contract referred to by the honourable Member should have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union .
I am also pleased with the reply he has given , namely that the Commission has declared Spain to be in default by reason of inadequate compliance with the directive on government spending .
I myself am a personal injury lawyer and have myself sustained personal injury in the past .
Nobody benefits from legislation that is not enforceable .
Genital mutilation of women is seen as upholding this tradition .
Murder or mutilation for reasons of honour are seen as a way of maintaining peace within society , and the public stoning or chastising of women is condoned in the context of maintaining the social order .
In addition , the express reference in the Budget that failure to take measures to prevent serious violence against women – and it specifies stoning , public castigation , burning , and rape – justifies the suspension of EU aid .
We are very much looking forward to the document that will eventually be on the table .
There is , in fact , little structure in current policy .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this courageous own-initiative report .
In my experience , it is in the fight against human trafficking , and particularly the fight on behalf of the victims , that this need for a strong women’s policy becomes evident .
You will have to forgive me for being sarcastic , but I can only deplore the fact that it is apparently deemed politically incorrect to call a spade a spade and to penetrate through to the heart of the matter , even when we are dealing with a very complex problem , namely that of the fundamental failure to respect women’s rights in a large part of the world .
Having said this , I can largely identify with Mrs Smet’s report .
Europe should therefore send out a forceful message that our standards and values , such as the giving of equal rights to men and women , are not up for discussion , and neither should they be .
We still have not tackled a number of fundamental problems , though .
Consequently , the institutional quality in those countries will need to be improved as a matter of priority .
However , we need thorough reform , so that the poorer regions can actually make progress .
What irritates me is that we in this House are sometimes inclined to twist things that have been scientifically proven , in order to adapt them to political statements or political sentiments .
Had they read it , they would have seen that a separate category had already been inserted for energy-reduced products .
On that score too , I urge you to be led by independent scientific research in future and be less swayed by the political issues of the day , because that way , I think we will arrive at the best legislation .
Not only the German consumers suffer , all those foreign tourists who , via the German , spend their holidays somewhere in Germany or even further afield , also suffer under the system .
Mr Trittin failed to indicate in so many words that that was his intention , but I would ask you to pull out all the stops .
We are against a restricting deposit system , and the voucher system in Germany does not belong in serious legislation but rather on a fairground , where it entitles you to a few rides on the merry-go-round , but not to do a few laps in Germany .
Everyone can level well-founded criticism at the German deposit
