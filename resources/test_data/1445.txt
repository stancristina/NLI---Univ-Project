This excludes many micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises , as well as smaller associations , institutes and NGOs .
This position has been imposed by the Right , with the complicity of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , which signed the joint resolution ; - the defence of the right of companies to take management decisions aimed at delivering their own economic growth , regardless of the potential social consequences ; - there is no mention of the economic and social impact of relocations , which most often take place with the sole purpose of cutting costs and maximising profits , with factors such as economic viability and productivity playing no part in the decision ; these relocations often fail to respect contractual obligations , yet in the most mercenary fashion the businesses involved enjoy local , national and Community public aid , leaving behind a trail of unemployment and undermining local economies .
I feel , however , that the proposal to set up a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a timely reminder of the scale of the problem , to which we must find far-reaching solutions .
The report should help to demystify the real meaning of the terms ‘pre-emptive war ’ and the ‘fight against terrorism ’ with which the USA and its allies have sought to cloak their attacks on the populations and sovereignty of countries , in breach of international law and human rights .
It is therefore understandable to press ahead with the Commission ’s work , but unreasonable to present unproven hypotheses as conclusions .
Under the ‘Terrorism Finance Monitoring Programme’ the USA has , with the help of a secret agreement , gained access to all financial data stored by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications ( SWIFT) , a cooperative of 8 000 banks and institutions in 200 countries , including the European Central Bank .
I wish to congratulate Mr Lambrinidis on his outstanding report on the strategies and means for the integration of immigrants in the EU , to which I lend my full backing .
Integration is a two-way process .
The report also sidesteps the underlying causes of migration , which are rooted in increasingly deep inequality .
What is needed is a policy that respects people 's right to use the natural resources and to enjoy the production and economic benefits of their country in order to improve their living conditions ; a policy that encourages mutually beneficial cooperation and delivers food sovereignty ; a policy whereby natural resources and the strategic sectors of the economy remain public property and under public control .     .
This ensured that there was a constant flow of information , which meant that the MEPs could achieve more .
Firstly , what is Europe 's actual ability to find a solution , even a partial one , to these problems in the Doha round ?
This , right away , enhances their rights considerably .
This is therefore a fair and timely proposal that should be implemented at the earliest opportunity .
These five Cuban patriots must be released and their convictions overturned .     – When you buy a new car in , for example , Portugal , you have to pay an astronomical registration tax to the government , sometimes nearly half the final cost of the car .
This is indeed the right system , as it will make cars more affordable for the middle and lower classes and will lead to a more rapid renewal of the stock of cars on the road , which makes sense from the point of view of both the environment and road safety .
It merely worsens the quality of the cars we drive .
As Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report correctly points out , and I take this opportunity to commend the rapporteur , what we need is a sustained , long-term financial framework that will deliver prevention for the Member States and enable them to use up-to-date , appropriate technical resources to protect our coasts from spills , such as those that have happened in the recent past .
This is a project which , with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and others , has our full backing , not least because it reinforces the idea that the Member States have a shared responsibility in this joint effort .
Consequently , solidarity must be shown with the communities affected , urgent support must be provided for pastoralists and farmers who have lost their cattle-grazing land in , for example , the Serra de Soajo , and burnt wood must be removed immediately as fair payment for farmers , small forest owners and those sharing common land .
The tragedy of the fires is still affecting a number of Member States this year , although it appears that Spain is currently the worst affected , with countless human tragedies , including loss of life , and economic and environmental losses that cannot be quantified .
I was the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , which formulated some 30 proposals with a view to adopting a European strategy , which was aimed at achieving the objectives of reducing the impact of natural disasters to a minimum via the creation of new measures and ensuring that the various existing political and financial instruments operate coherently .
Natural disasters cannot be avoided , yet precautions can be taken right now by complying with the Kyoto Protocol and by setting out an appropriate forestry policy .
The Commission must adopt the proposals put forward by Parliament .     . – I took part in Parliament’s Electoral Observation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The EU’s involvement in the DRC since the terrible war that devastated the country has been the best example of the implementation on the ground of Europe 's security doctrine : humanitarian and development aid , technical support for demobilising
