However , groundwater is one of our most important resources .
As has been mentioned , it will complement the Water Framework Directive .
We nevertheless agree with this law , even if it is not necessary for us .
The problem with the aquifers on the Iberian Peninsula is often to do with seawater .
We on the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy managed to draw up a statement in a congenial atmosphere , for which I thank my colleagues .
This directive is needed .
It affects our quality of life , it affects agriculture , and it affects human happiness and health .     Mr President , the revision of the bathing water directive is very important , as has already been mentioned here .
For example , from the point of view of recreational activity , if we are talking about a seaside area where hundreds of people go boating , for example , that is quite a different matter from a 50 kilometre-long river in Lapland where canoes are used .
We must therefore react to it in an appropriate manner .
I myself come from a country where there are 187 888 lakes .
Consequently , it is important , both as far as common sense is concerned and from the point of view of the environment , that we focus on the objectives , but leave the means for achieving them to the Member States .
In my country , that will mean reducing the administrative burden on the authorities without quality control suffering as a result .
Tightening the deadline from 2015 to 2011 will be problematic because of the timetables for the implementation of the water framework directive .
The same problem applies to the standardisation of values for coastal waters and fresh waters .
There are scientific criteria for the different values , and they do not increase the risk to bathers .
If the ‘sufficient ’ category is not adopted , there is a danger that the entire project will fail in the Council .
Our policy all along has been ambitious and one that advocates public participation .
Consequently , as the meeting in Almaty approaches , we will likewise work on the assumption that the matter at hand – the subject of biosafety – will be debated in the same spirit , with a respect for the rights of the citizen .
The Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers plays its part in helping to reduce pollution and promote sustainable development .
The purpose of applying the principles of Aarhus is to persuade public authorities and citizens to take individual and collective responsibility for environmental protection and improvement , so that the welfare of present and future generations can be ensured .
For that reason , my political group does not think it is right that these wide-ranging rights of the citizen should be abused where an appeal is concerned , with the aim of slowing down projects on purpose or providing a forum for fund-raising campaigns organised by NGOs .
Such abuses also undermine the rights we set out to defend .
Some time ago , an article in the British magazine , , expressed astonishment at decision-makers who view the warnings of climate researchers with indifference .
We will also need to involve major economically developing countries , such as China and India .
Above all , however , it is the biggest polluter , the United States of America , which ought to recognise its responsibility .
The industrialised countries have to acknowledge their historical responsibility for the fact that climate change has begun generally , and , accordingly , it is we who have the main responsibility to cut emissions .
The rules of the World Trade Organisation make this possible .
The north-eastern states are starting to engage in carbon dioxide emissions trading , and want to be part of the European Union emissions trading scheme .
This is a tough statement , I readily admit .
It should be borne in mind , however , that no one is being condemned to having sanctions imposed on them here : we are simply proposing that the possibility should be investigated for the future .
I therefore ask whether we should not take the step that would make free-riding impossible and uncomfortable .
That makes Kyoto ineffective and causes the distortion of competition and carbon leakage .
Not even the EU , however , will be safe from my WTO amendment , if it does not succeed in fulfilling its commitments .
Nine of the fifteen old Member States have exceeded their own Kyoto targets by more than 20 % .
Unless we can think of something radical , there is a danger that we too will have to recognise the hopelessness of the situation .     Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Bini Smaghi on his nomination .
However , I have some comments .
Mr Bini Smaghi seems to imply that the pact’s own rigidities led to certain Member States breaking its rules and that the politics of the SGP made sensible economics impossible .
I would remind Mr Bini Smaghi that without effective rules that are equally applicable to all , the EU would be nothing but a loose grouping with weak powers of coordination .
They should be based on genuinely open mechanisms of selecting nominees .
The present system too often seems to favour automatic entry for candidates from big eurozone Member States at the direct expense of smaller ones .
This is truly regrettable and potentially damaging in the long run .
The purpose of the directive is to remove the factors restricting the free movement of people and services between the countries of the European Union .
The professional needs to show that he or she has the adequate level of
