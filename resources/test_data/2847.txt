the Council which the latter should take on board and heed .
Stressing the coordination of efforts and experiences is insufficient to tackle our societies ' principal problem .
I believe the greatest possible emphasis ought to be given to the subject of local and regional authority cooperation , in application of the principle of subsidiarity , since this may go some way to solving the problem of unemployment and job creation .
In the future , we will have to improve assessment of the impact of regional policies on employment , seek new indicators and , if necessary , reform the Structural Funds in order to maximize their potential , simplify procedures , and focus resources and objectives .
We therefore need to make an extra effort to reduce these disparities .
If this is not the case , if we were to confuse social policy with structural policy , we would reach a conclusion which I wish to avoid in future debates and in debates on forthcoming financial developments , and it is this : that appraisals of unemployment concentrating on major towns and cities , on major towns and cities in prosperous countries , are capable of attracting the greater part of investment in Structural Funds .
Unemployment with the specific characteristics it assumes within the European Union is a unique problem .
We are already competitive on many markets .
I would like to end my contribution by asking you to continue cooperating with governments to achieve the objectives set out and would also call upon all of us to continue the work of making the public more aware of why we are undertaking a project of such historic proportions .
A review of the conditions of application of the Funds would entail changes in their use , perhaps moving them away from major infrastructural investments in order to focus more on work which is economically productive , human resources and local employment initiatives .
To this end , the primary objective of Community structural policy must clearly not be direct or indirect job creation , since this is a long-term policy , but rather the consolidation of competitive economies through the improvement of infrastructures , the environment , research , etc .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as the construction of a citizens ' Europe is one of our prime objectives , Mr Herzog 's report on the participation of citizens and social players in the European Union 's institutional system undoubtedly represents an important contribution towards that objective .
As regards information , the attention drawn by the rapporteur to its principal dimension , policy assessment , is important .
This Parliament should know that we are now agreed on the urgent procedure , but we are agreed on it in order to reject the Commission 's proposal .
This is what happened , in part , in 1996 , when there were some gaps , which I shall briefly point out , in the interinstitutional programme we are now assessing .
We believe that the structural policies must be extended in order to enhance the effectiveness of the drive for greater cohesion , as regards both regional development and research , transport , the environment , industry and the single market .
It would have been better not to cut the funds assigned for job creation , Objectives 2 , 3 and 4 of the structural funds and internal policies .
If one day - and we hope it never comes - someone takes an initiative which means a real cutback in Category 2 , then that person should know that the European Parliament will be against it .
We have made no progress towards solving the eternal problem of classifying compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure .
This is something which goes well beyond figures and technicalities and even support for national austerity policies .
I would also like to say , on behalf of Spanish socialists , that , just as we unhesitatingly supported German unification at the time , so shall we also be ready to support European union without hesitation when the time comes .
In my view it is ridiculous to think that a dozen countries with a per capita income of less than half the present Community average can be incorporated on the basis of 1.27 % of gross domestic product of a Community whose per capita GDP will be reduced by the actual enlargement process .
In my view this is of great importance , since the Commission 's document appears to be the chosen option , a development of the 92 reform approach .
Commissioner , thank you for your reply ; I am pleased to note that the Commission shares the Council 's common position which , as you say , is consistent with the trend of events between the Madrid and Florence European Councils .
These are the principles set out in the common position , which very clearly links any progress in relations between the European Union and Cuba to a scrupulous respect for and improvement in human rights and fundamental freedoms .
It is on these grounds , therefore , that we believe the most sensible procedure would be a global reconsideration of this proposal .
All of this is a crystal-clear abuse of an exclusive and dominant position reinforced by government actions and a situation which requires the European Commission to ask exactly what is going on .
Madam President , I also have to commend Mr Desama for the very reason that I was a witness , a very direct witness , of the efforts he has put in to achieve this common position and , as he has so correctly stated , this common position is a good thing - it is a good thing on account of the work done by a great many people in this House .
