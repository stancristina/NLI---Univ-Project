I have a group of Canadian members of parliament coming to the next part-session in Strasbourg .
I will have to take a decision on Monday as to whether they will be travelling to Strasbourg or Brussels .
Bearing in mind the French position on the precautionary principle , can a decision be taken rather sooner than a fortnight on where we will be meeting next month ?
Madam President , I rise on the same point of order as my colleague , Mr Sturdy .
It is essential that this Parliament should show by example and precept that it follows the same standards that it imposes upon everybody else .
It imposes standards on beef in Britain and cheese in France and it must follow the same example in relation to its own conduct .
I am perfectly prepared , in an extreme situation , to die for my country and my family .
I am not prepared to die from legionnaire 's disease because I have to sit in Strasbourg in June .
Therefore we should do something about it now and not just talk about it .
Madam President , it is all very well Mr Poos saying that the Quaestors asked for the air quality check .
I understand that the staff asked for an air quality check before this building was opened .
I asked for an air quality check in January .
Why has it taken so long to get that air quality check ?
Usually , in a lot of countries , if legionella bacteria is found in any part of a building , that building is closed .
Madam President , I rise under Rule 126( 3 ) so that I might question whether a quorum exists for this vote .
Despite the unprecedented presence of some French Members , my assessment is that Fridays in Strasbourg do not function properly and effectively for this Parliament and we should transfer more of our parliamentary work to the capital city , Brussels .
Madam President , I just wanted to correct what Mr Posselt said .
He said that he did not think there was a quorum on the vote on Mrs Buitenweg 's report .
By my calculations , 242 people voted on that report including about 35 Members of the PPE , and they should be congratulated on supporting that excellent report yesterday .
Madam President , should these reports be serious then they certainly deserve a quorum .
What I will do is to press my point of order .
Madam President , on the same point of order that Mr Duff raised earlier , the roll-call vote has just shown that we are not quorate , so therefore , under the same rules , I would like to ask for the quorum to be established and I call on Members to support me by standing .
( 19 Members rose ) President .
The request is withdrawn .
Relating to Amendment No 10
I have been up in my room just now , and it is little surprising that Fridays are so devalued .
The television technicians have gone home , so the television pictures are of the Assembly and no longer of the original speakers .
The staff are apparently running for the exits from 9 a.m. on Friday mornings , so it is hardly surprising that Fridays are being devalued .
I would ask you to check that the whole service of Parliament is available so long as the House is sitting .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on today 's fisheries reports , both of which I am sure will receive the overwhelming acceptance of this House and both of which are extremely important in terms of protection and conservation of fishery resources .
I welcome the Commission 's updating of the regulation on the protection of juveniles .
We all know that sustainable development is a learning process and we must be able to update and adapt existing legislation to protect our fish stocks .
I have paid particular attention to scientific advice which indicates the requirement for the closure of fisheries for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland .
This does not just concern the maintenance of sand eel stocks themselves , but the preservation of the entire ecosystem in these localities .
The low breeding rate of the kittiwake that Mr Busk referred to is of particular concern .
I am also happy to note , as Mr Busk confirmed , that Denmark as a Member State principally concerned with sand eel fishery has accepted these measures .
However , while these measures will hopefully contribute to improving the state of fishery resources , I am concerned that the Commission has not got it right in certain other areas : for example , in the recent report on the implementation of MAGPs and the drastic cuts that it calls for in some fleets which is of grave concern to Scots and other fishermen .
I would like to ask the Commission if they have really looked at whether cutting fleet sizes actually improves the conservation of fisheries .
I quote from the Commission 's own document which says : " The Scientific , Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries found no evidence that stocks had , in general , deteriorated or improved since the adoption of MAGP4 ."
Surely we must question the effectiveness of MAGPs as a conservation measure .
The Commission also failed to take into account how fleet sizes are reduced .
I call for a more thorough investigation by the Commission into this .
In those states which have , on paper at least , been complying with MAGPs such as Spain and Portugal , what has happened to the vessels which are removed from the register ?
How many would be decommissioned ?
How many were scrapped ?
How many were sunk and
