the mode of infection of which is not adequately known and the testing of which so far is only possible after the symptoms have developed .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted a position that allows both of these objectives to be met .
One important aspect of this view is the whole-herd slaughter on a farm where disease has been discovered .
At the same time , we must , of course , ensure that the breeder receives proper compensation for his livestock .
This objective has now been met in the Committee report - in a slightly different , but nevertheless satisfactory manner .
This in itself is acceptable , but we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a technology which is continually being developed .
Mr President , in my opinion , the supplementary question by Mr Purvis was most pertinent , since recently the need for increased economic cooperation amongst the EMU countries has been justified by precisely this weakening of the value of the euro in relation to the US dollar .
The reason for the dollar becoming stronger in comparison to the euro is simply that the national economy of the USA is stronger than that of the euro countries .
I would like to ask the Commissioner firstly , whether the Commission admits that the weakening of the euro that has been much thrashed out in public , is a consequence of the infrastructural problems and lack of dynamism of the EU economy , particularly in relation to the USA , and whether he really believes that the kind of Keynesian action as proposed by Mrs Frahm would be the cure for this weakening of the euro , and whether he believes that the Commission will achieve better results in this matter , when the national governments of France and Germany have actually proceeded in the totally opposite direction , and their actions have weakened even further the competitiveness of the euro area .
Mr President , Commissioner , my question does not concern the timetable ; instead I would like to ask a question regarding a principle of enlargement .
I would further like to ask , whether the Commission shares the view that this kind of arrangement , along the lines of the EEA agreement , could considerably reduce the costs of enlargement and promote the economic development of the applicant countries .
Commissioner , I just want to clarify matters as there seems to be very bad interpretation - I was not talking about the Charter of Fundamental Rights but about the Social Charter including the rights of workers .
These include working conditions which I think are a corollary to the movement of services .
What are the conditions under which people are working ?
) Mr President , I would first like to congratulate Mr Savary on his drafting of such excellent reports .
My group supports improvement of the competitiveness of railways and liberalisation of competition .
The rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach .
Technical solutions can vary a great deal .
Existing differences between national railway systems will make necessary some exceptions in the harmonisation of railway systems , so that no Member State shall have to face inordinate difficulties and so that current railway transport will not be jeopardised .
It applies to Finland in particular , but some of the applicant countries will be faced with the same problem in connection with enlargement of the Union .
Russia is hardly about to change its standards in order to comply with the requirements of the Union .
Russian wagons account for approximately 40 % - almost a half - of Finnish freight transport .
The reason for this high percentage is that we do not want to take the risk of sending Finnish wagons to Russia , since experience shows that they are so very rarely returned .
This proposal is very good , but the solution remains half-finished , as far as Finland is concerned .
This is why we have tabled an amendment of Article 7 , which simply aims at making it possible to use third country freight wagons for traffic , as long as they do not cross the border between two Member States .
The dynamism and desired growth of the European economy will not come about by creating Union-wide integrated programmes , whether they be applied with good intentions in the area of training or entrepreneurship or whether they be common support systems for the benefit of SME organisations .
I also have my personal doubts about the superiority of a European scientific community , if it is to be created from above , i .e . by the volition of the Commission and the Council , and not allowed to develop naturally through networking between the scientific communities , from one business or university to another ; financing , both at a national and European level , must naturally be secured .
At present , European dynamism will be improved by dismantling top-level structures , for example , barriers to trade , which are still hindering the creation of a genuine internal market .
Recently , the neutrality of the Communities ' competition policy has been called into question - justifiably so - inter alia in the case of Volvo-Scania .
In this context , I would like to ask what kind of plans , if any , the Council has regarding these practical arrangements .
The report on Parliament ' s financial administration , in which all political groups were criticised for having channelled parliamentary appropriations into European political parties also , did not take into account the fact , for example , that the office of the Party of European Socialists is situated within the European Parliament buildings , whereas my own group , the PPE , received a great deal of criticism despite the fact that our Party office is situated away from the European Parliament ' s services
