In order that this goal may be achieved , it will be necessary to pay particular attention to involving the relevant networks of national representatives , who are to perform a supporting role in transposing and implementing European law , and also to make use of the monitoring instruments still at our disposal .
This is something else that we should take into account and incorporate into progress reports of this kind , enabling them to show what is lacking and where changes still have to be made where equal opportunities policy is concerned .
Rather than having discussions about disabled people , we discussed things with them .

The Commission ’s new initiative for growth , the sixty-two projects in which are expected to be signed off by the Summit , deals precisely with this area .
With this proposal for harmonising the taxation of diesel fuel used for commercial purposes , the Commission has taken a courageous step in the right direction , one in which the lead committee was not prepared to join it , thus ignoring the recommendations in its favour in the opinions of the advisory committees .
Are diesel cars not urgently needed to bring about a reduction in CO2 emissions ?
In the proposal for a directive , the Commission has also referred to the sharp increase in the number of privately owned diesel cars and regretted the revenue lost to the Member States’ budgets .
It could also mean a great idea running into the buffers .
We also wish to voice our outrage at the criminals in Istanbul and convey our respects and sympathy to the families and survivors there .

I based my criticisms on an agency report , according to which you had given a recommendation to a party political list in Italy , and that is not compatible with your role as President of the European
