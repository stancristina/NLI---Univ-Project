First may I thank Commissioner Lamy for his strategy on this issue .
We recommend reducing fishing efforts , by which I mean the number of days at sea , wherever necessary , i .e . where stocks are endangered .
The second problem in the Mediterranean , as you quite rightly said , is that the Mediterranean is fished both by Community ships and by those of other countries bordering it .
According to the notifications received by the Commission , these terms were met or the Irish Government stated that it would meet them .
Any agreements over and above that which the Mauritanian Government concludes with other countries or private individuals are beyond our control .
All these stocks are managed with TACs and quotas based on scientific reports from the ICES.
Mr President , my dear Madam , I quite agree that jobs done by women are very important in the fisheries sector , and not just in processing .
Madam President , I am slightly confused ; I had five minutes ' speaking time at the beginning and obviously said a great deal .
It is a pretty poor show on our part to say to the consumer that this 1 % does not need to be labelled , unless the company has acted maliciously and did not label intentionally or cannot submit the evidence .
Consumers must be able to decide what they put on the table for themselves and for that we need labelling .
This report sends out a misleading message , not just to the Member States of the EU , especially Ireland , but also to the accession countries .
Mrs van Lancker has abided very closely by these specifications and has presented a whole host of best practices in her report , the most important being proper education on responsible sexual conduct , on which we need careful guidance by experts , with the Member States providing full coverage by professional advice centres .
So that clear , unequivocal and straightforward applications can be submitted .
In other words , networks of excellence , joint European research area , yes , but not in the form of some sort of collaboration which cannot be properly quantified .
In early obedience , as it were , to the vote which , I assume , will be a large majority in favour .
I also understand why it wants to encourage projects , networks of excellence , integrated projects etc . which are as big as possible and presumably this will also be the future of the European research programme .
If so , what action are you minded to take ?
I fully agree with you that our aim has to be to admit ten countries : Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Slovenia and , of course , Cyprus and Malta .
It is of course precisely the Nordic countries - Finland , Sweden , but also and in particular Denmark - who lead the way here .
Recently I read that he sits with the Christian Democrat Group at their conference .
My question concerns the recent American initiative .
I hope that is not currently the case , Prime Minister , but that you see me as a Liberal and as a friend , a trusted friend who is also able to tell you a few truths .
That was not a question ; it was a campaign speech !
That is also why a number of things will have to be checked , for example with a country like Poland there will have to be a discussion about whether the central bank will have to remain independent or not .
This can only be a reference to his private life .
If you are going to refer to Jean Monnet , Mr Rasmussen , then I have to tell you to apply Monnet 's method .
That is why it contradicts the fundamental principles laid down by Adenauer , Schuman and de Gasperi , fundamental principles which have made this EU of ours what it is today and what it ought to remain .
I wish to make it absolutely clear that abortion must not be elevated to the preferred means of birth control .
However , the " Everything but Arms " policy must not be over-estimated .
A law which does not apply to the strong is extremely problematical .
I would urge you , Mr President-in-Office and Commissioner Byrne , to take this point very seriously .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Haarder for his reply .
This is why the amendments before us - and I hope that the Commission will not take this amiss - propose , among other things , that as things stand at present , the article on the Commission and commitology should simply be deleted from the Commission 's proposal , for we still do not regard the arrangements regarding commitology as adequate and satisfactory .
The segment directives should simply state that we need this or that declaration of conformity , or that we need a type-examination , or that we just need specific checks to be carried out by the manufacturer .
My final point is that anti-racism as it is defined here would mean achieving tangible improvements in migrants ' living conditions .
The resulting job losses do not only affect the individual workers ; they also have an impact on economic and social cohesion in the region as a whole .
We welcome the fact that venture capital investments no longer fall within the EU merger control arrangements .
However , three Member States have yet to complete their internal procedures to ratify the Agreement .
