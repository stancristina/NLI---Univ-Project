The most important task aid agencies have is to make themselves unnecessary , all the while ensuring that the work is leading to local action and prosperity .
My colleague , Mr Wijkman , has produced a good report in this respect , one that emphasises this paradigm that is the only successful and morally tenable one .
The EU' s framework programmes do not extend to developing countries .
But why not ?
We must give more responsibility , by way of funding , to local researchers to be able to create development that will be of benefit to the local community and leave the job to them when the financiers have left .
Mr President , Commissioner , reforming the directive on annual inspections of commercial vehicles is both urgent and vital .
The rapporteur has adopted a perfectly good position in this issue , in the final analysis .
Roadside spot checks are also necessary because heavy goods vehicles from non-member countries often enter the area of the Union in bad condition , presenting a serious risk to safety .
This should not , however , slow down the prompt implementation of the directive .
The drivers of thirty-three of them received fines , and sixteen received a warning .
A considerable number of the vehicles in bad condition were from non-member countries .
The worst case was a Polish truck with no brakes in the drawing vehicle , a poorly secured load , and a trailer whose brakes were badly leaking .
Our group supports Amendment No 3 and hopes the new version of the directive will come into force promptly .
The motion proposes the introduction of spot checks , as vehicles have to be deemed roadworthy between tests too .
The damage caused by lorries in traffic accidents is , more often than not , considerable and the state of vehicles is very patchy in different parts of Europe , so pan-European legislation and strict compliance with it will be of benefit to each and every person on the road .
Being from East Karelia , I know that even if they had one light and the wheel brakes on one side working , it would be something .
The Council ' s common position will improve road safety considerably , and the directive should enter into force as soon as possible .
Enlightenment is a good thing , but , unfortunately , only proper penalties have an effect on hypocrites .
We can never assume too much responsibility when it comes to human life .
I hope that this position will be retained in tomorrow ' s sitting , as it will be vitally important if we wish to avoid confusion with the many various schemes in respect of fundamental rights .
If , however , we were to examine what a citizen of the European Union today can actually do , how much he or she can influence the decision-making process , we would see that there are not so many opportunities to do so .
Citizens can mainly stand as candidates in elections and vote in another EU country .
Why , for example , could we not take up the notion that a certain number of citizens - let us say from three different EU countries - could formulate a citizens ' initiative that then could be channelled though the European Parliament ?
Unfortunately , not everyone sees the matter in this way , and , in my opinion , we can see an unnecessary conflict between the rights of women and those of families , which people try to accommodate by rejecting the family instead of seeking a radically new and egalitarian European policy on the family .
That is why the theme is tiresome to so many .
However , I believe that it would be a big mistake for the European Parliament to approve of this sort of trend .
Like many others , the Christian Democrats want a society where freedom and responsibility meet halfway .
Its bosom is too cold and its arm too short .
Social development with that end in sight still takes place in the family .
Family rights and protection that have been provided for in legislation elsewhere in this respect should be reproduced in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
My question , however , concerns concrete matters and the substance of this agreement .
I would like to ask whether it is a question of the Chinese not being prepared to accord us the same negotiating status as they did the US representatives or why we should not be able to achieve consensus on the remaining - the tail end - 20 % .
To be able to act sensibly and correctly we have to bear in mind something that has already been spoken of here , which is to say the waste hierarchy : the prevention of waste , recycling , the exploitation of its energy-producing potential through incineration , and its final treatment .
I also hope there is support for the proposal that was very much endorsed by the Committee to facilitate the incineration of waste produced by the paper and cellulose industry at the production site .
This waste is an important energy source not only for the industrial plants themselves but also for the surrounding community .
However , in those countries where the recycling of waste is reasonably well established , such as Finland , and where they know what is being incinerated where , tighter controls will not improve the state of the environment ; on the contrary , it might make it worse , as the incineration of waste will be prevented in small incineration plants and transportation will increase .
Mr President , the directive on the incineration of waste is well intended but I think those responsible for preparing it have gone into
