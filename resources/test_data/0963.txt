We are concerned not only with government , but with the consumer as well .
Each country is given the right to take its own decisions , but we have a single European market and so it is not really possible any longer for each country to reach decisions in isolation without that having repercussions , so perhaps the wording of the revised Treaty or the communication which the Commissioner has announced might provide something rather more positive than we have at present .
And what does the Commission do ?
Who is to say , Commissioner , that social benefits cannot be provided just as well by private insurance ?
Take this report .
Preparations for the fifth framework programme are already well under way .
This says that Member States need to shift the burden of labour costs on to other factors .
But when is the definitive system going to happen ?
Mr President , since 1980 there have been a number of steps towards a Community driving licence , all of them aimed at better road safety and freedom of movement for individuals within the Union .
Mr President , there have been a number of Commission proposals in recent times aimed at improving safety at sea .
I also applaud the importance he attaches to rules on working and rest periods , working conditions , training , safety inspections by classification societies and so on .
So it will take a lot of persuasion to get the national Member States on board , financially as well .
In my country the Minister for Economic Affairs has calculated that a third of jobs in Belgium come from start-up companies and a third from creative initiatives on the part of existing companies .
Because the Socialist Group does not see local initiatives as an alternative to trans-European networks , although we sometimes have difficulties with the nondescript colour of many proposals , but as a necessary complement to these trans-European networks and we hope that they will have a rather better chance of completion than the TENs with their long and painful progress so far .
We need a European programme of action , a coherent programme , a global programme which is equipped with European instruments .
And my big question is this : how are the PHARE funds being used ?
What influence has Mr Monti over the way in which PHARE funds are used ?
A number of experts gave the lie to that yesterday before the selfsame committee of inquiry .
Certainly the Visegrad countries must be helped , for example by the launch of projects , good training projects of which PHARE is one .
A number of questions occur to me , following on from the earlier questions .
Be that as it may , it is extremely important that we should decide on our position on the Bioethics Convention as a whole .
Rules 89 and 90 set out more detailed procedures for the accession of new Member States and international agreements .
If you approve this proposal by the required two-thirds majority , Parliament will be helping to make its procedures more transparent for the press and for the public .
It is high time that the Member States started talking about what the right of association means in the European context , now that multinational military forces are being set up and Europe 's defence policy is set to develop further .
Fortunately , a great deal has already been achieved in the social field , and it makes sense to establish clear objectives for the many social problems in our society .
In February this year , Parliament delivered its opinion on a package of measures proposed by the Commission relating to inland waterway transport .
On the subject of liberalization , the Council agreed with the Commission 's original proposal for the gradual abolition of the system of chartering by rotation by 1 January 2000 .
Our reasoning here is that because the inland waterway transport sector is made up of a large number of small firms , fluctuations in the market caused by new investment could easily result in overcapacity once again .
Aid and scrapping schemes are all well and good , we all support inland waterway transport , it is environmentally-friendly , it offers plenty of capacity , there are new facilities for containers and storage , port installations , inland ports and so on , all absolutely fine .
It is perfectly clear that the inland waterways can and must play an important role in our long-term transport policy .
Will Parliament be involved ?
To avoid any unnecessary correspondence , I would ask Mr van den Broek to take the matter up with Mr Kinnock and ask him to read our letters once again .
I would remind you of one of the main points made in the report by the high-level group of experts set up by the Commission , namely that the biggest problem with the whole of the information society which we are busy creating is how to ensure that the benefits are shared fairly , and the need for the authorities to be actively involved in the market on a regular basis .
Small and medium-sized firms too must be able to compete in the new developments , because this is where new jobs lie .
The Liberal Group believes that our main task should be to give our citizens the best possible preparation for this , through education and training , through continuing education from primary school onwards , and by setting an example ourselves .
One final point : governments are being confronted for the first time with communications technology on a worldwide scale , and they therefore need to show restraint when it comes to legislation .
Firstly , the Liberals also support a dual system which has a strong public service broadcasting sector providing
