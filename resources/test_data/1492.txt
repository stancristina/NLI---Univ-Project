The Commission supports these efforts .
For the rest , I think we will also come to an agreement with Mrs Lulling to push for reference to be made to 'assisting life partners ' as well as spouses in every passage of the Commission text , rather than leaving it open to interpretation .
In that context , between 1988 and 2002 legislators discussed a Commission proposal aimed at regulating the working time not only of employee drivers , but also of the self-employed .
As a result of that discussion , the sectoral directive on the working time of mobile workers was adopted .
Among other things , these rules provide for the use of the digital tachograph , an extremely reliable monitoring device , and a specific implementing directive .
Lastly , it is very important to point out that the application of working time rules to self-employed drivers is ineffectual and very difficult to achieve , since these drivers do not have to record their working time for salary purposes , not to mention the fact that the administrative costs of applying such rules would be very high .
Large numbers of people are injured or permanently disabled .
For me it is completely incomprehensible that this regulation should only apply to drivers who are employed by others and are not self-employed .
It is in fact very difficult to control any kind of self-employed worker , artisan or small entrepreneur .
This will fill the legal vacuum created following the ruling by the Court of Justice annulling Framework Decision No 2005/667 , which established the nature , type and level of criminal penalties for the illegal discharge of polluting substances at sea .
I thus believe we can say today we are happy to be sending out a message on reducing the pollution of our seas .
Mr President , honourable Members , the Commission takes note of the position expressed today by the European Parliament and , in view of the commitments made before this House , the Commission will draw the most appropriate conclusions from today 's negative vote , also taking into account the Council 's position .
This definition should therefore be adapted ' ; 2 ) replacement of Recital 5 with another requiring the source of the meat to be monitored in order to inform and guarantee transparency to the consumer ; 3 ) maintenance of the cold method as the only protective treatment . draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as draftsman of the opinion , I would particularly like to say something about the amendments to the EGAF , the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , and express my appreciation for the Commission 's proposal over the agreement reached with Parliament at first reading .
The last meeting between the Commission and the competent national authorities was held at the beginning of December last year , in other words a few weeks before the Court of Justice 's decision .
I can therefore assure you of my commitment as Commissioner .
This decision has therefore led to the creation of a new airline model , what ought to be the airline of the future : no more state companies but fully privatised companies .
All my efforts as Commissioner for Transport have been directed towards supporting this form of transport and it comes as no surprise that we are again discussing a question , the matter of slots , that aims to prevent the airline situation from worsening in this time of crisis : this also means seeking to reduce job losses , in other words to contain employment levels within the European Union in the air transport sector .
The coordinator Mrs van Miert has been monitoring the project since 2005 , I believe with positive results .
Most of the 831 km stretch between Strasbourg and Vienna - more specifically the Strasbourg-Stuttgart and Linz-Vienna sections - will be complete by 2015 .
The Stuttgart-Ulm section , which represents the most significant bottleneck , will be complete by 2020 .
I wanted to give you some other news because you are particularly interested in the Strasburg-Vienna section .
For this reason , Commissioner , we can only oppose the introduction of new wine production practices that have been dreamed up and have nothing to do with the science of winemaking , because we believe that they can lead to a deterioration in the image of wine and detract from the relationship of trust between consumer and products , with severe consequences for quality and perhaps even for health .
As cosignatory of this question , I emphasise that lowering the quality of production - which is the outcome of centuries of tradition and research , huge investments , passion and attention to detail - is not the answer we need , particularly at this time of economic crisis , when the average consumer is certainly paying more attention to price than to what is written on the label .
I believe that we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have done an excellent job .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during the trialogue of 2 April , an agreement was finally reached between Parliament and the Czech Presidency .
In the rural development sector , the Commission measure proposes the introduction of appropriate updates to Council Regulation No 1698/2005 that are designed to implement the guidelines of the said European plan .
It is therefore crucial to guarantee the use of available Community funds , increasing their effectiveness and added value .
The amended directive would eliminate the discretion the Member States have over their own funds , which would hinder the harmonisation of supervisory and fair competition practices between banks .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during this term , Parliament , especially under your presidency , has reinforced its ability to make a
