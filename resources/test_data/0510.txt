According to the Commission , part of that deficit can be made up by rationalising and redistributing the existing workforce .
I would like to express great appreciation of the rapporteur ' s really excellent and influential work , and the same appreciation applies to the proposals from the heads of delegations , which extend that solution to all the institutions of the Union .
While not wishing in any way to interfere in the sovereign decisions of the Irish people , I am personally deeply saddened by the outcome of the referendum .
They have told us so in the most democratic way possible - by voting - but they have also told us so by not voting , revealing the indifference and confusion they feel about the issue .
The Commission is ready to make an active contribution to this structure .
This is the core of the European model of society which we want to build and preserve for future European generations : if we do not do this it will be difficult to integrate Europe .
As regards transport policy , we intend to break the link between economic growth and the indiscriminate growth in road transport .
Moving on to my second subject : enlargement .
I have never ceased to stress that enlargement is our historic duty : the duty of my Commission , of course , but also , in my view , the duty of Parliament .
We are scrupulously following the road map drawn up last year and endorsed at Nice , and I am pleased to report that excellent progress has been made .
These are undoubtedly complex areas , but it is now clear that , in some cases , transitional periods will help to overcome some of the difficulties .
The Members of this House have the crucial task of reassuring the citizens , explaining the problems calmly and objectively but also explaining the great benefits they will draw from the project to unify Europe .
I want us to think in terms of a continent-wide Community of peaceful nations , consisting of the enlarged European Union and all its new neighbours , increasingly sharing common values and objectives .
I am confident that you share my vision of that future and I am equally confident that Gothenburg will enable us to take significant steps towards making that vision a reality .
There is nothing left to analyse : studies have been carried out and they show that the planet is in danger and that it is therefore necessary to act and do so quickly .
Lastly , Madam President , I would just like to say a few brief words about the agencies .
Mr President , yesterday afternoon , an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was held to discuss the serious implications of the referendum which has just taken place in Ireland .
This should be entrusted to a convention which , thanks to the participation of the national parliaments and the European Parliament , can guarantee the kind of transparency and complete legitimacy that have been missing until now .
However , because it is our duty to involve the peoples of Europe , I feel that an initial stage should be also envisaged in the reform process in which the European Parliament , the national parliaments , the governments and the Commission work together to prepare for the 2003 Intergovernmental Conference .
Firstly , I am extremely pleased to see that Parliament has taken the will expressed by the Irish people very seriously , not just because it is representative - although the turnout was not very high - of the wishes of an entire people but also because it represents the wishes of an entire country .
Our duty is not to make exceptions for some countries : our duty will be to apply the rules to small and large countries alike , for the Commission 's duty is to be the guardian of the interests of all the European peoples and countries .
The Commission is working on it , it is analysing the possibility and feasibility of introducing such a tax , which will have to replace existing taxes and will not be an additional burden of any kind for the European citizens .
Finally , we must also take the lesson of the Irish referendum and the subsequent deliberations to heart .
( Parliament agreed to take into consideration the oral amendment ) Oral amendments to paragraph 40
Europe is different , and we must ensure that it is built by the elected representatives of the people , by an ad hoc body which is close to the citizens and young people , in particular .
Many pensioners and elderly people who are members of the Pensioners ' Party , of which I have the honour of being the representative to Parliament , tell me that they have free time and would like to be useful , to do something to help society .
Madam President , it would be difficult to deny that the people who spend most time watching television - one of the objectives of the Mr Harbour 's report - are the elderly .
Usually young graduates , young people who have been taken on in these companies and who come from universities that indeed teach statistics .
As you know , there are national referendums , and there are proposals for national legislation which are signed by the citizens .
In this respect , I can only congratulate the rapporteur on this report , for the subject is of great interest to many young people who vote for the Radical Party .
Madam President , Mr Miller 's report is important primarily as regards the entry of many young people at the bottom grade , who leave the world of studying for the world of work and become part of
