As is often stated , our policy on China and Russia is closely tied to factors connected with policy on trade and energy .
At the moment we are 50 % dependent on energy imported from outside the EU , and , according to the Commission ’s calculations , that will rise to 70 % by 2030 .
Unless we realise this and identify the risk inherent in the situation we are in , the result may be an inadvertent weakening of our human rights policy .
It could close mouths when they should be open .
It is not always easy to be a consumer in present-day society .
Sometimes advertising can be misleading for the consumer , and marketing can be aggressive and unfair .
I think it is wrong to suppose that consumers have the opportunity or time to examine advertising material very carefully .
Harmonisation must not lower standards of consumer protection , which in some EU countries are very high .
Consumer policy should be based on guaranteeing high levels of consumer protection .
This is a good thing .
If the authorities in the country of origin were deprived of the opportunity to take issue , if necessary , with unfair advertising , the most crucial objectives contained in this proposal for a directive could not be achieved .     Mr President , we must act to prevent the recurrence of any such cases .
We need it ; it is a major source of employment .
We have to maintain high standards in goods , working conditions , and pay as well .
In addition to international competition , the European steel sector has to meet tighter environmental standards with the advent of emissions trading in the Union and the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol .
It should therefore cut its greenhouse gases either by investing in new technology or by purchasing emissions rights .
The steel industry in my country is indeed one of the cleanest in the world .
The cleaner industries are therefore paying for the dirtier ones .
Commissioner Spidla , how do you intend to act to prevent cleaner industries from having to reward dirtier ones in the context of emissions trading ?
Europe needs its own steel sector : it lies at the heart of our basic manufacturing , and we have to remain self-sufficient .
The Commission should also draw up a fundamental strategy for those vital sectors of industry in which our self-sufficiency is important .
We are adding this to the Lisbon objectives , as I noticed the Commissioner is also doing .
It is the Finance Ministers of the Member States and Ecofin that are our targets and whom we should be grabbing by the scruff of the neck .
We require some exceptionally determined work from the Commission , and this really is , as you have said , the first test , or actually a test both for you and for us .
The funding is to be doubled , but where is it being channelled ?
I would like to know exactly which areas it is destined for .
Here , moreover , the working week is being lengthened .
I am one of those who believe that 1 % on the budget is not enough to take care of enlargement , the Lisbon Process and many other matters .
That is the only way out of this vicious circle of competitiveness .     .
Mr President , I am rapporteur for European Investment Bank loans and guarantees on the Committee on Budgets and I would therefore like to present our committee’s point of view with regard to this issue .
With that purpose in mind , every year we effect a transfer of funds from the Union’s budget to a special Guarantee Fund , which serves as a guarantee to the EIB in case of defaults on loans .
The European Investment Bank itself does not even ask for a 100 % guarantee for all the loans it grants .
We expect the Commission to propose an amendment to the conditions of use of the Guarantee Fund and I would ask the President of the European Investment Bank , Mr Maystadt , to confirm , on the Bank’s behalf , that these changes could be justified and that the Bank would have nothing against them .
This kind of situation should be rectified in the future .
We cannot accept a situation where Member States do not consider all the Union’s neighbouring regions impartially , but instead , try to favour their own neighbours .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have submitted this proposal for a regulation concerning access to the natural gas transmission networks for second reading by Parliament .
As rapporteur , I would have liked the regulation to include two important issues , which are now absent from it .
The judicial services of all three Institutions , the Council , the Commission and Parliament , were of the opinion that the drafting of legislation should take place by means of the comitology procedure , and no hearing of any external agency can be written into the legal text itself .
The other matter regarding which I would have liked to add my own article to the regulation concerns the storage of gas .
Preserving the storage monopolies will prevent the full-scale use of the networks for the benefit of all stakeholders and weaken competition in the market .
The shared use of the networks , which is to say access to the networks , is therefore important .
Our objective in Parliament has been that this regulation should enter into force as quickly as possible .
There are also big differences in the conditions for access among the transmission system operators .
We have to create non-discriminatory conditions for competition and make sure that everyone complies with the new
