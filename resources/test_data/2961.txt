, who complains that there is disagreement concerning asylum policy and that therefore it will not really come to anything .
I did not entirely understand this remark , because I was after all able to say that we have just reached agreement on the cornerstones of a common asylum policy .
In addition , we have also agreed to convert the Dublin convention into a Dublin directive .
That may sound very easy , but the opposing interests of the various countries are so enormous - depending on where they are situated in Europe - that it has been tremendously difficult to reach agreement .
Mr Vitorino and I met for the first time in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
The first thing we talked about was these things , which we wanted to lead to a common policy , and we talked a lot about Eurodac.
Now we can answer : something will come of it on 15 January , that is , next month .
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to repeat that .
Mrs Sbarbati is right that something must be done for asylum-seeking minors in particular , and I can only state that in my home parliament I have introduced a Bill which ensures that an adult is present , that a lawyer is present when necessary and that cases involving minors are processed extra quickly .
Similar efforts are in progress in other countries .
Most governments maintain that this must be a national decision .
It is only natural that reaching agreement on this point is a difficult task , not least because some countries have very high levels of employment whilst others have very low levels of employment .
I would go on to say to Mrs Swiebel that one specific aspect of the common asylum policy on which we have now agreed is that we ensure compliance with the conventions in every case .
One cannot rule out forced repatriation , however ; if we were to rule that out , we might as well pack up and forget all about an asylum policy , including a common asylum policy .
To reassure her I can state that the Afghans in most countries - this is true in my country at least - are young men from the Kabul region .
I think it is great that Mr Vitorino has now achieved agreement in the Council not just on a general return policy , but also on a special return programme for Afghanistan .
For this aspect of the matter must be included .
Finally , I would say to Mr Olle Schmidt that I thank him for his interest in Danish legislation .
So thank you for your concern .
Mr President , thank you for drawing attention to what this question is about .
As you mentioned , however , it is about the fact that French authorities have removed a sign in the Basque language which points the way to a railway station .
The answer is that the Charter addresses the EU authorities and the national authorities when they administer EU policy .
I have the greatest sympathy for regional languages .
I believe that they have a future and I believe that we will become more aware of them , but in this connection I am forced to say that , where the Charter talks about the Union respecting cultural , religious and linguistic diversity etc. , it is talking about the Union 's policies and not about the Member States ' policies .
I can answer that the Council has not been informed of the event in question .
And the Council established that the country has made progress with regard to the economic criteria and adaptation to current Community law .
As part of the accession partnership Turkey has undertaken fully to support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General at finding a solution to the Cyprus problem .
On Friday , it was confirmed that the Council is willing to adapt the accession treaty to these terms , and the European Council expressed its pleasure that the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots had agreed to continue negotiations with a view to arriving at an overall solution by 28 February 2003 .
As I have said , I cannot comment on the specific case , but I would like to remind you of what Mr Verheugen said in very strong terms on Friday evening shortly before midnight at the press conference and which he has repeated in even stronger terms today in this House , namely that Turkey will be assessed according to the same strict standards as the ten countries that have just been accepted , that the Commission will carry out its work zealously and meticulously , and that torture in prisons , political prisoners and the theoretical existence of what Mr Medina has spoken of are naturally unthinkable in a country which is to start negotiations for accession to the European Union .
The issue of the integration of third-country nationals is one of the priorities of the programme of work of the Danish Presidency .
Its importance and the need to prompt and encourage integration were recognised and underlined by the Council in the conclusions adopted on 14 - 15 October .
As a follow-up to those conclusions , the Presidency called upon the Member States to establish national contact points for integration by the end of this year , and all the Member States have accepted this .
I would add that a major conference on integration was held in Copenhagen in July , which also provided opportunity for such exchange of experience and best practice .
These legislative instruments are aimed at creating a legal framework of rights and obligations at Community level for third-country nationals wishing to enter and reside in the territory of other Member States .
