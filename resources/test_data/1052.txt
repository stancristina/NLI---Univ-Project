But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation , stifling individual initiative and enterprise .
We must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society .
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead , particularly of enlargement .
Secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity .
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too .
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation .
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations , which seems to go in a different direction .
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes .
Lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the European Commission .
Yes , the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body , but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament .
The information problem , which Mr Bonde just referred to , is treated like a straw in the wind , with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us , as citizens and as parliamentarians , although we have the right to it under the Treaties .
The Commission is not in fact today a European government .
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament .
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe .
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union , has its relevant role to play .
Therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission , and perhaps of the Union itself .
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called " core tasks " .
That , as you have said yourself today , means that you must also identify tasks , policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission 's main vocation .
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date , or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level .
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national , regional and local government .
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration , we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers .
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim , as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde , that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only .
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes , which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality , are devolved and repealed .
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead , you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and , as we have heard today , you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament .
Madam President , I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan .
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present .
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group , Mr Poettering , in his opening address .
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place .
That foundation is clearly the single market .
How strongly is the single market established at the moment ?
I want to remind Mr Prodi , and his colleagues who are still here , of the findings of the Commission ' s own survey among 3000 European businesses .
Nearly 40 % of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications .
This is the Commission ' s own survey .
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry .
The Commission ' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market .
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers , intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and , of course , extending into crucial new areas like financial services .
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved .
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union .
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement .
I conclude by saying , on behalf
