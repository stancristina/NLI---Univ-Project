I hope that 1997 will bring a breakthrough , and not just at the IGC. 1997 should also be the year when an even balance is finally achieved between a macroeconomic policy focusing on stability and growth and an employment policy focusing on creating jobs .
It should also be one of the main ways of targeting the Structural Funds more specifically on employment .
I said last time that I found it fairly unambitious and in need of greater impetus , and I will give you four examples of what I mean .
Then we can convince the governments during the preparations for the fifth framework programme that the money has to be found .
We are all still at risk from unsafe nuclear power stations .
We have shown great self-discipline and I should like to pay tribute here to all my colleagues on the committees who have contributed so much and who have made real sacrifices because real priorities had to be weighed against each other .
On research and development , trans-European networks and Northern Ireland , the European Council has repeatedly said that we must increase the amounts but when it comes to it the money is not there .
The Budget Council is not a real Council and in the motion for a resolution we ask the President of Parliament , together with the President of the Commission - and I welcome the presence of President Santer here today - to take up this point with the President of Ecofin .
The proposal is to put ECU 100m in reserve for specific actions concerning Turkey .
He has made a lot of progress but I hope that in the course of next year we can make progress there on substance within our various institutional frameworks .
Next year the situation will be quite different , and I would warn the Council that the Interinstitutional Agreement is not guaranteed for ten years either , just this year .
It should come to an arrangement as quickly as possible , on the basis of Mr Christodoulou 's sensible suggestions , it should adopt a rather more sensible approach to category 3 , and then we might actually get somewhere .
It simply acknowledges the fact that European party groups exist and indicates their importance for the process of integration and the development of European citizenship .
It also has to do with the fact that the Netherlands deliberately does not have any legislation on the position of the political parties .
We could have kept a substantial part of it afloat at second reading , but it looks as if this too is not going to happen .
It has a customs union with us , which we voted through last year .
It does not need to be .
Mr President , Parliament is once again discussing a very important topic today , and I think it was very ambitious of the Committee on Budgets to put this issue on the agenda so soon .
Its very nature means that certain aspects are rather speculative , which could put the whole debate on our hopes - and I stress the word hopes - for enlargement on entirely the wrong track .
The strategy may vary from one country to another , as will each accession , and this too will affect the final bill .
But , at the same time , it is also clear that words must be matched by deeds .
That is the underlying motive of the amendments which my group has tabled .
It is a fundamental choice which must be made .
There is no doubt that the enlargement of the Union will involve considerable costs .
I think the Rehder report contains a number of important points to be considered .
So that is out of the question .
Before any new countries join , a careful analysis must be made of the effects of the 1992 reforms and the concessions that have accumulated under the free trade agreements with the Mediterranean countries , Mercosur and South Africa .
If national programmes are linked to European framework directives , then national funding for nature and countryside policy measures need not result in distortions of competition .
In the applicant countries , more people are dependent on agriculture , and this means that we have an even greater responsibility to support them materially and democratically once we have completed our reforms .
You said that the Member States were consulted .
Madam President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , this is the second reading of the electricity directive , which is designed to create an internal market in electricity .
The distribution companies are in a position to stimulate initiatives at a decentralized level , such as obtaining energy from renewable sources and co-generation .
Energy cannot and must not be allowed to distort the operation of the market .
His task at second reading was anything but easy , and I know how much effort he has put into preparing this report .
In the short term , there would be no kind of market regulation at all at European level , and there would be a considerable risk that people 's security of supply would be jeopardized , not to mention all our ambitious plans for giving renewable sources of energy - which are too expensive at the moment - greater priority in terms of electricity production .
This directive is like a bottle of ketchup .
Make no mistake about it , this already offers a great deal , with every citizen having a basic telephone , a fax line and the possibility of connection to the Internet .
The EU must ensure that people have access to new , advanced services .
At the last Telecommunications Council on 17 November , it appeared that the Member States could not
