At the very least , this engenders a lack of transparency .
It may also mean that the additionality principle is not being properly implemented on a region-by-region basis .
I accept , like Mrs Evans , that this does not , strictly speaking , contradict the letter of European Union law on this matter .
But , unlike her , it seems to me to be quite clearly contrary to the spirit of additionality rules and undermines the very purposes for which structural funding was established in the first place .
Although I come from Scotland , I know these issues are of concern not just to my Liberal Democrat colleagues from other parts of the United Kingdom but also to ELDR members representing regions across the whole of the European Union .
Mr President , it is with particular interest that I rise to speak in this debate today .
Great Britain , as a whole , receives some £10 billion in support from the Structural Funds programme .
Indeed parts of my own constituency , the West Midlands , have been awarded £550 million under the Objective II strand .
In addition to the Structural Funds programme the European Union , by having this programme , is indeed providing an opportunity - an opportunity for regions to develop and for communities to strengthen ; an opportunity for businesses to prosper and for people 's lives to be improved .
The Structural Funds programme provides , in many cases , the single most important and positive opportunity for our own worst-hit and most deprived areas to get up off their knees and back on their feet .
This is a laudable objective and something that every Member of this Parliament would , I hope , support .
But Structural Funds also provide an opportunity for national governments .
If unregulated and unmonitored , they are an opportunity for national governments to ease their cash burden and to iron out their accounting difficulties - or indeed more cynically , one could say , to siphon away a war chest or pay for vote-winning tax reductions .
Granting of Structural Funds is often trumpeted by governments as a sign of its success , whereas in truth it is merely a recognition of difficult problems that a region faces .
The aim of the Structural Funds programme is not to help governments win elections , but to help the lives of Europe 's citizens .
It is a great shame , therefore , that just by having this debate today , we are signalling our awareness that money from the Structural Funds programme is not allocated in many Member States as it should be .
We are accepting the fact , for example , that matching funding is often not provided by national governments and that , by clever accounting , figures are all too often shrouded and fudged .
So what can we do ?
What can be done to ensure that our aims and objectives are met ?
To begin with , additionality must mean exactly that - additional funds being spent where they are most needed and on the most important projects .
We must work harder to ensure that the true figures for spending are rigorously checked and that spending is identified more clearly .
Only recently the Commission published a devastating critique of the UK Government 's handling of the Structural Funds , due in large part to the inequality of public sector matching funding .
This is clearly not acceptable .
In one area alone - Liverpool and Merseyside - the lack of support by the UK Treasury is putting at risk the creation of 10 000 jobs , and up to 5 000 existing ones will be lost , according to a report by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce .
The end result of all this is that private-sector partners will have little confidence in projects , often resulting in the failure of worthwhile schemes .
To conclude , as I have said previously in this House in previous debates on the subject , we must endeavour to ensure that these funds are seen not as a hand-out but as a hand-up .
Mr President , one of the main problems arising in this whole issue is that there is not any legal sanction from Europe to ensure that Member States adhere to the excellent concept of additionality .
I think we must look in detail at that problem , and we need also better coordination between DGs on this issue .
Additionality is your concept , and it is up to you to ensure that it works effectively in Member States .
We understand as well , of course , the problems you are facing concerning the overlapping of programmes , creating problems of continuity for you .
Verification is another matter that needs to be tackled with Member States , because they are guilty as well .
We understand your problems , that they are not providing for you sufficient data in good time , especially with Objectives 2 , 3 and 4 , to enable you to ensure that the system works more effectively .
One of the worst offenders in this connection is the UK.
No additional money has been built into the budget of our Welsh Assembly .
This is clear non-compliance .
The European Parliament and the European Union admit that our nation of Wales is poor and yet the UK government , not only the Labour government , has not complied with additionality .
It is all very well for my colleague Jonathan Evans to imply that his party is not guilty .
For eighteen long years the concept of additionality was not complied with by his government either .
I think some momentum is being lost , Mr President .
I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday .
They need this scheme to go ahead .
It is in
