be carried out in a good many countries .
Schemes have also included the improvement of the methods and tools used by heritage workers in Europe , especially those developed by the International Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage in Rome , and the further training of workers and specialist craftspeople in the area of restoration , an area we have tried to develop through our education programmes , precisely in order to establish a supply of specialists capable of assisting with various ongoing restoration projects .
A new approach has now been adopted to ensure that discharges are confined to the business of the budget .
Obviously , this will cause some overlapping of funding , since funding is not sufficiently well monitored , and hence the poor use of European appropriations .
I shall therefore confine my comments to the subjects raised by Mr McCartin and Mr Staes .
The measures to assist young farmers setting up in business are inadequate , since in far too many cases the target group exceeds the age limit on the date of receiving aid even though it was eligible at the moment of presenting an application .
The Committee on Industry perhaps emphasised to a greater extent the importance of SMEs for employment , the need to facilitate access to risk capital , the need to simplify bureaucratic and administrative procedures and regarding improving the coordination between the various Commission programmes of interest to small and medium-sized enterprises .
From this point of view , I support the programme of start-up facilities for smallSMEs .
Throughout Europe , differences start to show at primary level , causing children from working class areas to fall behind in their education at this stage in an often irreversible way .
Therefore , to protect , preserve and promote our heritage , we must save our architecture , support our arts and craft industry , preserve and enhance the value of our countryside , but I would like to stress that we must not wrap it in cotton wool or exclude the cultural traditions and customs which are practised there .
Since signing the Oslo Agreement , the European Union and its Member States have , to a great extent , subsidised the Palestinian education system .
Commissioner , Mr President , this situation prevents the people living and working on the borders of the various European Union countries fully experiencing the notion of European integration we champion , even though these are the people who should be the first to benefit from it .
We debated the matter at great length within the parliamentary committee and , in the end , the Committee on Fisheries went along with the opinion of the rapporteur - as , in my view , there really was no other option - with everyone able to argue their own corner on the subject , just as usual .
Review of the main areas of the Union ' s fisheries policy is called for throughout .
Furthermore , we are , generally , not particularly in favour of the bilateral fishing agreements between the European Union and third countries , often small countries , whose entire budgets are occasionally no larger than the subsidies granted them .
It is known , moreover , that the effects of radioactive contamination do not become apparent until after a relatively long period of time .
Yet it is not Mr Milosevic and his allies who are the victims of the radiation , who have ingested depleted uranium , but the local population , the military forces and the representatives of NGOs .
It is up to the European countries which manufacture them , including Great Britain , Portugal and , unfortunately , my own country , France , to agree to put an end to the manufacture , storage and , of course , the use , even experimentally , of such arms .
I hope that increasing numbers of us will align ourselves with this move for change .
We can therefore only welcome the establishment of inquiry bodies at every level within our States , the Alliance and the European Union .
The first is the advent of a new era in bilateral relations between the two Koreas , characterised by the policy of rapprochement , or Sunshine Policy , of President Kim Dae Jung , who made an important initial gesture with his historic visit in June 2000 to Pyongyang .
The implementation of the Habitats and Wild Birds Directives must henceforth be implemented speedily and effectively across the board .
Moreover , such aid is often also misappropriated by the local administration .
We therefore voted against the creation of the Rapid Reaction Facility , just as we shall vote against any budget allocations to support it .
In future , by coordinating its diplomatic and military forces , the EU will be trying to optimise what its Member States have done individually throughout the last century .
These directives fully live up to the ambitions of the citizens of Europe , who are demanding that greater attention be paid to environmental matters and are seeking arbitration from the European authorities .
I would stress the importance of milk produced by young farmers and of supporting the product at this difficult time for the farming world .
We therefore chose to highlight the issues associated with education , training and information policies and the social and cultural life of young farmers .
Inspection and penalty systems must absolutely be harmonised between the various fishing areas , in order to prevent distortions between Member States .
Essentially , the CFP , which often contains too many excessively obscure regulations , must reconcile contradictory objectives , i .e . conserve fish stocks , according to the precautionary principle , while protecting coastal communities and economies which sometimes depend on the fishing industry for employment , as in the case of the Manche region .
