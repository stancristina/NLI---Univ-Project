This too is important , in that it makes it more likely that Croatia will exercise influence as an example to the other countries in this forum , which comprises only countries from that region .
We have appealed to the Iranian Government to cooperate unconditionally with the IAEA.
I will take this opportunity to repeat that all the targets agreed at the Millennium Summit must , of course , be achieved .
It is a recurrent experience that the end of a period sees considerable amounts of money left over , and that means that we also have to improve the capacity for these funds to be used , which has to do not only with the amount , but also with the way in which these funds are used .
There had previously been concern that the countries with which we want to maintain particularly close relations should not have to suffer the increase in these visa charges , which were to be – and have been – imposed for reasons that are objectively perfectly understandable .     The issue of the sustainability of biofuel use is generally an important one in terms of the European Union’s sustainable energy strategy .
A number of approaches are being adopted ; in Austria , for example , we have defined cross-compliance conditions derived from agricultural reform as the basis for energy production and also for the admixture of biodiesel and bioethanol , the consequence of which is that anything produced subject to eco-social criteria and production conditions , and to European standards , can be added irrespective of which parts of the world it comes from .
In addition , the Commission 's proposal will be up for debate at the end of the year , and that is a very good thing .
The Austrian Presidency has already seen several debates on the quite crucial issue of how to minimise and limit the pollutants produced by vehicles in transit .
Over and above that , we must give industry a signal as to how things are to go in the future , and I see that – which is the approach we want to take – as a sensible thing to do .     – Euro 5 is a big step in the right direction .
What is the workable potential when account is taken of sustainability , and by what means do we want to inject funds into rural development in order to make use of this potential on the energy supply market in ways that make good , effective and cost-efficient use of resources ?
Does the programme or the Financial Perspective make provision for financial facilities to meet this ?     .
When compared with that in other countries , the quality of Austrian water is very good .
We had a major argument about how this was to be funded , that being crucial when it comes to making things safe , only then to ask oneself who is meant to come up with the necessary money .
If , then , the cost of protecting people against danger at football matches is borne generally , then the same ought , even if only to some degree , to apply at airports .
If ERTMS can build on the foundation of a strong market in Europe , it can be the standard for the world .
I hope that what we are hearing about the White Paper that is due to appear is no more than a rumour ; the planned system is certainly needed .
At the moment , we are discussing the reinforcement of Parliament’s rights in respect of committee procedure , specifically the Lamfalussy procedure .
Everything that has to do with enlargement is politically sensitive , but we have to make sure that , in this area too , things are done properly in budgetary terms .
Thus , for example , Parliament will not agree to any regulation that restricts its rights in any way .
In so far as investigations are carried out at all , they are arbitrary .
Now , for everybody’s sake , we must send a reminder to the Council about this and follow it through , otherwise the fight against fraud will remain incomplete and be a toothless tiger .     – Mr President , instead of constantly looking for new sources of funding , for example in the form of new EU taxes , and instead of constantly increasing the level of expenditure , it is in my view high time to intensify the fight against fraud and waste .
The close nature of the vote result gives cause for hope , however , that this can be rectified in Council and at second reading .
History teaches us that rising defence expenditure and , hence , increased funding for defence research , too , is always a sign of further wars and conflicts .
We call on the EU institution , the Member States and all political parties in the EU to do likewise .
It cannot be the European Union’s function to regulate everything right down to the tiniest detail , or we will end up with the sort of thing with which we are familiar in the context of the labelling of allergenic substances , with demands being made for labelling in every conceivable language .
Various EU Member States also cooperate very closely with Syria , with the Dutch state bringing Syrian refugees in the Netherlands face to face with representatives of the regime .
It is for that reason that I would like to make it clear that we are right to make the demand contained in the motion for a resolution , namely that we should resume the human rights dialogue with this country that was suspended in 2003 and
