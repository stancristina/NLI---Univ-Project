much Confucius as confused !
There is also a need to coordinate taxation of fuels with infrastructure charges in order to guarantee a level playing field .
I still do not think it right that we do not wait for the general standard of living to improve before doing something about that of MEPs .
I therefore no longer have any confidence in the Council’s will , at the present time , to bring about a single statute for MEPs , and , for that reason , I vote against the resolution RC B5-543-/2003 .     .
Is it , in any case , any legislator’s task to prescribe one technology or another ?
Let me conclude by asking you to believe me when I say that for me , as a German rapporteur , it has not – heaven knows – been an easy matter to propose this course of action to you .
By way of conclusion , I want to say something about the effect that distorted competition between road and rail has on society .
We can certainly live with what Mrs Sommer has put together and the Committee have adopted , but I would like to point out that it would actually do the European’s image some good if it were to move towards the most modern technology , not just because the technology is the most up-to-date , but because it is highly flexible .
A satellite-based toll system also promises more for the future , firstly , because it can – provided that the political will is present – provide comprehensive and cross-border coverage of vehicles , and , secondly , because – as my colleague Mr Swoboda said – it provides a basis on which future traffic flows can be directed and on which different modes of transport can be logistically interlinked .
The regulation they provide can benefit the environment ; they can promote safety ; they also produce income , and one can of course have exciting discussions about what is to be done with it .
Not in any way , though , is this about using toll-collecting technology as a means of justifying the extension of Galileo .
Austria does not want that solution .
If , as some have said , that is a concession for Austria , I can only say : God save us from friends like that !
The ‘transitional system ’ we now have no longer contains any incentive to change over from more environmentally harmful to more environmentally friendly lorries .
I only know that again they do not want the compromise .
Because the compromise bans the transit of the dirtiest lorries ; if the compromise is not adopted , then not only Greek lorries , which funnily enough you want to allow and which are the dirtiest on the road , but all dirty lorries will be able to drive through Austria .
For example , if I get to Tegel before finding out that my flight from Berlin to Mallorca has been cancelled , I not only get my ticket replaced , but I also get EUR 400 compensation .
If a budget airline offers a flight for EUR 50 , then it is still obliged to make the flight , despite the low price .
When it comes to international cooperation , the Turkish customs authorities hold monthly meetings with drugs liaison officers who are sent to Turkey .
The Commission has always followed developments affecting minorities in all applicant countries closely for the pre-accession strategies and the Europe agreements .
My personal strategy in this connection has always been that one must be very careful about dramatic insinuations or dramatic accusations .
In my opinion , the most important thing at the moment is to use effective surveillance to gain an overview of the actual situation .
I was in Moldova a few days ago , and there the problem is much more shocking in extent and is quite clearly a consequence of the bitter poverty in which the people there live , so the strategy of increasing the chances for economic prosperity for the countries in transition within Europe is quite certainly a right one .
In Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Hungary they are still used in a very few exceptional cases and strict guidelines must be followed .
I agree with you , Mrs McKenna .
Of course , the underlying message still remains the same and shows the Turkish Government that not only the Commission but also all 15 Member States together with the 10 incoming States consider the two subjects politically related , without wishing to create a new condition or a new requirement .
I have no doubt that the number of voters in this election was in fact artificially inflated , with the intention of manipulating the results .     – Something happened yesterday which does not belong in the Minutes , where it would merely be out of place , but rather in the full session report .
I would therefore be interested to hear how the European Union , and in particular the Commission , expects this problem to develop in future .     – Commissioner , a very good evening to you .
More pressure was applied through the statements made by a number of delegations in the Council questioning the need for a directive promoting cogeneration , and making it clear that the directive would be blocked if Parliament requested anything beyond this support .
The Commission is required to evaluate these reports and , if necessary , submit an action plan for developing cogeneration in the EU.
The Commission is required to present an action plan for developing cogeneration if there is no increase in cogeneration usage .
That is also why the relevant definitions were very important .
The Council has acknowledged our compromise .
