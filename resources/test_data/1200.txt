to say to Mrs Alfano that it is important that the legal acts adopted by the European Council are complied with and that all Member States implement them as decided .
It is also important to involve the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in our work in order to achieve the high quality that we are aiming for .
If we have this we will not need the policies of Messrs Meyer , Batten or Bontes .
It requires a package of various initiatives within different areas .
The division of responsibility between the countries with regard to sea rescue efforts also needs to be clarified .
I think that this debate has clearly shown that .
Unfortunately , these terms sometimes become nothing more than fine words .
If some MEPs do not even feel involved in and aware of the work , how can we expect our citizens to feel involved and have confidence in our work and to vote in elections ?
I should also mention that we have trade agreements which sometimes exacerbate the problems with regard to food supply and poverty in the world .
One way to start to move the policy in the right direction is to stop the privatisation and deregulation of public services .
Democracy also requires that our civil rights and freedoms never be violated .
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left are prepared , and gladly accept our responsibility , to play our part in building a fairer EU with greater solidarity and a fairer and better world .
It is a victory for the European Parliament and it is also a victory for all of us who fervently support European cooperation and everything it stands for .
I would also like to thank you for the visionary speech and the ambitious plans you have for this Parliament .
We in the Council look forward to working with you and the European Parliament .
If the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force - and that is something that I certainly hope will happen - the European Parliament 's role will be extended and you will have a greater influence on the European agenda .
I must say that it is wonderful to be back in the European Parliament .
There is , of course , an awful lot I could comment on , but I will not do that today , because this is not the Council 's debate .
The first thing is self-evident : Jos√© Manuel Barroso has been unanimously nominated by 27 Heads of State or Government with various political affiliations .
We are living in extremely uncertain times with considerable and difficult challenges .
The Presidency and the Commission will jointly represent the EU at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh on 24-25 September .
The financial and monetary policy measures that were able to be taken quickly were entirely necessary to get us through the worst of the crisis .
We are very aware that rising unemployment will be a very dominant issue in the time ahead .
The G20 will also work with the international financial institutions of the IMF and the World Bank to guarantee that they have sufficient resources and a well-functioning internal organisation so as to be able to support economic growth and ensure financial stability throughout the world .
These include a comprehensive stimulus package for our economies and a strengthening of cooperation on the supervision and regulation of the financial markets .
Furthermore , we have ensured that the International Monetary Fund has sufficient resources to meet demand for borrowing .
I feel that we in the EU , along with the other members of the G20 , have made great progress on a number of central issues that are crucial if we are to provide a strategic response to the economic and financial crisis .
The aim is to build further on the successful work of the informal Ecofin lunch and the meeting of G20 finance ministers in London , so that we will be well prepared on arrival in Pittsburgh .
This is an important part of the overall initiative to ensure greater transparency and better supervision of the financial sector and it is crucial if we are to be able to secure future stability .
We have only just begun to reflect on these exit strategies .
I am sure that we will also repeat the need to maintain a stand against protectionism and to ensure fair play on the global markets .
We want them to be strong , with sufficient resources , the right mandate , with political guidance and management structures that correctly reflect their composition .
We want to ensure that the right incentives are in place for everyone to take action to limit global warming and to adapt economic strategies so as to favour climate-friendly development .
( Applause ) Mr President , I would like to thank all the Members who have contributed to this debate .
Yes , we need better supervision and better regulation of the financial markets .
We need clear principles for bonus systems .
Naturally , we will work towards this , because it would be a good thing .
We also need global solutions .
Unemployment is here to stay for some time in most of our countries and that is a very , very serious situation .
We also have to discuss exit strategies .
It is hitting the poorest in the world hard .
Consequently , the various discussions concerning global taxes and various kinds of Tobin tax are only meaningful if they can actually be realised globally , and at the moment that is not the case .
We will decide these matters alongside you and we look forward to working very closely with the European Parliament to get directives on hedge funds and financial regulation in place as soon as possible .
