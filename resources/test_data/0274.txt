reach agreement on the draft directive , which means a further delay for the liberalization of the postal services market and no further progress in a sector which is so vital for the Union 's competitive position .
I would therefore ask the Commissioner what he intends to do now , following the Telecommunications Council in November .
What you are asking for is absolutely impossible .
What you want is for the Commission to renounce its responsibilities .
For me , it is quite clear that the Commission must do what it is required to do under the terms of the Treaty .
I wonder , Mr President , whether you could investigate this and do something to ensure that the verbatim reports of our sittings in Brussels are produced just as quickly as those of our sittings in Strasbourg .
It is not sufficient simply to declare that these matters are important .
We were promised a revision of the decision-making procedure and we have not got that ; and far less have we seen any role that the European Parliament is to play in that decision-making .
But what I find lacking is specific action on security and a policy on drugs .
That was essential for good cooperation .
I particularly like the article on non-discrimination which I think is also a good start to the European Year Against Racism .
And on the subject of foreign policy much remains to be done .
Mr President , this House has a reputation especially outside the Union for defending human rights .
Mrs Lalumi√®re rightly focuses on how the Union can produce as effective an external policy on human rights as possible .
That too is part of Europe 's image abroad .
Economic interests should not be the overriding factor .
There is a continual area of tension between the ideal and often bitter reality , where the biblical truth is confirmed that man 's instinct is towards evil .
I must say that we in the Committee on Women 's Rights have discussed on various occasions in the last few years the dangers facing minors not just outside the family but also inside it .
Well , either she was totally absent from the debate or she was not listening at all to it , but she cannot draw that conclusion because I heard various people here say that adoption should also be allowed in less traditional forms of society .
I understood that Mrs Veil has finished her work and that her report says that employees ' rights should be guaranteed in all situations .
Mr President , I would like straight away to thank Mr Kerr most sincerely for his report .
It was very difficult to bring the various interests together fairly and I am happy that our two groups in particular managed , together with the Commission , to reach an acceptable solution .
Mr President , I think it regrettable that the Christian Democrats are saying here , ' our two groups ' .
Public health was my main point of departure in drawing up my report .
In the past Member States have proved very imaginative in bypassing the old definition .
But amendments are proposed to a few points , the most important of which is the parameter for faecal streptococci .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to ask the Commissioner to explain how she thinks this directive should be integrated in the future into the framework directive on water .
I myself have certain ideas on the subject as can be seen from Amendment No 14 , but I am very curious to hear the Commission 's reaction to them .
It is a symbol that people can easily recognise .
I would like the Commissioner to explain clearly why the experts here should be wrong .
Then we must ensure that water destined for water sports comes under the scope of this directive .
If measurements show that polluted water forms a threat to public health then the Member States should prohibit bathing in the relevant area .
The rapporteur has made a few useful additions to it .
How does the Commission view Amendment No 14 in this context ?
Mr President , I should first of all like to thank Mrs Kokkola for her excellent report .
I would call in this context for special attention to be paid to agriculture , fisheries , transport and regional policy .
I hope that this will enable the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment , which has asked for a separate vote , to vote in favour of this amendment .
So I would formally contest the statement by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy .
I was moved yesterday listening to your speech on the occasion of the award of the Sakharov prize .
You will be doing so again , today , tomorrow and the day after .
That is my question .
Moves towards a common policy on asylum are far too slow and lacking in substance .
To Christians Sunday is especially significant as the day of rest ordained by God , going back to the day of Christ 's resurrection .
There is more to life than work and production .
But we think that is a restricted freedom .
Mr President , after Sunday as a day of rest we come to the ongoing unrest in Belarus .
Otherwise the seed will be sown for the resurgence of more crime , undemocratic attitudes and the vices of the bad old days - revolution , civil war and human rights violations .
A majority of this House will declare its outrage here this afternoon .
To my mind it would have carried more conviction if we had taken the opportunity this morning of expressing our outrage in more than just words .
This is the only real means of censure we have and we are giving it away
