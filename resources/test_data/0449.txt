A duty should be imposed on the chemicals in order to finance the monitoring , assessment and remedying of damage caused by use according to the rules , as well as in order to finance the development of alternatives .
The first substance on which it would be appropriate to impose such a tax is PVC.
Investment must also be made in real ecological alternatives , which either already exist or are on the way , as a replacement for most chemicals .
Just as , in Parliament , we have discussed the labelling of genetically modified products , labelling arrangements should also , in the interests of free consumer choice , be introduced for the many toxic chemicals .
I find it difficult to understand why a temporary – and , I repeat , a temporary – subsidy arrangement must now suddenly be extended .
The Commission assured me of this , as did you too , Mr Monti .
The regulation contained , moreover , a mousetrap clause whereby the regulation would cease immediately in the event of the dispute with South Korea being resolved .
For me , this was a mitigating circumstance , since at no time have I been convinced that South Korea does in actual fact compete on unequal terms .
I would therefore take the liberty of asking you , Mr Monti , whether the regulation is , in reality , on its way to becoming permanent , and whether you do not see this as a backward step in the fight against direct production subsidies .
Could it perhaps be said that a promise has been broken in this case ?
I am therefore rather tired of the matter this evening .     Mr President , I see we have two clocks in this Chamber , and they seem to be completely out of sync .
That is how it has been for quite a long time , and I think we should do something about it .     Mr President , quite a few people , including Mr Patten , have said that EU-Russia relations have not always been ideal , and right now can probably be characterised as being quite strained .
Last Monday , we were able to ‘commemorate’ the 60th anniversary of Stalin’s deportation of the Chechens and , thus , also the 60th anniversary of a genocide that has never been properly acknowledged .
These are journalists who wish to cover the election and who are not therefore being given an opportunity to offer a critical analysis of what is happening .
Mrs Malmström mentioned how , with a snap of his fingers , Putin dissolved the Russian Government .
There are good reasons for being very critical of what is happening in Russia .
I do not understand how , on the one hand , we can pursue a critical line – which I think is correct – on Russia and , on the other hand , consider lifting the arms embargo against China which , in my view , is more or less as difficult , troublesome and unreasonable as Russia in its behaviour .
I believe that genocide has taken place , and is continuing to take place , in Tibet .
I believe that the oppression of the Chinese people is without parallel .
Nonetheless , we are considering lifting the arms embargo .
I do not , moreover , think that this is the situation at present .     Mr President , there is a subject that raises concern when we talk about Russia .
We know that , according to Russian law , there is freedom of the press in Russia , but there is a big gap between the law and everyday practice .
Moreover , the situation is getting worse .
According to the International Federation of Journalists , four journalists were killed in Russia last year alone and , since 1 January 2002 , thirteen have been killed .
I saw this for myself in St Petersburg in the run-up to the election for Governor when , for example , it was forbidden to show pictures , or quote the names of , candidates in the election .
Recently , a Danish journalist was denied entry to Russia .
Her crime was to have written critically of Russian conduct in Chechnya .
The attacks on freedom of expression that take place in Russia are unacceptable !     Mr President , I should like to take the opportunity sincerely to congratulate the women on their international day of action .
That is something I think should be a key issue for us .
That is perhaps a more important perspective than that of whether there should be one or two more women .
In the twenty-first century , equality should , on the contrary , be a natural part of everyday life in a democracy .
Talk of genuine democracy is meaningless unless there is also genuine equality .
We would therefore call upon our member parties to comply with that objective in connection with the elections to the European Parliament .
Enlargement to include the ten East and Central European countries on 1 May is of historic importance .
At the same time , it gives rise , however , to some concern .
At present , approximately 30 % of MEPs are women .
In that connection , I wish to send a powerful appeal to all women to use their right to vote on 13 June .
Of the ten shadow commissioners , as they are called , who have been appointed from 1 May , three are women .
At the same time , I hope that , in connection with the appointment of the forthcoming Commission , the Member States will comply with the proposal from the Convention to the effect that all the Member States must nominate three candidates for the Commission , with representatives from both sexes .
