But on this issue , raised by myself and other colleagues back in 1995 , nothing has been done and nothing is likely to be done .
On the other hand , the idea of managing to control capital flows , both directly and indirectly , could not only turn out to be pure wishful thinking but also lead to a highly inefficient allocation of resources .
These , as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has said , proved extremely difficult : in fact it took four meetings , two exploratory ones and two at which we really tackled the substance of the matter .
I must say that we were assisted partly by an Austrian Presidency which was keen to move in the direction advocated by Parliament , and partly by the Commissioner , Mrs Cresson , who was of course on our side , given that Parliament 's proposal dovetailed with that of the Commission .
In our opinion , as we have said several times , this represented an infringement of the Treaty , or at least of the interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspective .
I invite the House to demonstrate its wholehearted support for the outcome of this conciliation .
I should now like to run through these rapidly .
Since information society applications have a satellite dimension , we are constantly in a situation of competitive disadvantage vis-Ã -vis the Americans ; I am therefore pleased to note that the programme takes this aspect into consideration .
The fifth framework programme would be impoverished if this openness were not ensured .
In this context , technology transfer and the involvement of third countries will add to the merits of the framework programme .
Among these I would single out an extremely important one : the quality of life and management of biological resources .
Europe has ample experience of research and applications in this field , and I would stress that - over and above all the ethical considerations - biotechnology and genetic engineering are having and will continue to have a crucial impact on the future of medicine and on our future well-being .
It seems to me that since then the Commissioner , Mr Liikanen , and the officials and Commissioners responsible have spared no efforts in attempting to respond to the serious and thoughtful stance adopted by Parliament in accordance with the Treaty .
We are a fortnight away from the introduction of the single currency and , as it happens , six months away from elections , and I am entirely convinced that Mr Pasty is initiating his election campaign .
The Court needs to provide us with concrete proposals as a basis for thorough discussions leading to the adoption of measures to facilitate its translation work .
This policy has already borne fruit and , if it is pursued further , will bring additional , appreciable savings for the Union 's budget .
How can the agricultural policy be improved through a proposal which in actual fact destroys the good parts of what exists at present ?
The French authorities consider that there are substantial differences whilst the British ski instructors do not agree , as you know .
Hence the importance of informing Europe 's citizens about the euro and ensuring that they appreciate its significance .
What do we intend to do for the other part of the population , the less fortunate groups , the ordinary citizens who will only encounter the euro once it is in their pockets in 2002 ?
What I would say , however , is that not only must the nature of the information be different , but so must the type of language and the practical methods used .
It is not a matter of repudiating the magnificent work done so far , and which has served our purpose so well , but this should be complemented by other , more suitable methods .
After the initiative launched with great media hype by the Jospin government in the run-up to the Amsterdam summit , we had hoped that an agreement would be in place after last December 's meeting of the Council in Luxembourg .
Vienna did not solve the problem of unemployment ; nor did it offer any concrete prospects for the creation of the third pillar , which is becoming increasingly important , given the enormous problems being caused by unregulated immigration and political connivance with the perpetrators of terrorism .
This should be of concern not only when outrages are committed , but also when seeking to prevent and overcome a political culture which indirectly protects terrorism and its authors .
The European Council in Vienna was the first one since the expansion of the borders of the so-called 'social democratic Europe ' .
All of which confirms , as I have already said , that this social democratic Europe may well be capable of winning elections , but is not yet proving capable of leading the continent .
Obviously this concept must be rejected but , clearly , Europe must take great pains not to appear always to be rapping others over the knuckles , as a schoolmaster does to a pupil .
This report stresses a concept which I regard as fundamental , namely the existence of an intrinsic link between the development of human rights and democracy and development per se .
At the dawn of the twenty-first century , human rights are still experiencing a sad autumn .
Yet I do believe that we can take some comfort from the recent extraordinary arrest of General Pinochet , for which the initiative came from a Spanish judge and which was carried out by the UK authorities , in our European area of freedom .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , every human life is unique and irreplaceable .
Appropriate institutional structures must be established and endowed with sufficient powers and financial resources to guarantee respect for the rights of men
