highest taxation on the resource which we most wish to use .
I think it is quite right to do as Mrs Waddington has done and compare this trafficking in women with the slave trade of the past .
People were able to participate in the slave trade of the past as long as they did not think that the people being shipped from African countries to countries around the world had any humanity .
But I still think that we must appeal to all the responsible men who do not buy minors and who do not buy people forced into prostitution , or even willing prostitutes .
Mr President , the problems surrounding terminal dues for international postal services and our recent decision about the EU Member States ' postal services and the Universal Postal Union as an institution are based on a view of postal distribution as a state monopoly , a view which is on the way to becoming increasingly out-of-date .
The complementary question which I would like to ask concerns the situation of private postal companies in connection with forthcoming European legislation , something which I think we have debated far too little in the European Parliament .
I did not see my name in yesterday 's Minutes from yesterday , but I was here .
I submitted two questions about the building work in Brussels and Strasbourg , one to the Commission and one to the Council of Ministers .
Since my questions were sent to the President of the Parliament , I would like to know who it is who decides whether questions may be asked in Parliament or not .
It must be possible to ask this kind of question .
In this area the President-in-Office of the Council has made use of the European Parliament 's ability to play a constructive role .
That has been demonstrated during the autumn .
However , consultation also involves exchange .
Such an exchange is necessary if Parliament is to be able to fulfil its important role as problem-solver in the European process .
Parliament must know the reason in order to be able to present new solutions and work out the difficult questions .
If the Council does not explain its points of view , the debate can come to a standstill , just as the IGC process showed before the decision on the Amsterdam Treaty .
Admittedly , we in the Green Group do not agree with you on all questions , but we think you have done a very good job to be able to keep track of all the 700 amendments which there were on the Committee .
This has a lot to do with money , but it also has a lot to do with details , which Mr Desama talked about earlier .
The existing source of energy in my own country of Sweden , for example , is in fact nuclear power .
That is the area where we must invest more money , not in keeping old nuclear power , which Sweden , for example , is now finally beginning to phase out .
There are many fine words about sustainable development , but we also need to show by example .
With regard to Amendment No 160 we have added a proposal which is basically that we want to clarify that 60 per cent of what goes to energy for the future should be for renewable sources of energy and 75 % for demonstration .
I would also like to say that I appreciate the reports the Commission has made against various countries for breaching the procurement regulation , including the report directed at my own country of Sweden .
Therefore there is an idea that we should set up some kind of procurement ombudsman , i .e . someone who could receive these reports and make a case against the local and government authorities who do not follow the rules .
I would like to say to the Commissioner that what I believe Mr Sj√∂stedt and also Mr Cornelissen are seeking is not a measure of these indirect effects , which are of course always the result of everything , but what people want is quite simply a solid statistical basis with regard to the precise financial payments inwards and outwards .
It is also the case that each budget item obviously has a destination in a particular country .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer .
Our vision is to achieve zero injuries and zero deaths in one year .
Lastly I would just like to put a follow-up question : Does the Commissioner believe that during the next year more concrete initiatives are going to be taken on the basis of this programme ?
I think that the reply from the Commissioner is good with regard to the general contributions which the EU and the Commission can make , such as providing and gathering information .
It would be very interesting to know , based on what we are now discussing , which kinds of traffic are safer or less safe , especially which kinds are safer , so that we who are able to encourage traffic measures concentrate on the right kind of traffic .
That is no longer so .
That is also why the OECD agreement of 1994 raised such hopes in Sweden that fairer terms of global competition would make it possible to begin to compete again when new tonnage was to be built .
In my party we have also proposed that Sweden should again be able to give the shipbuilding industry a limited state subsidy in order to be on equal terms with other countries .
It is also my conviction that Sweden is going to remain outside monetary union for the foreseeable future .
