, to try and reach a joint and multilateral solution .
That was the final point in a long journey that began who knows where , conducted in just as unclear a manner and ending anywhere , it might be Hanover or any European port .
Madam President , we too support this report , because it breaks through the so-called open doors as well .
Age is important as well , to avoid speculative transactions spanning this intervention .
All of this must therefore prompt the European Union to intervene in a practical way , above all by starting a campaign to make public opinion and tour operators aware of this issue , with the aid of the mass media .
It is vital that as part of the fight against sex tourism the Commission should first and foremost take on the role of promoter in terms of pressing for and coordinating specific measures to dissuade and punish sex tourism of any kind , either in the tourists ' countries of origin or in the countries which are tourist destinations , cooperating closely with the ONGs whose action in the field is indisputably effective .
It is always difficult to respond to distress and frustration with reasoned policies and rational proposals .
However , in the report I also read of attention to the value of children in themselves , in their rights , and it is in light of this value that I interpret paragraph 27 , which as far as I am concerned deals with political responsibility , as being much better than paragraph 29 .
The protagonist in this debate is Parliament which is the first of the Community institutions to bring forward proposals and forecast the prospects for reforming the fishing industry .
Fishing involves artisans , it involves industry and it involves cooperatives .
The issue of the common fisheries policy after 2002 is a highly significant subject for the European Union and therefore also very controversial .
We also think that the fisheries agreements with the ACP countries in particular should be revised so as to provide sufficient scientific and technical cooperation in the monitoring and control of resources to guarantee their conservation .
I believe that this is an extremely positive fact which must be greeted with approval .
With regard to article 4 which relates to the conditions for the burden of proof , we believe that the Council 's decision to reject the last sentence which refers to residual doubt on the grounds that it only relates to criminal proceedings is unfounded in the sense that with this sentence the directive is leaving it to judges to decide on prima facie cases but where doubt persists , it determines that the burden of proof should be borne by the employer since he has all the information at his disposal .
We have therefore been waiting ten years for a directive along these lines .
In the meantime there has been considerable legal precedent , which this directive , by its nature , should take into account .
In the Sainjon report , therefore , the multinationals are re-evaluated as the driving force for prosperity through job-creating investment as well as promoters of the modern job culture , acting as ambassadors and almost de facto social operators in developing countries through their voluntary codes of self-regulation .
To round off quickly , I congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done .
Whereas stainless steel will be recycled into consumer goods and investment for the everyday life of the citizen , what is to be done with the other materials which have no other use except as new coins , like copper-plated iron which , once discarded , is no use for working iron or copper , as it is contaminated ?
However , I do not think the report has been analyzed in sufficient depth and the amendments have been discussed in vain .
This proposal is therefore the result of a lengthy consultation process involving the business sector , consumers ' organizations and associations for blind people .
And for what reason ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with regard to Mr Imaz San Miguel 's report , I do not have much to add , since , as the rapporteur said , it concerns small technical changes that will improve the conservation of resources with the use of more selective fishing gear .
But we cannot impose solutions on Mauritania , since it is a sovereign country acting in its own territorial waters .
I did not attend simply because I do not yet have the ability to be in more than one place at the same time .
That is not a complaint , it is a regret .
I would like to point out that I have had to complain several times , including in writing , as chairman of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , that the its reports end up being discussed at very odd times : either late in the evening or at the very end of the sitting .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , the Kyoto meeting provides the opportunity to face the problem of climate change caused by anthropic activity with greater rigour .
This point has been dealt with in Mr Linkohr 's report .
The winds are strong and devastating at times .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , while technical in nature , this rule change has a certain symbolism , particularly when debated in this Chamber , which we are sharing with the Council of Europe at least until next year .
Maintaining a formally closer link than that of the other European parliamentary bodies seemed important to the majority of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , although it was possible to take advantage Mr Ford 's resolution aimed at changing the nature of our relations
