Within the means at its disposal the Commission is working with the United Nations mission in Kosovo - Unmik - through the European Agency for Reconstruction , to eliminate these threats according to priorities for intervention .
Mr President , in response to Mr Alavanos 's first question , I am informed that the report from the expert committee that is being convened under the Euratom Treaty will be published within weeks rather than months , so it is in the relatively near future .
As regards the detailed response that is justified to the question on health problems , there is a great deal of material at the Commission and certainly I , or indeed my responsible colleagues , would be happy to give full details to the honourable Member of whatever is at their disposal .
This would be rather more useful than my trying to make a recitation in the limited time available in this House .
Mr President , as I indicated in my first answer , there are certain budgetary limitations that have the effect of restricting some of the actions that we undertake in the region , not only as the Commission but also in our cooperative activities with other organisations .
I am certain that the honourable Member recognises the nature of those limitations .
It therefore means that on some occasions it is quite probable that the activities to secure decontamination and protection for public health are not as extensive as , ideally , we would like them to be .
The fact remains , however , that the Commission , acting on behalf of the Union , is probably the lead actor in all the activities to improve conditions of public health and to provide for decontamination and environmental protection .
So far as the NATO statement of last month on plutonium is concerned , I am not in a position to give a comprehensive answer at this stage .
I am certain that if the honourable Member wanted to write explicitly on the NATO statement and the possibility of the use of plutonium and its side effects in that region , either in the course of acts of war or otherwise , my colleagues in the Commission would be more than ready to provide a comprehensive reply .
I invite the honourable Member either to write directly to me on the subject - and I will certainly see it gets to the right quarters - or to take it up directly either in the committee of which he is a member or specifically with one of my fellow Commissioners .
Mr President , the Commission 's attention was given to the use of depleted uranium in armour-piercing shells as long ago as 1993 .
At that time , the Commission 's reply to Parliament related to the specific issue of the test-firing of shells in coastal waters , and it offered the view that such action would not have a significant impact on the environment .
The Commission continues to hold that view on the basis of the evidence that , in the marine environment , the only exposure pathway is the slow dissolution of uranium .
It is important to note that the amount of uranium that could be dissolved is very small compared to the natural abundance of uranium in all sea-water .
The movement of uranium away from the test-firing location by tides and currents could not , therefore , be distinguished from natural background concentrations .
The Commission understands public concern about the use of depleted uranium materials for military purposes .
However , the Commission draws attention to the fact that the firing of uranium penetrators at land-based targets has implications which are different from those of firing ammunition in the marine environment , because use on land can result in the dispersion of uranium oxides which may subsequently be inhaled , whilst that is clearly not the case in the marine environment .
Mr President , it is not a question of the Commission in any sense being complacent , either politically - because it is responsible to the public - or indeed scientifically .
The points that I made in my earlier response related to the natural concentrations of uranium in sea-water of all descriptions and in all locations .
On the basis of that scientific reality the feeling of the Commission and all other scientifically advised persons and bodies is that the evidence of uranium deposit in sea-water is such that the firing of shells for target purposes in the marine environment does not make any significant addition to uranium concentrations .
It is only on the basis of that widely accepted and well-documented scientific evidence that the Commission takes its view .
In addition , I did draw attention in my first answer to the strong distinction that has to be made between possible consequences of the use of depleted uranium material and munitions in a land environment where the oxides can be inhaled , and in a maritime environment where the consequences of the use of depleted uranium do not have the same consequences , since obviously no inhalation can take place .
Can I draw the honourable Member 's attention to the title of the question he set down earlier .
The title of the question was " Radioactive pollution of the Aegean and Ionian Seas " .
The answer was given , not only now but as long ago as 1993 , based very heavily on strong scientific evidence in relation to that question .
If the honourable Member has evidence to support the contention that there has been damage as a consequence of target firing , either to the coasts of Greece or indeed of Turkey , or to islands in the Aegean or Ionian Seas , I know , that as a conscientious
