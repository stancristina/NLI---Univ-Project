If the Council makes promises with regard to every crisis without considering the financial implications , we will reach a dead end .
Mr President , I would still like to raise a couple of points .
Employment is an important issue .
It is in small and medium-sized enterprises in particular that jobs are created .
This would mean , for example , that the Structural Funds could be used more effectively to prevent unemployment .
We would like to extend this list .
We should just ensure that the links that are to be built should , as far as possible , pass through EU territory .
The Northern Dimension also offers immense scope for cooperation in the field of cultural and research policy and higher education .
The importance of that was reflected in the debate on the Structural Funds .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly my many thanks go to Mr Bradbourn for his sterling work and his report .
Unfortunately , I see Marco Polo as being part of the Commission 's programme to forcibly shift traffic from the roads to the railways .
It is true that road transport is responsible for a lot of congestion and pollution , but that is due to the fact that there simply is no other means of transport that compares to it .
Freight transport is forced onto the roads because it is the most effective option .
The citizens of Europe pay for transport and if it does not run efficiently and cheaply in Europe , we all suffer the consequences .
If we start off that way , it is all the same whether the share of road traffic is 1 % or 100 % .
The interoperatability of different transport modes , where we get something that works very well from the whole , is important .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Bradbourn , for his thorough work .
The enlargement of the EU will also bring with it new challenges as transportation routes get longer .
No mode of transport should be excluded from the programme .
The aim must be to move from a more polluting mode of transport to more environmentally friendly transport solutions .
In concentrating only on new projects there is a clear danger of distortions of competition in relation to the old ones .
It is right that the regulation should include a separate mention of sea transport and keep the reference to 'motorways of the seas ' .
As the rapporteur said , threshold values for all types of action in the Commission proposal are too high .
We support Amendment No 29 tabled by the Group of the Greens and other amendments which aim to prevent and reduce unnecessary traffic .
In the longer term we hope that Marco Polo will prove worthwhile and attract additional funding .
Mr President , my report concerns the improvement of fuel quality .
Everyone will surely recall the directive we drafted in the codecision procedure in 1998 , which established quality requirements for diesel fuel and petrol for the first time in the European Union and which has had a decisive part to play in reducing emissions of traffic exhaust .
This time we are faced with the challenge of having to reduce the sulphur content of fuel to very nearly zero for both diesel fuel and normal petrol .
This will not be possible unless we remove the sulphur from diesel and petrol .
If you recall , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission originally proposed that all fuels should be absolutely sulphur-free by 2011 .
Several Member States have realised that a very effective way to purify fuel is to offer small tax concessions in relation to normal fuel , and this practice , which originated in Scandinavia , in Sweden and Finland , has now spread to very many Member States .
I would like to make special mention of the United Kingdom , which has actively adopted this tax concession tool and derived good results from it .
Machinery includes tractors and any kind of small but very often extremely noisy machines that are used , for example , in parks to blow leaves .
I can assure you all that the latest research on this subject shows that removing the sulphur from fuels used in machinery as well really is worthwhile economically and in terms of the environment and health .
With this proposal we are working on the assumption that by 2009 the fuel used in machinery will also be sulphur-free .
The report proposes a two-stage approach .
Firstly the sulphur content of fuels used in machinery would be reduced to 350 mg per kilogram and then by 2009 the sulphur content would be eliminated totally .
I believe we have a good chance of obtaining clear and binding scheduled targets with regard to this issue .
Mention is also made of vapour pressure .
In my position as rapporteur , I have tried to look into this responsibly and I have acquired as much useful information on the subject as has been available .
That examination would take place in 2005 .
However , as rapporteur , I have not considered it possible that we could , with any degree of responsibility , alter this property of the fuel in the report at this stage , as certain doubts remain in connection with this about not only exhaust emissions but also the possible adverse effects of these biofuel blends on vehicles and engines .
However , vehicle manufacturers have got in touch with me and said that this is not the case .
I will now end my speech and say that we also need sulphur-free fuels because we must be able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars .
The inverse of this can also
