in this House .
For the ELDR Group , it is important to emphasise that the liberalisation already implemented by a range of sectors has generally been a great success .
At the same time , the issue of whether or not Parliament should demand a framework directive has been of crucial importance to the ELDR Group’s support for the present report .
I should like to emphasise that the ELDR Group does not support a framework directive .
The purpose of a horizontal directive would be to freeze a number of areas which , as we know by experience , develop the whole time .
On the contrary , we should support further liberalisation , but on equal conditions .
In the ELDR Group , we are , as I say , convinced that it will be neither possible nor desirable in a framework directive to establish any usable definitions of services of such different kinds as are at issue in this House , at the same time bearing in mind the large regional and national differences that exist in the area of services of general interest .
We therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission ’s reflections concerning a legal initiative to clarify this issue .
If it were a question of a legal initiative , we should , however , greatly regret the fact that the existing Treaty does not give us in the European Parliament power of codecision concerning such an initiative .
On the contrary , we believe that such a duty could easily go hand in hand with liberalisation and , for example , environmental requirements , if only the political authority were to require this .
I want us to obtain more value for money .     Mr President , at the Brussels Summit in December 2003 , the Heads of State or Government agreed to domiciles for ten new agencies , including an agency for IT security .
In the Øresund area , universities and business enterprises on both the Danish and Swedish sides formed a consortium and put forward proposals as to how good conditions could in practice be created for locating precisely this IT security agency in the area .
The Øresund region has a sound infrastructure , good international transport connections , very extensive IT facilities and strong environments for IT research and development .
In short , here was an offer , in terms of location , that could guarantee a rapid start to the agency in an area easily able to attract qualified labour .
What emerged from the efforts concerned , however ?
The EU’s Heads of State or Government agreed that this agency should be situated in a town in Greece .
It is neither transparent nor comprehensible to the public .
The decision concerning a new agency must be transparent and based on analyses of advantages and disadvantages .
It is important for the Commission to have ongoing responsibility and for Parliament to have the role of supervisory power and not be governed by the agencies .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party’s amendments are to emphasise this , and I very much hope that there will be broad support for these proposals .     The Danish Social Democratic delegation has today voted in favour of a series of amendments which , in terms of safety and the environment , will tighten up the original proposals .
We finally chose , however , to abstain from voting in favour of these reports as a whole , because we do not think that the proposals go far enough regarding safety and environmental protection and because we are generally opposed to the use of nuclear energy .     Madam President , my question is also about the short declaration or short announcement about taking legal proceedings against the Council .
What would the consequences be ?
What does the Commission mean when it says that it is exclusively procedural elements that the challenge will concentrate on ?     Madam President , it was in February 2001 that the Commission adopted the action programme ‘Accelerated action against HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction’ .
There is a need for a stronger and more coherent strategy .
Almost 20 000 deaths – not per year , not per month but daily , and it is the poorest countries ’ populations that are absolutely the hardest hit .
There is therefore a need for greater concerted effort in a number of related areas .
Medicines of proper quality must be produced in sufficient quantities .
The prices must be within the financial reach of governments and populations , and the medicines must be available to all .
In this context , I should particularly like to emphasise the need for increased and continued support for the global fund for combating HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria .
This continent receives 60 % of the resources .
For example , a contribution from the fund to Haiti in 2002 has put the country in a position to reopen a public health clinic and operating theatre , provide five public clinics with important medicine and provide basic laboratory services to four clinics .
In that case , the fund’s resources are not only helping Haiti’s efforts to prevent and treat HIV and tuberculosis but also mean an overall improvement in health in an area of 250 000 inhabitants .
I would urgently call upon both the Commission and the Member States to contribute no less than that amount , and I support the amendments by the Group of the Party of European Socialists , which make this undertaking clearer and more precise .
That is downright unethical , and the EU absolutely must respond to this catastrophic situation .
The Commission ’s reflections on specific legislative instruments to promote research and development into neglected and poverty-related diseases could point to one of the solutions .
