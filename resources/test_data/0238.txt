In the case of Greece and of both parts of the island of Ireland there are obvious geographical obstacles to full participation in a single rail market .
In these circumstances , full implementation of the Rail Package would result in a considerable burden on the administrations of these Member States without any of the benefits to consumers that the Package is designed to bring about .
The amendments which I tabled to Mr Jarzembowski' s and Mr Swoboda ' s reports aimed at restoring the equilibrium established by the common position .
The Council position is , I believe , in the best interests of both the rail industry and the consumer .
I would further like to point out that the derogation for Ireland , Northern Ireland , Greece and Luxembourg only covers those elements of the package where implementation would serve no real and practical purpose .
Furthermore , there are even in-built safeguard clauses in this derogation which would cause the whole derogation to lapse should any new entrant to the rail markets of Ireland or Greece appear .
In summary , colleagues , as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism I recognise the desirability of developing a single market in rail-service provision and the potential benefits for the consumer .
The granting of a derogation to the geographically-separated rail networks of Ireland , Northern Ireland and Greece does not in any way undermine this principle .
On the other hand , removal of the derogation would impose unnecessary administrative burdens and costs in these Member States without bringing any visible benefits to anyone concerned .
Mr President , as I and many colleagues have argued for some time , the monetary union project is profoundly dangerous .
It is economically naive and will do huge macroeconomic damage .
Politically it is clearly intended to undermine the nation state , and thus it threatens democracy in Europe .
The proposal before us talks of information on the euro , but we already have all the information we need .
Every newspaper I open has stories about the euro .
Banks and accountancy firms are running seminars and briefing clients .
This is not about information , this is about propaganda .
I do not trust the Commission to provide unbiased information .
The very idea is absurd .
I was particularly horrified by the idea of Mrs Randzio-Plath that we should actually enrol schoolchildren as the stormtroopers of this euro propaganda blitz .
Now , if the 12 euro countries wish to undertake a propaganda campaign , that is no business of mine .
But in three countries , Denmark , Sweden and Great Britain , the euro decision is not yet made .
It would be a gross abuse of the democratic process for the Commission to undertake a euro propaganda campaign in those countries before referenda on the currency take place .
It would be outrageous to take money from the taxpayer and to use it to influence the voters ' decision .
In Britain , 70 % of people are opposed to joining the euro .
We do not want our money spent on promoting it either in the UK or elsewhere .
I therefore have two demands to make of the Commission .
Firstly , please tell us today that no such campaign will be undertaken in Great Britain , Denmark or Sweden .
Secondly , please assure us that the share of funding which might have been spent on those countries is returned to their national exchequers so that people can see clearly and transparently that their money has not been squandered on objectives they do not support .
Better still , cancel the whole project and put all the funds into a special account to help defray the enormous costs that will be incurred when the euro is eventually dismantled .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs let me state in very clear and simple terms the position of the committee as we voted ; ( a ) to ban all phthalates and ( b ) as a consequence to delete all labelling , since if you prohibit all phthalates you do not need labelling .
As the rapporteur , I share the concerns of the Members of Parliament in my committee .
As elected politicians we clearly cannot afford to play fast and loose with children 's health .
We must ensure that they are not exposed to unnecessary and unacceptable health risks and acknowledge the public concern on this issue .
In the interests of the single market we must achieve the highest common standards for product safety .
We also need legislation which cannot be undermined or discredited by legal challenges .
This debate has unfortunately been clouded by confusion and uncertainty fuelled by comments in Parliament from Scientific Committee members who doubted the need for any ban on phthalates and questioned whether the health risks are serious or immediate enough to warrant a ban .
As politicians we need clear advice from scientific committees if we are to make rational judgements , take the necessary risk management measures and produce good legislation .
In this case we have not been able to do that effectively because of the gaps in our knowledge , and so my committee understandably decided to go for a blanket ban .
Nor do we have any information on substitutes to plasticisers which might have toxic or chronic effects .
I believe that this legislation shows us that we need action on a number of areas : ( a ) we urgently need to continue work on migration testing and research into chronic toxicity and the behaviour of children ; ( b ) we need to review and update this legislation periodically and as gaps in knowledge are filled , where necessary add new substances to the ban in the
