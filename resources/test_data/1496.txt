And perhaps we can help the Chinese and Mauritanians to carry out this activity with a certain amount of moderation and restriction .
Having said that , we must insist , as Mr Imaz San Miguel has already said , that Parliament firmly maintains its position , as did the Commission in its day , that the appropriate legal basis for the regulation on the fisheries agreement with Mauritania , Regulation 408/97 , is the second subparagraph of article 228( 3 ) , in conjunction with article 43 , which remains valid as regards form .
Secondly , at a time when public sectors or parts of public sectors are being privatized , I want to stress the need to analyze the other concentrations of interests to which the outflow of public capital from these sectors can give rise .
The Commissioner is sensitive to these issues , but I think he is going to have to tread particularly carefully in these discussions .
I would be grateful , Mr President , if you could approach the airport authorities on our behalf to sort out this scheduling problem once and for all .
Therefore , although we agree with the report , we think that certain basic elements should be introduced , such as the European Union 's firm commitment , given in Toronto , to move towards reduction , and not towards the precise opposite , which is what is happening .
That is what we actually have .
Next , I think we have to make a clear distinction between problems caused by the emission of gases in general , on the one hand , and the overall phenomenon of climate change on the other .

A lot of data was published recently in an article by a renowned specialist .
I would like this Parliament 's sympathy to be conveyed to Mr Ignacio Velázquez , the President of that city 's autonomous authorities , together with our solidarity with the victims , and with those who have suffered such terrible losses .
The first question is about substantive errors .
It is clear that there is still a lack of cooperation between these institutions and the Court of Auditors .
We need to evaluate jointly the work done by the Committee of Inquiry and the Temporary Committee .
There are indications of the distortions which can arise in the decisionmaking process , and also of problems with implementation .
For example , there are still shortcomings in the use of risk materials in the pharmaceuticals industry .
Mr President , as rapporteur for the report which was approved by the European Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry , I should first like to congratulate the chair of the Temporary Committee , Mrs Dagmar Roth-Behrendt , and the committee 's rapporteur , Mr Böge , for all their hard work in finishing what was started by my report , and what was approved by Parliament at the time .
It is unimaginable that the European Union should continue to function on the basis of the sovereignty of the Member States , with a totally free interaction of market forces , and a lack of effective Commission powers in health and other areas which are important for the welfare of its citizens .
As to the reorganization of services , I think it should be speeded up .
Research in this area has been promoted , provided with funds , and coordinated .
Interinstitutional collaboration should be the trademark for constructing the Europe we all want .
It is a question of having a realistic approach to all the controversial questions relating to worker involvement ; of finding formulae which go further than just information and consultation ; and achieving worker representation which enjoys real involvement , and is not limited to just being on the receiving end of a little information .

Mr President , my second surname is González .
You ask if there are programmes specifically for women .

But " country ' means country , whether the word is used in a political document or an annex to a political document , which is what this is .
Whether the Commissioner will be able to use these arguments , or the Commission 's own , to convince the fifteen young people who have been invited to attend the second day of the Luxembourg summit is another matter .
Also , the methods we have chosen , of direct assistance , do not work as well as earnings-related fiscal advantages .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , this report was submitted by the Commission before the Members of this House had ever heard of any Agenda 2000 document , even in draft form .
Variations in employment , research and many other areas also showed that we were a long way from achieving the European Union 's cohesion objectives .
