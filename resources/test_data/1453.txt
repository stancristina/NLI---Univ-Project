but also visible in the appropriations provided .
These are tools for adjusting economic policy decisions , since these policies prop up the single Economic and Monetary Union , which lacks precise statistical instruments .
This is why the Member States have submitted many requests for exemptions .
Council Directive 2003/96/EC , restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity has become the main legal base in the field of energy taxation , guaranteeing all the current Member States transitional arrangements that will enable them to adjust their national legislation .
The ultimate aim of Directive 2003/48/EC is to enable savings income in the form of interest payments made in one Member State to beneficial owners to be made subject to effective taxation , thus guaranteeing an equitable tax treatment of savings and Member States’ rights to tax their residents ’ income , at European level , whilst at the same time removing artificial incentives to the flow of capital in the EU and beyond .
We must work on ways of coordinating taxation in order to tax capital movements and cross-border stock transfers at Community level .     .
Regardless of what one might think of the proposals as a whole and given that we are seeking to create an internal market , one can understand the need to establish a degree of tax harmonisation to combat tax evasion and double taxation .
Our concern is that the directive must not make tax evasion easier or deprive Member States of the appropriate means with which to combat fraud and abuse .     .
With the increase in the number of judges – from 15 to 25 – following enlargement , it is proposed that this quorum should be set at 15 .
Under the terms of this proposal , the Court would increase the number of judges in the Grand Chamber to thirteen , with the minimum number of judges required to be sitting remaining at nine .
The draft Council decision seeks to include , in light of the new division of jurisdiction in direct actions and the enlargement of the EU , Estonian , Hungarian , Latvian , Lithuanian , Maltese , Polish , Slovak , Slovene and Czech amongst the working languages established under Article 35 of the Court’s Rules of Procedure .
The draft Council decision on which the European Parliament is being consulted seeks , therefore , to add these languages to the list contained in Article 29( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice .
We should , therefore , always give consideration to protecting the language of each EU Member State .     .
This is the type of development that will ensure equality between Member States , which is a key value for preserving the European Union as an area of freedom and diversity .     .
The proposal consolidates , in a single legal act , the requirements in the field of animal health for importing live ungulate animals and provides for a list to be laid down of third countries from which Member States may import such animals as well as the health requirements to be met .
This proposal for a regulation is intended to be a vital tool in implementing Article 104 of the Treaty – under the excessive deficit procedure .
The major concern over this instrument is , therefore , political , especially with regard to its purpose .
Employers must determine and assess risks and inform the workers of these risks .
The common position also sets action values , measurable parameters which , if observed , will ensure that exposure limit values are not exceeded .
This directive must also contain a provision relating to the penalties to be enforced under national legislation pursuant to the directive .     .
The task of achieving equality between men and women is a vital one for the EU , which has an obligation to be proactive in promoting all actions to this end .
The purpose of this proposal is to establish a basic act for operating grants to be awarded to the European Women’s Lobby and to other organisations active at European level in the field of equality .
The rapporteur proposes that the common position be approved , with just one additional article on the ‘transitional clauses’ , already agreed with the Council .     .
The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities should have a duty to provide a voice and a clear vision for the majority of women , for diversity and a plurality of opinions and interests .
This led the EU to draw up Council Regulation (EC ) No 2836/98 on integrating gender issues in development cooperation .
As I stated at first reading , measures must be funded in the area of development cooperation to combat poverty and disease and to develop solutions for education , within a culture of safeguarding basic human rights .
It must be specified that the term ‘sexual and reproductive health ’ refers to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases , such as HIV/AIDS , and to the provision of decent conditions for pregnancy , labour , childbirth and post-natal care .     .
Lastly , I should like to express my agreement with Amendment No 6 , which is intended to ensure that the Commission does not have the general power to amend Annexes I and II , adopted under codecision by Parliament and the Council .     .
The central figure in the proposed system of official controls is the official veterinarian , who should be provided with both the legal and the technical means to carry out his duties , and this entails public funding .
The intention is , therefore , to enforce hygiene rules at all stages , from the farm to the table
