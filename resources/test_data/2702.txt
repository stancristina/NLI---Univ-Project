wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .
The regulations must therefore be reviewed , and I thank you , Commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have brought you a small gift .
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?
Next , we have flags of convenience .
Quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .
Next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old .
It happened to sink there , and Brittany , where I come from , should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula , and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks .
We would like to know their names and their faces .
Therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Commission will therefore make use of every instrument it has in order to help the affected Member States in this reconstruction and to provide any possible aid to the people and businesses affected .
Powers for programming actions and selecting priorities have , as you know , been devolved to each State .
I would like to say that the EAGGF could also allocate a Community cofinancing grant for the storage of wood .
As far as I am concerned , I shall endeavour to do that myself this week , when I visit , the day after tomorrow , two French departments which have been particularly badly affected by the storms : Charente-Maritime , affected both by the hurricane and the oil slick , and Creuse .
For the moment , of course , the Commission has neither the manpower nor the financial resources to take responsibility for such a task .
The risks of weather-related disasters must not be ignored and , in the light of the consequences of such disasters and the speed of intervention that they require , I think that the Community would do well to have these resources again .
Prices have already fallen because of the huge availability of timber , which has led to market saturation .
This means , of course , that today we must send out a powerful message of solidarity to everyone affected by the storm and to the families that have lost a loved one .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union , in terms of the help that we can offer them .
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .
I clearly heard what Commissioner Barnier was saying and indeed I appreciate his proposals , but personally , I would not set emergency goals and long-term goals in opposition to one another .
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .
As a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .
Our priority , as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States .
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .
I want to discharge my responsibilities seriously .
Some of you are extremely knowledgeable and competent in these matters , even if , in the past , I have happened to write several works on ecological and environmental issues .
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women ?
However , I agree with the previous speaker that , if paragraph 9 were challenged , this motion would clearly lose its substance .
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and , like Mr DÃ©sir and several other speakers , I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect .
Well , patently , if we do open this debate today , Madam President , as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting , on the basis of Rule 50 , we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments , enabling some other majority in this Parliament , at some future time , to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free , regular , peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State .
Is it really putting words into someone ' s mouth , if we pay attention to what a political leader has been saying for many years , when it shows an obvious tendency to go against everything that we want
