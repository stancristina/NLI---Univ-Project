In recent years , the trend has been reversed , which is extremely odd considering the efforts made by the Western world : in certain areas of our planet , the number of undernourished people is constantly on the up and the problem is heightened by natural disasters or , even worse , wars , which have continued to hit the headlines recently .
Europe has always been one of the highest-producing continents in the agricultural sector .
As you are aware , this project was blocked by the Swiss referendum in December 1992 , when , albeit by a very narrow majority , the Swiss citizens decided to block the entry of the Swiss Confederation into the European Community .
That was the beginning of a period of uncertainty , of widely sectoral agreements , which is being brought to an end by this package of seven agreements , which are closely related to the economy but which are also wide-reaching and of general interest .
In 1992 , the people of Switzerland were called upon to pronounce judgement on Switzerland ' s accession , whereas on 21 May they will be asked to approve or reject a package of strictly economic agreements which do not have the political implications of the 1992 agreements .
Well !
I would also like to use these few , precious seconds allotted to me to point out that it would have been appropriate for these measures governing transport and , in particular , air transport in Europe , to make provision for young and elderly people who enjoy travelling , and that it would have been appropriate to provide flight discounts for them - but not necessarily during peak hours or on peak days - thereby promoting cultural exchanges among both young and elderly people from different States of the European Union .
The effect of these actions is therefore damaging , whatever the motive behind them .
The impression they get is that we intend to make the farming sector increasingly less productive in economic terms .
I tabled a question to the Commission , calling upon them to do something about the genuinely appalling issue of those insurance companies which set high premiums and then do not pay citizens from certain parts of the Community what they are entitled to .
Nevertheless , although we are competent when it comes to regulating the matter , as the Rothley report is doing in relations between the different Member States , I feel that we ought to challenge the insurance companies to avoid blatant discrimination , to set the same premiums for all , to pay claimants what they are actually entitled to and to ensure that this sector is improved , or adapted in some way to the changing requirements of our society .
" Now , it does not seem right to me for a person who is 70 or 80 years old to be considered worthless , and I therefore call for care to be taken that morally acceptable payments are made when the victims of road accidents are elderly .
Madam President , I voted for the measure tabled by Mr Jeggle on the Commission proposals on the prices for agricultural products .
This is because I feel that we should change the way we support and provide aid to agricultural products in the European Union .
The same report states that these EUR 1 019 million which have disappeared as a result of fraud are only the tip of the iceberg .
In this sense , we ought to ask the Commission - and insist on a reply - whether realistic estimates of the quantities of material to be incinerated are already available to us , whether they have already been made or whether this still remains to be done , according to the various classification procedures of the States , together with an evaluation of the resulting organisational economic burdens , with subsequent referral to Parliament .
As far as the latter is concerned , Community programmes for nuclear research are established by the Council which , pursuant to Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty , acts unanimously on Commission proposals .
In our opinion , the open method of coordination , which was introduced on an experimental basis in Lisbon , should allow for the full exploitation of the connection between growth and employment , which , we feel , cannot be ignored .
The subsidiarity principle needs to be steered in this direction with regard to the role both of the governments and of the decentralised institutions , without diminishing the decisive part played by greater synergy , greater coordination between the broad guidelines , and by placing greater focus on the European Community dimension with a view to developing an economic policy which can enhance the potential for development in Europe and allow us to effectively achieve the goals which we set ourselves with regard to full employment .
This is one of the shortcomings of the euro , a currency which is suffering from a structural crisis and inflexible , excessively regulated markets .
On the subject of this last point , as the Katiforis report stressed , there has been a slight fall in unemployment in Europe , but unemployment is still unacceptably high , particularly as regards the level of unemployment among women and young people .
They are outdated and obsoleted by events and do not contain any prospect of a solution to the extremely serious problems which are both holding back economic development and , in particular , weighing down the citizens .
I refer to the constant pressure with regard to restricting welfare expenditure , structural reform of the labour market and privatisation of the telecommunications and energy sectors .
It is deplorable to talk of democracy and human rights and then not give Members the right to read the texts in their
