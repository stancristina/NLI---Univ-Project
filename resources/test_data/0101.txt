There may be unanimity regarding the aim ; there are , however , clear political differences when it comes to the choice of remedies and how they are prioritised .
We would like to stress that excessive regulation , too much faith in the omnipotence of legislation , and burdensome taxation are the worst enemies of employment .
We would also like to emphasise that an innovative and information-based economy , in which everyone is given equal opportunities and individuals are given the right to get ahead and live their lives according to their own goals , means making the European labour markets a lot more flexible .
Another way of increasing efficiency is to strengthen our educational systems by making them more adaptable to the needs of individuals .
If we want to become the world ' s best economy , we have to ask ourselves a few questions .
Have Sweden , and Finland too , seen success as IT countries in Europe and achieved peak growth because they have imposed more and more regulation ?
Has Ireland succeeded through regulation ?
No, it has deregulated and supported external investments by means of tax concessions , doing so well that we even have to give it a telling off for its success .
They are those I have mentioned , and not the well-intentioned but ineffective remedies of guardianship , control , and planning , which our socialist friends so greatly favour .
The Council must achieve results quickly in its continued programme of liberalisation and improving the business climate , especially now that we are clearly headed for a period of uncertainty , with the USA in the lead , as prices on the stock markets fall and confidence weakens in companies and amongst consumers .
Although the decisions taken at Tampere on a common security area have remained in the background in the debate , their implementation has been just as slow , if not slower , than the Lisbon process .
At the moment , two countries , Spain and Britain , could torpedo efforts to achieve air safety and increased efficiency by squabbling over the insignificant airport at Gibraltar .
It is hard to believe that the same countries are advising how to solve the Balkan crisis or the situation that has flared up in the Middle East .
I might even say you are welcome to join our group when your ministerial term has finished , as what you said was so much to our liking .
Mr President , Commissioner , it must be rather dull to listen to these speeches here at this time of the evening , particularly when we are so unanimously agreed in matters .
The committee ' s proposals form a coherent whole and also contain some practical and concrete measures to bring the system into effect .
This is a requirement that we should propose if we want to achieve a genuinely viable European internal market for financial services within the next few years .
We can never achieve the ambitious aims of Lisbon if the reform of one directive on the financial markets is to take ten years , as has tended to be the case with the present system , if we take the UCITS directive as an example .
Parliament has taken its role as the EU' s second legislative body seriously and responsibly .
For that reason , delegating the responsibility of technical legislation to the committee to be set up is basically not a problem for us .
This , however , does not weaken the demand Parliament is making in plain terms in the form of the 'callback ' mechanism .
This sort of system , which would take the concerns of both Parliament and the Council into account , must also be created on the basis of the Lamfalussy report .
When I was given this report in January 2000 I thought it might be quite easy .
After listening to the Council 's worries I decided to table some amendments to the Commission proposal in order to reach a wide consensus at first reading .
It enables reliable comparison of government deficits within the framework of excessive deficit procedure .
The differing statistics on unemployment are one of the best-known examples .
Different ways of compiling , calculating and documenting data on real unemployment renders comparisons between Member States difficult .
The possibility of reliable comparison of statistical information on the accounts also increases the transparency of our public administrations .
The different levels are : lies , big lies and statistics .
The majority of the delegations expressed reservations about the proposed reclassification as it could lead to changes in the level of government deficit within the framework of the excessive deficit procedure .
The ECB has also approved this system of two definitions , even if they would prefer legal acts with only one definition for important statistical indicators .
Excluding swaps and forward rate agreements from the deficit calculations under the excessive deficit procedure would indeed place an unnecessary constraint on the market activities of the national debt managers .
I introduced separate treatment for swaps and forward rate agreements , thus paving the way for a first reading agreement on this dossier .
The technical nature of this issue should make this possible .
The explosive situation in Ukraine makes this report very much one of its time .
Our group supports its main premises .
There is good reason to criticise the country for its serious shortcomings in the areas of human rights , democracy and freedom of speech , among others .
At the same time , however , we need more effective cooperation with the Union for Ukraine to be able to solve its acute problems .
This is something the rapporteur also referred to in his speech .
The worst safety problem has been eradicated , since Chernobyl was finally shut down .
Cooperation and an
