made by Mr Herzog are intended , at European Union level , to respond to the political crisis and the crisis of representativeness which for various reasons are affecting the various democratic systems .
I think that for that reason our debate is not essentially one of form .
We distance ourselves , as everyone knows , from the restrictive option adopted at first reading , with a view to the single currency and , particularly , with an eye already on enlargement .
Indeed , the inscription in Category 2 of 100 MECU for Ireland now represents , objectively , as it is accompanied by a negative reserve of the same amount in this category , a further cut in the structural activities with which we obviously cannot agree .
This declaration of vote is , equally and especially , an affirmation , an unequivocally political affirmation , of political principles and values .
The budget has to be prepared , fundamentally , so that we can support the structural policies needed to adapt the economies of the candidate countries to a more open and far more demanding market .
In any case we cannot accept a situation where encouraging consumption continues to be the main way of boosting the Community 's own resources .
We therefore welcome in specific respect of funding enlargement the exhaustive listing of problem areas and the care taken in finding solutions .
The financial question is important but it is not the only or most important factor .
Therefore , the European Parliament should have adopted a set of coherent guidelines to reshape that document and enable decisions to be taken later on on strategies and alternatives .
On what basis is it possible to decide future strategies if we have yet to make exhaustive assessments of the effects of the 1992 CAP reform , which should have been carried out by the Commission as an obligation any way , and if certain farming sectors have not yet been reformed ?
But this enlargement cannot be underestimated .
It so happens that the average level of income of CCEE farmers is lower than that in the European Union .
This enlargement will oblige the EU to profoundly reform this policy , something we welcome .
In my country , the unemployment existing is identical to the number of persons who were obliged to abandon the countryside following Portugal 's entry into the EEC .
Guessing what enlargement will bring , a political reality that we all want , is very difficult indeed .
Thank you very much for your replies , Madam Commissioner but they were not precise enough for my liking .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the first instance , the Commission has taken a series of organizational measures in-house to speed up and improve the administration of the NGO cofinancing budget .
On 22 March 1996 the Council adopted the complementary directives which allow the Commission to start negotiations with South Africa on trade and cooperation .
Despite some constraints in the agricultural sector , the Council directives provide a very good starting position for trade discussions .
Studies on these matters are under way and will be completed early next year .
I just wish to add that in the recent meeting I myself had with Vice-President Thabo Mbeki in Brussels , we agreed that we would enlarge eventually the scope for our discussions to include the possibility of taking into account several of the concerns of neighbouring countries regarding possible equilibrium for trade with South Africa through investment and other complementary aspects .
From the beginning they have said that they do not want to be a prosperous country in the middle of poverty .
Yet , from what I learned a few weeks ago we will perhaps have the mandate in December and will therefore be able to start an assessment with our South African partners early in January .
But , for the moment we are waiting for the starting point , the South African mandate , and as in every negotiation we will have to try to fill the gap .
If there are new areas emerging in the third millennium , in my opinion they will be in Southern Africa and possibly Western Africa .
I must repeat that the main objective in proposing a free trade agreement with South Africa is to help the new South Africa and the region .
I sincerely hope that it will be achieved as soon as possible because we are losing opportunities .
I am sure that will not take place , despite the fact that Steffen Smidt is moving to another DG.
We have done that in many other countries .
One of the things which I and Vice-President Mbeki agreed on was that an evolving clause would have to be included , as well as a safeguard clause , to take into account the possibility of the train being derailed .
Madam President , one of the main problems currently facing the European Union is related to bringing the people closer to its institutions , making them feel that they are at the heart of our concerns , that it is for them that we are labouring , that we represent them according to the basic principles of democracy and transparency .
We should work jointly on the draft directive which the Commission has drafted and on which the European Parliament has already approved an excellent report .
To have a smiling portrait of 16 or 17 , including the President of the European Parliament ?
Why waste a whole minute , Mr President , when 51 seconds are enough to put questions that could take hours to comment on and discuss ?
This cannot be denied but we must note the difficulties met in introducing into international commercial , economic , political or military relations the moral values which , in accordance with our culture , should govern the international community .
