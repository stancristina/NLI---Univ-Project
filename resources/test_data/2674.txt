It does not mean that there is this number of victims every year .
In all events , the phenomenon is worrying and I believe that both the government and society will work in this direction .
We need to remove the obstacles which prevent people with disabilities from participating in economic , social and cultural life .
I also wish to mention and to add that the adoption of a common definition of disability at European level will greatly facilitate the recognition of the common issues of people with disabilities for the purpose of adopting policies at European level which will give greater added value to national social policies in a sector which still - to a significant degree - comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States .
In addition , the huge spread of the illness in less capitalistically developed countries constitutes a source of the spread of the illness worldwide , with serious repercussions on world public health .
It is the duty of every state to protect the health of its people .
The Group of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament voted against the report regarding the Commission 's proposal for a regulation on a ' Modernised Customs Code ' , because it clears the path for invasion of major monopoly enterprises (especially logistics ) in the sector of customs procedures .
This reactionary policy by the EU is aimed against all grassroots classes .
The criteria set by the regulation under which it is applied are so narrow that a minimal number of workers will be entitled to it , given that it is paid in areas in which , due to the relocation of companies , there are at least 1 000 redundancies from one company or at least 1 000 redundancies over a 6-month period ( or 12-month period as proposed in the committee report ) , representing 1 % of employment in the region .
Thanks to their constant desire to integrate new countries into the ΕU , they are projecting the most reactionary aspects of the European Constitution ( such as the full abolition of unanimity , the strengthening of the role of the President of the Commission , the introduction of the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs of the ΕU , the simplification of amendments to the Constitution ) , as allegedly necessary reforms for the effective functioning of the Union , meaning the unimpeded facility for monopoly capital to promote capitalist restructurings and its anti-grassroots , imperialist policy at the expense of the peoples of Europe and the whole world .
The group of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament voted for the proposal to amend Article 4 , paragraph 3 of Regulation (ΕC ) No 417/2002 , both during approval in the Committee on Transport and Tourism on 22 November 2006 and in plenary in the European Parliament on 14 December 2006 , so that heavy grades of oil are only carried in double-hull tankers .
On the basis of this programme , ideological perceptions , positions and stands which challenge the 'holy of holies ' of capitalist barbarity and the exploitation of its political systems come within the definition of 'terrorism' , while customary action which the mass grassroots movement has acquired the right to take , such as the symbolic takeover of buildings or roads , which they may consider jeopardises 'critical infrastructures ' or the unimpeded functioning of public services can potentially be classified as 'terrorist action ' .
The European Return Fund is yet another step towards promoting the anti-immigration policy of the ΕU.
The Greek Communist Party neither recognises nor participates in the proceedings for the so-called Sakharov prize , which is supposed to be given for freedom of thought , but which in practice serves the political and ideological objectives of the ΕU.
We express our solidarity with Cuba , which defends and builds socialism , despite the rabid attempts of the imperialists to overturn it .
The political groups in the European Parliament , including the majority of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , have huge political responsibilities , in that they are trying to create preconditions for the justification of the overt or covert war which has been unleashed against the Cuban revolution .
The partnership agreement , which is accompanied by a protocol , has been concluded for a period of six years , while the technical and financial terms governing fisheries activities entered into force back on 3 December 2005 .
We should emphasise that agreements such as this are particularly important , because they promote economic development and cooperation with third countries .
It is contrary to the real needs of the workers .
We abstained from Amendment 15 .
We should not forget that there is already leverage in this direction at the current stage of negotiations .
This was also the message from discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and from the opinions of the Committees on International Trade and Regional Development and from our consultations with operators in the sector at national and European level .
The funding for these programmes , by which I mean the national envelopes , will need to be decided at Community level on the basis of standard objective criteria so that there are no distortions or inequalities between the Member States and the regions .
You are ousting European wine and vintners from the market .
However , I should like to state my position on the amendments tabled in plenary .
We cannot call in a loud voice for a radical reform and , in essence , propose a radical status quo .
At the same time , the elimination of small and medium-sized farms is being promoted so as to concentrate land , production and trade in a few hands .
That is why mass grubbing up
