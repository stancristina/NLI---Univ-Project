reality .
What was proclaimed five years ago as the remedy for ethnic cleansing has proved to be the opposite .
My appeal to the producers is that they should start with voluntary insurance .
I think it is perfectly clear that we have to go down the road of seeking out the safest alternatives possible with the absolute minimum of global warming potential .
This directive will , for the first time , introduce compensation for damage to protected species and habitats – what is termed purely environmental damage .
This report is also to examine the relation between the liability of shipowners and the contributions of those who buy crude oil , for calamities such as the wreck of the make it necessary that we again rethink the arrangements for liability at sea .
We are in favour of real waste – polluted material or stones – being properly removed and disposed of .
We do not insist that only one form of financial surety should be possible .
This is a solidarity clause against terrorism .
For this reason too , I emphatically agree with the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , who has said – as you also have done , Mr President-in-Office of the Council – that peace in the Middle East with security and dignity for all people in Israel and Palestine is absolutely crucial in terms of peace in the world and peaceful relations between Europe and the Middle East and the Arab world as a whole .
However , I say to you now that a Constitution tending to reduce the intrinsic right of any Parliament , namely the right to set the budget , cannot be acceptable to us in the European Parliament .
It is a positive signal that an antiterrorism coordinator has been appointed and the solidarity clause from the draft Constitution has been brought forward .
We must also speak with one voice in another area , in which the diversity of voices is much too great .
Although the Heads of State or Government have now seriously promised that it will come , it still cannot come this year !
If it were to be confirmed that Mr Barnier has become the French Foreign Minister – which I regard as good news – I would be glad if , because of its importance , his position in the Intergovernmental Conference were to be reallocated to President Prodi himself in the next few months , in order thereby to underline the fact that the Commission , too , is right behind the process .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , not only did the attack in Madrid kill many people , but it also undermined the sovereignty of a European state .
I make this request for myself personally , Mr President , but also on behalf of all 34 other German Social Democrat MEPs , and I am aware that Members of the other groups – the Greens , the PDS and the CDU/CSU – will also certainly have something to say about this .
It follows that we must clarify matters completely as soon as possible , because I am afraid that it will have as its consequence very low turnout at the next elections .
This report on ‘the new policy for the neighbouring states ’ involves reorganising the lending facilities of the European Investment Bank .
It would be nice if the European Union could at last prevail upon the Republika Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina to take back Croatian refugees from Croatia .
Both the country from which I come and this group to which I belong are very well disposed towards Croatia , but that does not mean that we turn a blind eye , or even two blind eyes , when it comes to assessing whether it is ready for Europe .
I have followed developments in Croatia since 1995 , first as a delegation chairman and then as chairman of the EU-Slovenia Joint Parliamentary Committee , and have found that steadily increasing efforts have been made in the right direction .
That is right and I am glad the President-in-Office also sees it that way .
There are Community legal bases and principles that are binding .
I also ask my fellow Members to support that .     – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Miguélez Ramos’ good report on the modification of the protocol to the fisheries agreement with Greenland shows once again that justified criticisms can be made of its content and application .
To the point in hand , my group agrees with the starting point of saying that it may make sense to oblige carriers to communicate data on persons entering the EU from third countries to the competent border control authorities in advance .
So far , this Council initiative has not done that , and that is why I do not believe we should continue any further down this path .
What happens if the data are misused ?
Above all , of course , as various speakers have said , levels of development funding for ACP countries must be guaranteed .
Nonetheless , the Common Position takes into account many , although not all , of Parliament 's amendments .
One point is of major importance to me , and that is the famous Article 8a of the Regulation , which deals with slot mobility .
I am most grateful to you , Madam Vice-President , for stating that you will endeavour to present a revised version of the new Regulation by November .
Tomorrow , I will have to be here in this House , going about my political duties , and I will be recording my presence in the central register .
The reform process has given public debate in Turkey a new mood of openness and freedom .
