along with imperialism .     . – We agree with the majority of the findings , which confirm the deterioration of the environment , the destruction of forest ecosystems and the continuing loss of biodiversity .
We disagree radically with the proposal in the motion for a resolution which 'calls on the European Commission and the Member States to show leadership and conviction , by agreeing to and facilitating concrete measures for the protection of biodiversity , both domestically and internationally ' , because it is like asking the wolves to look after the sheep.
It is unacceptable when the Union buries its head in the sand by following through on policies which promote benefits not for the workers but for large companies .
In the name of competitiveness , workers rights are on the receiving end every day of the fire of capitalist Europe .
How can that be , when their objective is once again the criteria laid down to safeguard the economic interests of Europe , when immigrants and people who need international protection are being kept on European territory under conditions of detention when their only crime has been to seek a humane life ?
There is not one , not one European citizen who this year will be better off financially than last year .
What does this mean ?
It therefore means a worse life .
It is inadequate .
Do not try to put everything in one basket and use renewable sources of energy like a big curtain to cover the truth , which is that a large proportion of European citizens feel anything from reservations to opposition to the use of nuclear energy and that cannot be made to disappear with a magic wand .     – Mr President , the supply of energy and the use of all sources of energy are a political option which must aim to take a combined approach to all grass-roots requirements , such as reducing energy dependency , saving energy , ensuring residents are safe , protecting the environment and safeguarding energy products as a social – not a commercial – commodity .
The European Union is promoting the policy of liberalisation by sacrificing the satisfaction of grass-roots requirements to the profitability of private investors .
A way out could be found through a single energy agency which would belong to the people and would function within the framework of an economy with nationalised basic means of production .
It should also be emphasised that the harmonisation of the internal market in the energy sector should target the protection of consumers and not impose more costs on them .
Europe must stand and confront this international problem with stable policies .     – Mr President , the question we are debating tonight is very important to the external action of the European Union and to efforts to respond to our political commitment to achieve the Millennium Goals .
Moreover , the budgetisation of the European Development Fund will resolve many of the complications and difficulties in the application of successive European regional funds , will help speed up their liquidity flow and will wipe out the existing democratic deficit , which is something the European Parliament has expressed repeatedly .
We shall be both more democratic and more consistent in our commitments to European taxpayers and more efficient in the Millennium Goals .     –Mr President , the rapporteur , Mr Bushill-Matthews , who is known for his attention to detail and heightened sensitivity and who has patiently prepared this report , has quite rightly highlighted possible solutions to the demographic problem , starting with the means of decisively addressing low economic growth and high rates of unemployment .
What has brought us to these life choices in times of peace and opulence ?
However , if there is to be no demographic problem , if new Europeans are to be born and grow old under dignified conditions , future parents need of their own accord to have a demand for reliability in their personal relations and , in general , a vision of life for the present and the future .     – The EU decision to send the military forces of the Euro-army to the Democratic Republic of Congo relates to competition between the imperialist forces to control the markets and the wealth-producing resources of the Congo and Africa in general , which has paid for this policy with millions of lives .
The second organised military mission of the Euro-army after Bosnia also demonstrates its aggressive , interventionist character .
Particular importance is attached to young people , by strengthening the ' European parties ' in order to create European youth organisations .
Moreover , inalienable fundamental human rights are respected and supported by the majority of the population , which is why support for the rights of the few must not give the impression of the abolition of the rights of the majority .     – Mr President , the disturbances in France cannot fail to move my generation , to which the famous First Employment Contract or , to put it differently , the 'disposable worker ' model is addressed .
They will be squeezed out by young 'disposable workers' , by shifting cheap and disciplined manpower .
Now there are social clashes for the full withdrawal of the law on 'working pawns ' .
The competent institutional body replied to my question five months later , on 9 March 2006 to be precise , informing me in just three lines of text that the Council had not discussed the matter on which I had requested a position and had no plans to do so .
What therefore , Mr President and honourable Members , is the role of MEPs and the function of the European Parliament and what of respect for and responsibilities towards the European citizens who have entrusted us with the position which we occupy today
