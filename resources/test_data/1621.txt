protection and to keep an eye on how the recommendations on the security and reliability of such means of payment are being followed .
As soon as possible , we need to see the appropriate measures put in place to protect consumers .
A horizontal directive , focusing on more general gaps in regulation in the sector , should be able to remedy the situation , .
If such money is to become a feature of our everyday lives , we must of course be able to spend it .
I myself remain convinced that the sector itself will soon launch a series of measures of its own .
We also want the Commission to make sure that any standards produced for this sector do not exclude certain operators .
My group cannot , however , support the proposals in Amendments Nos 12 and 13 , which call for separate directives in order to safeguard interoperability .
Violence in all its forms , but especially violence against children , is a gross infringement of human rights , and not just a matter of public health .
We need training , education and advice facilities , as well as broad networks of support to cope with risk situations .
The organisations need support to set up various networks , to improve the dissemination of information , to forge partnerships , and to promote reciprocal information exchange .
I would especially like to stress the importance of the Daphne programme for defending the rights of children and protecting them from sexual exploitation in particular .
I believe it is also very important to extend this programme gradually to other countries , especially the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , as violence in its various forms has a transnational dimension , for example in the sex trade and child pornography on the Internet .
Otherwise , I would hope that issues of children 's rights will be one of the priorities on the EU agenda , as only then will we be able to protect our future and status as a community of civilised states .
You terminated discussion of the matter before all the facts were presented .
Mr President , thank you for welcoming me in Finnish .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is indeed the first speech I have made in Parliament , and I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on such an important matter .
Our rapporteur , Hugh McMahon , and Edgar Schiedermeier have worked hard , not only in producing this report , but also in organising a conference on the elderly , the outcome of which forms the main basis for this report .
Senior citizens are to be seen as a resource that society should exploit more and not as a problem we have to solve at minimum expense .
Work must adapt to people 's skills and abilities , rather than insisting that people adapt to the demands of work .
In many workplaces problems have been caused by pressure , when an attempt is made to achieve the same results with a reduced workforce of lower-paid employees .
In my opinion , the public sector should set an example to employers and be capable of thinking in the longer term .
One of the greatest problems older people have on the labour market is their poor level of training .
Unless older workers can be trained up for new jobs , we face the threat of age discrimination on the labour market while many sectors are suffering from labour shortages .
For that reason , training must be closely linked with practical work .
Age discrimination on the labour market affects women quite a lot earlier than it does men .
A woman of 40 is often too old , in the opinion of the employer .
In all countries women 's pensions are substantially smaller than men 's .
Although retirement schemes naturally differ from country to country , I believe there should be a statutory minimum income at Union level , which Member States should guarantee citizens who are unable to work or for whom there is no work available .
I would like to thank you all for that too !
This is very much a question of the simplest jobs having disappeared in our society , with differences in pay growing so enormous that some people are paid huge amounts of money for what they do , while others would in fact be more productive , in the traditional sense of the word , if they were not in the labour market at all .
But that is in no way an acceptable state of affairs , either for society or from the human dignity point of view .
Part-time workers and those engaged in atypical work should qualify for welfare and a pension if we wish to take responsibility for people who have to resort to atypical employment more and more .
I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work .
So it was too last autumn and winter , in connection with the 1996 budget , which led to the Commission 's resignation .
Discharge is thus the object of the exercise .
Discharge as a vote of confidence in the Commission is , however , too broad an interpretation , in my opinion , and there are two reasons for avoiding this .
Giving discharge cannot be allowed to act as a barrier to intervention .
The decision on discharge must not be too ponderous or broad in scope , and it should not lead to a situation in which no one dares to give discharge .
Mr President , I have closely examined the report by the Committee of Wise Men which suggests that both the Members of the Commission and its officials lack a sense of accountability .
Furthermore , the penalties were too lenient .
