Accordingly the agreement provides for a supervisory cooperative Council .
Therefore , whilst I share everyone ' s enthusiasm for the agreement that has been reached , I am much less enthusiastic about the manner in which it has come about .
This agreement must invite South Africa to promote regional cooperation as well and must help the South African economy to become the driving force for development throughout the region .
Mr President , I am one of South Africa ' s great admirers : I love the landscape , the people and its leaders .
Madam President , yesterday the European Commission decided to give Paul Van Buitenen an official reprimand .
He intends to produce new proposals at the end of the year concerning flax cultivation in Europe .
Indeed this is our moral duty from a Biblical point of view .
The aforementioned industrialists are endeavouring to defuse this explosive situation by calling for people to join forces for a civilian society .
But the problem you are now confronted with is that whilst , as a politician , you obviously have to act when the going is good , you also of course have to ask the question as to what will actually happen next once a country has been granted candidate status .
How much thought has been given to the implications it will have for our agricultural policy and for the deepening of the European Union that we are currently working on ?
However , it is essential for Turkey to undertake radical reforms itself , not just in words but above all in deeds .
Article 7 even provides for the suspension of those Member States that do not abide by Article 6 .
The Council has politely said that Turkey is doing its best to become more of a constitutional state .
Immediately after the earthquake , the Greek Government made very friendly noises about Turkey ' s becoming a member but I do not think we can take them at their word .
Mr President , this resolution does not evoke the same feelings .
More attention must be given to these measures , otherwise we will be giving de facto encouragement to those pursuing a policy of colonisation , and that when the European Community together with the rest of the international community , the United States included , has constantly condemned this policy and we are all aware that Israeli settlement policy is a major obstacle on the long road to freedom and a true Palestinian state .
This exists , of course , but this extraordinarily poignant question is , in turn , a legacy of the war that the Arabic States waged in 1948/49 against the recently proclaimed Jewish State .
This is an official Christian festival and therefore also a public holiday in some EU Member States , that is to say in Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Austria and Sweden .
We believe that cooperation is certainly feasible , indeed we believe that such cooperation is actually necessary for bringing about policy that will truly promote peace and development .
However we feel that Turkey deserves an honest answer too .
What is more , they must remain aware of the fact that the WTO can only serve an important purpose if every Member State ensures , and also continues to understand , that the interests of one State alone cannot be allowed to prevail , rather the interests of Europe as a whole must always be served by these negotiations too .
In the United States , more responsibility rests with the consumer .
In view of the fact that there are so many different opinions about climate change , there are bound to be a great many more conferences in the future .
In view of the seriousness of the situation I support the proposal made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Lange to do this by means of an assent procedure .
The situation already existed under the Tsarist regime .
We are soon to receive a report from various governments and this motion for a resolution is extremely topical because it addresses the national governments yet again , via Parliament and the Council , on the fact that we as a Parliament - and I am very pleased that all groups have been able to reach agreement on the motion for a resolution - really do stress the importance of their taking active steps to produce a carefully considered report .
Russia is supplying Eritrea with arms through Antwerp whilst we , the European Community , are in the midst of this conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia .
It is the case with all these areas that we must not labour under the misapprehension that the international community is in a position to solve the problems .
Mr President , with all due respect to my colleagues in this Parliament , I think that it is a little odd - I thought I would just say this , looking at the list of speakers - that we are having what is almost an all-Dutch round on the Moluccas .
The Moluccas form part of a great State comprising many nationalities and religious groupings .
Thirty-five thousand people in the Moluccas are in camps or other reception centres and even larger numbers of people have fled .
Of course , the economic crisis has a role to play here , too .
Militias and other armed groups must be stripped of their arms because they are an out and out threat to security .
There is a lack of food and medicines and countless houses and villages have been burnt down .
Mr President , I am keen to endorse what Mrs Maij-Wegen had to say .
There too , as we see , armed militias
