First of all , are we going to receive the evaluation which we asked for after three or four years of new policy in the sphere of vertical restraints ?
In this context , I wish to ask for the quorum to be checked .
Mr President , I have been trying to catch your eye for a while now .
This will cause some irritation .
I would just like to say , Mr President , that some strange selectivity is being practised here , that certain Members stage little acts and , after the act is finished , they leave and the game is over .
Mr President , noise pollution caused by aircraft is a very topical issue .
We in the Netherlands are far more flexible in this respect .
This means bans and international standards .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the airline industry has become a growing as well as a thriving industry within the Union .
Well , when the green Minister had the audacity to propose a complete night ban , all of a sudden , Belgium was not big enough for the fierce discussion which followed .
It is an improvement , but not a solution .
Too many people continue to suffer from excessive noise in their bedrooms .
In addition , we would like criteria which determine when a night ban should be instituted within the Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Lannoye stated a moment ago that noise is a problem with all forms of transport , but the problem with aircraft is very specific because it is so concentrated .
Our question is , therefore : how can we marry the two together ?
A European framework is lacking at the moment - and you say yourself that a framework should be in place , but when ?
Since the life-span of aircraft is about thirty years , the effect of these technical improvements are not felt for a long while .
It should be clear that , ideally , the actual environmental costs should be brought into the equation .
Mr President , it is certainly not a coincidence that so many Belgian Members have taken the floor during this debate today .
The increase in the number of noisy , obsolete and unlisted Russian aircraft , in particular , is the cause of unacceptable noise pollution , not to mention the risks for the environment and safety which such aircraft pose .
Mr President , I would like to back Mr Lannoye ' s motion .
If Fridays were like Tuesdays or Wednesdays , then it would not have been necessary to have this debate and the counts here today .
What effect does this have on the people in Europe ?
Economic experts have calculated that this expensive line would never be a success .
The existing large and small national airline companies have become more profitable and have started to operate more efficiently without government funding .
One cannot help but wonder how many of these will still be operating within the European market in ten years ' time .
Important steps still need to be taken after liberalisation .
Normally speaking , after a liberalisation process , companies tend to operate in tune with the market which has been liberalised .
As rapporteur , I am personally quite suspicious of America ' s nationalism when it comes to transport , including aviation .
I think that the Commission too should be clear about this and should issue proposals to promote intermodality .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his report .
It is the first in a series of reports on aviation which we will be dealing with in the course of this year .
We would also draw attention to the human side of developments within aviation .
Personnel too experience the adverse , social effects of cost reductions .
This is a step in the right direction .
These airports continue to grow and they place a huge burden on their surroundings .
There are considerably fewer international through train connections within the European Union compared to 20 years ago .
In their view , the conservation and protection of the natural environment are far more important than fast or cheap transport , and air traffic has already supplanted far too much rail traffic .
The enormous competition within the industry has led to a price war in certain sectors .
Although air fares have come down in certain areas , there are situations in which their rights - including those in the event of overbooking - are under real threat .
In short , the aviation industry is heading for stormy weather .
It became apparent during the Strasbourg debate on night flights only two weeks ago that European legislation on aviation leaves a great deal to be desired .
As far as the allocation of slots is concerned , I believe that more consideration should be given to environmental criteria , such as noise and exhaust fumes .
We have also asked to "de-flag " senior posts .
This very exciting and very extensive change is something both the Commission and Parliament want , but the ball is now back in the Commission ' s court .
The rotation system is clear .
The question came up : should someone who has held a senior post be transferred to a job in the public sector elsewhere without any further ado ?
Since Commissioner Kinnock is present today , I would appreciate it if he could confirm whether he is on target with his staff and people .
We continue to endorse the guidelines you gave at the time for this personnel and appointment policy .
On behalf of my Group , I would say that this question was somewhat superfluous .
We have been given important information , in my opinion , and I would
