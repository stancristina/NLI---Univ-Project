Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , representatives of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I would like , if I may , to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent work .
The July proposal referred to the criterion of working units : this criterion disappeared subsequently and we have attempted to reincorporate it through amendments , for we consider it to be necessary .
Despite the many instances of reluctance to address mountain concerns , despite the fact that the mountains are not mentioned anywhere in this reform , we can say that there is hope on the horizon .
At last , for the first time , multifunctionality , which is indispensable for some disadvantaged peripheral areas , is treated quite seriously .
I do not want to go into the details of this case or the conclusions of the Advocate General , which concern a matter of highly specific legal practice .
For example , the Mediterranean is completely disregarded .
It is estimated that the European processing industry alone employs at least 100 000 people .
We are opposed to reprogramming of the Structural Funds , considering , rather , that these funds should be reserved for other priorities .
Commissioner , I would like to ask you to clarify a few points regarding Mr Fava 's report , if possible , since you have said that you essentially endorse the proposals it contains .
The excessively nationalistic overtones make me genuinely of the opinion that there is no longer any point in having a common fisheries policy .
As the event is so important , my intervention today will be entirely devoted to this subject , and I am certain that the ensuing debate will provide much encouragement and many suggestions for the final , extremely delicate , stages of the Convention 's work .
If we did not achieve this , the risks would be enormous .
Nevertheless , we must also admit that in almost half a century we have built up an astonishing wealth of institutional and lawmaking experience and we have developed a style of politics that is unique on the world scene and of which we should be proud .
The latest version of the draft Constitutional Treaty , published by the Convention , contains some , perhaps many , good proposals : the Charter of Fundamental Rights is firmly enshrined as Part Two of our Constitution ; the scope of the codecision process has been extended , although not far enough ; lastly , it is now clear that we will have a Foreign Minister to represent the Union at international level .
The solution put forward in the latest draft of the Constitution has three drawbacks : first of all , there is the fundamental problem of legitimacy , of accountability , as it is unclear to whom such a President would report , which is fundamental for democracy ; in addition , it weakens your role , the European Parliament 's role , because this assembly rightly has power of control over the Commission , but not over the Council or its President .
We need to be creative , imaginative and have a sense of time and the future .
The events of the last few months have taught us one thing : until we put an end to our divisions , we will continue to be an economic giant and a political dwarf on the world stage ; indeed , when you are a political dwarf for too long , you cease to be an economic giant .
Before closing , I want to raise one last point : we need the right institutional instruments to strengthen our economic policies , precisely to prevent us being sidelined on the economy too .
This leads me to make a further remark - which may seem ill-disposed but which on the contrary is sincere , indeed absolutely sincere - that is , that institutional engineering formulae may provide a rational explanation why the rotation system cannot function .
It is true that the President and the Praesidium have clearly miscalculated , intentionally prolonging the concluding period of debates without ever setting out in black and white which points had achieved a broad consensus , thereby deluding themselves that they can control the Convention at will and giving the wrong impression that the Convention is divided on everything ; but today the governments which are anxious to see this constitutional reform succeed - and they exist , I am sure , and I am also sure that your government , Mr President , is among these - cannot simply pull the plug on the Convention if it does not conclude its proceedings to the satisfaction of the majority of its members .
Mr President , I would just like to make one , very brief point : this debate is an affront to the parliament which has chosen to hold it .
This time I greatly appreciated Mr Wurtz 's speech , for the first time in 20 years , I think .
We need to free ourselves of you , and we shall !
Beware !
It is essential to remove the idea of incompatibility with holding a national mandate too , because if we establish a full time President of the European Council - albeit calling the post 'chairman' or trying to draw up a restrictive job description - all the elements of duplication , or dualism in the leadership of the Union , which have been condemned for being extremely confusing with regard to executive functions , will inevitably come about .
Health , for example , is one such policy .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this has been a very heated , highly interesting debate ; I have noted all the issues raised , vital issues for our future : from the Balkans question to equality
