African policies coherence and consistency in the common foreign and security policy and in trade and development .
Firstly , it is better for us not to have any directive at all than to have a bad directive .
As the spokesperson for this issue in the Parliament 's largest group and head of the Finnish EPP-ED delegation , I think that the decision to reject the common position was the right one .
However , I regret that the attempt to harmonise varying patent practises in different Member States was rejected .
The Council Common Position did not take into account at all the view of the majority of the Parliament .
The Parliament showed that the Member States in the Council cannot walk all over the Parliament 's view - whatever the matter in question .     .
No-one should ever forget the horrors that unfolded during the following days and weeks .
I shall go there to express Europe’s support for peace , reconciliation and democratic development and for the European future of the Western Balkans .
The European Union , as the greatest peace and reconciliation project , can testify to that and serve as an example of what can be achieved , including in the Balkans .
In this respect , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , the ICTY , plays a crucial role .
The countries ’ cooperation with the ICTY has steadily improved , which is an encouraging sign , but more remains to be done to achieve full cooperation .
The people carrying the main responsibility for the Srebrenica massacre are still at large .
Their place is in The Hague .
As Mr Alexander stated regarding the EU’s policy in the Western Balkans on behalf of the Presidency , the inclusion of our Balkan neighbours in the European integration process has been a powerful incentive for enhancing stability , human rights , the rights of minorities and the rule of law in the region .
The Kosovo standards review is a work in progress and the status talks are likely to start in the autumn .
The prompt resolution of this issue is very important for the stability and progress of the whole region .
The Commission is ready to contribute to the timeline Mr Alexander presented , i .e . this autumn , to get the negotiations started .
The Commission ’s opinion on the membership application of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is under preparation .
It is only natural that enlargement policy will be a part of the broader debate on the future of Europe .
Our enlargement policy has helped transform countries in regions that are still very fragile .
We shall continue to help them to become stable , democratic and prosperous societies able to join the Union .
It serves the cause of peace , stability and prosperity in Europe , and our own vital interests .
.
First of all , on the country ’s need to cooperate fully with the Hague Tribunal .
I also note wide support for the continuation of our prudently managed accession process , combining the historic mission of European integration for peace , democracy and progress with consideration for our citizens ’ legitimate concerns about the absorption capacity of the Union .
We therefore have to practice strict conditionality in our enlargement policy .
It is fair to say that the European perspective is the glue that keeps the Western Balkans on a peaceful and stable track .
Therefore it is important that Bosnia and Herzegovina can itself reflect on the constitutional changes that can serve the country and its people better than the current construct .
We need consensus and a consensus-building political process in Bosnia and Herzegovina to achieve that objective .
Mr President , it is a pity that Mr McCreevy cannot be here .
It would have been nice to talk to him personally .
It is even clearer now .
They involve a careful study of the expected economic benefits as well as ‘the extent to which measures facilitate cross-border business and enhance the competitiveness of Europe’s financial markets , while , at the same time , protecting internal stability’ .
The report before you sends a clear signal to the markets that the achievements will not be hampered by unnecessary regulation .
I appreciate and respect the cultural differences in regulatory philosophy , which lead some to these conclusions .
However , it would be a serious mistake to apply this philosophy in the case of clearing and settlement .
More importantly , our clear signal in support of the developments that are taking place in the clearing and settlement markets should not be diluted with confused concerns regarding potential developments sometime in the future , for which no evidence currently exists .
The call for new competition legislation is a misguided call for a short-term directive , with the risk that it will develop into wide-ranging legislation on clearing and settlement before we have the results of the different Commission impact studies .
The removal of such barriers promotes openness , equal access and transparency in the industry .
It is a very important field of the single market .
I fully appreciate Commission efforts in this respect .
I hope we can continue this very fruitful cooperation in the future .     .
The urgent item concerns the elections that took place in Bulgaria on 25 June this year .
We understand that there is a broad consensus across the party political spectrum on this objective .
So , encouragingly , there are serious efforts to keep the preparations moving on and to limit as far as possible the interruption caused by the elections .
We also understand that there are plans to keep the Parliament working through the summer holiday period to allow progress in the key areas of accession preparations
