to wish the Danish Presidency every success in this .
We must involve the governments and civil society in the Member States .
Given the years of preparation and the importance of enlargement , we hope that we can complete the process with all ten candidate countries within the next eighteen months .
The rate at which reforms have taken place over the past few years gives me hope that the remaining problems can be resolved quickly .
I am , however , concerned about another matter .
You spoke about monitoring in the context of police , justice and the internal market .
I have to say that the European Parliament , from all manner of quarters , has also done what was necessary in this matter .
This means that , since Turkey is very different from the other candidates in terms of meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen , we have to put another problem to Turkey .
As fellow MEPs have already pointed out , this was mainly due to the Liberals , who are conspicuous by their absence in this debate , and who , in my view , have adopted a small-minded bookkeeper 's attitude in a bid to obtain short-term electoral victory .
What is your personal opinion about this and what is the Commission 's opinion about this ?
Mr President , enlargement by ten new members puts the EU before major difficulties .
Enlargement is not a matter of meeting a certain number of technical requirements .
Its current stance concerning the equally 'hard ' Stability Pact is not very promising in this respect .
On the other hand , secrecy can also protect powerful profiteers from popular anger .
Competing companies and competing methods benefit from legislation that results in companies selling as many of their own products as possible , thus pushing other products out of the market .

Many people - almost everyone , I think - immediately associates terrorism and the fight against terrorism with images of extreme violence like those we recently witnessed in Bali .
What we do have to ensure , though , is that this balanced , paper vision is not imbued with a practice that remains governed by oppression and military means .
Mr President , on that unforgettable day of 11 September 2001 , I was in Washington with a delegation from this Parliament .
We should take the nature of this threat much more seriously .
Are we really managing to drive back terrorist networks ?
Parliament 's motion for a resolution devotes a great deal of attention to the role of the United Nations in the fight against international terrorism , and rightly so .
We are , in fact , talking about a form of conflict prevention , which is surely the EU 's general priority in its foreign policy .
There are certain categories of citizens in the Netherlands and in other Member States who are victims of such extortion , and we must fight for people in that position , so that the rule of law is no longer under threat for them .
A considerable leap is required to resort to violence .
An important point in that debate was that the vast majority of this Parliament is not opposed to interception per se and that intelligence services are necessary even in a democracy .
European citizens and companies must be able to rely on the confidentiality of their communications being guaranteed in the same way across the EU.
Mr Liikanen mentioned the Charter of constitutional rights , but the Liberal group was quite firm in its belief that a legal framework is necessary in order to curb illegal tapping practices and to clearly define legal interception with effective control at European level .
It can be argued that the airline companies ought to recover the damage from the appropriate party themselves , but that is not feasible in practice .
We have had further debates and further discussions here in Parliament .
Being squashed into an aircraft like sardines is also a fairly recent phenomenon .
I would like to propose that we now start by abolishing unnecessary subsidies on exports ; that we set up a phased plan in which we demonstrate that we want to help rural economies , rural culture , the men and women - as you correctly stressed - who live there , to produce their own food by their own efforts , with our specific help , using environmentally-friendly methods and new forms of energy without being dragged into a system of agricultural production which has proved disadvantageous for our own countries .
The rapporteur ought to have highlighted the abolition of export subsidies more clearly .
Overall , the report contributes towards achieving a productive relationship between the agricultural sectors of Europe and the developing countries .
Secondly , I am not convinced that a total ban would mean that poaching would cease .
Five countries in southern Africa have presented alternative plans .
That we must try to find a solution that will also work for the African peoples .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes unanimously to give elephants full protection once more .
Thirdly , a party exporting prohibited or strictly regulated chemical products must provide information to the importing party .
A more difficult issue is that in the original proposal by the Commission , the Commission itself wanted to impose a monopoly on the procedures .
This is not sensible , as Member States do not all have the same legislation with regard to chemical products .
More freedom has also been created for the individual Member States , meaning that individual Member States can pass more far-reaching measures .
This led to 42 new amendments , which were signed by most of the groups .
The voting slip comprises 4 blocks .
