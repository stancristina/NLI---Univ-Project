More and better research and , therefore , more resources for research together constitute the most crucial weapon in the fight for competition and growth in Europe .
That is a great pity .
Even though the EU’s research programmes only constitute a small portion of total resources for research in Europe , we must think very carefully when we set our priorities .
The very fact that European women are still under-represented in the research world , despite women now being better educated than men , signifies that Europe has huge potential that is not being exploited .
That is something that , emphatically , we must do something about .
Young female candidates have difficulty obtaining research posts .
Now , in particular , it is important to be aware of the fact that women are more vulnerable than men , for the competition for research funds is tough .
Investing in education , research and innovation is our only opportunity for coping successfully in the knowledge-based economy .
We must become better at encouraging young women to choose a research career , and we must at the same time secure better conditions for both women and men in the research world .
In the longer term , this may mean that most university teachers will be women , reflecting the situation further down the education ladder in the school system , while men find employment in industrial research , which is better paid and more prestigious and in which only 15 % of researchers are at present women .     Madam President , the election in Palestine was conducted in an exemplary fashion .
There are still problems in Israel and Palestine , however .
Palestine is occupied .
The fact is highlighted in a list of UN resolutions , which criticise Israel’s ongoing breaches of international law , as well as the settlements , the dreadful Wall and the attempt to annex East Jerusalem – just to mention the worst problems .
The proposal sets out the relevant conditions for Hamas .
Certainly , we must not take away the right they have under the Geneva Convention to armed resistance to the occupation , but we must make determined and carefully considered efforts to ensure that the situation does not get out of control .
We must discourage any form of radicalisation in both Palestine and Israel .
I would therefore call on Members to vote in favour of the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , especially the amendment to paragraph 10 , which contains a very clear formulation of the Council’s decision not to publish the report on East Jerusalem , prepared by the Heads of Delegation in Palestine .
I would call on us to be consistent now .
More journalists are to be employed to tout their own virtues , and a fresh news agency is to be set up so that you can decide what the media are to write about the EU and so that you can provide each new item of news with an easily understood message , extolling the EU.
The Commission does not need a communication policy .
What it needs is transparency and democracy .
Give the EU’s auditors access to all expenditure so that they can monitor this .
Open the drawer containing letters of formal notice , so that voters and elected representatives can see which aspects of our laws the Commission does not like .
Are there , for example , Commissioners who have opposed Mrs Wallström’s communication plan or Mr Kallas’s Transparency Initiative .
We need this with a view to road safety , and we need it in order to ensure fair conditions of competition for those haulage contractors and drivers who observe the rules .
We have , however , been more sceptical about significant changes to the rules themselves , where driving and resting times are concerned .
If we change them , we must change them for the better .
With the conciliation now arrived at between Parliament and the Council , I believe , however , that we have found a sensible balance , and we in the ALDE Group are able to support the conciliation .
The rules are being simplified , which , in certain cases , also means that they are becoming less flexible .
The rules will require a daily rest period divided into periods of nine and three hours .
What is also important is that the rules are now also to cover lorries from third countries , which do not come within the AETR agreement .
The issue of monitoring drivers ’ working time has been important in the negotiations .
Such monitoring is organised very differently from one country to another , and that is something we have to accept .
Bus and coach owners will not be satisfied with the result of the conciliation .
I regret that we were unable to obtain a more flexible solution in this case .
Otherwise , I am satisfied with the overall result , and I thank Mr Markov and the shadow rapporteur for their efforts .
The fact is , the legislation surrounding digital tachographs has been called a farce because it has for so long been uncertain when it would be introduced .
I think that the farce now needs to come to an end , and I would therefore conclude by putting the following question to Commissioner Barrot : will you guarantee that when , in a year’s time , the new legislation on driving and resting times is brought into force , account will be taken of the problems involved in converting the digital tachographs from the present rules to the new ones ?
Like the demonstrators , the June Movement wishes to reject the Bolkestein Directive .
The country of origin principle is being removed but is not being replaced by a clear host country principle .
Sensitive areas are being
