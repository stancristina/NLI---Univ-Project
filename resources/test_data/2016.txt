Moreover , that is the way it should be in the EU , which is , and needs to be , a community founded on the rule of law .
Turkey is developing rapidly , as I have seen with my own eyes .
Turkey really is changing day by day .
Not everything is , however , as it should be in Turkey – far from it .
That is completely unacceptable .
Turkey must treat the Cypriot ships as if they were Danish or French ships .
The EU’s foreign ministers must make this indispensable demand of Turkey on Monday , 3 October 2005 .     We are voting in favour of the overall report on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions .
We have , however , been obliged to vote against some parts of the report .
We voted against proposals that defend an outdated agricultural and fisheries policy which benefits neither the Community’s interests as a whole nor the long-term interests of the outermost regions .
Protectionism , tariffs and trade barriers are not lasting solutions .
Support for the outermost regions must be based on sustainable development .     Mr President , I too should like to say thank you for , above all , the first part of Mr Vatanen’s introduction today .
The problem is on a horribly huge scale , and it is appalling that we are not doing anything more serious about it .
The larger and broader roads would be there for many more cars to drive faster on .
I am delighted that the report mentions vulnerable road users and that the aim is to have no accidents at all .
I think that the proposals , pathetic as they are , fall spectacularly short of dealing with the problems so splendidly described by Mr Vatanen .     Mr President , I wish firstly to thank the Commission for not , as it happened , allowing things to go completely wrong .
What we have witnessed in this case has , in fact , been quite shocking .
As a rule , the result has been twice as much harm caused to the poor .
The fact is , the rich countries must open themselves up and also pin their hopes on renewal .
It was of course in order to guarantee this whole process that ten years were spent on developing the Multifibre Agreement .
Going back on the agreements would penalise those countries , for they cannot possibly compete successfully with government-protected sunset industries .
We must hope that the industry we obtain is one that can hold its own , even if the poor countries get their act together , and we must do everything we can to help the poor countries thrive .
At the same time , it is also important , however , to draw attention to the abominable conditions in the social and environmental spheres .
I hope that most of us can agree that it is not only the EU that has a big responsibility but that action should be taken within the system of international agreements .
If we are to make our presence felt in the WTO , we need to be trustworthy , but people are only trustworthy if they are worth trusting .
If these rules really were to apply , we could not import a drop of oil from Saudi Arabia , which does not of course have even the first clue about human rights .
However , there is never any talk about , for example , human rights and the environment to be heard in relation to Saudi Arabia .
We need to strengthen our position within the WTO by opening up our markets rather than by coercing the poor countries .
That is absolutely the only way that is practicable , and it is also the way that , in all conscience , we must keep to .     Bioenergy is unnecessary .
At the same time , such a plan leads to high energy efficiency and clean combustion .
If bioenergy comes into the picture , it should only be as fuel for furnaces used by more than one supplier .
Bioenergy is a renewable , but not a permanent , energy source .
Ethanol produced from grain , clover-grass and wood biomass is outweighed by the fossil energy inputs .
Finally , the EU should not dictate energy choices in the individual Member States , and certainly not on so doubtful a basis .     Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner .
I believe we are all delighted that there is now such a sharp focus – both political and , happily , also economic – on Africa .
Unquestionably , quite extraordinary efforts are needed if Africa is to be lifted out of poverty , and it is therefore appropriate for the EU to prepare an overall strategy on our relations with Africa .
Concerns for the environment , good governance , women and equality , peace-making , trade and the strengthening of the private sector have been crucial in taking developments forward , although I could have done with hearing a bit more about them in the Commissioner’s speech .
That is directly contrary to the principles of aid effectiveness and sound donor behaviour on which the EU helped decide at the Paris High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness , held in March of this year .
If we scrap everything we have achieved in this area in order to speak with one voice as part of a top-down strategy , what we are in danger of seeing , instead of a competently conducted fight against poverty , is a whole caravan of white elephants invade the African continent .
Having observed a splendid and peaceful election – I myself was part of the delegation – in which we were genuinely
