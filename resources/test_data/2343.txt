I shall devote the last seconds of my speaking time to Mrs Korhola’s report .
I also think that it is very important that the public be given a partisan interest , so that it is covered by this regulatory framework .     Mr President , Commissioner , firstly , I should like to say that we very often say in this House that consumers must have the same rights as economic operators , and that all sides must be heard .
Finally , I should like to point out that I do not think that we can share the Commission ’s interpretation that the requesting of internal reviews by qualified entities would not cause problems in the most successful , progressive countries .
This does not mean that we are completely satisfied with the result .
There was a good number of us that wanted a more harmonised system , and we could have gone a little further than this .
One way of reaching a compromise at the final stage is through a declaration by the Commission , in which it makes clear that it intends to fulfil the obligations imposed on it by the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council .
Waste from extraction can be of such a composition and volume as to pose a serious threat to the environment and human health if it is not managed correctly .
The stability of disposal facilities must also be ensured in order to prevent the occurrence , or reduce the impact , of accidents .
Contamination from mines can indeed pose a problem , but it cannot be regulated by this proposal , which concerns waste .
I should like to conclude by pointing out that the Commission is striving for a directive that is sufficiently comprehensive to enable the achievement of these important environmental objectives .     Mr President , before I go into detail on this proposal and Parliament’s suggested changes and improvements , I should like to recapitulate on the background to this Directive .
All things considered , this could be said to constitute a considerably greater environmental problem than the mining currently in operation .
This has many good points , for example regarding the safety of ponds and the effective prohibition of the method involving a high cyanide content , which had been used in Romania .
This Directive will make that method inadmissible in future .
For that reason , we have chosen to remove a number of exemptions , for example concerning waste from prospecting .
I should also like to mention inert non-hazardous waste .
I do not think that the decision taken by the Committee on the Environment goes far enough in this regard , and have therefore tabled Amendment No 98 , which would put this right , in my view .
In my opinion , it is important to include this in the suggestions made in the report , so that we are also able to use Structural Funds to really address this .
This involved our allowing Member States considerable freedom to give shape to these financial guarantees .
I believe that we have indeed achieved this result .
Despite construction requirements , there are often shortcomings in that dams are not adapted later , nor are they monitored as required if the production conditions change .
I hope that these proposals will enable us to address the fundamental problems that I mentioned at the beginning : preventing major dam collapses , making leakage of pollutants into the environment a thing of the past , and establishing legislation in this field that is effective in practice and comprehensive .
This does not prevent such waste being reused for a beneficial purpose , for instance in construction materials .
The amendments concerning the scope of the proposal are of course of particular importance .
Amendment No 15 proposes that the limited requirements of Article 2.3 should include non-hazardous waste .
That part of Amendment No 15 would have a significant impact on the overall effectiveness of the proposal , and the Commission cannot accept that .
It is necessary to manage the great burden from the past presented by closed and abandoned disposal facilities .
The Commission can support this strategy .
Nor can we accept amendments concerning the form of these guarantees , as the text should retain its present flexibility .
In addition , the rationale behind the transitional period should not be undermined .
Finally , Amendment No 7 also explains the role of this Directive in EUdevelopment aid .
The problem must be tackled .     Mr President , it is of course a great tragedy that it should take acts of terrorism of the kind seen in Madrid for Europe’s leaders to pull themselves together .
We must create much better preconditions for the coordination of intelligence services and also , in time , create a kind of European FBI that is also operational .
It is very important , therefore , that the Convention’s proposals in this field be adopted .
The Lisbon process is not at all functioning as intended , and the problems are great .
I fully share Mr Prodi’s view that the Stability and Growth Pact is idiotic .
Something should really be done , and the electorate is reacting .
In both Germany and France , we are seeing how the electorate is protesting against an economic and social policy that is now being left to its own devices .     Mr President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , the atrocities in Madrid have moved the fight against crime and terrorism to the top of the European agenda .
Bringing about measures that are sufficiently effective and multi-faceted requires respect for fundamental rights , and also democratic transparency and monitoring .
Years of inactivity are reflected in the programme with which the Irish Presidency is now exemplarily presenting us , but the issues merit a long-term approach .
A package solution to the crisis
