The real purpose of the provisions allegedly being introduced to protect fish stocks and sustainability is to restrict the access of small-scale fishermen to fishing grounds , which will be handed over for big business and its fisheries operations to plunder .
The EU 's stand is even more hypocritical in that it is championing itself as a worker 's paradise at a time when it has unleashed an unprecedented attack on the rights which workers have fought hard to acquire .
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report .
The Commission has continued to work with the people of Somalia , who have received an average of EUR 30 million a year under programmes run by European non-governmental organisations and United Nations agencies .
It is a peace-building method which encourages the emerging administration and closer collaboration with regional and local administrations .
In response to calls for a representative council of the parties to be set up , I should point out that the Commission and Member States have already expressed their joint support for a council to be set up under the IGAD.
The Commission therefore considers that a final institutional framework should be designed for the future of Somalia , mainly between the Somalis themselves , within the framework of detailed dialogue and democratic consultation .
Clearly the European Union is the biggest donor of development aid to Somalia and it has earmarked a further EUR 200 million for the period from 2002 to 2007 .
In addition , the Union is pushing for the farm reform procedure to be revised in accordance with the guidelines in the proposal contained in the United Nations development programme .
We are , of course , doing the best we can , but we know from reports that the Zimbabwean government is making political capital out of the food crisis .
We have emphasised in our contacts with the Zimbabwean authorities that aid must be given to everyone facing a humanitarian emergency , irrespective of their political persuasions , and we have reiterated the need for food to be distributed impartially .
The Commission accompanied the United Nations development programme mission to Zimbabwe to examine the farm reforms and expressed its wish to support transparent and fair reforms predicated on the needs of the poorer sections of the population .
After so many unsuccessful attempts at mediation and the deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe , we understand that people are sceptical as to whether or not these initiatives will succeed .
During the troika 's mission , our partners in the SADC insisted that European Union sanctions had had the opposite effect .
The Commission realises that the Zimbabwean authorities are endeavouring to undermine the reliability of the ban on visas .
In over 70 countries , homosexual relations qualify as a crime , sometimes even attracting the death penalty .
I also understand that five teachers are to stand trial for taking part in a cross-community choir which gave a performance in Istanbul .
This , coupled with the Commission 's insistence on abiding to the letter by the GATT agreement and Agenda 2000 , which ban any increase on plant protein crops , reveals in all its glory the hypocrisy of the Commission , which is using every environmental excuse it can under Agenda 2000 in a bid to reduce agricultural output .
The solution to the problem lies in plant proteins , which can be grown in abundance in the European Union , in Greece and in other countries in the south , and in increasing crops of legumes , beans , alfalfa , vetch and cotton cake which , along with several other products . provide some of the best fodder .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , although I do of course agree with the basic idea , I feel that , when it comes to the question of a Single European Sky , which is a very complex issue , we should look very carefully at local parameters and anyone advocating the privatisation of air traffic control and management will need to come up with some pretty persuasive arguments .
This needs looking into .
Even the involvement of the military sector in this overall exercise has not been clearly safeguarded with respect to national security issues , i .e . second pillar issues .
And then there is the , in our view , equally serious question of the legal basis for the proposed regulations which , by their very nature , appear to warrant more than just Article 80( 2 ) of the Treaty , given that this is not just a transport issue .
The proposed open skies will , it is openly admitted , be used to serve the militaristic , anti-grass roots plans of the warmongers in ? ? ? ? and the European Union .
We are fighting for nationalised airlines which meet high quality and safety standards and which are integrated into a national development programme designed to serve the people , not big business .
For example , it suggests that multinationals should develop a sense of responsibility and set up ethical investment committees and should apply a 'fair ' ( but unspecified ) trade system and an overall trade liberalisation policy .
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the Deva report , which is little more than a manifesto for the 'globalisation ' party .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm to us that , while the European Union and the Commission will support every effort to find a political solution , the main stumbling block to which , as we all know , is the intransigence of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot side , the Republic of Cyprus will not be barred from the
