for financial services planned under what is known as the Lisbon strategy , which aims to integrate markets and financial services by 2005 and to achieve greater liberalisation of movements of capital , to which we are opposed .
( PT ) As a result of the Member States ' policies , the EU is benefiting from clearly exceptional health systems compared to the rest of the world .
Lastly , we should emphasise the need for a ' New Attitude ' with respect to the elderly , seeing them as an important new resource that should be cherished - not as a burden on society .
Mr President , the European Parliament today has the task of delivering its opinion on the conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States on the one hand and the Republic of Lebanon on the other .
We cannot ignore the fact that the political leanings of the Lebanese authorities are still dominated by Syria and that Damascus has a decisive influence over the position of the Lebanese Government in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , despite the Israeli army 's withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in May 2000 .
It is , however , by balancing its components and respect for its diversity that it will become a Europe that is more democratic , safer , more developed and definitely more respected on the international scene .
It is other types of causes that need to be cleared up .
There are various approaches to solving this problem : one is that adopted by the United States in the wake of the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 , by creating the Oil Pollution Act , in 1990 .
Next , we should surely amend all international legislation .
.
Indeed , this Bank came into being as a result of the fall of the Berlin Wall and its primary aim is to assist the economies of Eastern European countries , which have since opened up to international competition , to overcome the natural difficulties arising from their embryonic development .
The recommendations contained in this report , which are aimed at increasing financial and technical aid for small and medium-sized businesses and at prioritising the implementation of financial resources within partnerships , especially in the form of venture capital , and the call for an ongoing commitment to train staff in the bank which can help them better to perform their duties , are extremely positive aspects .
We agree with the rapporteur 's argument for maintaining aid under the FIFG and the participation of the main parties involved , the need for research to be promoted and for an economic instrument to be created to support possible crisis situations in the sector , such as natural disasters .
It is therefore on their behalf and on the behalf of all Europeans who live from the sea that I am speaking in this plenary , and that I am trying to support solutions likely to keep the economic , social and cultural costs of these Community measures to a minimum .
This quality can be improved not only by correctly implementing and targeting Community investment , but also by simplifying legislation , making it more coherent and more comprehensible to those for whom it is intended and , consequently , making its implementation more effective .
This was practised more , however , as a costly and fashionable pastime than as an economic activity .
Although aquaculture cannot replace fishing in the environment , it is , nevertheless , designed to complement and enhance some much-loved and sought after species that today feature on our daily fish menus and that fishing cannot supply in sufficient quantities .
Mr President , Commissioner Solbes Mira - who has previously been a Minister for Fisheries and is therefore not insensitive to this debate , despite not currently being responsible for the sector - I wish to address my first words of congratulation to Mr Martin , who has proved once again that he is an excellent MEP by producing this magnificent report , which is entirely appropriate to the current situation .
Nevertheless , as a consequence of recent food crises that have beset Europe , consumers have become suspicious of aquaculture .
I have voted for this report , because I agree in particular with the views it expresses on the 'positive effect ' that the EBRD 's activity has had on the economies of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
The EBRD must continue to function as an institution that shares the spirit of solidarity and cohesion that are a collective aim of the European Union .
We must , however , overcome the crisis of confidence in aquaculture products , promoting food safety measures and modernising production technologies .
The European Union cannot do without international fishing grounds and the agreements negotiated with third countries , in the exclusive economic zones of these same countries .
The European Union must set an example in complying with international agreements and must give a decisive boost to the regulation of international fishing .
The failed reform of the common fisheries policy highlighted this unfortunate situation .
The rapporteur has made important observations about the social , economic and environmental fields of our fisheries sector with regard to fishing in international waters .
I therefore agree with the report , which aims to increase the EU 's presence in regional fishing organisations ( RFOs ) , and to conclude bilateral agreements and renew existing agreements .
The pursuit resulted in physical confrontations and injury to one of the authority 's agents , requiring the intervention of a Portuguese navy corvette .
This is crucial for supplying our market , which has a shortfall in fish products and for preserving fishing in those EU regions that depend on it and which tend historically , to be least-favoured regions , which lack economic alternatives .
