Even worse , the report makes a scientifically unacceptable correlation between small-scale crime and organised crime .
This correlation has not come about by chance and proves once again that the real need to combat common crime is being used as a pretext to curtail people ' s rights and freedoms and create an even more authoritarian institutional framework .
Innovations and new multimedia and Internet technologies will give us the tools we need for distance learning both for general education and for training and lifelong learning .
Finally , the European research area must be given form and substance by coordinating activities and policies in the research area and supporting both basic research and pioneering technologies .
The tragic situation in the Balkans is , I think , proof of this .
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is threatened by a number of state or civil forces which refuse to acknowledge its definitive borders .
Ask KFOR to do its job throughout Kosovo , to control borders , to make arrests and to refer people to the courts , in liaison with the representatives of the UN.
So my question to the Council and the Commission is this : what are they going to do , even now , to get KFOR out , given its fatal role in destabilising the region .
And , finally , what does he intend to do about the disastrous proposal of the so-called national liberation army which recently committed crimes in FYROM in a bid to confederate it ?
What we have in the FYROM is the same phenomenon as in so many other countries - Albania , Kosovo , Cyprus and , to a large extent , Turkey - countries which are inhabited by mixed populations , mixed nations with different languages and religions , but which border on compact , nationally homogenous countries or regions inhabited by the overwhelming majority of the nationalities in question .
It is a scenario which we have witnessed numerous times in our region and , as we all know , it is accompanied by bloodshed , ethnic cleansing and the intervention of foreign forces , with both good and bad intentions .
Tetovo University is a typical example .
Ten out of ten for intentions , ideas and the set of conflict prevention and crisis management measures taken .
However , when it comes to the practical , as we have seen in the Balkans , the results are a disaster , an absolute disaster .
But to applaud his position by talking of constitutional change and converting the FYROM into a federation is , I think , highly dangerous , especially in the present circumstances .
Let us at least try out a new starting point , the sole aim of which is conflict prevention .
The European Union must assist and strengthen the healthy forces in the area and must keep its distance from those trying to turn the underworld and organised crime into political agencies .
At last it can emerge wearing a olive wreath , Athena ' s olive wreath of wisdom and peace , rather than the spear and shield of Mars , the ancient god of war .
That proved to be impossible and I was one minute late due to the Bureau ' s delay .
Because if it does not state the nationality , the citizen in question may not be able to stay , as Mr Sj√∂stedt has said .
I should like to draw your attention to the reply given to Parliament last month by the Commission , which said that failing to state the nationality on Greek identity cards might be contrary to Community law and constitute an obstacle to the free movement of Greek nationals on the territory of the Member States , because it violated five directives .
Can nationality be removed from all Greek identity cards and , in more general terms , can the residents of the European Union have identify cards which say nothing , not even European Union , nothing , no nationality whatsoever ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am somewhat surprised to hear that the euro will be born in nine months .
Of course , nothing is perfect in this imperfect world and , as the rapporteur points out , the rate of inflation is set to exceed 2 % , the stability criteria set by the European Bank , for the second year running , but not to a sufficiently serious extent to give us particular cause for concern .
Not , as you might assume , for ideological reasons , although of course ideological reasons are not easily dismissed , but for reasons of competitiveness .
We should take every opportunity to remind ourselves and the citizens of Europe that our Union has engaged in a huge economic venture in order to gain its rightful place at the economic vanguard of the world .
This venture is based on the triad of a knowledge economy , full employment and renovation of the social state .
Our rapporteur insists on the technological aspects of economic superiority .
At lunchtime it was still in free fall and it is threatening to drag us down into a slump with it .

According to the report , the biotechnology industry should operate without restraint and beyond any form of control and its interests should come before any public interest .
This huge increase in our balance of trade deficit has little to do with the increase in oil prices .
This sort of report cannot , I think , hide the fact that there are economies in the EU which are still a long way from 'real ' convergence .
The Americans , NATO and the European Union spent USD 100 million ousting President Milosevic .
Is this the punishment for resistance ?
Investment services are , without doubt
