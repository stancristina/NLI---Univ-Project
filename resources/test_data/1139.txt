criminal invasion of Afghanistan by the American armed forces was increased by a further fifteen children , murdered during bombings by the occupying forces .
Mr President , I should like to ask the Bureau to invite the House , during the next plenary , to observe one minute 's silence in memory of the children and the thousands of other civilians who lost their lives during the above invasions .     – Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Renate Sommer , on the work which she carried out on her report .
We agree with the Commission proposal in principle , because it makes life easier for users , that is , drivers , who will have fewer difficulties in cross-border transport with this approach .
We simply have a few objections – and I am glad that both the Commission and the Council understand them – which focus on two points .
Secondly , will the new satellite positioning system be applied exclusively or not ?
There were Members , Austrian members , who – quite understandably in my opinion – had every reason to have an acute awareness of the issues we were debating , because the Austrian people had , and continue to have , a particular awareness of this specific issue , which was why , moreover , the relevant protocol was drawn up when Austria acceded to the European Union in 1995 .
And then , as regards the lorries which should or should not pass through , Parliament again took the view that more lorries should pass through .
Finally , this opinion on the part of Parliament was accepted by the Council and that is how we arrived at the result of the conciliation .
If , in the meantime , there is progress on the Eurovignette , the relevant agreement will also apply in the case of Austria .
I am , of course , aware that some members are not happy .
We could not move any closer to the Austrian positions , because then we would have had problems with Members from other representations .
Our rapporteur , Mr Giorgio Lisi , who has done an excellent job , which was ultimately crowned with success during the conciliation procedure , also personally took this line .
I think they are exaggerating , I think that the agreement we have is a good agreement and that we should accept it as it stands .     – Commissioner , you know that our party , the Communist Party of Greece , has raised the problem of the rights of the Russian-speaking minority in the Baltic States on numerous occasions .
It is , in my opinion , an example of gross hypocrisy .     – Commissioner , of course I absolutely agree with your position that these are political processes and I should like to ask you about the most recent statement by Mr Giul , who said that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side are preparing a compromise on the island which will be published next week .
In your opinion , does this constitute acknowledgment of the victory of the opposition in northern Cyprus and do you think this marks a change in Ankara 's position ?
When aeroplanes , however , in order to save a few minutes ' flying time or a few litres of fuel , fly over residential areas , instead of turning in to land over the sea , which is exactly what happens at Athens International Airport , thereby disturbing residential areas with hundreds of thousands of residents , what happens then ?
Its main characteristic should not therefore be the amount of funding .
The development , moreover , of the legislative framework does not appear to have resulted so far in a greater take-up of appropriations , while the financial reference amount in the European Commission 's proposal for 2004-2006 makes provision for an average annual sum which is higher than that of the previous period of application of the action and which , in my opinion , corresponds to the objective set .
However , it is understandable that action by these agencies and the management of Community funds on their part should be characterised by transparency and honest financial management .
I should like to state from the outset our categorical opposition to the cultivation of genetically modified products and to point out for the umpteenth time the hypocrisy of the Commission which , at a time when it is implementing the reform of the CAP , supposedly with the basic principle of improving the quality of agricultural produce in order to guarantee healthy and safe food , environmental protection etc. , it is , on the other hand , promoting the cultivation of modified products .
Of the 210 fields cultivated , half were modified and half were conventional .
Research has shown that modified rape , maize and sugar beet plants damage the flora and fauna far more than conventional crops .
As for hypocritically citing the 'polluter pays ' principle , I do not understand , on the one hand , what calculations can be used to evaluate either the possible environmental cost and the damage to consumer health while I fear , on the other hand , that they will ultimately heap the blame indirectly , if not clearly , on the producers themselves .
With current scientific resources , diagnosis is made at an early stage and , with suitable treatment , the advance of the disease can be controlled or slowed down and the quality of life of sufferers improved substantially .
What is needed , as quickly as possible , is a new epidemiological study , at European level and in collaboration with the WHO , so that the extent of the problem can be seen from the data collected and the need for intensive research and international cooperation can be highlighted .
