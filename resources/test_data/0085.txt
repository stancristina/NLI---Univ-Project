This strikes me as sensible , effective and much to be welcomed .
We are disappointed , but , in our disappointment , in the darkness , a light shines , for it was on 13 December 2003 that we got the news that the Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen had been awarded to the President of the European Parliament and thus to Parliament itself , which shows that we have allies in the cause of a strong , democratic , and active Europe .
A ‘core Europe ’ is no solution , for the problems on which the few agree are always different ones .
There are three kinds of failure : you can lose to your opponents , you can fail to achieve goals that are set too high , and you can be your own downfall .
I do not want a ‘core Europe ’ ; instead , we should waste no time in resuming the attempt , with the Convention text , to get more of a constitution for a large-scale Europe with twenty-five Member States .
It is still on the table .
It represents a setback for European integration , but what brought it about ?
On 1 January next year , there will be no European arrest warrant .
I might add that it is generally not the core of a fruit that is interesting , but its pulp , so creating a smaller core Europe is not a way out .
We may perhaps then come to the conclusion that we have , in recent years , not engaged very seriously with the question of whether the EU can be made both deeper and wider at the same time .
The scope has been more clearly delimited , and that is something that we do not always see .
For over a decade now , we have been debating the takeover directive , the first version of which , as we know , was unable to get over the last hurdle in this House .
This represents a decrease of 2.8 % on the current budget plan .
In my view , conditions will also improve as a result of Saddam Hussein’s arrest , enabling us to devote all our energies to helping the people of Iraq .
The Commission firmly rejected this attempt .
He has said that he no longer wishes to chair the committee , but I am sure he will keep his seat in the next Parliament and the House will continue to benefit from his wit and wisdom , unless the British people are foolish enough not to re-elect him .
Even if we include the new countries in the equation , the staff-to-population ratio falls from 0.8 officials per 10 000 inhabitants to 0.7 per 10 000 .
We want to prepare for demographic change , as population levels are declining throughout Europe .
The 2004 budget will be your last budget , Commissioner , and it is not yet apparent that all the reforms have been completed satisfactorily .
The basic question is this .
After all , that is what the resolution adopted by this House says .
I believe that the compromise tailors the legislation to reflect scientific progress and economic developments , and patients will benefit from this .
Through the mutual recognition procedure , it is now possible for every patient in Europe to access these medicinal products .
We also need to speed up the procedures further where particularly important medicines are concerned , and we need an adjustment of the structures of the European Medicines Agency to the EU of the Twenty-Five .
Unfortunately , we still do not have a proposal from the Commission .
I therefore urge all fellow Members who may have a rather critical viewpoint to support this compromise tomorrow .
The compromises which have been found are acceptable .
If we look around the group of fellow Members here , surely all we are doing is just patting each other on the back , with very high costs for the taxpayer .     – Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , let me be quite frank and say that many of us feel ill at ease today .
By adopting the single statute , we are also voting to do away with reimbursements of travel costs that are utterly absurd .
We know from the information given us by all three legal services – Parliament’s , the Council’s and the Commission ’s – that what is actually proposed here is contrary to the law , yet this Parliament is nonetheless prepared to go along with it .
If you want to detach the one from the other , then you will end up proposing a solution that lacks both fairness and solidarity .
The arms embargo is an instrument of political pressure , and what that means is that any response to the question as to what has changed in China must be political in nature .
Right at the very start , I would like to say that I regard the removal of the arms embargo as neither advisable nor wise .
We should be urging both parties in this hotspot , China and Taiwan , to be cautious in the action they take , and reminding them that we live in times in which peaceful , rather than warlike solutions must be found .     – Mr President , let me start by saying that my criticisms , coming as they do from a member of the German opposition , cannot be more trenchant than those uttered in this House ten minutes ago by a Member belonging to the same party as the German foreign minister , who stated that , on this issue at least , the German Federal Chancellor was suffering from delusions .
He is not so
