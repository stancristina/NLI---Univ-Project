resolving more than half of the problem of sea pollution with hydrocarbons , since the Commission states that the majority of that pollution is not due to accidents but to deliberate discharges .
And I would like to stress the important step we are also taking on the issue of codecision , with the intention from the outset to agree common positions with the Council allowing us to speed up the very necessary entry into force of the legislative rules .
We are talking about an additional monitoring and coordination measure , as well as a genuine Community system for monitoring the maritime traffic in dangerous goods , by satellite , with black boxes , etc .
Over the last four years I have come to this building some forty times .
Mr President , honourable Members , I must express my gratitude to Mr Pex for his work .
We are favourably inclined towards the ideas .
As I conclude on the report by Mr Pex , allow me to reiterate my conviction that there is considerable convergence .
Parliament and the Commission are of one mind on this .
I trust it will prove possible to adopt both these texts .
We shall not hesitate to act if countries fail to meet the deadlines for transposing into their national legislation the directives adopted here with a view to combating marine pollution and promoting maritime safety .
Early adoption is essential , given the imminence of enlargement .
Turning to more serious issues , I should like to thank Parliament , especially the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
It should be borne in mind that difficulties have arisen at Council regarding several Member States , and such support would be helpful .
It involves both concerns for nuclear safety and the desire for fair competition in the electricity market .
I shall now turn to the draft directive on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste .
Sweden has made a great deal of progress too .
The fact that deep geological repositories are currently the best solution does not necessarily mean they will be the best solution ten years from now .
This is simply to guarantee the highest possible level of safety within an enlarged Europe .
As I recalled when presenting these initiatives , in the past the Commission tabled proposals on issues such as acceptable levels for bathing waters in the European  Union .
That is something different .
Sadly , such a scenario could come about , as it seems certain countries such as the United States , Australia and possibly others might not lend their support .
That link has actually been scientifically proven .
They will therefore no longer be classed as developing countries .
They will be deemed to be fully developed .
Nonetheless , I would remind the House that nuclear power is not perceived simply in strictly technical , practical or scientific terms .
This involves a common methodology and the necessary guarantees that any anomaly or incident will be dealt with by reference to the latest available technical developments .
I could also mention avoidance of a situation in which European regulations were superimposed on national ones .
It demonstrates that , as one of Spain’s greatest twentieth-century thinkers maintained , the solutions to problems it is difficult to solve at national level lie in Europe .     . – Mr President , we know all about .
There is no scope for rabble rousing in dealing with such issues .
It also concerns the treatment of radioactive waste .
It is essential to guard against seeing everything in black and white in a completely irrational way .
It should be remembered that the candidate countries have all been members of the International Atomic Energy Agency from its creation .
What is on the table today means these same standards can be required everywhere and can be imposed in future .
It will impact on waste management also .
The latter is one of the most promising options for the future .
All Member States of the Union would do well to learn from the Finnish approach .
That would be something quite different .
They will also allow work to continue in this sector as it has in others .
On the other hand , I am indeed able to list the achievements of the last four years .
Sadly , at the end of her intervention she referred to the nuclear package as nonsense .
For the sake of my personal regard for Mrs Ahern , and in the interests of parliamentary courtesy , I therefore call on Mrs Ahern to withdraw the word nonsense .
The maximum Euratom contribution was set at 50 % of a project’s cost .
Nonetheless , there are important sectors in which the instrument could be helpful to the Commission ’s policy on nuclear safety .
If you , honourable Members , bear all these ventures in mind , you will readily understand why the Commission is calling for the Euratom mechanism to be increased by EUR 2 billion .
The Commission will have the opportunity of assessing the individual merits of applications when it studies each of them in turn .
Essentially , it all relates to the countries due to join the Union in four months ’ time on 1 May .
To mention just one such responsibility , each and every one of us is responsible for ensuring not just the safety of supply , but also maximum safety for the citizens .
In other words , we should try to ensure that , for any type of legislative delegation , there is an interinstitutional agreement , with the Council and Parliament as the legislative power .
Despite the insignificance of cotton in Europe , however , there have been certain statements against Community policy on the sector , which I believe to be entirely demagogic , since in the European Union export refunds are not given and goods are imported freely , without tariffs .
