legislation and measures that act as a stimulus .
The role of the EIB has been of topical interest in the debate in recent years , and criticisms have been made .
The analysis for the year is in many respects a follow-up to the sterling work carried out a year ago by Mr Lipietz .
A number of the views put forward at that time are being repeated now .
Today , most EIB loans go to different types of regional development project within the EU.
Among these are the Balkan countries , the Mediterranean countries and the ACP countries .
In my view , this has to be reflected to a greater extent in the EIB ' s activities .
From having been a rather closed institution , the EIB has begun to change its attitude to information and transparency .
The EIB has published a list of projects at the assessment stage .
If the Council does not want to give the ECB this remit , the issue should be clarified at the next Intergovernmental Conference , with the objective of establishing proper prudential supervision of the EIB ' s activities .
These issues received much attention in the Lipietz report last year .
In my opinion , more staff are required in this area .
In line with what applies to commercial banks able to handle greater risks , the Member States should , for example , consider reviewing the ratio of capital borrowed by the Bank to capital of its own , with the purpose of including the EIB ' s reserves .
They do not change the content of the report but highlight the environmental issues and the issues concerning openness and transparency .
Mr President , I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur , my Swedish colleague Olle Schmidt , for a very good report .
It sheds light upon the important areas of Europe ' s future development , which the EIB has a major responsibility for promoting within the framework of its powers .
I am thinking of the candidate countries , the way in which projects are prioritised , small and medium-sized enterprises and supervision of the EIB .
When it comes to prioritising projects , it is important to safeguard Europe ' s competitiveness and therefore prioritise infrastructure in the broad sense of the word .
Of the 18 million companies in the EU , 99 % are small and medium-sized enterprises employing 66 % of the workforce .
I agree with that .
Competitiveness and staying power should be the guiding principles here .
I think it necessary for the European Parliament to express an opinion about the EIB ' s activities because the EIB is not only a Bank but also an EU institution that finances large projects and uses Community funds to steer development .
I want to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report that addresses important issues .
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled six amendments that specifically address environmental issues and matters of transparency .
In accordance with Mr Schmidt ' s wishes , I also accept Amendment No 5 as a supplement to Paragraph 30 .
This is the second year that we are discussing the annual report in Parliament .
What is perhaps most remarkable of all , however , is how little all this is discussed by the Bank ' s owners , in the Member States and in the parliaments of the various Member States which , I believe , are in many cases quite unaware of the Bank ' s activities .
First of all , the EIB has been criticised for having supported a series of projects that have increased environmental problems , as well as for shortcomings in terms of environmental impact assessments .
It is rare for the Left to have occasion to praise the World Bank , but it does in this case .
There is a need to go further , however .
This should mean a big improvement .
It should imply , hopefully in practice too , a change of focus for the Bank .
The European Central Bank is a genuinely undemocratic institution which should not be given tasks of this kind .
Smoking is therefore very much a public health issue .
Mr Katiforis is a very intelligent and agreeable fellow MEP , but even intelligent MEPs are occasionally wrong .
In my country , the Public Health Institute has calculated that the one-off effect of the increase in cigarette prices in 1997 was to save 12 500 people from premature death , thanks to the fact that 100 000 people gave up smoking when cigarettes became more expensive .
However , I do not believe it is sensible for the EU to support tobacco cultivation at the same time as great efforts are being made to prevent smoking and reduce the spread of cancer .
We have voted in favour of the report in view of the importance it attaches to transparency and environmental considerations .
We would nonetheless make it clear that we are opposed to Paragraph 22 , designed to make the ECB the EIB ' s supervisory authority .
Madam President , allow me to begin by thanking everyone who has helped with this report : MEPs from other political groups - especially Mrs Roth-Behrendt , former chairperson of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry on BSE - together with the Commission and the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin .
It is , however , important that this should not lead to our seeing a freer flow of viruses .
For example , we have created the European Food Authority .
It is , then , not only the defective legislation but also inadequate compliance with this that have resulted in the present position .
Life continues , and so does its negative sides
