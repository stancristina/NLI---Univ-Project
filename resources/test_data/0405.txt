This will contribute to integration but , as I said during the debate that we have just concluded , it is not that easy to reach agreement concerning these conditions .
In recent months , the work has been concentrated on the patent system 's court-related aspects .
Following intensive discussions , the Presidency tried , at the meeting of 14 November , to reach agreement on a number of central principles for the court system as part of an overall compromise , but it was not possible to reach agreement on all the features .
In spite of the lack of progress , the efforts have continued .
At the meeting on 26 November , the Presidency concluded that COREPER should continue its work , giving high priority to the issue of finalising an agreement and so paving the way for a political agreement .
Against the background of an overall political agreement , the aim is to have the matter of the EC patent finalised and adopted as quickly as possible .
It may sound simple , but it is in fact fiendishly complicated , and when I think of how many debates there have been in my own Parliament in Denmark , I can readily imagine the problem that rotating presidencies will have in getting 15 - and soon , in fact , 25 - parliaments to agree on the same rules .
It is absolutely crucial , so I want to thank Mr Sj√∂stedt for his question .
I am not in a position to say whether one of the subjects might be more difficult than others , but I can in any case imagine that the issue of expenses is something that has a role to play .
The Council is carefully following the work of the Convention and is of course aware of the structure for a constitution , presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing in October .
As is well known , it will be the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference that will adopt a final position on the issues raised by the two MEPs .
It is rather difficult for me here and now to predict what the Intergovernmental Conference will say .
That solution will , on the other hand , be less ambitious than some might have wished .
He is perfectly entitled to table them , but the Presidency has no comments to make , either on its own , or on the Council 's , behalf .
Does the Council also adopt that line of reasoning etc ?
The Council has no view .
Nor should it have , either , for we have left it to the Convention to prepare all these things .
I must not therefore , on behalf of the Council , stand here and evaluate the proposals that are made in the Convention .
I shall spare him that .
I am able to state that Mr Solana has not visited Cyprus since he took office .
He has expressed support for the efforts made by Kofi Annan and , on 12 November , he expressed satisfaction with Kofi Annan 's decision willingly to present a proposal for solving the issue of a united Cyprus .
No practical priorities have yet been set or more specific provisions laid down .
In connection with the Council meeting of 19 November , the ministers debated the Cyprus issue over lunch , once the UN Secretary-General had presented his plan for a solution to the situation .
Last Friday , the European Council meeting welcomed the fact that both Greek and Turkish Cypriots had promised to continue the negotiations with a view to reaching an overall solution on the basis of the UN Secretary-General 's proposal before 28 February 2003 .
In the Council 's view , Kofi Annan 's proposal constitutes a unique and historic opportunity to put an end now to the conflict that has devastated this beautiful island for far too long .
At its meeting in October , the European Council concluded that EU expenditure must be such as to ensure that the enlarged Union has sufficient resources at its disposal to ensure the orderly development of its policies for the benefit of all its citizens .
It was added that multifunctional agriculture will be maintained in all areas of Europe , in accordance with the conclusions of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council and the 1999 Berlin European Council .
To contribute to this process , the Brussels European Council decided that , with a view to enlargement , all commitment appropriations must be added to the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund to the tune of EUR 23 000 million in the period 2004-2006 .
The overall , well-balanced result forms a solid basis for integrating ten new Member States , at the same time as ensuring that the enlarged EU is able to function effectively .
I am also able to refer to paragraph 11 of the President 's conclusions stating that EU expenditure must continue to respect both the imperative of budgetary discipline and efficient expenditure and the need to ensure that the enlarged EU has sufficient resources at its disposal to ensure the orderly development of its policies for the benefit of all its citizens .
Moreover , paragraph 12 reads : ' The needs of producers living in the disadvantaged regions of the present European Union should be safeguarded ; multifunctional agriculture will be maintained in all areas of Europe , in accordance with the conclusions of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council and the 1999 Berlin European Council . '
I cannot be more precise at the present time , but I think that a framework has in this way been set that should reassure the honourable Member , for there is of course no question of any sort of revolution .
The Council took an open decision to embark upon these negotiations on 20 September 2001 and , following the usual relevant procedure
