That should allow us to proceed more steadily , taking careful steps towards a well thought out reform which the farming world really needs .
The government in Belgrade must understand that the tactics it is pursuing will not help to solve the enormous problems that prevail in the area .
Mr President , firstly , the Birdal case concerns a sentence handed down by a Security Court in Turkey .
Secondly , there is no possibility of appeal to a higher body .
It concerns the freedoms of the Turkish people and even our own freedoms .
Regarding Birdal in particular , I would point out that Turkey 's Supreme Court stated as the reason why the Security Court condemned him , that his main preoccupation and orientation were freedom and peace .
Mr President , I am no longer surprised by acts of the Turkish state such as those we are talking about today , and I fear this will not be the last time we will have occasion to talk about such acts .
It wishes to dispense with the Theological College of Halki once and for all .
The European Union cannot play deaf when from the first day there has been an international outcry and condemnation of these unacceptable acts by Turkey .
Mr President , the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the few remaining Greeks in Istanbul have been there for many centuries , long before first the Ottoman and then the Turkish State .
In substance , this is another act of terrorism by a country with no respect for human rights , and which has no hesitation in eliminating any kind of threat no matter what direction it comes from .
I would simply like to say , in conclusion , that if Turkey continually defies and distances itself from European ideals , that is also happening because Europe , by constantly putting only economic interests and criteria first , has not made Turkey understand properly that human rights must have priority .
One of the many indications we have is how Turkey is behaving towards the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople , and how it has behaved in this specific case towards the Theological College of Halki .
Today , at least , the European Parliament has woken up to it .
Let us therefore respond to the call of Patriarch Bartholomew , who is a moderate religious leader , let us do something about this issue .
Do not be slow to imitate them when for once they are doing something positive .
The second thing I want to say is that this act by the Turkish Government - I do not say Turkey , I distinguish Turkey , in other words the Turkish people , from the state , the reactionary and fascist regime in power - is undermining the operation of the Patriarchate by depriving it of its functional organ , the College of Halki .
Mr President , I have three things to say .
My second point concerns Agenda 2000 , which is certainly an issue which is not going to go away .
I think the Vienna summit has a duty to do that .
This has made it necessary to work out a more specific policy for the safety of nuclear installations , a need made more urgent still in light of the accession procedure and the beginning of agreements with the countries of the former Soviet Union .
We cannot afford the luxury of sitting here just twiddling our thumbs .
A second point concerns Romania .
I believe that today 's procedure to a certain extent confirms just that choice and I would like to believe that the Vienna summit will make it official .
Congratulations are due to Bulgaria , to the Bulgarian government and all the political parties , the Bulgarian state , Bulgarian society and the Bulgarian people .
Mr President , the rapporteur has obviously made an effort to add gloss to this report , but I do not think he has succeeded .
Does he say anything about a constitution or about penal law ?
Where before has such a thing ever been proposed ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
But what is the European Union ?
Democracy , respect for the individual and his rights , freedom of thought , the protection of minorities and respect for diversity .
Perhaps that is why Turkey so easily and so often threatens peace , threatens to take up arms even against members of the European Union itself .
But if it does not wish to reconsider its application , it must respect the principles I mentioned .
This report is a very important one and I hope it will not be misunderstood in Turkey , because it was prepared by people who want to help that country finally move into the twenty-first century .
If those two countries were to work closely together , given that they occupy sensitive positions at the crossroads between Europe and Asia and between the Balkans and the Mediterranean , that cooperation would be valuable , productive and constructive for the whole of Europe and , I would say , for the security of the world as a whole .
It is because the conditions of the Luxembourg Council 's decision requiring Turkey to demonstrate a truly European orientation have not been satisfied .
Some of us have not ceased fighting hard for that over the years .
With that rationale , the Bureau of the European Parliament , at the time of Egon Klepsch and with as rapporteurs the then President of the College of Quaestors , the Belgian socialist Ernst Glynn and your present speaker , asked the Council to establish a common statute and proposed to equate MEPs with European judges , as happens in several Member States of the European Union .
Our esteemed German colleague has taken a lot of trouble to come up with some entirely new proposals , and
