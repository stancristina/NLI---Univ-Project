parties , which had so far been kept secret .
We do not , however , know the names of the participants .
How many people have been appointed independently of the general appointment procedures ?
Openness is the best tool honest people in power have for defending themselves against pressure from their own friends .
Provide us with the names of all the experts .
Let us see all the Commission ’s contributions to the legislative process .
Give the Commission ’s sacked accounts manager , Marta Andreasen another job .
Begin afresh with openness , democracy and proximity to the people .
You will lose some friends in the upper echelons , but you will gain in terms of people’s confidence in you and in terms of support for European cooperation .
We put a number of questions to the Commission during the hearings , where we were promised information about the expert groups .
What information is it that has to be protected ?     Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the framework programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship for small and mediumsized enterprises is an important programme for every smaller enterprise in search of information or funding .
The background to the proposal to extend the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship by one year is that the functions of the programme will in future be performed by its successor programme , the ‘ Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation’ , which is planned to run from 20072013 to coincide with the financial perspective .
It was initially disappointing for me to learn that the Commission ’s proposal to extend the programme by a year involved returning to the level originally budgeted for in the framework programme .
That amount was proposed partly because it would correspond to the actual expenditure on the programme in 2004 and partly because it would make the budget for 2006 the extension year level with the average for the previous years .
It is important to maintain and extend aid to entrepreneurs and small and mediumsized enterprises in Europe .
They are the backbone of the European economy , and their continued growth is a condition of achieving the Lisbon objectives .
Finally , the external evaluation report has stressed that the financial instruments in the existing programme in large measure cover the needs of the new Member States .
In the programme’s financing component , the most frequently used financial instrument , the ‘SMEs’ Guarantee Facility’ , had provided aid to 112 000 small and mediumsized enterprises in Europe by the end of 2002 .
The programme operates smoothly and is wideranging , and I was therefore very pleased when a unified Committee on Industry , Research and Energy backed my proposal for an increase in the budget .
My colleague , Mr Březina , and I met with the Council and the Commission on several occasions and now concur with the Council about an agreement at first reading involving an increase in the budget of EUR 7 million instead of the EUR 9.5 million I originally proposed .
I should like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the Luxembourg Presidency , which has demonstrated great political flair and a tireless willingness to compromise ; to the Commission , which has provided technical analyses and guidance in support of the negotiations ; and , finally , to my fellow MEP Mr Březina , whose active participation in the meetings and unfailing support I valued very highly .     Mr President , Commissioner , there is a lack of growth in Europe , and I now see that even the OECD’s economic managers are saying the same thing clearly and unambiguously .
In reality , Europe is not so badly placed when it comes to our export markets .
I am not saying that this is good enough .
What I am , however , saying is that this is not the most important problem , and I am saying that the most important problem right now is that there is insufficient growth in Europe’s internal economy or internal market .
Moreover , such growth does not come about of its own accord .
Such growth only comes about through a combination of modern reforms that , instead of causing countries to compete in reducing social benefits , is couched in human terms and takes the form of a more modern and socially active labour market policy , combined with coordinated investments .
I am able to assent to everything contained in it .
What I should dearly like to hear come out of the economic guidelines is a constructive message to all the Member States , saying ‘let us now , together and in each individual country , invest in the Lisbon Objectives over the next three or four years , and let us do so at one and the same time’ , for doing so simultaneously would be Europe’s secret weapon .
That is something that we in the Nordic countries have demonstrated and that we can extend throughout Europe .     .
In Denmark , we have a health policy based on a balanced diet involving healthy and natural foods .
In a long list of EU Member States , extensive liberalisation in the sphere of food has gradually given rise to a definite need for strict regulation of this area , designed to safeguard and guarantee consumers ’ safety and health .
Public health and consumer protection go hand in hand .
In Denmark , we wish to maintain a high level of protection , but that requires us to retain our arrangements involving a national ban on the unnecessary addition of vitamins and minerals that are harmful to health .
Thank you for your votes .
Mr Bösch pointed out that we still have too much fraud , and that is a view I can only endorse
