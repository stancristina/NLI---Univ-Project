Is it fair that a young person should have to wait three years ?
The EU already has – and will have more – problematic areas within its own external borders .
Quite simply : how is the Commission successfully to carry out this task , or is the idea of its doing so utopian and a mere dream ?
Social and environmental clauses must be developed , and we should help countries develop environmental labelling so that they might be better paid for their products .
We must now help the rest of them to make greater use of both Cotonou and Everything But Arms .     We have voted against this report .
We are in favour , however , of financial support for the EU’s future Member States , but this must be channelled to neglected regions and directed at education , infrastructure and legal institutions .     We Moderates think it is wrong to use public funds to subsidise advertisements for agricultural products , both within the EU and in the rest of the world .
We believe that the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) should be abolished and that agricultural products should be sold on the free market without the EU investing financial resources in communication campaigns and sales promotion measures for these products .
One of these was paragraph 3 , indicating the period in which referendums might take place .
A constitution would lead to increased EU centralisation and help transform the EU into a form of state with global ambitions .
A nucleus of operational provisions with regard to judicial and police cooperation is to be created at European level ( paragraph 1c-2 ) .
A joint data protection authority is to be set up at European level ( paragraph 1c-8 ) .
We should like to see increased cooperation between the Member States on these issues with a view to developing a humane asylum policy , in accordance with the Geneva Convention , for the whole of Europe .
The risks involved in the euro are already clearly seen , above all in Germany which has been subjected to an unduly restrictive monetary policy in recent years , with hundreds of thousands of German workers forced needlessly into unemployment .
This is completely in accordance with economic theory , but too low a target has been chosen .
They deserve to be sharply criticised for their inability to adjust their policy to the way in which the European mixed economy operates .     Mr President , I believe I am the only car worker in this Parliament .
It is the metal workers who have to pay the price through having to do less satisfying work at high speed .
They have a social obligation towards those who work in the factories .
I think it good that the Commissioner mentioned demand in his introduction .
In this area , we can see how the European car industry in actual fact lags far behind competitors in countries such as the United States and Brazil , which are much further ahead with the work on developing more environmentally friendly vehicles .
For Trollhättan , this is of huge significance .
My party has always been open to restructurings , but it is important how they are carried out .
It must not just be a case of informing them of decisions that have been taken .
They must be actively involved in the restructuring process .
A number of people in our country say that we do not need more cooperation at European level , but the opposite is the case .
We need to strengthen those directives , so that we strengthen the position of workers when restructuring is carried out .     Mr President , it is interesting to observe that the Social Democratic representatives from Sweden and Germany , where the car industry has problems , are now leaving it to the EU to find solutions to what are basically problems with their national economies ’ competitiveness .
We have experience from the seventies when national policies on shipyards were conducted in a long list of different European countries .
When we are concerned with an industry that needs to be competitive globally , the conditions that make it competitive cannot be assessed on the basis of national sub-markets .
Above all , a Lisbon process is needed that makes European companies competitive and that can give Europe more companies .
The political composition is a clear step to the right for the EU.
During questioning in the committee , Mr Dimas , as a nominated Commissioner , showed that he lacked both the necessary knowledge of environmental policy and a vision of its future .
One wonders if it can get much worse .     Madam President , ever larger groups of EU citizens view with disquiet the way in which the self-determination of the Member States is continually undermined .
For those of us who have been given democratic mandates in democratic elections to campaign against the centralisation and bureaucratisation of the European project and for those of us who have been given democratic mandates to reject the draft Constitution , this Commission is therefore unacceptable .     Madam President , Mr Barroso , you were appointed as Commission President after many meetings , negotiations and compromises behind the closed doors of the Council .
It forces each Commissioner to reflect upon his or her visions and ideas .
There are many of us who do not have confidence in the person who would be responsible for these issues , which would be at the centre of European debate .
Unlike the Eurosceptics in this House , we believe in a strong Commission .
We do not want to help bring about a situation in which voting in this House is on the basis of the private opinions or moral views of individual Commissioners .
Our task would
