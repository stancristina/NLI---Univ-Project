Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I found out about this speech only a couple of minutes ago , but this is a very serious matter .
We are talking about human life .
It was a pity that the Committee headed off in the wrong direction right at the start .
This is about saving human lives and finding the means of doing so as quickly as possible .
We must remember that we are elected just once every five years , but the car industry holds an election every day .
We especially must not get ourselves caught up in an EEVC test , good though it may be in itself , because developments are happening very fast .
What will we have to offer in terms of technology in two , three or four years ' time ?
Unless everyone is involved our society will flag .
Even we in the European Union may shortly be going around in blinkers .
Finances are not a barrier .
There exist different solutions , for example , in Sweden and Finland , but everyone , ourselves included , must aspire to the Liikanen objective .
Hard copy texts today are already too difficult so for many they will be too difficult on a screen too , but this is a measure of democracy , a measure of e-Europe , Europe 's gauntlet of competition for others to pick up .
Democracy is not a one-way process , as it can easily be on the web.
If that does not happen democracy will be distorted .
The package before us reveals the present state of EU budget administration : frankly , it is wretched .
A full 16 % of the entire budget for last year 's payment appropriations - EUR 15 billion - remained unspent .
The figure for outstanding commitments has risen to EUR 110 billion , which is more than the EU 's annual budget .
A total of EUR 10 billion of payment appropriations remained unspent , and , accordingly , there is an increase in the figure for outstanding commitments .
The present system does not work .
It has problems with payment appropriations , which are at their lowest level for years - just 1.03 % of Community GNI.
This is actually EUR 4.72 billion below the ceiling set for the financial perspectives , although the increase in outstanding commitments has been explosive .
Another problem is administrative expenditure , which exceeds the financial perspectives by EUR 66 million .
Administrative expenditure must be able to be kept below the financial ceiling by means of internal transfers and savings .
Mr President , Mr Duisenberg , ladies and gentlemen , the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential element in the credibility of the Euro area .
Funded pension obligations and low taxes do mean there is more room to move in a crisis .
During recent months the euro has strengthened against the dollar .
I agree with the ECB 's judgment that the strengthening of the euro against the dollar is a positive development , as long as the currency strengthens in a controlled way and not too fast .
The question arises as to what impact the strengthening of the euro will have on inflationary pressures .
Others , meanwhile , have been concerned about the strengthening of the euro against the dollar , as was revealed , for example , in the interview Commissioner Solbes gave last Saturday .
Inflation is 1.7 % at the moment , its lowest since December 1999 .
Last week 's M3 growth figures were higher than predicted .
This fundamental question relates to the whole role of the first pillar .
However , first pillar management is complex and is sometimes ill suited to day-to-day decision-making .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the European Central Bank and its chairman for improvements in its information practices and its positive attitude to dialogue with Parliament regarding monetary policy .
The results of voting in the Governing Council should also be made public .
If dissenting opinion and any results of voting are published anonymously it will strengthen the confidence , such as it is now , the markets have in the European Central Bank .
It is the opinions of our citizens that are the basis for our work .
The measures Member States have taken to stabilise their economies have led to a very low average inflation figure over the last three years .
According to research , over 60 % of consumers still do not think in euros when they consider the prices of products .
Dual pricing will also ensure that the forthcoming holiday period in central Europe will flow smoothly .
Last week a figure who was at the heart of the subject of our discussion today passed away at the age of 88 : Luxembourg 's Prime Minister , who was in office for many years and was one of the founding fathers of the euro , Pierre Werner .
I too , as the European Parliament 's rapporteur , wish to dedicate the last part of my speech to the memory of Mr Werner .
We must bear in mind these visions , these common aims , and , moreover , the jointly agreed principles regarding responsible and sustainable economic policy , when we seek solutions to our continent 's political and economic problems .
At the same time I would like to say how glad I am that the matter has been settled .
I would like in my own speech to stress that we must also practise good neighbourly cooperation in our neighbouring regions .
The Danish Presidency in fact offers a new opportunity for this in the Nordic area .
This is welcome news as far as I am concerned , and I would like to propose that the Commission and Denmark ,
