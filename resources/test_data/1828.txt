These demands must also feature in negotiations on membership .
The added benefit of combined heat and power production is an effective means of getting nearer to the Kyoto objectives and will have a positive impact on EU environmental policy .
The Union should try and adopt an overall view of the promotion of combined production and allow the market to decide on the competitiveness of fuels .
Madam President , Commissioner , I thank Mr Fischler for his statement , which fully explained why the pig industry has reached this situation of overproduction .
We have to find funding for that .
In addition , pigmeat production must be cut in the EU in relation to consumption and the existing outlets for exportation .
In a case like this , those governments that are still recommending increased production are being irresponsible .
Balancing production is urgently required , as otherwise it will take place through a broad sweep of competition .
According to the Commission 's proposal , the Community will be making , in the form of direct aid , a 100 % compensation payment for lost income in the first year to all Member States outside the euro area .
I should like to ask whether we will be recompensing these countries too with an automatic 100 % payment in the form of direct aid to make up for loss of income arising out of fluctuations in currency values in the first year ?
The national currency used to be one means of protecting domestic production of food .
The steady 7 to 8 % fall in the value of currencies like the Swedish krona and the Danish krone , which are the currencies of non-participating countries , compared to , say , the Finnish markka , give these countries a competitive edge in production .
I would like to ask if the Commission intends to monitor the changes in the value of currencies outside the euro area and their effects on the competitor counties , i .e . the euro area .
It allows us to protect ourselves from a currency market that is now in turmoil .
Consumers get confused by too many quality marks , trademarks and labels showing origin .
I therefore give my enthusiastic support to the coordinated scheme referred to in Mr Mulder 's report , whereby quality marks and approval systems are regulated at Union level .
In Finland , we have just established a basis for a policy on the quality of domestic foodstuffs .
Quality means a higher price , because it costs more to produce it .
Mr President , Commissioner , I bring greetings from the northern regions of the European Union .
It is an ecological method of production that we have .
We have a winter , with cold conditions , which sees to it that there is less residual pesticide about than in the countries of the south .
Free trade within the EU has worsened the quality of our food and , for that reason , we give our support to labels , signs and codes that speak for quality , the environment , and which give information on content , all of which increase consumer protection and consumer choice .
Current farming practice , as has also been stated here , has been responsible for most of the effluent in our waterways and the reason for their eutrophication .
Now people are demanding that the pollution and eutrophication of the Baltic should be kept in check .
I especially wish to point out that Finland has not put together any kind of plan itself , but , at least , it has promised to lower its nitrate emissions by fifty per cent .
This is very important , because we not only have a coastline but we also have an inland waterway system .
The agricultural policy which is part of Agenda 2000 is an important instrument for controlling agricultural emissions .
I would also like at this stage to thank Mrs Dührkop-Dührkop , Mr Viola and Mr Giansily for their excellent work .
Expenses are to be paid only for the actual costs incurred , which I think is the right solution .
The status of Members and the issue of equality will now be dealt with by the Council , and here the so-called dual mandate issue rears its head .
The Commission 's budget now contains an exceptionally high level of appropriations in the reserve .
The under-use of the Structural Funds and the way they build up by the end of the programme are real problems .
The Commission and the Member States are applying a bureaucratic system to the administration of the Structural Funds that is out of all proportion to the amounts of money that need to be spent .
But Parliament 's intention to put pressure on the Commission to help people who are suffering is questionable .
Hopefully Mr Santer 's letter and measures taken by the Commission will speedily resolve the situation .
One condition for releasing the funds is that the Commission must present to Parliament its overall strategy for solving the acute economic and political crisis in Russia .
According to this , the legislative , the executive and the judicial powers have to remain distinct from one another ; otherwise a nation 's citizens are vulnerable to despotism .
Mr President , the policy buzz-word in today 's euro economy is discipline .
In global and electronic capitalism the markets are sacrosanct and safely beyond the reach of policy , or , in other words , discipline .
You can control people with policy , but not markets or capital .
While record sums of money are being made in the stock exchange sweepstakes , the price is being paid for it in the shape of mass unemployment .
The devaluation of the dollar is not only a monetary policy
