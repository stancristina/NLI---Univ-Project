I am slightly worried , though , by the statements that the Austrian minister made following conciliation .
The compromise embraces a regime in which the most polluting vehicles are barred and clean ones encouraged , while the available number of points are deducted annually .
I am pleased with the compromise that has been struck with the Council , and we therefore warmly support it .     – Mr President , although progress has been made in the negotiations , I certainly do not think that it is enough .
Ultimately , it decided unilaterally to abolish the ecopoints system on 31 December .
I consider refusing to carry out a freshly taken democratic decision to be wrong .
Could I ask you , Commissioner , to review your intervention , and may I invite you to spend an evening , or a night , with me in the northern part of Brussels , so that you can see for yourself what those people have to put up with day and night ?     – Mr President , the best way of providing development aid is by doing justice to the local context in developing countries .
The criteria for this selection should be sound and their application insightful .
Especially in the delegations , expertise is required in this area .
However , constant requests are being made for the more effective regulation of these matters elsewhere too .
It should give gender equality in development cooperation policy an extra shot in the arm .
The report describes that gender discrimination stops developments in their tracks .
The report also describes that , barring a few exceptions , the industrialised countries and international financial institutions have failed to make good their own promises .
Simply donating money is , moreover , not always the answer .
In that respect , it is astonishing that neither the Zrihen report , nor the Commission ’s own , should make any reference to Islam at all .
But , Commissioner , the European Union’s own knowledge centre has calculated that in the event of the uncontrolled use of this genetic technology , also in traditional farming , costs would rise from 1 to 41 % depending on the crop , because we have no idea how the consumer will react .
In the light of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s sterling report , I would ask the Commission , in its capacity as an important European institution , to accept this task with renewed dynamism and table sound proposals following thorough research , in order to achieve truly sound legislation .     – Mr President , like the chairman of our Committee on Fisheries , I too have the privilege of speaking late this evening and I have the special privilege of acting on behalf of my coordinator , Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna .
I am therefore looking forward to the Commission ’s reaction , as well as Parliament’s .     .
The problem is that this war is not yet , by any means , over ; there are still foreign troops on Iraqi territory , there is no legitimate Iraqi government and every day , attacks from the Iraqi opposition on the occupiers claim victims .
The VVD delegation believe that it is unnecessary to draw on the margins under financial perspectives , our own resources in other words , if this is not absolutely necessary .     . – A small Member State is being subjected to a measure which public opinion in that country has unanimously rejected out of hand .
The Heads of Government have failed .
As a result , the old road tolls are being re-introduced after all , accompanied by new electronic technology .
Quite apart from my general criticism of such neo-colonial fishing agreements , I have in this case another objection .
The first obstacle is the international undertaking of 1999 , by which the Kremlin committed itself to withdrawing its military presence from Georgia .
It is reminiscent of the Central Europe of previous years : Romania after Ceaucescu , or Serbia after Milosevic .
It will have to be a cautious process , one that is primarily based on the efforts of the peoples of Georgia themselves : the Georgians as the largest group , but also taking account of the three large national minorities .     Mr President , Commissioner , following the euphoria over the peaceful revolution that took place a few weeks ago , we are now preoccupied with a growing number of major concerns .
At the same time , however , we know that the influence of Russia in Georgia is very bad in the long term from a structural point of view .
I am very much in favour of this : that is also laid down in the resolution .
The European Union must play a pioneering role in order to prevent this : if possible , by convincing Russia ; but if necessary , by seeking confrontation .     Mr President , the death penalty is an abomination .
Under these circumstances , the death penalty is a highly dangerous instrument in the hands of a government that refuses to listen to diverging opinions and stands in the way of alternative solutions .
What was that we were saying about good neighbourly relations ?
The way that Romania is now , few consider joining that much larger country a matter of urgency .
Compensation for house owners who are evicted is ridiculously low ; there is no means of recourse against it and the residents , often retired foreigners from across the EU , are not even informed .
I therefore take the view that there is still neither adequate protection by the United States nor protection of the interests of air travellers and airline companies .
In general , before we discuss the
