is already heavily in debt ?
Finally , in regard to the committee 's amendments , we urged increased cooperation with third countries , and the CEEC countries in particular , through training programmes such as the Matthaeus programme .
In Europe there is a legal vacuum in this area .
Although Europe has a large medicines market , it also fortunately has a great scientific and industrial tradition : something known as good manufacturing practice , a notion which must be preserved .
Finally , I welcome the creation of the European Medicine Evaluation Agency .
So here we have a gentleman who dares give advice to people who are doing much better than certain others and who tells them : ' If you come to come to our country , you will not actually do as well , but we have a better system ' .
Our pragmatic position can be summed up in four simple ideas which are effectively adapted to the reality of the situation : the decriminalizing of all drug use , controlled legislation for products which do not lead to addiction , public international control of the supply and trade in hard drugs based on an agreement between the European Union , the United States and the other major consuming and producing countries , and , finally , the generalization of policies of risk reduction and substitution treatment .
Under the pretext that zero inflation is virtually inachievable in a period of economic growth , some economists have always believed that the official policy should be one of low inflation .
Drugs are spreading because this society is ethically decadent .
However , I do not believe you are going to get very far by giving equally short shrift to those who want to liberalize and those who simply want to repress .
Here in Parliament we have the obligation to discuss this matter a great deal more .
But above all we must help parents who are so often ill-equipped to confront the dangers threatening their children , and also the teachers and trainers , especially those active in risk environments .
We must endeavour to act on collective awareness , on public opinion , on our Member States , on our governments - and I am well placed to know about this , given my nationality - and , finally , on international opinion as a whole .
Madam President , we would like a separate vote on Amendments Nos 5 and 6 .
This is why I invite you to vote in favour of my amendment , especially as the Commission and Parliament must succeed in convincing the Council .
In order to make its intentions quite clear , it has even dechristened the programme , which is no longer concerned with ' Community customs ' but simply ' Community action on customs ' , which we consider to be perfect .
The Council must see drug addicts as people in distress who must be brought back into society and not as delinquents .
Taken overall , this would not increase expenditure but rather reduce it .
Mr President , representative of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin with a comment on procedure .
I tabled an amendment which simply specified these amounts .
Mr President , a cooperation agreement on fisheries has been concluded with Morocco .
Health professionals and patients as well as governments require this to provide the decision-makers with all the material they need for the best possible insight into existing situations and how they are developing .
All these measures , harmonized throughout all Member States , will allow blood products to circulate freely throughout the whole European Union .
Common standards will therefore have to be set .
The European Parliament already asked for precisely this in its resolution of November 1993 .
The ideology of obscurantism , of deliberately ignoring the origin of blood or the origin of meat .
It is the most common , chronic , terminal illness among our older people .
At the end of the debate on the eight reports on discharge - when you were in the Chair - there is a reference to a remark by me that 'although it was true that the Council had not attended the whole debate , neither had all the rapporteurs been present to hear the Council speak ' .
The figures are disastrous .
No doubt that is true , but there are three points which I should like to make .
Although our achievements have been reasonable , we are prevented from doing better by the role and status of the European Parliament itself , and by the difficulty of persuading governments to accept that major institutional change is vital , and that we need more democracy and more policies .
However , 50 years ago they were torn away from Europe and forced into a geopolitical entity where they have never felt at home .
Countries which have emerged from the communist bloc must be able to choose freely the type of security structures they wish to have .
Hope is vital to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , and while they are well aware that it would be rash to move too quickly , they still need to be given , as soon as possible , some clear and encouraging signals .
We are taking part in a historic adventure .
Rejecting it would therefore amount to contesting the figures , which at present are not in dispute .
Furthermore , with regard to the fisheries sector , we must welcome the financial protocol annexed to the agreement , which amounts to ECU 500 million over four years .
We also need such a system in order to be able to focus our efforts more rapidly on prevention rather than healthcare per se - and this , perhaps , should be the aim of medicine in the twenty-first century .
