usually the most perfectible .
European public opinion is behind the Charter , whatever some people may think , since many people think it is very important to them .
In other words , we believed that it was not necessary for the Committee on Petitions to produce an extensive report and to present it as if it were a fundamental report , because we had confidence in our rapporteur in the Committee on Freedoms .
And non-repatriation in the event that the applicant is at risk of the death penalty or corporal punishment .
I agree with them that our main concern must be attention to and clear information for patients .
And an increase - as the rapporteurs have said - in the monitoring of pharmaceuticals , because the effects of medication do not end with authorisation , and furthermore there must be continued monitoring .
Then comes the first reading in the Council and , taking advantage of the previous explanation by the Commission , it cuts the appropriations intended for external actions even further , using the pious moral justification of budgetary savings and the principles of sound financial management .
Since not all commitments can be met , however , and not everything can be funded when money is scarce , we have to turn to the excuse of the poor implementation of certain geographical programmes .
I believe that , in terms of applying cuts , the efforts of the Council are quite sufficient , since it is a great specialist in that area .
My group also supports Mr Stenmarck 's strategy of frontloading , in other words , providing for the use of surpluses available from the present financial year 2002 to bring forward certain expenses forecast for 2003 and therefore relieve the burden on the 2003 budget , as the rapporteur explained at length during his speech .
We therefore reject Amendment No 1 presented to the House by the Group of the European Peoples ' Party , which requests that it also be extended to Members of Parliament who have similar responsibilities .
Firstly , I would like to ask the Council - which , although it is absent , I hope will read the Minutes - whether it intends to comply with what was agreed last year in relation to the contribution to the programme of restructuring the fleet which traditionally fished in Moroccan waters , and which we agreed to restructure as a result of the lack of an agreement with that country .
Up until 18 October , EUR 105 million remained uncommitted .
This also implies a consideration by the Council of the total amount for this heading .
Mr President , I simply wish to thank the Commissioner for the information he has provided us with and the Commission in general for the work it has done , in particular ECHO , to alleviate this situation which is very worrying from a humanitarian point of view .
I would like to thank the Commissioner once again and wish him every success in his efforts .
While social dialogue is to be a effective instrument in the fight against the scourge of work accidents , political dialogue , with the intergroups , has led to the improvement of a report which was excellent from the outset .
I therefore believe that the triple aspects of the strategy are correct ; the global approach ranging from professional qualifications to the working day , from demographic trends , the general development of economic activity to that of the working population , the notion that safe and healthy working environments and organisations are factors which affect the performance of the economy in general and of companies in particular and , above all , the culture of risk prevention .
The culture of prevention must be insistent , to the point of boredom .
In other words , risks caused by the self-employed worker which they are not protected from .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are faced with a broader problem , that of the organisation of work characterised by the use of workers provided by temporary work agencies , the dividing up of the productive process , allocating it to contractors , subcontractors and self-employed workers and externalised and decentralised production methods in general .
Without getting into issues such as those relating to liabilities in certain types of accident , I believe that the constant and determined fight against accidents now has a new factor within the collective landscape : that offered by a culture of prevention in which the protagonists are the workers and the authorities themselves .
Before a wedding , the pre-nuptial agreement can be significant .
I believe we must start with the fact that it is good to have financial perspectives - I was the rapporteur for Parliament when the first financial perspectives were proposed - but these must not be restrictive .
The same is true of the Structural Funds , which are a sign of economic and social cohesion , not total cohesion , but an important tool for the modernisation of these countries , as they have been for others such as Ireland - the country of origin of the President - Spain - my own country - Portugal , etc .
In any case , I confirm what he said , taking into account , furthermore , that , when the mandate was given for this resolution , the Conference of Presidents consulted the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
Mr President , in politics , dogmas are overcome by the will of the majority and in this case I believe my fellow Members , whose speeches I heartily welcome , have made their will very clear .
Certainly an enormous amount of work has been carried out
