What must not happen is for the EU now to go in and provide aid as a thank you to those who voted in favour of the Koffi Annan plan and to forget those who voted against the plan .
This was clearly unjust and clearly unacceptable to the Greek Cypriot population , and it was consequently rejected by a huge majority .
As long as Turkey has occupied part of another European country ’s territory , we cannot conduct negotiations , such as may be decided upon in this House in December , with the Turkish Government about Turkish accession to the EU.
It is the Greek Cypriot population that have been the losers since 1974 .
The fact that a Christian and Eurosceptic has now been removed has not mollified us .
Mr Barroso’s Commission was not inclined to promise that the EU’s auditors and the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control could now be given permission to audit every voucher for the use of EU money .
Nor has Mr Barroso’s Commission promised us full details of the Commission ’s more than 3 000 working groups .
Who is involved in these groups , what do the groups do , who set them up and what do they cost the taxpayers ?
When will apologies be made to heroic whistleblowers such as Paul van Buitenem and Dorte Smith Brown ?
Those employees who help clear up fraud and who prevent fraud must be rewarded rather than punished .
We need a Commission that will introduce general law and order .
Each country should elect its own Commissioner and hold him or her politically responsible , while Members of the European Parliament should be able to monitor their conduct as European administrators and , if need be , request the Court of Justice to sack them for dereliction of duty .     Mr President , the Commissioners are appointed by the national governments and , just as the governments are of different political colours , so are the Commissioners ’ political positions different .
It was an expression of the pluralism in European politics , and Parliament had to live with the fact that there were Commissioners with whose positions we disagreed .
Now , Mr Buttiglioni has been replaced following negotiations between the President of the Commission and Parliament’s group chairmen – not because of his actions but because of his personal views .
There are still nominated candidates with a Communist past .
Someone is still designated Commissioner for Competition who scarcely has the required independence for that post .
I am not a Catholic , and I do not share Mr Buttiglioni’s view of homosexuals or of female equality but , in the light of the clearly dictatorial censorship of opinion in the opposition to Mr Buttiglioni , I intend to vote against this Commission , which has been constituted in a way that does not reflect the various political positions in Europe .
Only the first of these political positions is permitted according to this Parliament’s majority view .
Overcoming difficulties always makes people stronger , and I believe that you too have become stronger now that you have seen things through .
You deserve that recognition , also accorded to you by my group chairman .
You said today that you wanted to strengthen the connection between ordinary people and the European Union .
I sincerely hope , therefore , that you and the whole of the College will correspondingly give this high priority .
The European Union’s problem is , however , not just a problem of communication but also one of action .
For ourselves in the PSE Group and for the party of which I am chairman , it is now very important for you to confirm that your highest priority – as you expressed it within the confines of the European Union – is jobs , jobs and more jobs .
They wonder if they will be able to get jobs in the future and what will happen to their children and families .
If we are to deal with globalisation in a pro-active , rather than defensive , way and if we are to offer a pro-active response during the forthcoming trade negotiations with the United States , China , India and all the developing countries , we must be able to create jobs , jobs and more jobs in Europe .
The Lisbon process – which all of us , or many of us in any case , are solidly behind – must be taken seriously by the governments .
It would be of vital importance if you could confirm this in your response .     Mr President , Mr Barroso , I participated in the vote partly in order to obtain a Commission with more women in it than the present Commission .
You wanted to comply with our demand and therefore promised eight female Commissioners .
You lived up to my expectations when you quickly and efficiently put together a Commission with eight female Commissioners and sound liberal people of first-rate ability in important posts .
In the light of this , I supported you all the way , not least when things got rough in recent weeks .
It is therefore with great regret that I must now point out that you have broken your promise concerning eight women in the Commission .
I cannot , unfortunately , vote in favour of your Commission tomorrow .
I must also be able to look those people in the eye who feel strongly about our original demand for eight female Commissioners .
No, apparently not .
You will therefore see me not taking part in the vote tomorrow .
You are presenting a Commission without Mr Buttiglioni , whom Parliament could not accept – not because he was , and is , a Catholic and not because he was , and is , a conservative , but because he was unable to take on the task
