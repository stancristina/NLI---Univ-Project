a long time .
So we welcome the proposal to set up a special group within the Advisory Committee and we welcome the rapporteur 's suggestion that it should have more resources .
Clearly we also need greater synergy between the different Commission initiatives for improving legislation .
We sometimes think that the different parts are operating in isolation .
And , of course , we need greater cooperation between Member States and to overview best practice and seek to repeat best practice elsewhere .
And finally , it is crucial to ensure maximum involvement of the users of this legislation , particularly businesses , because they know best how this legislation affects them .
However , having said that , you could quite conceivably produce wonderful , simple legislation , yet it could be completely destroyed by the way that Member States implement it and enforce it .
We must understand that there are three stages of legislation - formulation , implementation , including transposition , and enforcement - and we have to see the process as a whole .
We often find the greatest problem is not the original legislation but how it has been transposed by Member States and the speed at which they have transposed it , how they have implemented it and how they have enforced it .
I am often quite surprised by how relatively simple ideas are turned into the most complex nightmares as we go through that process .
As part of this on-going determination by the Commission to simplify legislation , I would like to see much greater cooperation between Member States and the Commission about the whole life of legislation and , particularly , involvement with the people who have prime responsibility for enforcing the legislation , who are often local and regional actors .
So we must consider the whole process when we draft the original legislation .
In some ways , you could argue , we should start at the end and look at how we enforce it and then work backwards as a way of getting simpler legislation .
But the SLIM process ought to go much further .
We need a rolling programme which will cover all legislation and look at simplifying , consolidating , re-casting , sometimes repealing legislation .
Sometimes we may need to go for the status quo , but we need a more dynamic process than we have had so far .
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that although I have been allocated four minutes , I should like to do my bit for the simplification and streamlining of bureaucracy by speaking for less than half that time .
I congratulate the rapporteur on highlighting such a very important issue and also highlighting the failures of the Commission to get to grips with it thus far .
I hope that the Commissioner will say what more is to be done to give added urgency to what is such a very important programme .
However , rather than criticise the Commission more than the rapporteur has already done , rather even than refer just to the four committees involved in this particular issue , I should like to highlight one issue the rapporteur also raised , which is that it is really entirely up to us , as Members of this House , to ensure that legislation is better in the first place .
He wondered to what extent legislation should delve into details and gave an example involving people holding ladders .
That particular subject came up in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
It must be said that this particular committee has contributed very significantly to the extra bureaucracy that we are now passing the buck to the Commission to try and reduce .
How much better it would be if that committee , and indeed all other committees , had left such legislation alone in its simpler and purer form in the first place .
My final suggestion is that for us the acronym SLIM - " Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market " - should represent " Substantially Less Interference by Members " .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and say that the proposals on the simplification of legislation in the internal market that were launched in 1996 are very welcome .
An attempt was made there to improve the quality of legislation , to try to cut down on superfluous legislation and to limit the costs associated with implementing legislation .
Now that we have finished the third and fourth phases , with teams of Member State officials and users identifying concrete suggestions to simplify legislation , it is right that we have a review .
We need to have clearer definitions of what is going on .
Improved selection at the moment seems to be fairly random and we need some clear guidelines for the operation of the management teams and , of course , the implementation of recommendations which , at the moment , are too little and too late .
Many of the recommendations are not implemented at all and many have to wait considerable periods of time .
So we are in favour , but there are two things we want to add .
Firstly , we have to ensure that political control remains with the Commission and Parliament .
Recent press reports on the new approach to legislation dating from the 1980s and '90s - not so new now - which allowed the detail of legislation to be worked out by industry-led standardisation organisations , seem to indicate that this is not always the best way forward .
The European Committee for Standardisation , for example , recently did work on the packaging of waste directive , which the press has described as "fundamentally flawed , undermines democratic accountability and fails to meet the demands of the directive or , for that matter , environmental protection " .
