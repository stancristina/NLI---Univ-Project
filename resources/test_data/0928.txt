, and it is already apparent that in the next century those water resources will become even more important .
However , the European Union is undeniably doing something about water quality .
Therefore , to a large extent , my initiative report attempts to draw attention to the fact that we need a European hydrological plan , and it is our duty to start designing it now : a plan which considers the overall needs of the European Union , and therefore administers water resources efficiently , constantly and strategically , protecting the environment , of course , and allowing it to be reactivated and improved through the use of that water .
Madam President , the first thing I want to say is that we think this initiative report by Mr Izquierdo Collado is very timely , but , at the moment , it is just a technological evaluation of the feasibility of these trans-European hydrological networks .
That is essential for the European Union , in order to produce technological equipment which could be exported to other countries , given that the big problem of the 21st century will be water .
Madam President , Spain , where both Mr Izquierdo Collado and I come from , has a great deal of water , but it is not very well distributed , either in time or in geographical location .
However , I congratulate him in any case .
The shortage of water in certain areas represents an additional natural problem , and in order to overcome it we should act together , and from this Parliament , to urge all the peoples of Europe to show solidarity and promote really sustainable development in all the European regions .
Also , there is still a need for the Commission to guarantee that it will automatically turn to the relevant national judicial authorities in cases of justifiable suspicion of fraud , corruption or any other crime in which officials are implicated .
There are hundreds or thousands of projects and hundreds and thousands of administrative records , entailing a very high administrative cost .
In any case , we will support this report .
I think the rapporteur has the right approach .
He envisages globally integrated measures - in other words , not just using more advanced techniques for engine production , but considering aspects such as better quality fuel , traffic management , the promotion of public transport - which is being neglected -, trans-European transport networks and alternative fuels .
Mr President , all citizens - not just a select few - have the right to breathe clean air and protect their health .
Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure says : " Members of the European Parliament shall exercise their mandate independently .
In other words , whenever possible , the Agency should try to issue its publications in all the official languages of the European Union , as Mr Collins said .
And I have to say that in my group we do not agree with this system of control , which does not guarantee transparency or that Parliament will work well .
In other words , Mr Annan 's trip to Baghdad might end up being the excuse for US military action , which is unacceptable from every point of view , both because of the consequences it would have for the civilian population and , of course , because of the effects it would have on stability in the Middle East .
What a sad state of affairs that would be !
And it seems to me - and to many other Europeans - that this has been a wasted opportunity in that respect .
We should devote our solidarity and concern to them .
I would like to point out two of them : some of the sections of the current constitution , and the fact that General Pinochet has been active as head of the Armed Forces and is trying to continue in the same way as a senator for life .
How , for example , could this House not help the family of Carmelo Soria , who is calling for the two murderers who are free , despite it being known that they carried out that terrible crime against an international official of Spanish origin , to be brought to justice ?
I am totally against those who argue that this type of intervention is interference in external affairs of another country .
Mr President , the position of the Group of the European People 's Party 's on the other resolutions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is well known .
I do not think it will be , because the fact that we all agree on this matter does not necessarily mean that the debate will be boring .
This is an extremely significant amount and Parliament must place on record that it is not prepared to play the role it has been assigned .
Mr President , I fully agree that this is an important matter .
The reputation of this House is at stake .
Since we need to keep on fighting , that is an appropriate objective .
We agree to it .
Examples include : the need for clear , transparent labelling , especially for new products and foods ; secondly , the consumers ' organizations should have a clear role in this debate ; thirdly , we need a very clear idea of what Community law should consist of as regards food , given that at the moment there are so many regulations , sometimes contradictory - as in other sectors -, which need to be simplified and clarified ; and lastly , we have to welcome the relative speed with which the Commission has implemented the new scientific committees and the new type of inspection
