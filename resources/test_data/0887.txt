Is the idea of trying to slow down European integration with the philosophy ‘with less budget , less Europe ’ going to win out in the Council ?
Finally , in the face of an attack on the Union’s system of own resources , Parliament only has the right to protest , according to the Treaties ; nevertheless , please be in no doubt that the existence of the financial perspective does depend on Parliament .
And if the Council approves it , I will of course do everything possible to ensure that Parliament vetoes it .     Mr President , the structure of this debate creates great confusion , mixing up the Council on Thursday with the European consensus on development .
Our participation , through Anders Wijkman and followed by all of the groups in the Committee on Development , has been effective ; it was essential that we acted firmly and in a united fashion .
Mr José Borrell , President of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , esteemed participants , Mr Robert Ménard , Doctor Ibrahim , European friends and Cuban brothers and sisters resident in all parts of the world , the honour of being awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize , shared with Doctor Ibrahim and the hard-working and selfless Reporters Without Borders , has touched the hearts of the Women in White and of the seventy-five prisoners of conscience imprisoned in Cuba during the black spring of 2003 very deeply .
We will not collect that prize today , but , like Andrei Sakharov , the eminent scientist and selfless fighter for freedom of thought , the exemplary Aung San Suu Kyi , the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and all the other winners from previous years , we shall continue our tireless efforts to ensure that social justice , democracy and reconciliation prevail .
Finally , and I hope you will not take this as impertinent , rude or discourteous , I would like to inform you that the Women in White have asked me not to take part in the official lunch that you have arranged following this ceremony .
Then it was to discuss the report presented by the Commissioner , Mr Rehn .
We want to be closely involved in this issue .
We support and applaud the efforts they are making to get there on time and to achieve their goal , but that is a job for the Romanian authorities .     Minister , I do not understand the British Presidency’s concern about multiple contracts .
Although just 3 % of people employed in extractive fishing are women , women do participate actively in all the other activities relating to fishing .
As a result of their invisibility , many women working in the sector do not enjoy social and economic rights .
I am proud to be able to say that , over recent years , the fisheries authorities in my region have paid particular attention to the role of women , promoting ― and indeed calling urgently for ― the creation of associations and unreservedly supporting the integration of those associations into the existing networks , and arranging international forums and conferences to strengthen them and create new ones , with a view to the exchange of knowledge and experience amongst women from all parts of Europe .
The report also acknowledges the effort that the Commission has already made , holding the Conference on the role of women in the fisheries sector in 2003 .
Funding is required , since these networks are playing , and can play in future , more and better roles of public interest , from economic , social and also ecological points of view , and they therefore deserve funding instruments .
Firstly , the and studies carried out by the Commission for each protocol show that the agreements are still bringing benefits that are greater than the cost to the European Union and , at the same time , due to their new status as association agreements , we need to take account of other parameters which cannot be measured by means of a mere cost-benefit analysis .
I am referring specifically to Amendments 6 , 9 , 11 , 12 and 13 , on which I shall comment briefly .
Value for money for the third country ?
For some time the Commission itself has recognised the need to establish this kind of agreement for fleets that fish within a single area , and I would therefore call upon the Commission , together with Community tuna shipowners , to work to take steps forward that can bee seen as significant in this area .     .
The delays only reduce the European Union’s credibility in the eyes of other powers such as , in this case , Japan , which are much quicker to fulfil their obligations .
The European Union has been built upon the values of freedom and plurality , and in several of our countries holocaust denial or advocating Nazi-fascism are crimes .
It is unimaginable .
Finally , I would just like to point out that this Parliament has historically supported processes aimed at peace and the eradication of violence .
We need much more vigorous action on the part of the Commission and on the part of the Member States , the latter led by the Commission .
Nevertheless , we must bear in mind that , to some extent , nationality also falls within the competence of the European Union .
I therefore welcome this report .
I myself am the son of emigrants and I have spent most of my life outside of the Union’s borders .
In any event , what we have to bear in mind is that these people are the victims , who need political , social and legal
