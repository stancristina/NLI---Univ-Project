For my own part , I would like to remind everyone that the European Union is not the same as Europe , and the world outside the European Union is not just one of poverty , hunger and despair .
I also wish to remind you that we also have duties as members of the United Nations , the OSCE , and the Council of Europe .
The principle of democracy is that people are not just objects of the state .
Nor within the European Union do we always really need new directives .
I hope that in the future I may gain your confidence in this matter as well .
The Union continues in its determination to achieve this aim .
As a result of a decision taken in the General Affairs Council in April 1999 we have asked the Commission to draft economic and social programmes to improve facilities for the establishment of institutions for East Timor .
The General Affairs Council stated on Monday that the East Timorese also deserve all our support in the future .
At the same time I would like to say that I am grateful to Ireland ' s Foreign Minister , Mr Andrews , who acted as the President ' s personal representative in overseeing the election in East Timor , and Great Britain' s Foreign Secretary , Mr Cook , who represented the President at the APEC meeting .
I believe they were responsible for the safe atmosphere that prevailed while voting itself was going on .
During the whole crisis the Union has been putting pressure on the Indonesian government to meet its obligations to guarantee safety and keep the situation in East Timor under control .
I believe that we are on the right track , but the road is long .
The faster a peacekeeping force is got there , the better .
At present those in the most difficult situation are people who have fled their homes for the mountains , and East Timorese that have been forced to enter West Timor , where some have been accommodated in camps .
We have no exact information on events for the very reason that foreign representatives of the international community cannot reach the area .
The Indonesian authorities have announced an open-door policy with regard to international aid , but they cannot guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers .
A comprehensive aid operation can only begin when the humanitarian organisations have unhindered and safe access to the region .
Various countries have been prepared to participate in the delivery of relief aid .
Representatives of the European Community ' s Humanitarian Organisation have taken part in an assessment of the size of the aid package needed together with the Indonesian authorities and international organisations .
Experts say that , for reasons of safety , the drops must be made during the initial phase from Hercules transport planes from a height of one and a half kilometres , which may affect its chances of getting to the right place .
The Union has the whole time stressed and demanded that Indonesia take responsibility for order and security , but as we have seen , the Indonesian authorities have unfortunately ignored the obligations they have agreed to in this respect .
Indonesia has now agreed to the arrival in the region of international peacekeeping forces and I have just heard that the UN Security Council has taken a unanimous decision to send a peacekeeping force to East Timor .
We shall work towards getting the forces to the region as soon as possible .
I would now like to speak of a serious matter , which is the climate of fear and deeds of terror that are gripping East Timor at present .
Tyranny has prevailed in the area .
The day before yesterday the Council expressed its deepest anger regarding this state of affairs and the attacks on East Timorese , humanitarian workers , church representatives and advocates of human rights .
We in the Council have given our support to convening a special meeting of the Commission on Human Rights with regard to the situation in East Timor .
The General Affairs Council the day before yesterday approved the conclusions reached on Union action and took a decision on a common position to make them more effective , by imposing a comprehensive export ban on weapons , munitions and other tools of internal repression and terror to Indonesia .
While we work towards bringing about the right to self-determination of East Timor and its people , we must concern ourselves also with Indonesia ' s future development .
Conduct in the international community that reflects a democratic society will have the support of us all .
Many of us believe that we are creating a new relationship with the Commission , and that really does mean that Parliament and the Commission will , in future , work in very close co-operation with one another .
Some of us therefore decided to grant the Commission a vote of confidence , as we consider that we have made a remarkable start in this relationship .
We are most satisfied that Parliament as a whole stresses the importance of public access to documents and information .
Nevertheless , we are sure that the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , has listened to Parliament , and we are now embarking on a process of co-operation with the new Commission .
It shows that Parliament and its Committee on Budgets show real responsibility for the European Union economy and , in addition , real responsibility for the development of different policies and adjusting promptly to prevailing circumstances .
Putting this fund together was a significant challenge to EU credibility and the fact that they were dealt with by the Committee on Budgets leading to amendments being made shows just how great that responsibility is .
I would particularly like to stress that when reconstruction
