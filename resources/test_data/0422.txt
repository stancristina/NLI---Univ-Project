The consumer organisations in the applicant countries are not yet , if I may put it like this , ideally equipped for their role as representatives of consumers .
I think it is excellent that the provision of information needed to make choices before the sale of a service or product , the sale itself , after sales , service , complaints procedures and access to law are brought together in the framework directive .
I think this is necessary , because if this does not happen confusion will remain .
Better and cheaper products and more choice are the mainsprings of the internal market .
Information about products and production methods is crucial .
Liberalisation of public services is supposed to offer consumers cheaper and better services .
Every consumer understands that .
Mr President , we are dealing here with three important reports of course .
Consumers must have confidence in products or they will not buy them .
So I think and I am glad that the Commissioner is also working for this that the Union must involve these organisations closely in the preparatory work for future policy .
They make it terribly difficult for you .
We cannot deny that language , distance and cultural differences are the most significant barriers for consumers .
I do not have any anxiety about discriminating against Treaty articles because we make less use of them than other Treaty articles .
The role of the Structural Funds is going to diminish for the current EU Member States or even disappear altogether , in favour of projects for the newcomers .
A rotating system for the Governing Council means that members from the separate Member States are no longer involved in decision-making , while their countries do have to suffer the negative consequences of those decisions .
Generally it is not the real terrorists who are affected by this , as they have developed illegal routes that cannot be touched by it .
Peace that is not supported by the parties involved will lead to a resumption of conflict after the withdrawal of the new occupiers .
Even if there were no EU , agreements would have to be made between different countries on common support for these rights .
Fortunately the proposals of the rapporteurs , Mrs Thyssen , Mrs Patrie and Mr Whitehead are moving in more or less that direction .
The resolution rightly asks the Cambodian Government to withdraw these guidelines .
The European Commission must denounce these abuses at the WTO .
Mr President , Commissioner .
Presidential elections are being held in Nigeria in a couple of weeks .
Since then there has been strong international pressure from all sides to help Ms Lawal , and rightly so .
In January of this year , at the time of the riots around the Miss World contest , he said and I quote : 'no one will be stoned in my country ' .
Mr President , on behalf of our group I should like to give vent to our anger , our bitterness and our strong condemnation of the serious violation of the international law of the UN Charter by all the countries that are embarking upon this war .
( Applause from the left ) Mr President , this means that , while the disarmament approach was beginning to bear fruit and Hans Blix and Kofi Annan were urging the international community to respect international law , this international law has today been dealt a heavy blow .
That common ground was and is the Security Council , is international law and can never be a unilateral step .
I hope that our European leaders will hear this voice today .
Our European politicians will have to answer to their people for their impotence .
The Turkish Kurds are fearful of being militarily overwhelmed .
Military action against this merciless tyrant is not only fully justified ; it is even a bounden duty .
Mr President , this morning , then , the war began that must lead to genuine disarmament in Iraq and that is designed to put an end to the reign of terror that has been conducted there by Saddam Hussein over many years .
That is how I see this action now , as an action designed to prevent much greater disasters in the future .
That is why many Members of Parliament and members of staff have decided to wear black armbands during this week 's part-session .
I fear that political pressure alone will not be enough .
I will not mention the situation in Iraq because my group chairman has already done so and my fellow countryman and colleague Arie Oostlander will be doing so .
So in this spirit , I would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency .
How are we going to close this gap , and what efforts will have to be made by the various Member States ?
There was also barely any international reaction at all when the inspections were cut short on account of Iraq 's failure to cooperate .
We now know that anyone who wants to establish justice must in extreme cases accept the support of force , including military force .
My group would like to make it clear that when push comes to shove , they all really support the armies , in the same way as they support the people who need to be liberated as quickly as possible .
Mr President , naturally I too regret that the United Nations have not found a solution to the conflict in Iraq .
It is no use lecturing other people about international values if you are not able to enforce international law yourself .
Most of all I feel sorry for the victims and regret the human suffering that is without doubt much greater than we can imagine .
Regretting and hoping that the war will soon be
