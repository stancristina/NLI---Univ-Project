The crucial thing , however , is that the right places be inspected and that they be inspected in the right way .
Having been present at the debate in Copenhagen , I would like to bear witness to the fact that the Spanish Government put these problems right at the top of the agenda .
With regard to the imposition of liability , I would refer to section 18 .
With regard to ports of refuge , which I did not manage to mention , I refer to section 8 - where the issue of ports of refuge is expressly mentioned , and that is my reply to Mr Jarzembowski .
That applies to the European Council , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Hold the Council to the right things that have been decided .
After all , Parliament and the Council are in agreement concerning what is to be done ; the task now is to put it into practice , as many speakers have also said .
( DA ) Mr President , thank you for this opportunity to give an account of this very important area of work in which my dear colleague Commissioner Vitorino has been extremely active ever since he started , and in which I believe we are starting to reap rewards of which I am pleased to give an account .
As we know , the European Council repeated and reinforced its desire for action in these areas in Tampere in October 1999 , in Laeken in December 2001 and in Seville in June of this year .
We have not simply met these deadlines ; we have gone even further .
The implementation of the Seville conclusions has been a task of the Danish Presidency .
Seventeen different projects and initiatives have been implemented with a view to strengthening border controls at both sea and land borders and at airports .
In addition , a general dispatch programme and a specific plan for the return to Afghanistan have been adopted .
These two were approved a couple of weeks ago .
The European Fund for Refugees was established back in September 2000 , and in July 2001 a directive was adopted on minimum standards of temporary protection in cases of mass influx of displaced persons .
There is now agreement in the Council on the Dublin II regulation , which is expected finally to be adopted .
This task has been achieved ; there is political unanimity .
The Commission 's proposal for minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers is similarly expected to be adopted at the Council meeting tomorrow .
Substantial progress has been made , and there is now political unanimity on the definition of a refugee and political unanimity on the definition of subsidiary protection .
We have achieved political unanimity on virtually all of Articles 1-19 concerning the basic terms used in refugee law .
All that remains is the issue of the rights of refugees and of persons with subsidiary protection , which is why we can expect the proposal to be adopted by the summer at the latest , as was decided in Seville .
The things on which agreement has been reached are some of the difficult things .
The answer is : it is skilful because it means that from now on these conventions must be observed in every country , and that includes the new Member States that we decided just last Friday to bring into the Union .
The difference is that the Commission has much greater authority when it comes to considering whether the directives are being complied with , and finally there is also the possibility of going to Court if countries breach the conventions .
At the Council meeting in October we had an open debate on the Commission 's revised proposal on minimum standards for asylum procedures at which the ministers of the Member States contributed various comments on the proposal .
As far as immigration policy is concerned , the Seville conclusions state that the Council must approve the Commission 's proposal for provisions on family reunification and long-term residence status by June 2003 .
As regards the proposal on long-term residence status , on 15 October 2002 the Council discussed a number of outstanding political issues .
The Council will work towards meeting the deadline laid down in Seville for adoption of the proposal .
At the same time , an open debate was held in the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs on 15 October 2002 on the Commission 's proposal for a directive on the conditions for entry and residence by third-country nationals for study purposes .
Parliament has been consulted in all these cases , and Parliament 's statements have been incorporated , or will be incorporated , into the basis for the Council 's decision .
The Council looks forward to even closer cooperation with Parliament in the area of asylum following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice .
I believe that , overall , it conveys a positive picture .
I know that the Commissioner felt this too , as indeed I myself did , when I sat on the relevant committee here in Parliament .
It is important that the deadlines are met .
Mr President , I could have spoken for much longer , since in reality there are a great many initiatives - for example , in the area of border controls , in which a full 17 initiatives have been implemented - which I could have talked about for a long time , but everything must come to an end , so I will stop here and let the Members ' contributions decide what we will discuss in more detail in the hour ahead .
.
( DA ) Mr President , I will start with Mrs Hazan
