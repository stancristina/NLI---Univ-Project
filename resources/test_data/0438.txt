According to a study which the Socialist Party carried out among contractors in the Hague region before , many building companies are also badly affected by unfair competition from Eastern European countries , against which the Dutch trade unions mounted a campaign in March .
At the same time , the social inspectorates must also be reinforced and cooperate transnationally .     .
Mr Solana says that it cannot be the intention that the new Palestinian Authority should fail .
We need to demand that Hamas does not touch the human rights of Palestinians .
That generation has the potential to reconnect al-Fatah to the Palestinian street .
That is the first point I wanted to make .
I was pleased with the Commissioner’s remark about the dialogue with Moscow .
It is still unclear when , and in what way , the proposed sanctions and measures will actually be carried out by all Member States , including the Commission .
Extending the visa ban on government representatives is , of course , wonderful , but what to do with judges , police officials involved in ill-treatment , and suchlike ?
Moreover , as Mr Wiersma pointed out a moment ago , Russia’s role remains underexposed .
It is not only a great honour to have him here in our midst , but also very important that he should be here , for this is not only a moment of fear and threat , but also a unique moment of hope .
In terms of arms exports , it may be a good idea to persuade Europe and its allies to take tough sanctions , also with a view to preventing the President’s funds from growing any further , while this will not affect the people .
It is a step forward , one that deserves our admiration and our greatest respect .
Since the attacks of 9/11 , safety in the transport sector has become an important area of concern , for Europe as much as for anyone else , and with good reason .
This was accompanied by the pledge that a solution for the problem of funding would be tabled shortly .
No fewer than three out of these eight objectives are about health care , about the fight against diseases such as AIDS and malaria , about reducing child mortality and the mortality of mothers during pregnancy or childbirth .
There should be no budgetary support for those countries that do not qualify on account of bad governance .
We in Europe cannot , and indeed should not , put up with this .
Studies have shown that in a country such as Chad , only 1 % of government funds that are spent on health care actually arrive at their destination .
Indeed , the spreading of bird flu by migratory birds and the threat of the virus for people show that society has every reason to bring this disease to a standstill and ensure that the poultry sector does not go under .
The European Union is not an insurance company .
It would also distort the world market and is at odds with negotiations and agreements within the WTO .
In some of them , women’s rights count for nothing and the mutilation of women – despite what has already been done to counteract it – is still a daily occurrence .
Through dialogue in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly , we hope to further promote good governance , democracy and the protection of human rights , and I might add that I am also happy with the appointment this week – to which reference has already been made – of this House’s delegation to the Pan-African Parliament , which can be an additional instrument .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am pleased that we are , in this House today , having a serious debate on a matter that is not always easy to discuss in the context of a debate on development cooperation .
Responsibility for good governance and effective aid is shared by the donor community and the developing countries themselves ; ‘it takes two to tango’ .
Here too , I propose the compilation of a blacklist of such businesses .
What really is disappointing is where the ACP countries stood on the index and stand now , for there has been scarcely any improvement over the past five years .
What is needed is for this debate to become more than merely theoretical .
Those opposed to this resolution are probably right for the time being when they say that workers and retired people in Belarus enjoy a higher level of social security than do their counterparts in any other former Soviet republics .
There can never be an excuse .
We have to invest in more cultural freedom .
If Turkish television and radio provided more air time for Kurdish programmes , then Roj TV in Denmark will not be that important any more .
That is the only solution .     .
We must not allow agitators to sabotage the negotiations before they have got well and truly underway .
I do not know whether you have seen the report of the IHD human rights organisation about the killing of Mr and Mrs Ferho , or the judicial inquiry into the bomb attack in Şemdinli .
I really would like to know what the Commission intends to do in this respect .
If even Mr Pronk , who I know as an incorrigible go-getter and optimist , no longer sees a chance for the peace process , then it is really time for us to sound the alarm .

Mr President , Egypt’s stability has , for a long time , been based on a single-party state .
My group wholeheartedly supports the demand for Egypt to become more democratic , to put an end to
