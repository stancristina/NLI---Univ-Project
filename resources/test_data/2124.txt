its markets to some extent in those countries joining the EU , and that is something we also have to take into consideration to some extent .
We are also responsible for developments with regard to Kaliningrad , and I agree with Mr Poettering that we have to be able to provide help and assistance and work together to improve conditions for the people who live there .
This has to do with Russia and it also has to do with other countries that we have been praising here or which are perhaps our older allies .
The fight against terrorism has become an umbrella that allows violent actions to be carried out by countries against their own and other citizens .
The question of Chechnya is being raised because we have a delegation leaving for Chechnya , and I am its chairman .
This being the case , January seems a good time to go , if the members of my delegation agree : all this has happened so very recently .
We are thus a giant trading partner of Russia .
We are the world 's largest energy area , and the energy issue is therefore very important .
I should furthermore like to mention the state of the press in Karelia and elsewhere too in Russia , where there are pressures that are simply not acceptable .
Mr President , Russia is of interest to us and is a partner that presents challenges .
To their credit , they do not .
Right now it is important for us to discuss the effects EU enlargement will have on cooperation between the EU and Russia .
We need them to be unbiased in their approach to implementing changes in Kaliningrad so that there is investment there coming from the rest of Russia and abroad too .
Now that the border between the EU and Russia is to lengthen we must make renewed efforts to develop northwestern Russia and boost cooperation in the border regions .
Another question of current importance is the development of cooperation in the area of energy .
For that purpose we have to provide adequate financial support .
Russia is an important partner for the EU because the reserves of gas in the North Sea and North Africa will run out in twenty years or so .
The EU 's demand for gas has to be met with exports from the east .
The best form of cooperation would be if pipelines were built linking Russia and the EU.
That is good news , as in that way the EU countries ' increased demand for the use of energy is satisfied .
Adherence to market conditions in the EU will not solve the problems of the energy market .
With Russia we have to speak about factors that unite us .
One issue that separates us is the civil war in Chechnya .
At the same time we note that at the summit attended by leaders of the EU and Russia no demands were made by the EU regarding Chechnya 's independence as a state .
But before taking this step , a proper assessment must be made of these measures in the light of experience .
We are expecting the Convention to look at the issue in the near future .
In the Hänsch working group , MEPs like Mrs Berès and I tried to secure an agreement from the working group that the Treaty should be amended in order to give Parliament a formal call-back right within the framework of this procedure .
If there is enough political will in the Council , anything is possible .
If there is a real political will in the Council , it can be done .
We also need more transatlantic dialogue in the financial services sector at a legislative level .
Consultation processes , as Mr Herzog said , must be formalised and as transparent as possible .
I endorse our rapporteur 's point about the enabling clause .
I ardently support the ban .
The rapporteur has drawn up a very balanced report , as I have already said .
It would be wrong if their use were not regulated at all and they remained a 'grey area ' .
The aim must be to abandon the use of coccidiostats , but that cannot be done at once as they cannot yet be replaced by vaccination .
I enthusiastically support the rapporteur 's proposal .
On the other hand , it must not be imagined that natural substances cannot be a great danger to health when they are abused or prepared without care .
The instructions must contain information on the potential toxicity of the substances and their interaction with food , drink or other medicinal products .
Entrepreneurs in the sector will profit as the market grows and reputations are protected , and consumers will gain in terms of safety and price .
The rapporteur raises some problems that have been encountered with irresponsible manufacturers , especially in third countries .
When there is such indifference combined with good faith on the part of the consumer , human lives are in danger .
Mr Nisticò 's report lays down for this safe and clear limits within which the industry can flourish and succeed .
For many years now Europe has clearly not managed to fulfil its aim to become the world 's most competitive economic area .
Increased bureaucracy and interference in contracts between companies will constrain the labour market .
Do we not want supply to meet demand ?
The Member States take care of the social consequences of that by taking account of the interests of employees in the way they themselves consider best .
For historical reasons there are big differences between the labour market systems in Member States .
This directive 's implementation will clearly worsen the general situation regarding temporary agency work in Finland .
