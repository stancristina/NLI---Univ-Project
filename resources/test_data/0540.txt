greatest potential for improving the environment .
I should also like to describe how I see the link between the Integrated Product Policy and other initiatives mentioned in the report , particularly the two thematic strategies : the strategy on the sustainable use of natural resources and the strategy for waste prevention and recycling .
The Integrated Product Policy must then transform these resource-focused objectives – do not forget that natural resources provide us with minerals , food , water and clean air – into practical measures for reducing products ’ and services ’ effects upon the environment , at the same time as creating business opportunities .
This does not mean ignoring the products ’ whole life-cycles .
Nor do I believe that the Integrated Product Policy should advocate the use of certain materials , irrespective of whether they are bio-based materials , composite materials or other materials , because there is then a danger of ignoring the life-cycle dimension .
Secondly , I wish to emphasise that I do not believe that this is the right moment to prepare a framework directive on the Integrated Product Policy .
That applies to industry , governments and consumers .
For example , we might place greater emphasis upon services , recommend a framework directive or change the Integrated Product Policy as a result of the discussions concerning the thematic strategies .
I had this feeling following the package .
We have tried to do this to some extent in the report , but I think that we are in need of additional expertise in this field .
The international dimension emerges strongly and , in your speech , Mrs de Palacio , you point out what you are intending to do .
We know that the working group is going to meet in May , and that Spain , France and the Commission have presented a proposal .
The creation of the new PSSA in London was a success , but we need to specify what is meant by these .
It is also very important because it has the potential to contribute to overcoming environmental problems , crowding and noise .
In my opinion , it is good to have this option and , when it comes to defining this , regional-policy aspects should be included .
Previously , we have also given our support to the resolution on the Commission Green Paper on space policy , adopted on 9 October 2003 , the resolution on a uniform European space strategy , adopted on 17 January 2002 , and also the resolution on an action plan for implementing the European space policy ,adopted on 29 January 2004 .
We reject the increased EU competence that is set to be included in the EU Constitutional Treaty .     .
We fully support the right to free movement of persons , as one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market .
A significant risk when the EU becomes involved in areas that should chiefly be dealt with by the Member States , however , is that the body of legislation doubles .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is extremely pleased with the outcome of the vote .
My thanks to the President for giving me the floor , and for conducting the sitting so excellently .     .
It offers opportunities for individuals and institutions to invest risk capital in an enterprise without the liability associated with ownership .
In the enlarged EU , we need a distribution policy that shows solidarity , in order to reduce disparities and to compensate regions situated far from the large markets .
We must ensure that these parts of Europe obtain the aid they need .
Looking at the Court of Auditors ’ Statement of Assurance on the European Development Fund , we can say that the expenditure has been approved , but only with reservations , as the Court of Auditors is not prepared to give the green light with regard to direct budgetary support , which in 2002 constituted approximately a quarter of aid .
This is a key factor in the future auditing of the European Development Fund .
It indicates that the control system is still not working properly .
We are of the opinion that this is something that the Committee on Budgetary Control must continue to examine and look at next year .
The main issue with the Council is its attitude and unwillingness to cooperate with Parliament .
The Council was sent a schedule , a questionnaire , which it is in effect refusing to answer .
In reply , the Council of Ministers deigned to give answers to certain selected questions to certain selected Members ; this is in no way binding and is secretive .
It is quite evident that the Committee of the Regions still has not taken this in hand in earnest : quite the reverse .
Concerning the report by Mr van  Hulten , we are of the opinion that this is a very good piece of work .
Now is the time , before the end of the Intergovernmental Conference , to put forward this point of view , and we have the opportunity to do so tomorrow .
For this reason , together with Mr Blak of the GUE/NGL Group , I have tabled a number of amendments intended to clean up the system of privileges .
We have also put forward a number of proposals intended to tighten up the system for obtaining the daily subsistence allowance so that it is more closely linked to the meetings we actually attend .
This is a matter of political responsibility .
He is one of the heroes of our time , the man who confirmed that Israel has significant stocks of nuclear weapons that could turn the whole of the Middle East into a nuclear desert .
Why does the world community not intervene in regard to Israeli nuclear weapons ?
