Madam President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Souchet for his excellent report , which also represents a good basis for the report I have subsequently been responsible for .
However , I would like to express a certain distaste at the way we have dealt with this issue .
Madam President , I am beginning my speech in this debate on fisheries very moved , as you know , by the events that have taken place in Galicia .
I believe it is very important to bear it in mind and I hope , as I have said , that all our colleagues will show solidarity .
I hope that we can focus all our efforts and use the balanced approach indicated here , in order to adopt the commitments in this report , which will have to be debated , as I have said , at the next part-session in Brussels .
We have therefore been in a provisional situation for thirty years .
Because , if we do not have a clear vision of our future ambitions and projects , not only will we be unable to design our future , but we will also have great difficulties understanding the past .
In my view , following the Franco-German agreement , it is necessary to stipulate that the financial impact of enlargement must not fall to the poorest areas , who are beneath the Community average and who require sustained progress .
And , apart from holding discussions - the final phase of the negotiations is yet to take place - there are certain issues which we should remember .
As well as sustainable development , you , in relation to the framework directive on services of general interest , which was agreed in Barcelona , are proposing a Green Paper .
In any event - also in relation to the Convention - it is important that we find formulae for qualified association .
We have noted , from what we have been told and from leaks , that the President of the Commission is concerned to find a final date for the mandate of this Commission .
With regard to some of your ideas on the question of mathematical equality in women 's representation in the different bodies , I would like to say clearly that this does not appear in our programme .
I am referring to Europol and others .
What we need to do is to begin to take decisions in this area .
In this respect , I would like to point out that the Directive on the monitoring of traffic - yet to be transposed - in Article 20 , lays down the definition of areas of refuge , which , although they are vague , would allow vessels with problems to reach them to try to resolve them .
When we presented our first proposals , we received initial reactions from Parliament 's relevant committees .
If it is not , mechanisms will have to be implemented in order to correct the situation .
That is how we are going to continue to work , and , in this respect , I would point out that , with regard to the Stability Pact , we have the framework of the Treaties , which are very clear , including the Protocol , in which figures are clearly mentioned - such as the 3 % of deficit and 60 % of debt - and it is true that at the Barcelona Council we have been asked to work to create greater economic coordination - which was mentioned earlier , by Mr Bar√≥n for example .
I believe that the possibilities for improvement are favourable .
I will end by commenting on the specific issues that fall within my competence .
Unfortunately , the Council , Parliament and the final agreements did not achieve much ; there were more difficulties than we expected and they have been delayed .
President Prodi has agreed with me and has told me that he is in favour of dealing with the issue at the Interinstitutional Summit at the end of the month .
This is not going to alter the outcome of the vote , but since I was present in the Chamber , I will communicate this information to the services of the House .
However , on the other hand , I do not believe that this fact bears any relation to the internal situation in that country , to the increase in Islamic fundamentalism , the interests and people , our allies , who are being attacked in Afghanistan and the human rights situation in the country .
When we talk about financial services , we are talking about something which affects the lives of ordinary citizens .
The only consultation there is room for today is a public consultation by means of the ballot box and by means of legally elected representatives .
As Mrs Randzio-Plath has pointed out , we have just adopted the Lamfalussy procedure , we do not yet have any experience of how it is working and we want to continue to restrict the possible participation of Parliament without verifying whether this procedure is working effectively .
Specifically , in my own country , temporary work agencies - or at least some of these companies - are factories for insecure work .
That is what we are advocating , pure and simple .
Thirdly , I would like to stress the need for particularly intense action on the health and safety protection of workers during work and on the health and safety of workers provided by temporary employment agencies .
There are various reasons for this : firstly , the temporary nature of the employment itself , which seems to increase risk ; secondly , the diversity of the work to
