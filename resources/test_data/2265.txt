Many medicines are toxic substances .
One of today 's important areas of discussion is the relationship between the original medicine and the generic product that is introduced onto the market once the patent and data protection have lapsed .
We should put a stop to this .
The development of medicines is not going well either .
Secondly , legislation should not hamper , but rather promote , innovation .
All that remains for us to do is to make a small , yet important , step .
An alternative fuel is fundamentally different from the so-called traditional fuels because it is both a renewable and emission-free source of energy .
Real refugees , on the other hand , are increasingly less welcome .
It is not simply a question of resourceful young people exploring the possibilities technology has to offer , or of 'nerds ' who enjoy wreaking havoc in other people 's work ; it is also about critical investigators who are looking for information that is important to many but that is kept secret unfairly .
Mr President , it is customary for us MEPs to initially react a little critically to the Council 's absence from our plenary .
I should first of all like to thank my fellow MEPs , Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck , for the work they have done , which has culminated in the first reading of the Budget that is now before us .
When my group suggests bringing up the export subsidies for discussion because many farmers in developing countries are seriously hampered in their economic potential , then the argument of administrative assurance is used .
Yet still nobody dares say in public that the EU subsidies may , to some extent , be money down the drain .
I hope that Parliament will support me in this .
These are all examples of money that is being spent but against which I would place question marks as to their judiciousness .
My group will in any event be endorsing the amendments which will enable this to be adjusted , as I am convinced that we will ultimately be paying a hefty price .
According to this deal , Parliament and the Council look after each other 's needs , and it was agreed that the Commission would be served via a frontloading operation .
Mr President , we would like to add three comments concerning the Budget at this reading .
There is the risk that the resources allocated for the following year would be released prematurely .
This controversy demonstrates that the framework programme should have been restricted to facilitating cross-border cooperation .
Active financial support is undesirable and superfluous .
Would it not make sense , therefore , to shift the budget 's attention to fishing regions that have been self-sufficient to date ?
Funds for this cause have already been cut back worldwide .
A slight increase in the funds will result in a considerable reduction in the number of people suffering .
We should , in my opinion , adopt a flexible stance for once .
The public , however , should know what quality is .
This is the problem we are facing : the system is such that surpluses always arise .
I am unhappy about one point , namely the way in which foundations - and I am mainly referring to the foundation in Dublin - are being treated .
The first group of amendments related to violence against women , including genital mutilation , rape , the stoning of women etc. , in a large number of countries worldwide .
This amendment has also been adopted , for which I thank the Committee on Budgets .
If not , why not ?
It is currently a political event .
I also think that the proposed timeframe , namely to grant discharge or postponement in April and to pronounce a final verdict in October , is the correct one .
It is about vibrations , noise , and so on .
Thank you for this sound report .
The reason is simple : we can accept the fact that a kind of evaluation is planned in four years ' time and better measures will follow if need be , but on the other hand - and I should like to come back to this in connection with the previous topic - at what stage is the enforcement of this legislation monitored ?
It is not a very exciting topic to be discussing but , as we all know , it is very important or we would not be here .
There have been several instances of transfers or terminations of duties involving directors-general and there has been the case of the accounting officer , Mrs Andreasson .
Secondly , there is the question of the financial irregularities panel , which is designed to fill a gap in the existing set-up and introduce new expertise .
Three amendments have been tabled in plenary in addition to the ones from the committee .
There are two criteria : one on competition and one on economic and social damage caused by a debt if it is recovered .
They have been adapting their democratic systems , their economies and their legislation since 1989 , which has required major efforts .
It would also be preferable if better agricultural agreements were concluded .
There are still a few countries in which they need to have their voices heard , which will cause the necessary problems , as there are still questions on this score .
The politicians , however , must now roll up their sleeves as a matter of urgency , not as carpet dealers , as Mrs Schröder mentioned , but with the necessary vision and courage .
Will this be intergovernmentalism 's final victory ?
Mr President , we are facing a very complex European Council , and I should like
