and I have to underline that it is very important that she should satisfy the Environment Committee and the Parliament , not least because if she is asking us to suspend the application of any part of the regulation , it will have to come through this Parliament by codecision .
Mr President , Mrs Roth-Behrendt quoted from Shakespeare in her contribution and I would like to quote from Hamlet ' s soliloquy : whether it is nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or by opposing end them .
As chair of the US delegation here in this Parliament , I am only too well aware of the many slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that make up the trade disputes between the EU and the United States of America .
But having said that , it is important to get each trade dispute in proportion .
Every one of us would want to welcome the small indication of progress that comes after the meetings with Secretary of State Slater and Ambassador Morningstar .
I say this knowing full well the massive pressures there are upon Congress in an election year .
I do not want to be too critical , we know only too well as parliamentarians about electoral pressures , but it is worth saying that the pressures in the United States are not so much from the citizens , from the voters , but from the big business backers of both parties and both campaigns and that makes an enormous difference .
The Commissioner and others have outlined the basis of possible discussions .
I will not go through all those again , but just say that there is a need not only for a timetable to agree stringent noise standards but also to agree a timetable in which they should be implemented .
Mrs Roth-Berendt has mentioned a target with which I will concur .
I want to make one other brief point , because this dispute highlights the need for earlier and more forthright discussions about the many issues over which there are disagreements .
The delegation for relations with the US is planning , as you probably know , a transatlantic legislators ' dialogue using video-conferencing techniques so that we can discuss and understand - and clearly the Americans need to understand - what the powers of this Parliament are , the positive powers and also the negative powers and also the importance of timing in our joint negotiations .
We need to learn lessons on both sides but I very much hope that even at this late stage there can be some sort of resolution .
Mr President , I strongly support the resolutions that are on the table before us .
I do so not only because of the importance of the hushkits issue itself , although no one should underestimate the huge disturbance and the very real and significant health impacts from noise , but also because it establishes the principle of Europe setting its own regional standards .
The hushkits issue is also widely seen as a first case of how aviation issues will be dealt with in the future by the new Parliament and the new Commission .
It is very clear that ICAO standards need to be seen as a floor , not as a ceiling .
It should be quite possible and right to go beyond them .
This is a critical case because it is about how we face hard decisions about how to begin to make a deeply unsustainable industry a little less damaging .
It is about how we put into practice the Treaty of Amsterdam on integrating sustainability concerns into all policy areas , even the very difficult ones .
I wonder if we can use this conflict and these negotiations with the US to enter into a broader discussion about a proactive global environmental policy on air transport more generally .
Hushkits are important but noise pollution is only one aspect of the environmental damage from the airline industry .
It is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and we know that it is deeply unsustainable .
We need to be looking towards a new policy architecture to deal with all these questions .
Mr President , like most of the other speakers here , I see absolutely no reason at all for any kind of immediate suspension , or urgent suspension , of the hushkit regulations .
There are regulations , we put them in place .
I was here at the first reading in the Parliament in Strasbourg .
There were not very many of us here , a lot fewer than there are today , when we introduced these regulations in the first instance .
They are good regulations .
There are going to be useful regulations and they are going to bring positive benefit to the people of Europe .
That does not mean though that you should not negotiate .
I was fortunate to have an opportunity to talk with Under-Secretary Slater yesterday along with a number of my other colleagues .
They seem to be reasonable people who would be willing to talk reasonably with you about a better , long-term solution .
We know there are better long-term solutions because we know our regulation applies only in Europe .
Although it may have some spillover effect in the not too far distant future to third countries , we are not having a world-wide effect .
Your objective , Madame Palacio , is to get that world-wide effect .
Your objective is to make absolutely sure that whatever agreement you come up with with the Americans secures new controls on aircraft noise world-wide out of ICAO in a clear timescale .
It is not just a question of agreeing to the controls and the levels but also a timetable for implementation that makes us happy and satisfied in this Parliament .
