all , their effect will be counter-productive .
On the contrary , they will strengthen them .
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right .
.
The Left ' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision ' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere .
Mr President , my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women , although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue , which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age , in any case .
Unfortunately , it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .
For me , equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny , alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job .
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life .
On the contrary .
One can only hope that it succeeds .
I remember your predecessor ' s speech five years ago .
Like yourself , he promised "less and better " , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse " , and I do not believe that you , either , can deliver the goods you promise .
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation .
You talk about greater transparency , but produce proposals which would lead to documents which , at present , are available for public inspection being locked away .
Local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in Brussels .
Otherwise , the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing .
Even by this stage , that is already too many by far .
The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively .
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell ' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of .
Take a look at Jean Monet ' s memoirs .
What he envisaged was what he called a small , practical secretariat .
( DA ) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution , but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect .
.
At a forthcoming review of these programmes , it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.
.
Basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think , in general , that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations , as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects .
.
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years .
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition .
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders .
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders , projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale .
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come .
We can do this by , as a Parliament , amending the Council ' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment .
In its unaltered form , the present directive could , in fact , have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water .
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters .
We cannot afford to wait .
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment .
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and , not least , to our descendants .
Mr President , the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater , drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation .
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives .
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances .
This cannot be done , and it also , in any case , goes against nature .
European agriculture would not , for example , be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread .
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs
