Let the courts decide .
I , for one , would support you if you did .
Cigarettes have a share of approximately 91 % .
However , the debate about labelling is completely over the top to my mind .
For the fact is that it will mean a massive tightening up of provisions , not based on internal market criteria .
They are aware of the risks of smoking .
It has been scientifically proven that the risk of cot death increases five-fold when the parents smoke twenty cigarettes per day , not just during pregnancy but also during the child 's first year of life .
Commissioner Byrne , you are Commissioner Flynn' s successor and I hope you prove to be more successful - perhaps you will raise this argument in discussion with Mr Fischler .
And in the case of recycled HCFCs , the full ban will not take effect until 2015 , rather than 2007 , which is what the European Parliament wanted .
It is unacceptable for subscribers to need several receptor boxes in order to receive programmes .
Digital television will afford increased and wider access , also for the more remote regions .
I would urge every one here to be particularly sensitive in this respect .
Pre-selection is restrictive for the subscriber and is something they should be able to sue over .
European rules are needed for a European market , for example the unbundling of subscriber access , and of course the much-lamented principle of subsidiarity means that we need rules where they can best be made use of .
I must admit that having lived behind the iron curtain in the Eastern block for four decades , and having grown up there , I am always sceptical about being monitored and controlled 'big brother is watching you ' style .
Unfortunately , this is where the report is lacking in concrete proposals .
Firstly , the report emphasises the need to separate regulation from infrastructure and content .
However , we also want portability of numbers , so that a number is a personal distinguishing feature and people can actually be recognised by their numbers .
First of all , I would like to say that everything Wim van Velzen tackles turns out well , and his report is highly principled in its responsible treatment of the issue , which he makes his own .
Commissioner , I would like to congratulate you on this initiative because transparency and benchmarking are the most important basic prerequisites for functioning competition .
People could not therefore be more justified in demanding that the aforementioned 1998 report at last be published , and that it be made clear what lessons were drawn from it as regards the handling of nuclear material at the Joint Research Centre .
The Commission was asked to examine this step via the Council Decision .
I agree wholeheartedly with the motion tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture .
First : in 1991 , the European heads of state and government expressly recognised the importance of European political parties in Article 138a of the Treaty of Amsterdam , guided by the idea that full-blown democracy in the European Union cannot be achieved without solidly-funded European political parties set on a reliable legal basis .
We shall comply with these demands .
When they commit , it is mainly in civil initiatives , non-governmental organisations and various structures within the civil society .
This is surely a way for non-allied , neutral countries to find their own way as members of the European Union while , at the same time , allowing collaboration in practically all circumstances .
This also applies to transport , satellites and such like .
War , if anything , is the most unsuitable and most counter-productive method in this respect .
That means , as far as weighting instruments is concerned , that the financial and material focus must be on an effective conflict prevention policy .
Secondly , we have learned that we are unable to intervene independently on our own continent and in our own neighbourhood , even in the case of very limited military action .
I am reminded of the policy of the Christmas goose trying to postpone Christmas .
Developments over the past few days show that it is not as easy as you might think .
The idea of attaching Article 5 in an additional protocol to a revised Treaty , to which the individual Member States may accede if necessary , therefore represents a reasonable attempt to find a solution .
I take the view that this violates the Treaty and violates the agreement on where Parliament sits .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the ban on any form of television advertising for cigarettes and other tobacco products in Directive 89/552 and the more stringent labelling requirements for tobacco products introduced in this directive illustrate the ambivalent attitude of the European Union towards tobacco .
Wanting to accept a sense of responsibility for the health of smokers in third countries is obviously well meant , but when this sense of missionary purpose results in the tobacco industry relocating production intended for export to third countries outside the EU , then all we will have managed to achieve are job losses .
That is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries .
I think the resolutions of Parliament and our progress in the European Union , Parliament ' s progress , are now accessible to every country .
When Tunisia keeps insisting that we are also talking about fighting extremism and terrorism and preventing extremist views , attitudes and organisations , then I agree with it wholeheartedly .
Competition and the reciprocal opening of markets , freedom of establishment and in the provision of services , intellectual property rights , environmental protection and partnership for sustainable development are just
