It is not sufficiently justified by the fact that the Union ' s forest area has grown since the last round of enlargement .
Here at Union level at the moment we are discussing many genuine legislative proposals concerning forests , including a common position on the emissions ceiling directive and on the directive relating to large incineration plants .
They must be supported , so that they are as successful as possible and so that we can do more to protect the forests as a result .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr SÃ¶derman , it may be well to remember that just a year and a half ago there was a debate in this Chamber over whether we needed a Committee on Petitions in general .
I believe that we will be able to draft joint reports on the most important problem areas .
Public access to documents is an issue that will occupy us in the future , and we have already had some valuable advice on the matter from the Ombudsman .
The Ombudsman controls power and solves disputes between those who hold power and those over whom power is exercised , and last year there were almost two thousand such cases .
I would like to state seven principles .
The newer it is the greater this need is , and the more complex it is , the greater the need for better transparency .
We are used to reading instructions for use with all equipment , down to how to use the whisk in the kitchen .
There is no democracy without good administration , and that is why the Union Charter must contain the principles of good administration .
My suggestion is that we need an Ombudsman' s portal on the Net .
Thank you for your work !
Mr President , on the basis of the Ombudsman' s report and that of Mrs Thors , we may say that the institution of the Ombudsman is well established .
It is just as pertinent to emphasise the importance of good administration for the public and for the authority of the EU in the eyes of our citizens .
From the report it appears that only around 30 % of the complaints to the Ombudsman fall within his sphere of responsibility .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
Experiences from last Monday reconfirm that this is a very important report indeed .
Flights were cancelled , and many were severely delayed .
The report proposes relevant action that must be put into effect right away .
Reports aimed at improving the competitiveness of rail transport are , from this point of view , very important .
The threat that phthalates may pose to human health has not been proven scientifically .
For example , according to research undertaken in the United States by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , only rarely , if at all , among children is there a risk of exposure to harmful chemicals , as the quantities of phthalates in toys do not exceed that level which could be considered harmful .
I myself do not support the principle of 'excessive force ' and an extensive ban that is not justifiable in the light of scientific facts .
In addition , I am sceptical about substituting phthalates with substances whose effects there is no research data on .
Hieronymi Report ( A5-0186/2000 )
I would like to thank Mrs Peijs for her interesting and excellent proposal .
In my own country , shipping is almost totally of this short sea shipping type : in other words , it is important to us in that respect .
On top of everything , our railways have a different gauge from those found elsewhere in the European Union .
They are powerful ships : one ship ' s energy is equivalent to that used by a whole city .
A cheap workforce is a huge risk in these circumstances , especially in the north , and especially in ice .
Aircrews are always well trained , but the same cannot be said of the cheap workforce that is employed on ships .
I expect the Commission to look into this matter .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mrs Peijs on a successful report .
Mrs Peijs ' s splendid report aims at exploiting the opportunities offered by short sea shipping .
For remote countries across the seas , and that includes Finland , short sea shipping is an absolutely vital necessity , just as Mr Paasilinna there just said .
For the measures proposed in the report to be implemented , good levels of co-operation will be required between the Union , Member States , players at local level , and companies too , as will genuine investment of time and money in short sea shipping .
It is definitely so that when the fines are small , environmental crime becomes lucrative .
In my opinion , however , the multinational giants are the big problem , and co-operation between the authorities is needed in this area , also so that these regulations might enter into force before enlargement .
It is just this repeated , intentional , environmentally criminal activity that is what we should be looking into .
I come from a country where we can initiate criminal proceedings against a corporate body , and that has had an impact and preventive effect there .
It is obvious that the director of a company will take a more serious view of the environment , as it is possible that he will end up isolated from it as a result of having gone to prison for criminally abusing it .
It seems to me that Mr Poettering ' s proposal would serve the purpose well if we were now to create a little transparency , for
