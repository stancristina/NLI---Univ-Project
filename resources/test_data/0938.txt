.
This form of crime flourishes , organizes itself , expands and takes on giant proportions in direct proportion to the increasing unaccountability of the free market and in direct proportion to the extent to which the free market spreads and gains in stature .
So these measures are all well and good and are improved by Mr Orlando 's amendments and the amendments tabled by a number of other Members .
And we would vote for them if the vote , if the council resolution could provide an absolute , categorical guarantee that there no mistakes will be made to the detriment of civil liberties .
We have to deal with the underlying causes .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the absent rapporteur for his insistence upon some very correct views .
In such a case , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we must back Commissioner Kinnock with our authority and stand by him , and if the Council persists in its refusal , we must denounce this publicly .
Mr President , assessments of the environmental impact of various specific projects have one way or another not been very satisfactory , as Mr Gahrton points out , and I think rightly so .
We agree with most of his proposals .
At any rate , until now no attention has been given to the overall and wider impact of integrated projects , groups of projects or interventions involving several individual projects .
Let me give an example , which concerns the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004 .
Amendments and revisions of the initial programme are being debated , which will cost a great deal , while the real effect on the environment remains unexplored and public information is non-existent .
Following the new directive , might it be possible for the Commission , even retrospectively , to carry out a strategic assessment of the Olympiad 's environmental impact , now while work on the projects has not yet commenced ?
For the first time , an attempt is being made to shed light on the situation prevailing in the Member States as regards the implementation of Community law .
It should be noted that no Member State has incorporated the European listing of waste products in accordance with Directive 4/94 .
However , I would like to dwell on what is happening as a result of the directives on solid wastes .
Consequently , despite bombastic declarations by the Member States about a Europe close to its citizens , it is the Union 's own bodies which ultimately not only stand aloof from their concerns , but even strive to protect their own rights .
There is no doubt that in the medium term , the rules of the international money markets will have to be tightened because of this crisis .
And of course , after Latin America and Brazil , the threat looms over the large domino of Wall Street , which would lead to a recession of America 's economy whose effects would be disastrous all over the world .
So we produced a misprint of a Western European or American economic situation there , which in the end did not last , as might have been expected .
We must not be surprised , for example , that the Russian banking system has collapsed .
And they did that very effectively , with very good results for them and bad ones for the economy .
When we say that we must stay out of it and let Russia solve its own problems , we ought therefore to think again .
Mr President , these four amendments embody very sound principles .
After the answer given by Commissioner Liikanen about the issue of less widely spoken languages , that amendment is superfluous .
It will soon be a year since the Luxembourg decision which defined very clearly the conditions that would allow Turkey to extend its association with Europe and improve its prospects of accession .
Now , in the face of the impasse brought about by this intransigence , which has been confirmed by every envoy sent by Europe and America , Mr Denktash has set off like a firework the idea that he is disposed to negotiate a confederal solution , believing that some people might be naive enough to think that he has softened his attitude .
Madam President , in his report Mr McMillan-Scott sets out all the problems which tarnish relations between the European Union and Turkey , and attempts with his well-founded comments to indicate , mainly to Turkey , the path it should follow if such debates are to become unnecessary in the future .
The rapporteur stressed all this and also explained that any harsh statements he made apply to those in power in a Turkey under military control and not to the Turkish people , who have themselves had much to put up with .
Europe , they say , has major economic and strategic interests in Turkey , so large , it seems , that it often sets aside some of its principles to accommodate them .
Most of the measures proposed by the rapporteur go in the right direction , and so do the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets , which Mr Giansily referred to earlier and which we should support .
The problem is not that Turkey is an Islamic country , nor that much of it extends into Asia , nor that it has a large population , nor that it has underdeveloped zones .
I think we must insist , we must say that the doors are open and that the ball is now in Turkey 's court .
Especially today , we must lend weight to two issues and I call on the Commission and the Council to mobilise their efforts towards them and abandon their inertia .
