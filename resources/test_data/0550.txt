access whether they requested them from Sweden , Greece or Portugal .
I think that that is a good idea .
I think that a good deal more must be done in that regard .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I should like to say a word of thanks to the rapporteur for his work on the Directive on paint .
Precisely because of the imposition of limits , the paint industry has undergone a period of intensive innovation , the end of which is still a long way off .
The Directive on paint is a harmonisation directive and will without a doubt be a good thing for the industry , which would like to see clear , unambiguous rules in the internal market .
I call on the rapporteur , therefore , to have another good look at the various amendments that strengthen the social aspects of the Directive , and to support these .
It became clear during the preparation of this revised Directive that there is a conflict of interests .
In their view , the existing rules are not being controlled and complied with as it is , and they use that as an argument for rejecting stricter rules .
In addition , we should not wait until 2010 to lower limit values , but do it as soon as possible .
Exposure to these substances can result in damage to brain functioning and ultimately to disablement .
Thank you for your explanation , Commissioner .
I was there .
Environmental breakthroughs were achieved in Rio .
A coalition of the willing will now try to promote new , renewable energy .
New environmental agreements are also needed , particularly for sustainable forest management .
Sadly , this balance was not given its due at the Johannesburg Summit , because not enough emphasis was placed on the social and environmental elements .
Where human rights violations are concerned , it is a different story , of course , but these do not fall under the subject of sustainable development .
Sustainable development has developed over time .
One example is climate policy .
By showing that it is possible to give flesh and blood to sustainable development , we bring about rejuvenation , and this rejuvenation can also arouse new creativity .
Perhaps you , Commissioner , could advance the idea of a Johannesburg Commissioner and a Johannesburg check a little within the Commission .
He has never ceased to emphasise that transparency and openness are the cheapest means of ensuring good administration and combating fraud .
I still do not see why it should be so problematic , especially for the Commission , the very ones that should be setting a good example in this .
Sometimes , however , the Commission does not want to tread on the toes of the governments of some Member States .
Internationally operating companies that offer high returns have taken a large proportion of that money for themselves and with it gained control over the pension funds , too .
I by no means share the indignation at their actions which prevails here .
That is a sad thing in connection with arms , because these are not everyday goods .
Large parts of the world continue to be inundated with arms that are used not only against the people living there , but also against our own peacekeeping forces .
Nevertheless , people found an opportunity to export them to Nepal , and now we even have regionalisation of the arms trade .
If not , we shall find ourselves in the unpleasant situation in which those involved in rehabilitation have to compete for budget resources with those working on prevention , when of course prevention , too , is an absolute necessity .
While this is an important tool in conflict prevention , we also want to continue to urge you not to let us lose sight of the rehabilitation of victims .
You know that our great concern with regard to the Middle East is growing by the day .
What happened after the dramatic attack in Haifa , an attack deep in Syria , and one that we deplore and denounce , simply invites further military escalation .
Can we still keep the Association Agreement in operation ?
This is what should characterise the publicity surrounding the Convention results .
In terms of our relations with the outside world , the drawing up of the Constitution is also extremely important , because no third country should be in any doubt about the fact that the European Union is an alliance of democratic constitutional states .
Whatever we decide with regard to appointing Commissioners , we should constantly bear this in mind : never and on no occasion should the impression be created that the appointment could be of a national nature .
Legislation must improve and become more transparent , and that is a task for the Commission , Parliament and Member States alike .
A crucial element in the establishment of better legislation is the analysis of legislation for the financial and administrative implications by means of an impact assessment .
Apart from carefully examining alternatives for European legislation , it is also important for the implementation of legislation and national legislation by the Member States to be carried out more effectively and monitored closely .
The Commission has meanwhile tabled various proposals in this framework , including the programme for consolidation , codification and simplification of legislation , which will reduce the volume of legislation by no fewer than 35 000 pages .
What we do need is a drastic approach to tackle excessively lengthy procedures , the lack of results and the overall transparency deficit .
In the first instance , Parliament welcomed the Green Paper’s proposals for a ‘one-stop-shop’ system in Brussels for multiple filings in more than two Member States .
