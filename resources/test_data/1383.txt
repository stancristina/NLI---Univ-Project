I wish to raise is the issue of culture , which is not only about education and training , but also about cultural heritage .
Finally , the sociologist Edgard Morin is quite right when he points out that it is not cultures , religions and civilisations that engage in dialogue , but people , individuals , men and women .
The fact that we have to consider , however , is that 72 % of the 3 726 complaints received lay outside his competence .
Ladies and gentlemen , the office of the European Ombudsman was set up by the Maastricht Treaty as a part of European citizenship , which is still an ongoing issue that requires new rights as a result of enlargement and the complexity of migration and globalisation .
In the eyes of the vast majority of European citizens , the European Union is seen as a Moloch , and the European Ombudsman should have felt the need to voice this feeling , which has been expressed so clearly .
Although this network is certainly useful and we welcome it , there is no explanation , either , of the ramifications of the work that it can accomplish through the presence of national ombudsmen in the individual Member States .
In Amendment 771 in block 4 , the total amount of payment appropriations for budget line 22 02 01 01 should be written in the line and , finally , in the lines on the European Development Fund , a reminder should be introduced to restore the preliminary draft budget .
However , that is not enough by itself .
There has not , so far , been any confirmation or legal proof of such allegations .
The Commission will continue to monitor these allegations closely .
What stand did the Commission take when faced with this evidence ?
It is obvious that everyone must respect the rules , laws and sovereignty of the State .
In the top-secret CIA documents , which virtually the entire European press is currently discussing , the clandestine jails in Poland and Romania , referred to in the and , even have a name – ‘black sites’ .
We have noted your final comment , namely that if the episodes we are discussing today were proven , they would constitute serious violations of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union .
That , I believe , is an important statement and one we would ask you to develop further , by launching an exhaustive and in-depth investigation into the events we have been discussing this evening .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank those who have spoken and to say that everyone here is in agreement with a principle which I personally underlined in my introduction .
Ladies and gentlemen , the problem is that legal means must be used if they give us every opportunity to achieve the result that we , both Commission and Parliament , are seeking .
When some Members refer to an ‘investigation’ , they are not just referring to the approach the Commission is intending to adopt – and will adopt – namely to conduct a political enquiry .
Do we have the powers of the Council of Europe ?
We are allowed to ask the question , but if a Member State replies that it has never had clandestine jails in its territory , I shall need to have proof , as in the case of Abu Ghraib – photographs , evidence and testimonies .
That was the sign of an economic and social crisis that was also related to European policies , that is to say free-trade policies .
The problem is exemplified not by Europe or by enlargement or by Turkey , but by free trade ; and today you have once again suggested that we go down this blind alley .
We must guarantee democracy and not the so-called security packages that adversely affect democratic rights and have furthermore been rejected by the UK Parliament .
The recent events affecting the French suburbs are a clear signal that security problems no longer relate solely to dangers originating outside our frontiers .
We all remember that the previous Commission under Mr Prodi managed in the event to achieve only 50 % of what was initially envisaged in its programme .
This is a problem that affects one country today , but could affect others tomorrow .
In my opinion , therefore , the amendments seem to lead , as I would wish , to a major increase in the European supply of products in this sector .
Rather than voting ‘No’ , I should perhaps have simply left the room .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , while listening to the speeches of the two Commissioners and Lord Bach , who represented the UK Presidency , I was reflecting on the distance we have had to travel in order to arrive at this point .
It is easier to arrive at such a balance when one is approving a political resolution , since in that instance one is working solely with words .
As for enterprises , I shall mention only the most important things that have been done .
We have been subjected to much pressure , albeit legitimate pressure , concerning the interests that we all have to represent in some way while seeking the best possible compromise that is acceptable to a majority in Parliament .
We have come close to this objective ; and meanwhile the positions of various institutions , in particular the two legislative ones , namely the Council and Parliament , have moved very close together .
I said recently that an agreement is like a fruit : if it is not picked at the right time , when it is ripe , it rots and goes bad .
