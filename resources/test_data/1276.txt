justice .
We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom , Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character .
.
The EU introduces a common currency .
Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU ; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State .
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States ' legal principles , legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting .
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds .
Instead , the focus should be upon preventing the real problem .
( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni' s report , according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council ' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology .
Through the agreement , the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty .
With the approval of this agreement , we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned .

Company restructuring in Europe Mr President , what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible .
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on .
The Chief Commissioner of Police , Svend Frederiksen , has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed .
He has fewer than 2 000 officers , and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000 .
It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them .
It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained , and the idea was , in fact , that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained .
A year ago , we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up .
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace .
By Christmas , there were perhaps 100 and , by the spring , still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was , in fact , in place .
Then the war came , and the observers were withdrawn .
I would therefore ask the Commissioner : can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe ?
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers , who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad ?
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities ?
( DA ) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market , which ought to be promoted and encouraged .
Policy on tourism is not , however , something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole .
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian , peace-keeping and peace-making tasks .
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe .
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights .
You must lay these concerns to rest for , as you yourself have said , when we are able to present a united transatlantic front , we are in a position to do something .
So , maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway , Turkey and Canada , either .
As George Robertson has said so often , we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo .
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats .
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment .
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny .
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States .
No soldier can , of course , be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament .
It will be a force comprised of various national units .
However , there is , of course , also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament .
Finally , I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion .
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much .
We share your delight , as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired
