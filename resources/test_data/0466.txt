This represents an important moment in the internal market and the first landmark in this area during this parliamentary term .
However , it is one more consumer guarantee that has been put in writing – in this particular case , in the area of insurance – and that is clearly a positive outcome .
I have to acknowledge that the most recent indications are that the number of accidents is falling – precisely , I believe , because of measures taken to improve the health and safety protection of workers .
Lastly , an explicit reference to the key concept in this area – prevention .
In other words , it should be viewed as a limited , short-term solution that is little more than symbolic , bearing in mind that thousands of boats were destroyed and it is unlikely that this action will help to replace more than a few dozen vessels .
Our primary objective is to do everything we can to bring it up to speed .     .
It is therefore evident that they are both useful and just .
The tsunami disaster had an enormous impact on the fisheries sector in India , Indonesia , Myanmar , the Maldives , Somalia , Sri Lanka and Thailand .
We must ensure compliance with the concept of transferring boats if requested and with the criteria laid down by the Food and Agriculture Organisation .
We must not allow the businesses concerned to sidestep the agreed conditions on the basis of which they enjoy those subsidies , obligations such as long-term production in the territory and maintaining jobs .
The world will only be a better place if someone shows the way forward , and we should be that someone .
When what is really required is a sea change in the orientations and objectives of Community policies , by revoking the Stability and Growth Pact and replacing it with a Growth and Employment Pact , along with root and branch changes to the Lisbon strategy in order to put an end to the liberalisations and privatisations in industries and essential public services and to give absolute priority to the creation of jobs with rights and to the fight against poverty and social exclusion , the Commission continues to follow the path of even greater liberalisation ; that is , more of the same .
I wish to restate my belief that globalisation must be accompanied by strenuous efforts aimed at reducing poverty ; we must recognise the value of cancelling debt as a means of fighting poverty in countries where progress is made towards democratisation , respect for human rights , the rule of law and a sustainable economy .
The political and institutional reforms will offer the country gradual integration into the EU’s policies and programmes .
The figures cited in the communication are alarming : 5 200 workers lose their life as a result of work-related accidents per year .
The framework directive could go further and could be more practical ...
The report before us raises a general point that has , in itself , influenced my vote .
Indeed , bearing the above in mind , I believe that the defence of health and safety at work is a prerequisite to the kind of civilisation that we must promote , and , moreover , amounts to an obligation on the part of employers , because businesses also have social obligations .
I do not know if this is true , but we should like confirmation .
We have nothing against this , but we have repeatedly invited Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas , the 2002 Sakharov Prize winner , to come to Parliament , and it is this Minister’s government – the Cuban Government – that has not allowed him to come .
The Commission and the Council must also send out a clear message to Turkey that this is incompatible with its commitments as regards negotiating accession to the EU and that respect for human rights involves not only changing the law , but also putting that respect into practice .     . – Mr President , whilst I feel that there is relative consensus on this report , this must not stop us from taking a look at some key issues that go beyond the report and beyond the activities of the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) .
It must therefore be acknowledged that the Bank’s activities have gradually adapted to the reality of the European economic climate and that the Bank has managed to achieve this adaptation whilst complying in full with its original mandate .
The fifth idea is that , given that the Bank must support the European economy as a whole , special emphasis must be placed on scientific research and on high-technology industries .
Hence the importance of the adoption in committee of an amendment covering this aspect , which will hopefully be adopted in plenary with the adoption of this report .
When a woman has to choose between breast-feeding her child and keeping her job in management ; when a woman has to choose between looking after her sick children and the risk of being sacked ; when a woman finds that the people at work are more understanding if she asks to leave early in order to take the car in for a service than in order to pick up her child at the kindergarten ; all of this tells you everything about the mentality of those who hold economic power and about the undervaluation of jobs traditionally allocated to women .
It is also unacceptable that health and sexual and reproductive rights , guaranteed by the Beijing Platform for Action , continue to be undermined in countries such as Portugal , where women accused of backstreet abortions have been subjected to humiliation in court cases and
