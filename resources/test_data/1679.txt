, we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications .
We need a strategy .
Jacques Delors spelt it out in his White Paper , so we do not need to reinvent his thoughts .
However , the big difference between us and the successful economies of the world - the US in particular - is that they spend far more money on investment in science , and it pays off .
Commissioner Busquin' s communication on the European research area is very good .
However , what is important is the next stage : transferring that knowledge into goods and products and processes which can be sold .
Let us be innovative in the European Union .
Let us start by bringing the innovation unit back from Luxembourg to Brussels , where it can use its skills working with other departments of the Commission .
That would be a not very revolutionary but a sensible thing to do .
Mr President , I want to associate myself this morning with those people who have spoken in this debate and expressed some desire to challenge an atmosphere of complacency about the current state of the European economy .
I share the view expressed earlier by Mrs McNally that you can look to the United States and see that there has been investment in research .
That is one of the reasons why the United States is doing better than Europe .
But we must also emphasise that one of the other reasons why the United States continues to do so much better than Europe is because Europe has not yet properly addressed the issue of structural reform and market liberalisation .
I refer to the remarks made earlier by Mr Lipietz for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
I am very pleased to engage in a debate with him over the next four years on this issue of market liberalisation .
The fact is that we have not yet seen the agreed market liberalisation within Europe applied in some Member States , not least his own .
I have a shared concern about the jobs of workers .
I would be very pleased to bring Mr Lipietz to speak to workers in the United Kingdom who may lose their jobs as a result of decisions made by a French owner of energy companies in the UK, when British companies are not allowed to gain access to the French market because the French have not applied agreed European policy .
That is a structural reform we must drive through .
It is not just in that area .
We see that the wealthiest states within the European Union continue to be the states that apply the strongest amount of state aid .
That is robbing the jobs of some of the poorer states who are represented here .
That is also one of the reasons why I do not share the view expressed by Mr von Wogau in relation to competition policy .
My concern , where decentralisation is concerned , is that there should not be a repatriation of competition policy .
Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to welcome Greece into the euro and say that we shall certainly be voting in favour of Greek membership .
For those other 'out ' countries , including my own , I very much hope that they will be able to join the euro soon .
I very much regret too that there are so few British Conservatives here in the Chamber today because it shows , with Greece now the twelfth member of the euro zone , how far from reality British euroscepticism about the future of the currency is .
The euro has successfully delivered low inflation , rising growth , falling unemployment and protection for the euro zone economies from the ups and downs of the foreign exchanges .
Indeed , the British perception of the euro as a failure , because of its fall against the dollar , simply misunderstands the whole project .
The key test of a currency is price stability within the economy , not the value of the currency against other currencies outside the economy .
On the test of internal stability , with inflation at less that 2 % and growth higher at 3.1 % in the euro zone than in Britain , the euro is clearly succeeding .
Indeed , research at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi recently calculated the euro ' s value as if it had existed over the last few decades , weighting each predecessor currency 's value to create a synthetic euro .
Historically , that research found that the euro actually swooped between a high of USD 1.70 in December 1979 and a low of just USD 0.69 in February 1985 .
In other words , the euro could stay within its historic trading range and happily now either fall by a further 23 % or rise by 188 % .
Certainly that synthetic euro included currencies such as the Italian Lira , but the same point applies even to the mighty German Mark on its own .
If the euro is a weak currency , than the Mark was positively anaemic .
It plunged to DEM 3.45 against the dollar at the end of February 1985 , which is a third below its current rate of DEM 2.16 to the dollar .
Within three years , and a dollar crash , the Mark was back to DEM 1.57 during December 1987 .
The truth is that the history of foreign exchange is a history of gross misalignments , of overvaluations and undervaluations , each inflicting either depressive pain or inflationary costs on the economy and , as Greece has rightly recognised , the euro is a way of regaining control over a key part of our economic environment .
