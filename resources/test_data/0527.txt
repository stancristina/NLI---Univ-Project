After all we still have many times more unemployment in the Union than in the United States and Japan for example .
In a very recent report Mr Delors said that 6 % of the GNP should be devoted to training and many Member States are not yet coming up to that level .
Mr President , the news from Burundi in the last few days is simply bewildering .
Since then the tension between the army and the civil authority has escalated to an intolerable level .
Secretary General Boutros Ghali speaks scathingly of the Europeans ' interest in 'a rich men 's war ' on the continent of Europe whose desire for peace fades when it is a question of poor Africa .
Now ex-President Nyerere has accepted an assignment and the European Council has entrusted Ambassador Ajello with the task of mediating .
Why are Boutros Ghali 's proposals not being followed up ?
When the European Community was founded countries with historical links , above all with Africa , forced the Yaoundé Convention through , and later the Lomé Convention , and thus brought about an ambitious aid policy .
In any case , one thing has become clear , namely that the famous government convention of September 1994 delivered absolutely nothing of what was expected of it , on the contrary because Frodebu had to concede so much in the negotiations that he lost credibility , and the more credibility Frodebu loses , the more Nyangoma can gain , and that is the position we are in today .
Then I think it is simply a scandal that we should hear last Monday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs that our special envoy has not even the minimum working capital to do anything in a country like Burundi and that into the bargain our very own Committee on Budgets ( so this time we cannot blame the Commission ) is refusing to release the financial resources for Mr Ajello because it thinks that the rules are not being respected .
It is time for the economists in this House to see that economy and environment are twins .
There are environmental conditions and social boundaries which economic development must observe in order to be lasting .
That applies in the first place to job experience .
The competent authorities of the Member States would then have to exchange ideas now and then through the intermediary of the Commission .
That is a new amendment not included in first reading and which , I have heard , has meanwhile been declared inadmissible .
But I think we in the Committee on Transport still wonder whether the Commissioner has not accepted the Council 's ideas too quickly .
So once again the Council enhances a proposal whilst the Commission to some extent mars it .
Can we still rely on the Commission 's coming on 30 June this year with the proposals for requirements for the 2000 stage so that we can decide it all in time ?
So we have tabled a number of amendments on that point , that is , the distinction between infection and the onset of the disease , and other factors which have an influence on the more rapid onset of the disease .
Mr Pimenta argues that we should have a division in which a special aspect of the environment should be targeted , for example to begin with the ecosystems .
In that area I wish to support Amendment No 21 by Mr Liese .
I will give you one example - social policies towards street children in Brazil .
Madam President , what we see today is a very good example of New Labour .
Let us take Italy . 29 % of the post arrives according to the standards laid down .
That can only improve if we have open and free provision of services .
Users are losing an important part of the service and employees are losing their jobs .
That is against the consumer 's interest but above all , because of distortion of competition , it is harmful for businesses which are very dependent on the postal services .
Unfortunately the report of the Committee on Transport has taken a step backwards compared with the Commission 's balanced compromise and will not even consider restricted liberalization , in spite of the favourable experience in the Netherlands and Sweden in this field .
Good and efficient post and telecommunication services are of primary importance for the European Union .
All that does not diminish my great appreciation of the way the rapporteur has done his work .
So we must combat racism and xenophobia on a very broad front , not only from this special angle - we all know that the extreme right is indicated as the crystallization point - but we must inspect the whole wide political spectrum .
But there is always something left over for European policy and we shall have to pursue that because we can see the phenomena of international thought pollution most clearly in this sphere .
So the Commission must publish a regular report on the observatory 's activities and research , including research into policy which might be pursued , also at a decentralized level .
Mr President , the word bannissement in French comes out differently in some translations .
The English text speaks of ostracizing .
Because the present dossier is a blot on the escutcheon of all those who would like to call themselves with any justification representatives of the people .
Finally , an anti-racism year is a good thing but it cannot stop there .
An irresponsible decision .
Of course we have to have enough time to debate other matters , but I was rather surprised by Mrs Green 's remarks .
It should be possible to have this instead of the debate on the ombudsman .
We are in favour
