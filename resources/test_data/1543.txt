report .
Russia has considerable scientific resources , especially in the field of basic research , and a large proportion of it remains untapped and unutilised in an international context .
In the 1993 - 1998 period , the European Union financed cooperation in the area of techno-scientific research to the tune of approximately EUR 140 million . 35,000 scientists from Russia have been involved in these projects .
Currently , EUR 90,000 is spent each year on meetings and travel .
Agriculture is one area of research cooperation .
In Russia , small farmers have actually been compelled to switch to organic production because they cannot afford chemical fertilisers .
We could make significant progress in that area .
In many ways , Russia is a very content-rich country .
The number of refugees is on the increase , and conditions have become horrific .
The Russian leadership refuses to react to any of this .
It seems more and more likely that this is all part of the Russian election campaign .
This is something that cannot be tolerated .
Cooperation between the EU and Russia should be continued and developed .
The agreement now under consideration will bring the widespread cooperation activities within the sphere of a more effective coordination .
I would like to emphasise the importance of cooperation , particularly in the field of environmental and climatic research , and within the framework of information technology and telecommunications .
Through techno-scientific cooperation we can also promote the exploitation of natural resources of North-Western Russia , which are of great importance for the future development of the economies of both Russia and the EU.
We must also see to it that projects that have been started are brought to a conclusion within their allocated time span .
To a certain extent , this has detracted from the interest in practical cooperation with Russia .
Mr Speaker , the reform of the Union ' s employment policy that began in Luxembourg in 1997 is one of the biggest and most important projects the EU has launched during these past few years .
The European employment policy is , indeed , badly in need of reform !
The framework exists , however , for bringing about change .
In addition , the convergence of the economic policies of the euro countries as a result of the single currency offers the opportunity to seek optimal models , a process known as benchmarking .
I would especially like to emphasise the importance of the measures taken to improve the employment facilities of SMEs .
We simply have to try to reduce administrative costs , taxes and expenses .
I also consider it slightly worrying that the proposals for guidelines for the year 2000 are coming under discussion before the tangible actions regarding the old guidelines have been concluded or even started .
Any leak of information is extremely unfortunate , but it has happened before .
Madam President , it is very important that the European Parliament continues to support Alexander Nikitin , who is accused of endangering state security in Russia .
This has been a tradition for us ; we have supported him in his trial and followed it on a regular basis , and it has come to our attention that now would be just the right time to adopt a position , as the action will be continuing very soon .
Madam President , the legislative project under discussion is very important for the issue of air protection .
It will also reduce the number of particles in the air that are hazardous to health .
In my opinion , the rapporteur , Mr Lange , is quite right when he proposes that heavy goods vehicles should be included in a common strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from road traffic as quickly as possible .
In a market economy , money is the deciding force .
Therefore we have to use financial pressure to push forward environmental values .
Using tax concessions as a carrot to replace heavy old commercial vehicles is well justified , as are tax benefits for environment-friendly vehicles .
You yourselves must daily encounter situations where heavy vehicles such as buses and construction machinery leave their engine running at times when nothing is going on .
It is just a question of attitudes .
Trucks and buses contribute to air pollution in ever greater proportions , as we have actually done a lot to reduce car emissions , for example by using better quality fuels and tax concessions , as Mrs Myller said .
In the first reading , Parliament was very successful in getting through strict limit values for particulate pollutants , which are very dangerous for the health .
Industry needs sufficient time , and industry will certainly get the time it needs to prepare itself for this technological change .
Mr President , first I would like to thank Mrs Haug for a very well prepared report .
The most important basis mentioned were the estimates for Member States ' contributions , reconciliation on which became more important than safeguarding EU financing .
But this is where the system ' s clarity ends .
First , the premium paid for the collection of traditional own resources , i .e . customs duty and agricultural levies , was increased to 25 % .
The rise was justified by the need to collect contributions more efficiently , but that is not sufficient justification .
The same might be said for the agreement made on the payment of this rebate .
It should examine in particular concessions on contributions and the possibility of creating a new system of own resources that would relate directly to the public , without increasing their burden of taxation .
It is important , however , that the new system outlined in the report should come into effect in all respects from the beginning of 2007 .
