We are not talking about fully developed regions in the centre of Europe which have countless alternatives when faced with changes in market conditions , and where the common agricultural policy invests most of its resources .
The building of Europe is today , more than ever , essential for peace and progress not only in Europe , but also throughout the world .
Enlargement should not in any way be used as a pretext for making institutional changes which would gratuitously upset the equilibrium carefully created since 1957 , as these institutional changes have no direct logical or political link with enlargement .
We do not believe that the proposal in the report describes with sufficient clarity and openness the adoption of a criterion putting all Member States on an equal footing , whether the Commission is made up of one Commissioner per Member State or of a college of 20 Commissioners .
We consider that this new rule does not guarantee the necessary balance and equality in the representation of the Member States in the Council .
Until now all decisions in the European Union relating to appointments have been taken unanimously , and there has never been a lack of appointments or any kind of crisis .
We wish to add that , because of the speed with which we proceeded to the vote , it was not always easy to understand what we were voting on , there being a certain degree of confusion , specifically about votes on amendments and paragraphs .
These are ideas from which we have always unequivocally distanced ourselves and will continue to do so .
The European Parliament could demonstrate its worth by adopting these policies .
I would like to remind you of another reference : the US Declaration of Independence , an inspirational text which defines the three rights on which the United States war of independence was based : " the right to life , to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness " .
The fact is that Hitler is on the loose again - Hitler is out and about again there .
The chaos , the threats and the intimidation taking place in that country are unacceptable and it is also unacceptable that this is being encouraged by the person holding the highest office of state , the President of Zimbabwe himself .
The references to ways of solving the problems of discrimination and to the age range for participation in the programme - 15-25 , although there are some exceptions - are also inadequate , given that the average age for completing higher education is very close to the upper limit , which should be raised to 30 years .
But the truth is that this process increases financial instability and encourages concentration of capital markets and financial institutions , and for this reason we are opposed both to the position adopted by the Commission and to the rapporteur ' s position .
( PT ) We voted against this report because we consider that in content it differs little from the Commission ' s proposal , which aims to put social security totally in the hands of the financial markets , thus weakening or even replacing state pension schemes by stock market speculation .
Mr President , at the request of Mr Cunha I am presenting our statement on this debate on the school milk scheme .
The second reason is that , as there is a structural surplus in the market for milk products , this measure also represents an incentive to dispose of milk in a far more useful and constructive way than by distributing it , denaturing it or exporting it to third countries at even greater cost .
- ( PT ) Mr President , I would like to support this suggestion .
This is a matter which has extremely serious political repercussions !
Here we have the saboteur sabot√© - the saboteur hoist with his own petard .
As we can see , however , when we take a decision here on an issue related to storms , disasters or Europe ' s interests , that is , serious matters , they are no longer present .
We cannot continue to put up with a lame currency .
.
We consider this to be very important , as we reject the idea of transferring the costs of the CAP back to national governments .
In doing so , they rode roughshod over the regulations currently in force , with the damaging consequences with which we are all familiar .
We must be aware that , at this precise moment , Regional Development Plans are being approved for the period 2000-2006 which will contribute to isolating even further the Objective 1 regions , which desperately need a modern connection to the whole of Europe , including high speed rail links .
This is a good sign .
Thirdly , that in future reviews of the trans-European networks , greater importance is attached to the access of the remote regions to the central regions and to island regions .
Switzerland operates stricter laws for nationals of third countries and , with the entry into force of this agreement , the Swiss system will , by stages , adapt to the principle of the free movement of persons , based on the acquis communautaire .
With the agreements that have been approved today , these problems will gradually be resolved , and we also hope that , through the establishment of the Joint Committee provided for in the agreement on the free movement of persons , positive steps will be taken to resolve other issues connected to the social protection of emigrants and their families .
We also support the report ' s confirmation of the importance attached to passenger air transport as a public service for the remote and island regions and to the
