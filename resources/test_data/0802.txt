I am glad that the response was positive and glad to find this kind of European motivation in Bulgaria .
That is a case in point of the evolving European democracy , which is a very dear objective to this House .
Ensuring compliance with the accession requirements by January 2007 will pose a real challenge over the next 17 months .
Similarly , in the case of Romania , progress in the fields of justice and home affairs , especially the reform of the judiciary system and the fight against corruption , competition and state aid , the environment and agriculture will be crucial .
In June , the Commission sent early warning letters or ‘yellow cards ’ to both Bulgaria and Romania in which we indicated areas of serious shortcomings .
In conclusion , for the moment the jury is still out .
The next significant step will be the comprehensive monitoring report , which will be issued on 25 October .
If necessary , the Commission would not hesitate to recommend the use of the safeguard clauses of postponement provided for in the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania .     .
The first part is up to the word ‘market ’ and then the rest of the amendment would be deleted , so it would be similar to the original form in committee .
I propose that the first part be adopted .
Mr President , there is a linguistic problem in this amendment .
I represent an EU country that is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Ottawa Treaty by the year 2016 .
When they were placed in the ground during the war , precise maps were produced so that they could be deactivated later on .
Countries where that happens cannot be part of the Ottawa Treaty .
We already know that our defences are weakening substantially .
Our problem is therefore one of semantics .
The new systems are not in any way less lethal instruments of death than the current land mines .
I do not now intend to repeat what out resolution says ; I only wish to say that democracy is a challenging process which requires effort .
President Mugabe , a former freedom fighter and national hero , has degenerated into a dictator , who guards his own power jealously , and a criminal , and this needs to be analysed .
When , a few years ago , we were in Zimbabwe as election observers , we could only wonder at Mugabe , who had the nerve to proclaim during the election that the government would remain , whatever the result .
This former fertile African model country is now in a state of chaos .
One keyword is law and order , a condition of the social contract .
What is more , by crushing the opposition he is destroying the basis of democratic society .
The philosopher and theologian , Niebuhr , hit upon a reason for man’s dual nature : our capacity for good makes democracy possible , and our inclination to do bad makes it necessary .
Only true democracy guarantees that new faces will replace people who have been corrupted by power .
In fact , this directive covers almost all the issues that the Council of Europe’s Convention has passed a decision on .
In the discussion of this directive we should approach the search for modes of cooperation between these two bodies with an open mind , and clearly identify the areas of responsibility the Council of Europe and the European Union should have .
What is most important , however , is that resources should be combined .
I am also pleased that the European Union and China have reached a settlement , but I cannot support the policy of the European Parliament , not to mention that of the EU , in this matter .
The reason is straightforward : the principle at stake here should be free trade , not quotas .
In other words , I give my support to the Commission and those countries that are prepared to open up the textiles market , and not to block it .     .
In practical terms , nothing was agreed on , and , as a result , Parliament is free to undertake its own first reading without any commitments to the Council .
Virtually the only thing that the Council seems to be actively interested in financing is the militarisation of the EU.
Although the Constitution , which was rejected in two referenda , is not immediately forthcoming , the political elite in the Member States are implementing some of the articles contained in it , and are establishing , for example , an Armaments , Research and Capabilities Agency .
The way that the Member States behave is undemocratic , and it is very obvious that many EU joint military activities have no legal basis in the Treaties .
Only that way will the work of the Union acquire legitimacy , which is to say the general approval of the public .
Stringent budgetary discipline is a good thing , but in this case the Council is advocating a sound thrashing .
This is a strategic objective that we cannot accept .
Finally , I wish to say that we need to safeguard Structural Funds payments and increase human resources for the needs of enlargement .
It is very difficult for us in Parliament to understand the conflict which prevails between the Commission and the Council with regard to their views on personnel requirements and the need for increased human resources as a result of enlargement .     Madam President , first I would like to thank everyone for their amicable approach .
This , moreover , was achieved by cutting expenditure by half a billion euros as a matter of course
