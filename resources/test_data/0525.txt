integrated strategy is absolutely essential if it is to be possible to solve these problems .
Since October 1999 when President Pastrana , here in the European Parliament , asked for the EU' s help for his plan for peace , prosperity and a strengthening of state power , the Council has had the opportunity , in response to a number of questions from honourable Members , to repeat the main features of the European Union ' s position on Colombia and to inform the European Parliament of the way in which the work on this important matter has developed .
Approximately EUR 40 million of these funds would be allocated to economic and social development and the fight against poverty , approximately EUR 30 million to so-called alternative development and EUR 25 million to support for reforms of the judicial system and for the promotion of human rights .
When it comes to the fight against drugs - discussed under paragraph 8 of Parliament ' s resolution of 7 September of last year , to which the honourable Member refers - the European Union has also emphasised the crucial importance of combating this scourge which directly affects all European states and their citizens .
The Council has not expressed an opinion on the United States ' s contribution to Plan Colombia , a significant part of which is intended to be used in the fight against the drugs trade , because this is an issue affecting bilateral relations between Colombia and the United States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , there is talk in this Chamber of who the winners in this conciliation are .
We know , of course , that road transport is increasing at the expense of rail transport and that it has been doing so for a long time .
The railways ' organisational structure is also at fault .
I think we have achieved a good conciliation we can rightly congratulate ourselves on , even if we might sometimes wish it could have gone further .
This is important in Europe , where distances are long .
At present , distrust of the European food industry , of agriculture and of our countryside and farmers is spreading like wildfire .
Let us use the present chaos creatively , for today we have our electorate ' s support for opening up and transforming the entire food sector .
Within the European Union , we have had rules about not using hormones to promote growth .
According to that assessment , there were different levels of risk factor .
The Commission is therefore now proposing a change to the legislation so that oestradiol 17ß in particular is completely banned - both for use in feed or as a growth promoter , and for therapeutic purposes .
Naturally , it is also important to continue investigating the other five hormones to see how hazardous they may be , but it is constructive that oestradiol 17ß is now banned once and for all .
Firstly , there is the environmental argument .
We must consider whether it is reasonable to give animals feed supplements which cause abnormal growth .
We must therefore reflect upon whether hormone use accords with the basic ethical rules we human beings have .
The issue is , of course , that of whether change as far-reaching as this means that the very conditions of life for human beings or other biological creatures are being transformed .
At the same time , I want to emphasise that there is a crucial difference between the committee ' s and the Commission 's proposals , for we in the committee do not wish to apply the committee procedure proposed by the Commission but want to arrange for any amendments to go back to Parliament for approval because there is so much by way of politics - and not only of science - in all of this .
Yesterday in Stockholm , I met a representative of the American Department of Agriculture , who did not take the European view of science .
The progressive marginalisation of the Christian Maronite community in Lebanon is also deplorable .
On this occasion , it was therefore a case of one man ' s loss being another man ' s gain .
In recent years , the Commission has tabled a number of proposals for increasing maritime safety in various ways , and this as a result of a number of accidents affecting both people and the environment .
In this report , we are dealing with safety in connection with the loading and unloading of bulk carriers .
Lack of maintenance is a cause of accidents of this type , but many accidents also occur in connection with loading and unloading .
It is important to take an overall view of this problem .
We are concerned here not only with bulk carriers but also with other forms of shipping and other forms of transport .
I should be grateful if the Commissioner could say something about the initiatives the Commission intends to go on taking on this important matter .
Within 10 years , there may be 25 or 27 Member States .
There is one signalling system in Denmark and a quite different system in Sweden .
Another is quite deliberate - never to make it easy just to go ahead and drive a train straight into another country .
It is therefore an important step for the Commission now to take initiatives whereby , step by step , we obtain the same railway system .
It should also be pointed out that we need to combine with the Central and Eastern European countries to conduct the same operation there in the long term .
Mr President , allow me to begin by expressing my great disappointment at the fact that no minister from the presidency is present at this important debate .
