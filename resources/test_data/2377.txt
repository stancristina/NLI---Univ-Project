It is worth noting that its particular aspects , such as the prevention of forest fires or floods , are already covered by special Community financing instruments .
The Commission wishes to avoid overlaps with existing financing instruments .
Firstly , the Commission considers that replacing the legal basis with Article 175( 1 ) of the Treaty is not necessary for a civil protection financing instrument .
As regards the integration of interventions in emergencies outside the European Union into the financing instrument , the Commission agrees with the European Parliament on the need to safeguard this type of financing action .
This is the issue on which the Commission 's position differs from the European Parliament report .
I would , however , emphasise that , with the existing instruments , with the existing facilities and with the existing competences , civil protection and the mechanism which we have in the European Commission responded very , very well to last year 's crises , by which I mean the various fires , for example in Portugal , and the floods in countries such as Bulgaria and Romania .
Of course , we need , as Mr Papadimoulis 's report says , to strengthen civil protection .
I should like to comment briefly on the basic purpose and the objectives of the strategy concerning mercury .
The strategy has the following six objectives : to reduce mercury emissions , to reduce the available quantities of mercury by cutting the relative supply and demand , to resolve the long-term problem of limiting surpluses and stocks of mercury in products which are still in use or have been stored in recent years , to protect against mercury exposure , to improve understanding of the problems caused by mercury and its unavoidable uses and to support and promote international action to address the question of mercury .
At the strategy preparation stage , the Commission paid particular attention to identifying the most important aspects of the mercury problem which continue to exist and the sectors in which it would be possible for further action to be taken on the part of the European Union .
I should also like to emphasise the importance which joint international action has , of course , with the initiatives being taken at European Union level .
We are of the view that a ban on mercury exports from European Union countries should be brought into force by no later than 2008 and not 2010 , as supported by the majority in committee .
First of all , allow me to thank all of you for your very constructive comments .
That is a very strong foundation for the adoption of specific new measures to apply the strategy .
Similarly , suitable adaptation is not a problem for small producers , which is why the Commission too has proposed a ban on the use of mercury in these measuring devices .
As regards the question of dental amalgams , the Commission will ask the relevant medical working party to study new measures and will call for the opinion of the scientific committee on the danger to health and the environment .
Thus , a digital divide is appearing between Member States , a digital divide is appearing between regions and , most importantly , a digital divide is even appearing between persons with a small age difference .
This constitutes a major challenge , given that the new institutional framework must : a ) be flexible , so that it can adapt to rapid technological developments and the needs of the market without restricting innovative ideas , b ) protect the development and production of content and safeguard unimpeded access for every citizen to information .
This fact makes me pessimistic and I consider that it is one of the most basic points on which we need to focus .
IKEA opened in Athens and two and a half thousand small shops and handicrafts closed .
Carrefour arrives with 20 000 square metres and all the small shops in the entire region close .
This is the reality .
We have approximately 20 % unemployment in Macedonia , which was once the worksite of the whole of Europe .
That is the problem .
In this sense , preventive measures are needed to protect health and the environment for which the government alone , and not NGOs , are responsible and , of course , adequate resources needed to be provided .
I mean a system based on even stricter rules , on stronger institutions , on more transparent and democratic procedures .
The European Union needs to send a clear message , as you intimated Commissioner , and we are all with you in this message .
To all those who use the better price argument against the imposition of duties , I would counter with the following question : have consumers benefited from the reduction in import prices following liberalisation ?
I agree with all the recommendations and comments which she makes .
Congratulations Mrs Hazan .
It puts an end to fugitives from justice , an end to the complications of the political process to extradite criminal suspects .
Secondly , the Council needs to adopt , as quickly as possible , the proposal to harmonise minimum criteria in criminal proceedings .
It is pan-European .
We also hope that the future human rights service will take on a substantial role in the protection of and respect for human rights and personal freedoms and in the field of the European arrest warrant .     – Mr President , the two basic poles in European cooperation on criminal matters are the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States .
Naturally , despite the fact that progress has been made with the procedure to adapt the European Arrest Warrant , there are still certain difficulties which continue , among other things , with the uniform
