proposal to charge HGVs is an improvement on the current system .
I myself am pleased with Amendment No 50 tabled by Mr Simpson and Mr Swoboda .
Greenhouse gas emissions are mainly attributable to road transport .
In road transport , what one party gains by infringing the law can force another party to do the same in order to remain competitive .
The fact that the working hours directive has been included in the scope of controls is another example of the report overshooting the mark .
While a superficial reading of this will lead one to assume that he will use this sum to reduce EU tax payments , Mr Doorn does not offer a solution to the problem of the EU’s waste of 20 % of its budget annually on prestige projects , on pumping money around rich Member States and fraud .
That is in keeping with the Liberal view that a reduction in emission is too expensive at home and it is therefore preferable for this to be done in countries where this is more cost-effective .
Neither these provisions nor the Commission ’s communication on them make clear whether they also cover a serious failure to act against violations of human rights .
The second point , that is very important to us , concerns the fact that about 80 % to 85 % of all the money is spent by the Member States .
We had three main priorities in our committee .
I ask myself why there is no mention anywhere of the promises made in Gothenburg ?
The cooperation has been excellent and the Secretary-General , together with all his staff , has done a very good job of running the Parliament over the last five years in the face of mounting challenges , not least of which is enlargement .
Parliament has made progress .
People who say that this institution is just a 'gravy train ' are wrong .
This is a beautiful Assembly and an even more beautiful city , but we should not meet here for only four days per week .
It has been built on European institutions and we must give them something in return .
I hope that when we vote tomorrow we will all sign this pledge by voting for the amendments that have been tabled by a number of Groups .
I have two concrete questions .
As far as the role of rapporteur for the agencies that has been given to me is concerned , all I can tell you is that , based on the knowledge I have now , there is no reason to refuse to grant discharges to the agencies .
Finally , we think that the internal audit service of the Commission must pay more attention to what is going on in the agencies .
We are following Mr Bayona in his decision to grant a discharge to the Commission .
We heard from Mr Prodi , when he took up his position as President of the Commission , that there would be political accountability .
After all , if we make every civil servant at the Commission responsible for his or her own area of work , then that should certainly also apply to the Commissioners .     .
The stories of my own grandfather who , as a young newly married man , slaved in the trenches of the IJzer near Ypres in the 1914-1918 war and the stories in our family about what happened to him always made a very strong impression on me .
The Rühle report clearly indicates what measures the Commission and the Court of Auditors will still have to take in the coming months and years .
You ask yourself sometimes : is that so ?
Up to now it was the case that when a new period started , we got practically nothing off the ground in the first year .
We would like to see an evaluation of what has been done in connection with this programme in the accession countries , and that gender budgeting be also applied in all community programmes intended for the accession countries .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , three comments .
He has rightly paid a lot of attention to following up my report on the discharges that were adopted last year .
There needs to be a much more constructive dialogue with the residents of Leopoldswijk .
That is typical of the arrogance and contemptuous attitude of the Commission toward Parliament and the citizens , whose tax revenues this is ultimately about .
The validity of the distribution is open to dispute and the list of indicators in fact give the Member States .
A few days ago we heard for the first time that it is a matter of concern to you how this is organised .
Article 1 states what we have to do .
I have not mentioned the connection between this agreement and CAPS II , but the undertakings to that also state that this agreement will shortly also be linked to the new , advanced CAPS II system in the United States .
At the moment they are not adequately protected .
I do not agree with that .
The Commission has got a number of restrictions through , but the agreement still covers too many data and they are kept for a ridiculously long time .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when I took on the task of being the rapporteur for this report , I was extremely well aware of the fact that it would not be an easy one .
Other recommendations relate to rules on transparency and ownership of the media , especially ownership across borders , and the publishing of information about substantial interests in media .
Many of my colleagues reinforced the attention that I had given to Italy myself even further
