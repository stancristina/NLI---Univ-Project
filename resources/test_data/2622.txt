informed us that it is observing that the possibility of replacing the deteriorating tents and building more solid shelters in neighbouring Ingushetia is being denied .
All of these issues are essential to ensuring that multilateral trade relations lead to economic growth , if we want this growth to be equitable and its benefits also to reach the least-developed countries .
In seeking and prioritising its own interests , however , the West does not behave with justice and equity in its international relations , but rather it generates a new form of anti-democratic autarchy which will end up bringing it into conflict with the rest of the world and will lead to its unsustainable decline .
The European Union keeps meticulous accounts of molluscs and fish , chicks , poultry , cattle or goats ; it bureaucratically identifies animals and vegetables of every type of species , which it analyses exhaustively ; it analyses the chassis of motors , industrial parts and tools , the remoulding of tyres ... it is unacceptable that it cannot count the victims of a war of hardly three weeks ago .
I would therefore like to thank the two rapporteurs and all the Members , who I know have participated very actively throughout the discussions in committee , and to remind them of something that we all know : until 2000 this sector has developed systematically , in the intergovernmental field , by means of Eurocontrol or the International Civil Aviation Authority .
I would like to say to the honourable Members that of course I share your concern , but that there are legal institutional obstacles which prevent us from accepting some of the amendments you have presented , such as , for example , in the case of the report by Mr Fava , Amendments Nos 1 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 and 14 and , in the case of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte , Amendments Nos 13 , 16 , 25 , 29 and 33 .
I believe we must take advantage of this opportunity and proceed pragmatically in this field .
I thank you for your support , and in particular the work of the two rapporteurs , and I hope that in the conciliation stage we can rapidly achieve a positive result which allows us to create the famous Single European Sky before the end of 2004 .
The latest great initiative is precisely the Single European Sky , which facilitates all the actions I referred to earlier , particularly the negotiation with the United States , and also in the field of safety and the European Air Safety Agency , but which furthermore is going to allow us to ensure in the future that this time Europe is not left behind on this issue ; I am referring to the issue of the new definitions and new concepts for the management of air traffic for 2020 , where clearly the possibility of having a single sky , within which we will have integrated , harmonised and common systems , means that Europe will have a critical mass with which to negotiate adequately with the United States , which by means of an equivalent initiative is carrying out work in this sector .
But we cannot allow the Commission to legislate on the basis of decisions by a body like Eurocontrol , which is in no way a Community body , but which is an intergovernmental body which includes a series of countries which do not belong to the European Union .
We are not liberalising anything here .
But when it comes to traffic and air control , none of this is being proposed : neither liberalisation , which makes no sense , nor privatisation .
I am sure of this , ladies and gentlemen , but this is the first step .
In this regard , some of your amendments perhaps facilitate this approach and I hope that in this way we can move forward .
As you know , the objective of reaching conciliation quickly has the full support of the Commission , since the current system ends on 31 December 2003 .
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to say to the Austrian Members that we all understand their problem .
The commitment in relation to European lorries has been fulfilled .
Fortunately , Parliament is not proposing a reduction of this compensation since we believe they are at the minimum level necessary to provide air companies with the incentive to seek volunteers rather than directly preventing passengers from boarding against their will .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Lisi for the work he has done and for having achieved these compromise amendments , which I believe will mean that this conciliation can be completed quickly .
Thanks to this programme we will be able to finance , amongst other things , the first sea motorway projects , which are already under way with agreements between Italy , France and Spain in the western Mediterranean area , and other projects of this nature in the Atlantic area , together with other projects relating to the combination of inland waterways and rail transport and , finally , also of sea and road transport of course .
If , as the Commission points out , with one euro of subsidy 500 tonnes could be transferred , with the EUR 75 million allowed by the Council , 37 500 tonnes per kilometre could be transferred , rather than the 52 250 million tonnes per year by which road transport is expected to increase .
( ES ) Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Vermeer for his work , as well as the rapporteurs for the committees involved , Mr Staes and Mr Harbour , for their efforts to ensure that this proposal could be produced quickly
