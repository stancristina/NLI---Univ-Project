The main problem has to do with the role models presented to men ; those in our own Western society are competitive in nature , which is not absolutely ideal , but those in Muslim ideology go as far as to exemplify hatred of women .
We therefore take the view that what was decided by the Conference of Presidents , what is set out here in the order of business , should stay the way it is .     Mr President , we always listen to you , not only out of respect for your office but also out of regard for you personally .
The question arises of whether we can come back to Mr Cohn-Bendit’s proposal that , in view of the current situation and Mr Solana’s visit to these countries , we could adopt the resolution at the next part-session .
It surely cannot be the case that one institution alone does not discuss it , does not adopt a resolution on it , that the European Parliament , which the people elected to represent them , should choose to keep silent about one of the greatest conflicts Europe has seen .
On that we agree .
The Commission claims to be taking as its basis the report that the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare produced in 2000 , but that is not in fact the case , for this report explicitly states that the occupying density must not exceed 25 kg per square metre if more serious problems for the animals ’ well-being are to be avoided .
The more concrete the Altmark criteria are , the more difficult they are to implement , and the individual public offices cannot be expected to get to grips with the fundamental principle and determine for themselves whether or not aid has been granted on the basis of the avoidance of overcompensation using market compensations ; to do so would involve them in a quite unjustifiable amount of bureaucracy .
It is indeed the case that regional aid is needed for the more backward regions in particular , and it cannot be denied that aid under Article 87 will continue to be needed for those regions currently affected by the statistical effect .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Hökmark , for his outstanding report .
The fact is that eastward enlargement and headlong globalisation have resulted in such competitive pressure that some workers and some industries can no longer cope with it .
Lastly , I will point out that education and research and small and medium-sized businesses need the right sort of financial backup if we are to seize the opportunities in our own back yard and not shrink back from the risks involved .     .
Mr President , after all the discussion of the technical details associated with this directive , I would like to make a general comment .
As regards the regulations on natural radiation , it has to be said that the Commission missed the mark by a long way , for the original proposal for a directive required employers to commission comprehensive assessments of the risks associated with sunlight and bureaucratic action plans to deal with them , which would have involved employers having to provide t-shirts and suncream for workers working outdoors .
It is certainly to be welcomed that a regulation at least covers artificial optical radiation , but one can no doubt categorise the removal from it of natural radiation as one of this House’s less inspired ideas .
This presents us with a unique opportunity to improve Europe’s policy on human rights .
That makes it all the more important that we , while agreeing on common rules for local border traffic , should , as is provided for , allow the Member States to conclude bilateral agreements relating to their implementation .
The intention is that action should be taken on the basis of effective national goals and result in at least a twofold increase across the EU by 2020 .
Just another thing on the subject of the Green Paper , Commissioner : if we are to win Europeans over , there needs to be a chapter in it with the title ‘ ’ That is what the people of Europe expect of us , and you should not fall short of that standard .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , security of energy supply has , over past weeks and months , been the big issue , and there are numerous things that we need if we are to address it .
The slogan ‘think globally and act locally ’ also applies here .
This morning , we were told by the Commissioner that 42 directives have been adopted in the energy field alone , with 22 of them dealing with energy efficiency , and even so , we are not satisfied and claim that we are not moving forward fast enough .
Our primary concern must be with workers and their families rather than with big business and its markets , and we must also spare a thought for small businesses and artisans , who must not be allowed to be trampled underfoot .
We have now come to a tricky corner .
The people of Europe have every right to an internal market in services free from the risk of wage dumping or social dumping .
The freedom to provide services has been , since 1958 , one of the four freedoms that the Founding Fathers enshrined in the Treaty , yet – in contrast to the movement of goods and capital and personal mobility – it has never been anything other than neglected , and the reason why it has been neglected is that it has been in this area that the Member States have been least willing
