this resolution contains a long list of excellent observations and proposals .
That being said , we must , however , state that our arrangements so far have been quite inadequate .
I think it important to emphasise three shortcomings of the resolution .
Secondly , the resolution contains no discussion of the internal states of affairs that prevent people in the developing countries from living in freedom .
We recoil from removing those dictators who destroy people 's living conditions and the structures of their countries .
We want to have clean hands , and we believe that everything can be achieved through diplomacy , but we have to observe - as the resolution does too - that a great many of the countries whose populations suffer hardships quite simply do not have the freedom that is necessary for people to be able to change their situation .
Only the United States is prepared to remove the oppressors by force .
Our civilisation lacks , as it were , the basis for appearing 'worthy of imitation' , because we cannot implement in our own countries the economic and political changes that are a basic condition for changing the trade situation and for our being at all able to improve the disastrous situation the world is in .
I hope that everyone who votes in favour of this otherwise excellent decision today will be consistent and vote against the EU budgets that authorise the agricultural subsidies so damaging to the developing countries .
Mr President , you promised to investigate the matter of the dress code that an Italian MEP attempted to introduce during a hearing in Brussels .
Mr President , I have just been in Uganda where I was made aware of the terrible tragedy that is being played out in the northern part of the country and that is being totally ignored by the international press .
Approximately 800 000 internally displaced persons are living in wretched conditions in refugee camps .
The situation in the refugee camps is now so desperate that many people are attempting to return to their villages only to find that the revolutionaries have burned and destroyed their houses and fields .
A growing number of atrocities committed by the army against the civilian population is also reported every day .
They are saying that , at the Conference of Presidents where we had a video conference with Hans Blix , you said that the latter was warning us against sending a delegation to Iraq .
I think you should have an opportunity to say so , because anyone reading the Danish newspapers would believe otherwise .
The purpose of the directive is to give more content to EU citizenship and to increase people 's freedom of movement within the Community .
In this way , the state of the law would become clearer and less ambiguous .
Clear legislation would , at the same time , mean that it would be easier to overcome many of the practical obstacles to people 's freedom of movement that still exist .
The ELDR Group fully supports the principle of non-discrimination whereby EU citizens from other Member States are , as far as possible , treated according to the same rules as citizens of one 's own country .
We also , however , support the progressive definition of the family incorporated into the proposal .
The intention is , quite basically , to preserve family unity .
It is an important and necessary report .
Only a few common rules and procedures apply in all the Member States , and this means that there is no legal and administrative tool that can contribute to better management of migration flows .
Adoption of the directive would lead to common rules being laid down governing the rights and duties of third-country nationals .
The directive would also ensure that the existing rules were enforced equitably .
What is proposed would give easier access to the labour force , and flexibility and mobility in the European labour market would in that way be increased .
I believe that adoption of this report would entail some clear benefits .
Furthermore , what is proposed would increase the legal rights of this group of self-supporting third country nationals who have entered their countries of residence legally .
Contrary to a previous speaker , I hope that the proposal will be well received by the Council with a view to its being adopted quickly .
That is why it is also an important report that my fellow group member has written , making it apparent to anyone who still needed to be informed , how critical and difficult the situation is and how much is awry in terms of human rights , democracy and so on .
Now , the fact is that my group is confederal in nature , and we do not therefore praise each other as a matter of course , but I am nonetheless able to say , on behalf of the Nordic Green Left , that we fully support what Mr Marset Campos has written in his report .
Our confederal nature also means that the group has come up with amendments with which we do not agree and , like the rapporteur , I do not support these .
It is apparent from this report that many things are required if , as I hope it one day will , Belarus is ever to reach the point at which it can become a member of the EU.
As good democrats , it should be our task to support those activities , inside and outside Belarus , that are aimed at changing how things stand for ordinary people and for the democratic movements .
Basically , we think that the Commission 's proposal is too far-reaching in as much as a Member State would not be able to deport people with permanent residence permits .
