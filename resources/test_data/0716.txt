First , how to advance the matter of the institutional changes which the European Union needs and which the Convention on the Future of Europe has been processing since March 2002 .
Of course , over and above these five entities , the Council will not omit to discuss and take appropriate decisions on a series of other issues .
That is why the issues of the Convention on the Future of Europe are major issues for the Council and the Union in general .
The dialogue can continue , but at some point we must conclude .
We need to make sure , when the time comes , that this common denominator is not a lowest common denominator , is not a change of limited importance , but is a denominator that will guarantee a dynamic course for an enlarged Europe .
The Greek Presidency plans to hold a discussion on the material aspects of this item so that there is an exchange of views , so that a picture of national positions is formed before the Intergovernmental Conference and , of course , so that decisions are taken on procedural issues relating to the subsequent stages of the procedure .
We estimate that , around autumn , this procedure should have been completed , the Intergovernmental Conference should proceed and its work should be completed on time so that the period between the date of enlargement , in May 2004 , and the entry into force of the new institutional framework is as short as possible .
The drafting of a Constitutional Treaty is a quantum qualitative leap which is due in large part to the efforts made in the Convention .
The view that we can achieve better democratic credentials for the Union without creating new institutions or bodies was also broadly accepted .
Over and above the various approaches expressed in plenary at the Convention , it is , I think , important for us to maintain a balance between the Union 's institutions , to safeguard the equality of the Member States , to make further use of the advantages of the Community method and to strengthen the democratic character of a Union of states and peoples .
The EU/USA summit will be held in Washington a few days after the Council .
At the last meeting in Gymnich , we had a very useful discussion .
In this sector , we will need to be in a position to develop a common perception of the new security environment and be able to deal efficiently with new challenges and threats .
Following on from the conclusions of the European Council in Seville , the Presidency also intends to bring a series of issues concerning immigration , asylum and external borders which , as you know , were basic priorities of our Presidency , to the attention of the heads of state during the June Council .
In an effort to formulate a single European policy on the issues of legal immigration and asylum , the Presidency also attached particular importance to the issue of the integration of third country nationals .
At the March Council , we decided to promote the application of a series of policies on employment , innovation , entrepreneurship and other policies .
The fact that the western Balkans have remained high on the Union 's list of priorities despite the adverse climate over recent months is an achievement on the part of the Union and also illustrates the major political importance we attach to the region .
The stability and association process remains the basic element in the Union 's policy in the countries of the Balkans and , in our efforts to support this policy , stock was recently taken in Croatia of what has been achieved under the stability pact , the main objective being to coordinate actions under the pact in order to complement the stability and association process .
The relevant decisions are due to be adopted at the General Affairs Council on 16 June .
The European Parliament will approve these decisions and , in this way , we look forward to marking a crucial point in our relations with the western Balkans , with a text of conclusions not only expressing the political will to support the European prospects of the countries in the region , but also containing an operational outline for this purpose .
Enriching this process with elements of the recent enlargement experience will reinforce the evaluation , reform and control mechanisms on the basis of the 1997 conditionality and the Copenhagen criteria .
Of the operational actions that will be discussed at the summit , particular importance is also being attached to the questions of justice and internal affairs , especially combating organised crime .
The decisions taken by the Thessaloniki Council will also be reflected in the Thessaloniki declaration which is expected to be signed by the interested parties on 21 June .
The ratification procedure for the 10 countries is proceeding smoothly , as is reinforced monitoring of the application of the acquis .
I shall not refer to other matters which will obviously occupy the Council on a running basis .
We shall see how this develops .
I think that this is not the time to transfer American kitsch to the European Union and for us to become even more farcical than we were on the issue of Iraq .
Which precise stance are we following ?
I would even say that guarding external borders would be an important step for the common foreign policy , the security and defence policy , because it is not possible for us to want to adopt a common foreign security and defence policy unless we have adopted common external borders ; we have the opportunity to make a start on illegal immigration by guarding these borders .
There is unanimity here in Parliament that the Commission should
