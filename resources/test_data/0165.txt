The European Parliament ' s part-session for today and tomorrow is an important event for the institutions and Member States of the European Union .
I want to thank the European Parliament for its energetic and persistent work on establishing new and better rules on transparency .
There are different ways of improving transparency in the EU' s institutions , but far and away the best and most effective way is to have generous rules concerning access to documents , combined with open registers .
Parliament ' s resolution from January 1999 described its significance by saying that the trend towards greater transparency and public scrutiny of documents is of fundamental importance if the EU is to be successful in the future , because it helps clarify the EU' s political choices , promotes a more extensive and better balanced input into the political process , reduces the level of corruption and abuse of power and generally promotes a greater acceptance of EU decisions among the people of Europe .
When the treaty concerning Sweden' s , and a number of other countries ' , membership of the EU was signed in Corfu in June 1994 , the European Council stated that the new Member States were at the forefront of open government and public access to documents and it welcomed the further stimulus that the new Member States could provide on these issues .
Sweden has tried to fulfil these hopes , partly by taking the initiative , during the previous intergovernmental conference , to incorporate fundamental rules concerning transparency and public control of documents into the EU Treaties .
It means that people are entitled under the Treaty to be given access to these documents .
Parliament ' s representatives , in particular , have campaigned vigorously and persistently for such rules .
We consequently have an obligation to do everything that can be done to fulfil these expectations .
As standards , the rules with which people have had to be content until now are of low status because they are founded upon the institutions ' internal rules of procedure and have major gaps in them .
Another example of gaps in the current rules is the fact that the list of reasons for secrecy is not exhaustive .
The European Parliament has been demanding this for a long time , and this demand is now met in the new proposal .
The institutions are obliged to give citizens all the help they need in order to acquaint themselves with documents .
This improvement is also a result of the European Parliament ' s initiative .
I am convinced that , in the long term , the new rules will also mean significantly positive changes to the institutions ' administrative culture and to officials ' relationship with the general public .
Rather , our task has been to combine the best in the various Member States ' administrative cultures and historical experience , taking account of the institutions ' own experiences and need for special adjustments .
According to the proposal , the Commission must by 31 January 2004 at the latest - in good time for the next parliamentary election - present a comprehensive report on how the rules on transparency have operated in practice .
Anyone who has followed the dramatic negotiations of the last few weeks knows that the proposal for a Regulation , which has come about through the way in which all the institutions concerned have accepted responsibility , is balanced on a knife-edge .
The very fact that the institutions managed to agree about an issue on which it was uniquely difficult to negotiate but which was crucial to public confidence in the EU - and to have done so within the period promised in the Treaty of Amsterdam - provides hope for the future , in my opinion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen and all those who have participated in this process , the European Parliament is about to vote on the proposal for a Regulation concerning public access to documents of the EU institutions .
Obviously , there are exceptions to this main rule , just as there are from the Swedish principle of public access to official records , but the number of exceptions has been significantly reduced in comparison with the original proposal and is now limited to what is absolutely necessary to protect mainly military and security interests , commercial secrets and information about the private lives of individuals .
To make things easier for the general public , there must be a register listing all documents , and both the register and the documents must , as far as possible , be available on the Internet .
To vote against the proposal because 100 per cent of what was desired has not been achieved would be frivolous .
The result that has been achieved has been presented as a victory for the Swedish Presidency and , because transparency has been a key issue for the Swedish Government , it would have been a clear failure on the Government ' s part if it had had to hand it as a gift to the forthcoming Presidency .
How much control would the public have exercised then ?
I want to conclude by extending heartfelt gratitude to Mr Cashman , Mrs Maij-Weggen , Mr Watson , Mrs Hautala and Mrs Malmstr√∂m , as well as to Commissioner Barnier , who has made a major contribution in the Commission , and , finally , to the committee secretariat .
The answer is no .
Even though discussions have taken place , the procedure is not especially open .
I really cannot understand those who say that it is a retrograde step .
Is it not progress that all incoming documents are now to be made public , as is not of course the case at present ?
The answer
