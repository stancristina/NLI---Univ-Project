However we can see that the opposite is happening .
On more specific issues , Mr President , I think that we were right to set out again all the amendments to the first reading and especially those which referred to better fund management , such as the preservation of the reserves at Meda , and other such amendments .
I hope that in the next trialogue - and I address myself both to the Council and to the Commission - we will be able to obtain a logical solution so as to remove the inconsistencies from the budget on the issue of legal bases .
I believe that the picture painted by the budget is a little paradoxical , since we have been obliged to accept to be blackmailed by the Council in respect of the structural funds .
Because , if it is telling the truth , then why did the Commission accept the reduction of ECU 550 million which , unfortunately , was also voted through by Parliament ?
It is what an unemployed person would spend on a pizza and a beer , and that is what we have given him , for being unemployed !
A vote for those amendments in the House next Thursday will open the way to the implementation of the Philoxenia programme , at least in so far as small and medium-sized tourist enterprises are concerned .
I am optimistic that , by approving the few things accorded to tourism with the amendment we have tabled , Parliament will give hope to the 10 million people employed in the tourist industry and , of course , give a kind of signal .
By so doing we will be responding to thousands of millions of people working in this sector .
Of course European society takes an interest in the competitiveness of its products in the face of other world powers .
However , a big problem that has arisen concerning modern technology is the tremendous distance between it and a society which is confused and incapable of facing up to this technology and which still has deep moral problems in its regard .
I think that this gulf should be bridged .
The big question for me is : after the Luxembourg session comes to an end what will happen and how will our achievements be maintained ?
I think that the European Union must maintain a cool-headed , unequivocal and unshakeable position , especially when it is faced with provocative actions such as those of Minister Tselembi when he says that they will boycott European businesses , with the exception however of the United Kingdom , which will hold the presidency , France and Italy .
The first hope is that Turkey , despite its negative behaviour all these years and its peevish reaction to yesterday 's decisions of the 15 Member States , will realise that nobody is denying its position in Europe and that it is its own activities and oversights that , since 1963 , have prevented the upgrading of its relations .
The second area is the preparation of Europe for its participation in the fresh round of negotiations for the new GATT , which begins in 1999 .
Fourthly , the Middle East .
European policy in the Balkans cannot and must not be restricted to the enormous effort that is being made for reconstruction .
It is a reply within his terms of reference .
Does he not think that they should be supported throughout Europe ?
Mr Juncker , indeed you are right since the question was tabled before the Luxembourg session , and is therefore somewhat out-of-date .
As for my basic question , thank you , it has been covered .
Mr Jov√© Peres ' report acknowledges this and I thank the rapporteur for that .
However , we must also bear in mind that all the regions of olive tree cultivation are objective 1 regions , that is , structurally weak and with a high level of unemployment , and that olive oil production makes a significant contribution to their socio-economic development .
I believe that the proposal for reform of the common organization of the market provides a very good foundation .
Secondly , a radical change in the system towards aid per tree would create many problems .
However the main objective of the systems of support is to preserve the balance of the market and to maintain the level of income of the producers .
Fifthly , granted the leading role of the European Union in global production and the high nutritional value of olive oil , a policy to promote European olive oil must be formulated and sustained by means of specific measures and by the authenticity of the product .
Madam President , much has been said thus far but I , in turn , would like congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
In Greece , for example , we are talking about 710 thousand families , not just workers .
Also it must be stressed that keeping the same model of support for olive oil in production must not , with respect to time , be associated directly with marketable quantity but with actual production .
Is it only with respect to oil that irregularities have been shown to occur ?
In other words we must not move towards subsidy per tree since , in reality , by so doing we are equating those who produce with those who do not produce , and at the same time olive producers will cease to carry on intensive olive cultivation .
At the same time we need promotion of olive oil worldwide , since its positive effects on health are well known and , Madam President , we need to proceed to the abolition of support for consumption and to the utilization of money that is left in reserve for production premiums and for the promotion of olive
