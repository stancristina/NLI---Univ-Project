Today , the sixth environmental action programme includes this specific aspect , in other words environment , health and quality of life , while the first Community action programme in the public health sector , which we adopted in 2002 and for which I had the honour of acting as rapporteur , includes promoting the recording , analysis and evaluation of the determining factors of health which are linked to the environment .
Of course , particular attention must also be paid to the most vulnerable groups of the population : children , the elderly , pregnant women and people with a serious medical history .
Only by constantly developing scientific knowledge and research into the aspects of certain diseases with environmental parameters shall we be able to develop efficiently the Union strategy and action to protect human health .
In the fifteen Member States , 60 000 deaths a year are due to long-term exposure to suspended particles . 10 % of children in western Europe have asthma , ten times more than in eastern Europe , due to the different environment .
The Scale initiative , with incremental application in cycles , is based on scientific research to obtain the necessary information , focuses on children as the most vulnerable group , helps to raise awareness of the fact that the deterioration in the environment is harmful to everyone 's health , especially children 's , uses the legal instruments provided by the Treaty to take the relevant action and , finally , makes provision for permanent and constant evaluation to ensure that action is efficient .
In its conclusions , however , the resolution , instead of proposing a ban on any transmission of personal data , considers that there is a legislative gap and proposes that an agreement be concluded with the USA simply with less data , a shorter storage period and the right of persons whose data is on file to take action to correct information in their files .
For these reasons , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote .     .
This report required particular attention in order to be balanced and adequately substantiated , so that the initiative of the European Parliament for a recommendation to the Council would be duly considered by it and would represent the views and demands of all sides in an exemplary manner .
I thank my honourable friends for their help in this direction .
Secondly , the return of refugees and displaced persons .
Good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation are on the right path and the report emphasises that this is a key precondition for the development of democracy in Croatia itself , as well as an example for the safeguarding of peace , stability and economic development in the area as a whole .
Fifthly , the tripartite dialogue between Croatia , Italy and Slovenia must continue in the good spirit which surrounds it today so that all the differences and outstanding issues can be settled .
The progress made by Croatia with the operation of the free market is recognised and note is made of the achievements of Croatia , both in the year on year increase in gross national product over recent years and in the reduction in the level of inflation , which is close to the European Union average .
At the recent European Council , discussions and decisions unfortunately focused on the after-effects and failed to address the essence and causes of the new situation created by the war against democracy , as President Pat Cox called terrorism .
While all this is happening on the terrorist front , another terrible crime being committed on a daily basis against thousands of women and children in the form of a modern slave trade has recently been added to our political agenda .
All forms of violence , especially domestic violence , and the lack of legal and psychological support mechanisms for victims are still a specific problem .
At the same time , a direct increase is needed in spending on health care , which is at unacceptably low levels , thereby obstructing the right of women to access health services .
The thirteenth hearing , a procedure which started approximately one year ago under pressure from the European Union , will be held in Ankara tomorrow .
That is not our idea .
Nor is Turkey 's stance in Cyprus encouraging and I greatly fear that neither the Secretary General 's plan nor the stance of the European Commission are encouraging , because they cannot accept a massive military presence , which is equivalent to the military occupation of part of Cyprus , 18 years after the entry of Cyprus to the European Union , and probably even after the admittance of Turkey to the European Union .
As far as Turkey 's progress towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria is concerned , on paper , yes !
The reform needs to reach the depths of the Ministry of Education first .
The rector of the University of Istanbul is standing up and talking about 135 000 dead in order to occupy both Cyprus and Greece .
It was posited by the president of Turkish industry two years ago that Turkey will either become Europe or will become Pakistan .
However , these findings are a surprise , given that it is not the first time that the Turkish government of the day has expressed such intentions , which are blatantly refuted in daily practice .
The Dehap is threatened with a new ban , while its leaders are being tried and defenders of human rights are being persecuted and murdered .
On the contrary , it supports the Annan plan which , in essence , tramples over the UN resolutions and international law in general , legalising the results of the invasion and occupation .
Apart from strengthening mechanisms for prosecuting ,
