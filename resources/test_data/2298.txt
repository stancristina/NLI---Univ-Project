We are therefore proposing that lobbyists must be obliged to disclose the same information on expenses for an individual member that that individual member is obliged to disclose in his or her financial declaration .
Mr President , I would like to start by saying that there is not only reason to praise Mr Nassauer 's tie .
The decision that we are now taking is an extremely important one .
This is therefore the problem that we are now seeking to resolve through this major step forward .
I am also very happy to note that we now have some definitions of what such breaches consist of .
In the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , we have been very concerned about ensuring that habitat areas in particular are protected , and we are pleased that this has been included .
We would also like to have had more details on how tough the penalties should be .
This was unfortunately not possible on the basis of the current treaties , but overall we are very pleased about the result .
Mr President , the Parliament 's budget is not adopted until October , but with Mr Lewandowski 's report we are in principle supporting the proposed budget for 2009 adopted by the Bureau in April , and in particular the dialogue on the details of the proposal , which is being carried out as a pilot project this year .
It means that the budget will be reviewed in detail by those who are politically responsible , and that the Committee on Budgets is properly involved .
The dialogue has focused very strongly on the staff requirements in connection with Parliament 's new tasks arising from the Treaty of Lisbon , not least the matter of ensuring that needs are met through possible reshuffles before we start talking about increasing the number of staff .
We have also agreed to prepare a long-term strategic plan for buildings and their maintenance before the end of this month .
The asbestos case shows that details are of interest .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe thus supports the proposal put forward by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to put the money in reserve .
Last , but not least , I would also like to underline the need for us to adopt a regime for the assistants , as discussed with Parliament 's Secretary-General , Harald RÃ¸mer .
It must not go wrong this time .
Mr President , it is a pleasure to take the floor for the first time and within an area of responsibility in which I look forward to working .
However , I fear that , bit by bit , this legislation will simply amount to patching things up .
I believe that today 's debate reflects this .
It is vital that we secure the consumer 's right to complain in their own country and in their own language , and it is vital that food products and other goods that could constitute a health risk can be subject to checks in the event of import into the individual countries .
The EU 's consumer health strategy must be based on the principle of caution instead of an ideological school of thought that merely serves to allow all goods to move completely freely across borders .
Madam President , attempts to get the shipping industry away from the old-fashioned notion that the sea wipes away all tracks have so far failed .
No, the sea remembers as well as the soil and the air , as well as plants and animals and the human body , and the shipping industry 's contribution to pollution remains enormous .
Imagine if we could get the major shipping nations to make the IMO an active player in the battle to save the global environment instead of using the IMO to put the brakes on good initiatives , as is currently the case .
We already have aviation included .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , support Amendment 1 to have the Maritime Emission Trading Scheme included in the report .
I am glad that today we can put women and research high up on the agenda , as I believe that it is a pivotal issue for Europe with regard to fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy .
In each of these three tasks , women are an essential part of the solution .
If we in Europe are to create up to 700 000 research positions in the coming years , we must also become better at utilising our female talent base .
Firstly , I wanted to set out the status of the current situation .
What is the proportion of women in research and why are things so bad ?
Secondly , I wanted to look ahead and come up with solutions and suggestions as to how we can improve this situation .
Women comprise an average of just 35 % of researchers working in the public sector and 18 % of researchers working in the private sector .
We can therefore see a marked distortion in relation to the representation of women in decision-making and managerial positions .
Just 5 of the 22 members of this research council are women .
I would like to say a little more about the second , and perhaps more interesting , part of my report , namely the forward-looking solutions and proposals .
If this problem area is ignored at both national and institutional level , nothing will happen .
I believe that this is absolutely essential .
If we are to change the situation , we must ensure that there are more women in decision-making bodies , so that efforts can be made from the top down to create a new culture .
I have also called for more open recruitment procedures .
I have also made it clear in my report that
