.
The EU is in that way preventing countries that wish and are able to take the lead from doing so , and that is unacceptable .
It is particularly good that the ban on hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH) ,including lindane , is included in the proposal .
It is a proposal that is now being attacked quite vigorously , but we need to find out what these chemicals entail , even when , as is the case with many chemicals , they exist in relatively modest quantities .
We have succeeded in reaching an agreement with the Irish Presidency on this regulation and on the implementation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants .
As others have also said , it is important for the regulation now to be implemented as soon as possible , because persistent organic pollutants are in the rogues ’ gallery of dangerous chemical substances .
We must therefore go further and , in a number of cases , much further than is indicated both by the Stockholm Convention and by the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution .
In this area , the precautionary principle must apply fully , meaning too that new substances must be included on the list for banning or controlling these substances .
The whole of chemicals legislation is , of course , designed to do just that .
It will soon have been going on for as long as the Second World War did .
There must be an end to so-called mopping-up operations , which amount to nothing other than robbery and kidnappings , and Russian soldiers who do violence to the civilian population must be brought before the courts .
President Putin announced the departure of the Russian Government a few days ago .
It is unacceptable to the EU that , prior to enlargement , Russia has not approved agreements drawn up with Estonia and Latvia on the delineation of borders .
It is also unacceptable for Russia to oppose an extension to the partnership agreements .
The greatest risk of an environmental disaster that might also hit the EU area is presented by the outmoded and oldest nuclear power stations of what is termed the Chernobyl type .
EU cooperation with Russia on upgrading the safety of nuclear power must become more effective .
Democracy appears to be in retreat , instead of the reverse being the case , and the presidential election resembles more and more a farcical one-man show .
We wish , are able and ought to play our part , but such a partnership is not unconditional and cannot be dictated by Moscow .
We are all aware that democracy has not secured a foothold in Russia and that a climate of fear has been created in which people who express independent political views in relation to President Putin are exposed to threats .
At present , the prosecuting authorities have no independence from the executive .
Russia has a special responsibility for developments in Belarus , a new neighbour of the enlarged EU , which can scarcely be described as a democracy but , rather , as a country under the authoritarian control of President Alexander Lukashenko .
Violent conflicts have taken place in Ajaria between supporters and opponents of the province’s leader , Abashidze .
These and many more things have happened in recent days in our European sister countries , Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
At the European Parliament’s urgent request , a special representative was finally appointed in 2003 .
In the South Caucasus , there are three countries that believe in the EU ideal and that want the EU to play the main role as peace broker and provider of aid .
My report contains a large number of proposals as to what the EU should do politically , economically and in terms of peace .
It is also a question of helping the South Caucasus escape from the nuclear power trap , of developing renewable forms of energy and of ensuring that oil assets are handled in accordance with international environmental rules .
If we were to approve this and delete the reference to our own 1987 decision in connection with the deaths of countless Armenians in 1915 , the balance of the report would shift in favour of the one side .
Parliamentary elections are to be held in Georgia on 28 March 2004 .
Not enough is being done , and measures are required , perhaps a lowering of the barrier , if Georgia is not to become the odd phenomenon of the world’s first democratic one-party state .
I entirely share his view that it is in the interests of Europe and the EU to associate the region more closely with Europe .
In response to direct questions on electoral fraud that had by then already taken place , he flatly denied any such occurrences and referred to his own , and Azerbaijan’s , role in the Council of Europe .
A humanitarian disaster is taking place in the refugee camps , in which those driven out of Nagorno-Karabakh live in extreme poverty .
I therefore propose that recital  F should be worded as follows :     I have voted against the report , which was however approved by 334 votes , with 72 votes against and 42 abstentions .
All historical experience shows that a new level of taxation is there to stay and leads in time to a heavier tax burden .
In the case of Sweden , which now already has the world’s heaviest tax burden , it would be additionally onerous .     In 2003 , the Commission was forced , for the third year in succession , to revise its economic forecasts downwards .
It is absolutely crucial to people’s confidence in the regulations that the criteria should be clear , measurable and objective .
