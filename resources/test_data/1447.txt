I come from an area between Denmark and Germany where there have been war and conflict for donkey’s years and where , by granting reciprocal rights , respecting national minorities and having the border determined by referenda , a situation was achieved in which old enemies became friends .
I have experienced this process in Northern Ireland .
On subsequent occasions , it was a peaceful Northern Ireland that we visited .
I hope that peace will also finally be established in Spain and the Basque country .     Mr President , the Commission has broken a clear pledge to present a full annual programme , setting out all proposed legislation and its legal bases .
We have not been given precise information about the legal bases , so we cannot see whether the Commission is proposing voluntary coordination or binding rules .
Does the Commission want more power , centralism and Byzantine regulation , or does it want to inspire the Member States to pull together in the interests of job creation and to encourage countries to compete in doing things as best they can ?
The Commission must be open with people .
Let us see what is behind the advice .
Tell us how you use taxpayers ’ money .
Give the EU’s auditors , the ombudsman and the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control full access to investigate all expenditure .
Show some confidence in people .
May I also thank the President for quoting Montesquieu .
It seems to me that Machiavelli was more of an inspiration than Montesquieu when the Commission ’s powers were designed .     Mr President , the world faces huge challenges : poverty , climate change , serious diseases and armed conflicts .
We must substantially increase the EU’s overall aid to the world 's poorest people so that we can honour our pledges .
Development aid is all well and good , but other things , such as fair trade , are still more important .
It is , then , for the sake of our common future that we must honour the pledges we have given .     Mr President , the purpose of the Cotonou Agreement and the Economic Partnership Agreements is to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development .
That objective must under no circumstances go by the board .
The mentality or idea of reciprocity , based on a principle of equality , is therefore quite wrong .
That is something I am absolutely certain Mrs Morgantini agrees with me about .
The ACP countries also have extremely weak economies .
That is a view also expressed in Mrs Morgantini’s report .
It would be very unfortunate if we were entitled to prevent the ACP countries from selling us textiles and agricultural products just because we had not been skilful enough to adapt to the changed conditions of competition in a globalised world .
That being said , protecting markets is a very uncertain way of achieving growth and a healthy economy , and it should therefore be a limited , including time-limited , measure for developing countries too .     Mr President , I have voted against the report and , together with 22 other Members of the last Parliament , I tried in vain to take legal proceedings against the notion of taxpayers contributing to European political parties .
There is nothing that can be voted on , there is nothing of which to become a member and there is nothing over which to obtain influence .
The exception , curiously enough , is the EU Democrats , the new alliance for European parties and movements founded by critics of the EU.
It is possible to log onto our home page , EUDemocrats .org and , in that way , join right off the street , free of charge , and be informed , as well as take part in the various events .
These will never be able to achieve the status of European parties and obtain funding for activities that may be identical in every respect to the activities for which the larger political parties - in many cases the smaller groups ’ competitors - obtain funding from EU coffers .
Moreover , it is something that we cannot even have tested in the EU 's supreme court .
What is more , the decision-makers are themselves members of the political parties that now take money from voters who vote for their political competitors in connection with decisions from which those competitors are excluded .
None of the decision-makers perceives any problem in relation to competence .
My group wants to see the regulation abolished or at least modified so that everyone is placed on an equal footing when they , for example , carry out a cross-border activity for the purpose of disseminating information .
That is indefensible .
It is clearly unlawful discrimination , and there should be equality for Loki as well as for Thor , as we say in Denmark .     Madam President , you must forgive my infringing the basic rules .
I merely wish to take the liberty of protesting against our having this debate .
Suddenly to agree at a few hours ’ or minutes ’ notice to debate a very important subject is clearly in breach of the Rules of Procedure .
This is not a subject that can be debated at short notice .
That is the way things are here in the European Parliament , and it is something from which the other institutions can learn .
Why cannot the corresponding deliberations in the Council’s 300 half-secret working parties be opened ?
Why will the Commission not say who are involved in the 3 000 secret working parties ?
No other proposals gathered so much support : all the elected representatives in the national parliaments , all but one of the Members of the European Parliament and 23 out of 28
