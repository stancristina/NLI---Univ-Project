.
These are the questions to which we would like answers . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PT ) Trafficking in human beings is a modern version of slavery .
Fighting the trafficking in human beings is therefore one of the major priorities at both Community and international level .
There needs to be a legal platform acting as a basis for stepping up international cooperation , and I am appalled that it has taken such a long time to ratify and implement various international instruments , such as UN conventions .
That means being strict with those who provide work , strict with those who arrive , strict with those who stay and , above all , strict and rigorous in enforcing the law .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , innovation and knowledge are now enshrined as a pillar of development for the European Union .
I should like to end by voicing an appeal : researchers , who are the heart and soul of the Seventh Framework Programme , should not be limited to a mere minute in this Programme , which is all that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been given in this debate .
The market value of pyrotechnic articles used in the car industry is some EUR 5.5 billion , whereas that of fireworks is about EUR 1.4 billion .
In view of the volume of pyrotechnic products imported into Europe , especially from China , we have also decided to attribute clear responsibilities to importers and distributors of pyrotechnic articles ; this is especially important in the case of fireworks .
In addition , we must not forget the work and the follow-up done by Mrs Weisgerber , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , Mrs Fourtou , on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , Mrs RÃ¼hle , on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , and Mr Brie , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left .
We commend the rapporteur Mrs Lynne on her work and wish to underline the importance of the recommendations contained in her report , to which we contributed some proposals .
It is an important agreement for tuna fishing industry and grants fishing licences for the seven Portuguese surface longliners .
It is becoming increasingly clear that the true motive behind the creation of the EU 's Fundamental Rights Agency is to boost EU interventionism in third countries .
It has reverted to type by placing the accent on privatisation , on tenders and public contracts - thereby boosting the development of the private sector - and on more flexible labour laws .
Some positive results , however , have emerged from the negotiations between the Council and Parliament , which have just been debated and put to a final vote , of which I should like to highlight the increase in funds for SMEs and the prevention of work-related accidents .
The compromise reached to include fisheries as one of the main themes of the Seventh Framework Programme represents an important step towards preserving marine ecosystems and defending the Community 's fisheries sector .
One of the reasons for the lack of more substantial progress is institutional ; keeping many decisions under the third pillar and the unanimity requirement make adopting the necessary measures more difficult .
We therefore voted against the report .
The report adopted today refers to the different areas in which the actions of the Member States could be improved .
I am therefore in favour of specific actions at both EU and national level aimed at targeting support to services encouraging the integration into society , education , vocational training and the labour market of people with disabilities .
Lastly , it sets great store by private-public partnerships , which , as a rule , are a way of handing on a plate to the private sector important areas that , given their social nature , belong in the public domain .
These are shocking figures , which lead , on the one hand , to personal suffering and tragedy , and , on the other , to social and budgetary costs .
The risk of injury is not spread equally across all Member States or all social groups .
Firstly , the number of categories of risk of contracting BSE is reduced from five to three , in line with World Organisation for Animal Health recommendations .
The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs thus support the Roth-Berendt report .
Lastly , this proposal for a regulation provides for a more flexible approach , enabling sampling techniques to be used to estimate total landings .
Universal access to information gives the poorest people quicker access to solutions to day-to-day problems .
Promoting development is , mutatis mutandis , equally as important in the EU 's external policy as promoting human rights and democracy .
Yet not everyone in Parliament , and in other Community institutions , will share the same views on which human rights have been violated and on where there is and is not democracy .
We therefore welcome the focus on the causes of these injuries , on the circumstances in which they occur and on why , when and where they occur .
Accident and injury comes at a very heavy human price - premature death , years living with incapacity - and entails high costs in terms of healthcare and loss to society owing to lack of productivity .
By not allowing the use of the Fund when companies are restructuring and relocating within the EU , we are preventing the workers in well-known cases such as that of Opel in Azambuja , which is to relocate to Spain , from receiving support
