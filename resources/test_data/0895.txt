Could the President confirm that the study which has been carried out would , even at this late stage , look at fisheries in isolation rather than look at fisheries in the global sense ?
When I speak to small - and medium-sized enterprises , they are certainly pleased about the mood music that is coming out of the Council , but frankly they are a little sceptical as to whether the Charter will do anything constructive for them .
They think it is just another piece of paper saying how wonderful they are .
Can the President-in-Office tell us if this Charter will envisage new Community instruments being created to help small - and medium-sized enterprises .
For example , funds to help them with training , education , adaptation of premises or the use of new technology .
If so , can he also indicate that they will be as free as possible from bureaucracy because the other complaint one gets from small - and medium-sized enterprises is that the funds which already exist at European level are almost unobtainable because of the hoops that they have to jump through in order to obtain them .
Question No 18 by (H-0392/00 ) : Subject : Burma What further measures will the Council consider taking if existing measures appear to be inadequate and if the second EU Troika mission meets with no greater success than the first , when the common position on Burma comes up for another renewal in October ?
President-in-Office , thank you for the answer .
I am , of course , very happy that the new common position has been established by the Council and that it has strengthened the position as compared with the past .
I prefer to use the name Burma rather than Myanmar since the people of Burma and now Aung San Suu Kyi , the legitimate leader in Burma , do not refer to it as Myanmar .
I should prefer it if Parliament avoided the term Myanmar also .
I have to say to the President-in-Office that the net impact of the various measures the European Union has imposed since 1996 has been very limited : the Burmese have not entered into dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic forces in Burma remain as outside the whole process as ever .
Whilst I express my support , one thing still puzzles me .
Whilst we take these measures , there is no progress on the pressure that some of us in Parliament have been trying to exert on the Council in relation to the need for sanctions - sanctions , of course , which Aung San Suu Kyi has consistently called for .
Related to that , we continue to oppose the Massachusetts Federal laws which impose very effective sanctions on Burma .
We are waiting for the US to decide against these Federal laws .
Will that remain the case ?
If the US decides in favour of Massachusetts , will the European Union then reintroduce our opposition in the World Trade Organisation to these measures taken in Massachusetts ?
Mr President , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , I wish to congratulate Mr Paasilinna on his report , which we very much welcome .
He has drawn up not only a very concise but also a very hard-hitting report .
It is entirely appropriate as a response to the telecommunications communication from the Commission and exactly what we needed to give us a basis on which to move into our further consideration of the whole electronic communications package , which we shall be debating again in a month 's time .
I want to focus on some of the key points highlighted in the report .
I am going to leave issues on radio spectrum policy to my colleague , Mrs Niebler , who will be responding on behalf of our Group to Mr Alyssandrakis ' report .
Just to move forward on some of the issues related to opening up the market .
The first and most encouraging thing from our point of view is that we now see the wisdom of opening the telecommunications market .
To have an open competitive regime has now become the accepted wisdom .
It is something that is fully accepted and we now need to translate that and move that forward as quickly as possible , towards further deregulation and even quicker opening of those markets that still work imperfectly .
There is a tremendous amount of detailed analysis in this report and it clearly shows the consumer benefits in price reductions , choice and increased services that have flowed from deregulation .
However , it also clearly shows that there are far too many barriers , and the Commission has our full support in tackling them .
For consumers to benefit from this choice , they have to be encouraged to shop around , to compare in many cases what can be quite complex offers of prices and contract terms and service packages .
We would like to encourage independent regulators to work together to provide simple , impartial price comparisons for consumers and use the sort of new tools they have available , like the Internet , to give consumers the ability to calculate the real cost of their calls .
We encourage the regulators to share best practice with each other to provide a unified price and contract comparison system .
We will not have a developed market unless we have investment .
The other issue we have to address is the ability of investors to make satisfactory returns on their investment .
Therefore , in looking at the market-opening regulations , we have to look at methods of competition and encourage competition between the different parts and elements of the platforms .
That is something we shall address in the next communication .
We welcome this report , which is really
