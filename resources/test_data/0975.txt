Against this backdrop , this report highlights the effects on growth , employment and macroeconomic stability of public finances and calls on the Commission and the Member States to work together to take measures to reverse the slow growth of the European economy and to pave the way for the smooth functioning of the single currency .
Parliament is today calling for all European political institutions to play their part in this master plan of spreading the sacred principles of humanity and the rule of law around the world .
The death penalty , and even the exploitation of work that leads to company relocations , to give two very different examples , can only be combated with a tough concerted rights policy .
I feel , in any event , that the major issue here is that the proposal before us falls short of what was put forward last year and of the limit imposed on us by the financial perspective .
Otherwise we may to some degree warp the concept of solidarity and of balanced , harmonious development of the territory – concepts that lie at the heart of cohesion policy .
I have worked on this report for some six or seven months and , having spent that time listening to many MEPs , specialists , economic agents , local , regional and national authorities and the communities affected , I found the experience highly rewarding .
Firstly , agriculture and forestry are activities that are closely bound up with the natural world and are therefore at the mercy of climatic phenomena , and exposed to bio-sanitary risks resulting from air , water and ground pollution and from increasing globalisation .
The Solidarity Fund will need to be broader in scope and more flexible , to cover disasters that unfold over time , such as drought , which is currently not included .
In our own countries too – at least this was the case in Portugal – we held public hearings to gather suggestions , information and proposals put forward by the various stakeholders .
This is one of the major problems of our times . 2005 began with the world in shock at the scale of the tragedy caused by the Asian tsunami .
In order to prevent the worst case scenario , serious measures must immediately be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to honour the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol .
It is crucial to encourage the citizens to help prevent these disasters , by reducing greenhouse emissions , as I have said before , by protecting the forests and by not building in high-risk areas .
Parliament must address the natural disasters that have lain waste to Europe in recent years – drought , forest fires and floods – in terms of their impact on agricultural activity .
At a time when climate change is already being felt and when the vulnerability of farmers in the face of such dangers is becoming increasingly apparent , I feel that it is vitally important to draw up a Community strategy to combat natural disasters .
This was particularly serious in the Algarve region , where the climatic conditions were exceptional – a combination of high temperatures and the dryness of the air .
There must also be increased prevention and a rapid response preparedness instrument for emergency situations .
It is also crucial to enhance information and awareness raising among the communities and regions that are vulnerable to natural disasters , so as to reduce the risks and the impact of those disasters and so that the people know what they can do to preserve the natural resources in the region .
Let me say that this is a view voiced in the opinion delivered by the Economic and Social Committee , which deems it necessary to continue to address disasters with a serious regional impact .
In other words , we believe that priority should be attached to natural disasters .
In other words , I believe that a better and more effective Union requires better policies and more resources , with a view to sustainable development , which will in turn contribute towards economic and territorial cohesion , the primary objective of cohesion policy , as enshrined in the Treaties .
The idea of grouping resources and guidelines aimed at developing countries , countries in transition and industrialised countries into one single instrument , and the subsequent regulation thereof in accordance with their geopolitical and economic ‘roles’ , is one that we find alarming .
The set of general priorities and principles being established gives us the greatest concern with regard to the set of ‘simplified regulations ’ to follow .     .
Furthermore , international cooperation is not an exercise in competition between possible world powers .
This amendment was a waste of time in terms of the objective of recovering the economic , social and territorial cohesion of the affected areas , with the support of this instrument .
I abstained from the vote on the EU Solidarity Fund because I believe that the review of this instrument fell well short of what is urgently required if we are to address natural disasters that occur without prior warning and that have devastated Union territory .
This report contains some points with which we agree – such as the need to safeguard the fundamental rights of the Sahrawi people and to ensure a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Western Sahara based on the Sahrawi people’s right to self-determination , in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , especially Resolution 1495 .
Let us face facts – the picture is on the whole a positive one .
This report concerns the budgetary guidelines for 2007 , the first of the financial framework 2007-2013 , and is hindered by the most worrying aspects of the agreement on the financial perspective .
First and foremost , the glaring
