But when it came to implementing the directive in national law , things turned out very differently .
The groups within this Parliament , having undertaken serious preparation , have something to say about the simplification of the recognition of professional qualifications in the European Union .
Let me give you an example : it was rather ridiculous that the German Federal Land of Bavaria , following the fall of the Iron Curtain , did not want to recognize the DDR Abitur .
And what have we got in front of us ?
From the German viewpoint in particular , I am naturally pleased that the report shows no tendency to move towards wholesale recognition , but merely regulates procedures and time limits for the purposes of comparing individual cases .
This endeavour is an essential ingredient in moving towards European integration , because making cross-border mobility possible , and practising it in the field of general vocational training and also in the exercising of professional activities is of fundamental importance for the creation of a European consciousness and a Europe of citizens , and it is no less important for the prosperity of the European economy .
I believe that the European Community in particular must set an example by implementing what we are always discussing here concerning the equal treatment of men and women in all areas of our Community .
And a family does not mean having a marriage certificate .
Liberalization must ensure that those with special needs - the elderly , the handicapped , people on low incomes and those living in geographically remote areas - receive that minimum service at an acceptable price .
In this connection I would like to thank Mrs Read very specifically for having repeatedly stressed the cohesion of this whole voice telephony sector , as compared with the Commission 's piecemeal strategy .
Our subject today is first , if you like , the fundamental question of the various policies and secondly a subject involving very practical conclusions .
Now let us go back to the question of the 'universal service ' .
Of course there are certain kinds of disablement that require technological solutions , that is true enough .
And , here again , there will in future be competition between networks , and we will still have to deal with Mr Hoppenstedt 's report .
If we require it to bear the additional burden of the social policy , we will be hounding more and more jobs out of Europe .
That is how things stand today .
The European Commission 's communication on space travel of December 1996 clearly illustrates how important the promotion of applications and markets in satellite communications is for the purposes of improving Europe 's competitiveness .
The WTO Conference has been mentioned several times previously .
I only hope that this failing will not have a seriously disadvantageous effect on Europe in the global race for access to satellite communications services .
That is the task in store for us .
TEN telecom consolidation got off to a rather laborious start , but I hope we shall be reaching a compromise very shortly .
I could make an alternative suggestion : we can make ourselves a kind of board game and roll some dice .
How that can be achieved is something on which opinions still differ .
Mr Wolf is right , however , in saying that a more general framework legislation is needed for two reasons .
We must at least define the place where individual regulations are going to have to follow .
Of course , one can and must have a frequency .
That , Mr President , is what needs saying about Mr Hoppenstedt 's report .
So that alternative method of access may be available , but we will also ensure that you have direct access to it .
It was probably an avoidable misunderstanding , but such misunderstandings often have more serious consequences than the unavoidable kind .
There is a need for an action plan for humanitarian aid for southern Africa .
Time after time , too , we hear that the action taken has produced no effect .
Today , confronted with the grim reality , they are naturally trying to place the blame not on themselves but on the government .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am going to try to use my 60 seconds to say something sensible on the subject of what this Human Rights Commission and its 53rd session are about .
The motion for a resolution calls for other things too , of course , things that we feel should really be taken to heart by the Human Rights Commission , such as the development of standards or conventions for impunity , or for the trial procedure for politically motivated crimes .
The Turkish government , supported in some places by Europeans , has so far always been able to avoid condemnation by the UN Human Rights Commission .
Mr Newens referred just now to the German case .
I believe the European Union and the Israeli government , too , have a duty to take action on behalf of this person .
Secondly , I would call attention to the fact that Sarajevo is becoming more and more of a Muslim city , making it difficult for non-Muslims to enjoy equal rights there .
There will be a capitulation to the more vociferous and probably stronger claimants , the Serbs , although until the Muslims were driven out they were by far the largest ethnic group in Brcko , followed by the Croats , with the Serbs ranking only third .
As a first example , take France .
I have rarely heard such rubbish !
There is a very important point that we have not yet mentioned today , the fact that this whole debate we are
