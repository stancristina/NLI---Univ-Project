There is an error in Paragraph 12 of the Finnish-language version of the report .
It is unaffected because the Finnish version is wrong , but the amendment to Paragraph 12 does indeed alter the substance , and I should like to draw attention to this .
The majority has approved a text far too general in scope on ending the difference between obligatory and non-obligatory tasks .
I do not think that the various political bodies or their organisation are mature enough for this yet .
One individual country should not be able to stop action and in so doing exert pressure on the rest of the Union .
A common framework for practitioners is needed , as are recognition of alternative treatments and a list of medicines which also includes alternative medicines .
What is needed now is action .
Training requirements for alternative medical practitioners have not yet been harmonized .
There is no clear list of pharmaceuticals .
Good results have been achieved with these treatments , and it is no wonder that people favour them .
It is also important for sporting discipline that they receive as much publicity as possible , since this will enable general interest in the sport to grow .
The influence of the directive on these very sporting organizations and competition organizers has not been adequately explained .
Restricting the sale of TV rights may have serious consequences for sporting activity as a whole .
The organization of major events particularly in Finland , where sporting activity is voluntary and Community based , would be made more difficult and might prove economically unviable .
As a result of conciliation each Member State has to list the sporting events which must be transmitted publicly .
Is not this an interference in the subsidiarity principle ?
Which will be included on the list , and which not ?
There are other , better ways which can be found of guaranteeing that sporting events can be seen which will obtain the support of sports supporters fans and sporting organizations .
I am referring in particular to the debate on the far too independent status of the future European Central Bank , and on the vital need to tighten up economic political cooperation under the conditions created by EMU, particularly in the area of taxation , because under the conditions of EMU fiscal competition between the Member States will become ever stronger .
A number of views are put forward on how to create democratic supervision as a counterweight to the future European Central Bank .
This thought perhaps tends in rather the same direction as the idea which the French floated when they spoke of a Stability Council .
This consultation should involve the whole board , for never before has there been such an independent body of experts which can limit in such a decisive way the powers of democratically elected bodies to pursue economic policy .
Mr Four√ßans ' report has excellently analysed the narrowing of the choice of economic policy instruments under the new current conditions .
Greater national freedom of action for budgetary policy .
The 3 % ceiling on budget deficit should not be interpreted short-sightedly but in the context of the whole trade cycle .
This last is important because no punitive consequences ensue in the case of divergence from any other of the criteria .
A Member State may happily have a debt representing as much as 100 % of its GDP and inflation on an interest rate exceeding the criteria , without these incurring any punitive measures .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe 's economic policy has taken a healthy , though to many people dramatic turn .
We must not run headlong into a common VAT system on a wholly mechanical basis without taking account of employment factors .
We cannot assume that the Commission has the sole right to analyse and direct the structure of tax policy .
Tax revenue has gone uncollected in all Member States since customs formalities were removed and because of the cheap depreciations carried out by big businesses .
Large industrial concerns are able to adapt to the jungle-like VAT system , but SMEs are still trying to cope with the differences in practice between the various countries .
The common VAT system will have problems if we assume that public services come within the scope of VAT.
Will we thus tax humanitarian work while closing our eyes to bigbusiness tax evasion ?
The report contains some positive features in its assessment of Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU) , the European Monetary Institute ( EMI ) and the activities of the European Central Bank , such as the view that it is necessary to develop democratic supervision for the Central Bank .
The stability and growth pact described in connection with EMU should also be examined from the point of view of promoting employment .
In the debate on the EU 's economic policy , Parliament in particular should prioritize employment and the elimination of social exclusion .
For these reasons , I voted against adoption of the report .
The relative effects of these cuts , particularly on the viability of agricultural production , will be greater in the Union 's remote areas than in the better production areas .
Market deveopment assessments show that over-production in the cereal sector will be a growing problem in future .
When the Commission proposes making cuts in support to bring about savings , these cuts should be targeted taking account of the relative effect of the cuts on the viability of production .
Within the European Union each country tries to produce as much as possible of its own food itself .
In the USA 's industrial-scale agricultural production system , where specialization has been taken to extremes , food has to be transported thousands of kilometres to the customers ' tables .
It has created a confusing
