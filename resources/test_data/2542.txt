just a few round figures .
Danish agriculture received agricultural subsidies of DKK 10 billion .
Money is flooding out of EU coffers without ending up in the hands of the needy farmers , and this shows , more than any amount of words , the need for a halt to expenditure and tax , including in the EU.     Mr President , I too am pleased about the progress we have made in 2003 in crucial areas such as the control of external borders , asylum , immigration and the prevention and combating of crime .
I fully acknowledge that the terrorist attacks of 2001 are cause for revising and upgrading our security .
It is therefore crucial that terrorism should not cause us to compromise in relation to these fundamental values .
Quite a few of these initiatives involve very extensive intrusions into the sanctity of private life , raising as yet unsolved issues in relation to current legislation on data safety and the risks of data being misused .
I think , in actual fact , that it is time we now did some reflecting upon whether or not these security arrangements are out of proportion .
In other words , do the initiatives comply with the basic criteria governing the fundamental freedoms that we , of course , specifically cherish in the European Union ?
In this area , I am concerned that the Commission was not even in a position to inform me , as rapporteur , about the biometric data required of third-country citizens and about the precise numbers of visa applicants , falsified travel documents etc .
The Treaty’s ideological ambition , namely that of establishing an area of freedom , security and justice , is , of course , all but divine . ‘And God said , " Let there be light , " and there was light . ’ The EU’s ideologues have , for a good many years , tried to imitate the divine creator . ‘Let there be law’ , the programme goes .
The work done by the EU technocrats over a period of years , aimed at realising the ideology of freedom , security and justice , has proved to bear a striking resemblance to the Tower of Babel .
Together , these two categories of results involve huge reductions in legal certainty and , if this development continues , the criterion of success we shall be able , in a few years ’ time , to use in characterising the EU project will be the blackly humorous one found in the saying , ‘The operation was a success , but the patient died . ’ In order to promote justice , monitoring systems have been established that leave the parties involved beyond all supervision .
The degree of legal certainty is accurately reflected in the scope of police power and the opportunities to exercise democratic control over such power .
Fortress Europe involves neither freedom , nor security nor justice .
The EU’s ideologues overlook two basic facts in the sociology of law : firstly , that viable and democratic legal systems require something other , and more , than ideological phrases , legislative agreements and technological implementation ; and , secondly , that the objectives pursued should be realised through the least far-reaching means .
The Commission ’s comprehensive monitoring report , published in November 2003 , offers an ironic warning , observing as it does that the level of corruption is still high , indeed very high , and that this may have repercussions for people’s confidence in public administration and the judicial system .
What , then , is the cure ?
With the Eurostat affair fresh in the memory , that is no doubt like setting the fox to keep the geese .     Mr President , firstly , we hear a debate in the House concerning an area of freedom , security and justice , and then we hear two vital speeches by Mr Patten and the Irish Presidency .
One of the reasons why things are heading in the wrong direction is that there is an unwillingness to comply not just with the words , but also with the spirit , of the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
At the most recent meeting , in the year 2000 , it was decided to set up a special committee to deal with nuclear disarmament .
If nothing is happening , it is because those countries that should be putting their energy and resources into this issue either do not wish , or are unable , to do so .
They are in the throes of doing almost the opposite of what they have committed themselves to doing .
They have also emphasised that they do not intend to comply with either the letter or the spirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
By introducing what are termed mininukes , they have , rather , reduced the nuclear threshold instead of doing what they have , in principle , undertaken to do .
Instead of making this issue a firmly established part of the transatlantic dialogue , we are rather cautious and obliging .
It cannot in any case be used to create the world we all want to see .
It is always entertaining to hear Mr Patten produce fine words , but I am looking for a little more energy .     Madam President , last week , the Israeli delegation arranged a meeting concerning the so-called security wall with , among others , Mr Peled , the Israeli foreign ministry’s spokesman .
It emerged that a new lamb was taken into the cage for the wolf every day .
Nonetheless , this is very typical of Israelis ’ self-image and behaviour .
At the same time , Sharon needs to know that he cannot replace the roadmap for peace with his own unilateral delineation of frontiers .
