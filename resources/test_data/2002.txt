Similarly , if quotas introduced are to be effective , they must be linked with other measures relating to political parties and the reform of the electoral system .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on her excellent presentation of the situation in Europe as regards equality of the sexes and on her ordered approach to proposals and solutions .
The decision-making process takes place in the centres of power ; but it also means balanced participation in the most important decision-making process for the future , which takes place in the family .
So it refers to both sexes and the numbers of women in decision-making centres cannot be increased unless the proportion of time which men spend on family matters is also increased .
I would say , from a philosophical point of view , that a set of numbers or rules can never change a social fact of life .
The second type of policy concerns specific measures and specific positive action to support the policy of participation in the decision-making process .
Not always with legislative undertakings on quotas but with political undertakings by the political parties and always with specific quantitative targets .
It is also imperative , where no proposals for agreed rules are made by interested parties , that the European Parliament itself take the initiative on flight times and on working times and other requirements for the flight and cabin crew by 1 May 2001 , taking account of the needs of workers and safety requirements .
The Communist Party of Greece sees the problem of the lack of participation by women in the decision-making process not simply as a problem of democracy ; it is a sign of social inequality and exploitation of the classes , which is why it mainly affects working class women .
Women will only gain their rightful place both in the family and in political and economic life by joining the mass grass-roots movement fighting to reverse the policies responsible for their under-representation .
We shall not oppose administrative measures to improve the participation of women in the decision-making process , provided that they are accompanied by the corresponding grass-roots policy and can therefore effectively remove barriers to the participation of women .
The Sepp√§nen report on forest-based and related industries is a step in the right direction , endeavouring as it does to overcome the confines of commercial competitiveness and create wider and deeper prospects for European forests .
Mr President , today 's debate and subsequent vote follow on from the debate which we held in this House on 14 December last year , when the urgent vote was cancelled following the decision by the three political groups to withdraw their motions .
Some members may have been won over by the arguments set out in the letter on the matter from His Excellency the Ambassador of Turkey , who again did us the honour of sending us what is now his customary letter in such cases , in which he stressed that the Turkish government was handling the matter with the utmost seriousness and that Parliament needed to leave superficialities to one side when dealing with matters as important as the prison system in Turkey .
And , of course , three Turkish soldiers also died .
And what is the upshot of all this bloodshed ?
That is our main demand .
These are , I am sorry to say , the stubborn facts and they are not counterbalanced by the overbearing , not to say insulting tone of the advice meted out by Turkey 's representatives to the European Parliament .
Turkey , however , did exactly the opposite , confirming yet again that it is indeed a problematic country .
And as regards the European Union in particular , to make it crystal clear at long last to Turkey and to its non-European supporters , not just in words but - I repeat - with deeds , that the door by which Turkey is to enter the European family , even though there is some doubt as to whether it belongs there , will remain very firmly shut unless it absolutely and unreservedly brings its internal and international conduct into line with the rudimentary rules of law and ethics which underpin the workings of a modern cultivated society .
There are those who commit the crime and there are those who aid and abet .
We identified the problem back in August , we asked on more than two occasions for the president of the European Parliament to intervene - and nothing was done - and the last time we called for intervention was when the attack had already been carried out - and again nothing was done .
Mr President , the resolutions of three political groups were withdrawn during the last part-session under obscure circumstances and today we are debating a joint motion for a resolution by five groups on the same subject .
I personally am in favour of Turkey 's European prospects .
So as long as certain parties behave in a way which gives the impression that the system which currently has the upper hand in Turkey could take hold in Europe , then we are again painted into a corner .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must be absolute and we must be fair : absolute as regards compliance with European criteria by Turkey , as regards its prospects , and fair as regards the way in which we control them .
The new law on aliens currently passing through the Greek parliament contains provision to this effect .
I was a member of the delegation , as she rightly said , and like the rest of the delegation , I too was highly embarrassed in front of the parents of the political prisoners because , although they did indeed beg us to help their children , we were unable to respond .
I am surprised
