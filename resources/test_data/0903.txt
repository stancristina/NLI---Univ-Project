positions themselves .
We accept a common trade policy for the EU and therefore call upon the EU to embark upon negotiations concerning a trade agreement with Cuba , as well as with other Latin American countries .     This motion for a resolution outside legislative procedures contains a number of sensible views in various areas , but also a number of views with which we cannot agree , for example when it comes to the demand for a ‘coherent and comprehensive European asylum and immigration policy ’ ( paragraph 11 ) .
Firstly , we believed he had negotiated with the governments in order to obtain an extremely federalist Commission .
Now , this latter mistake has been rectified , but the new proposal is even more federalist than the first .
Thank you for giving me the floor .     Mr Barroso , instead of doing some thorough spring-cleaning when you moved in , you have just brushed some of the problems under the carpet where they will fester until , one day , they reappear and cause problems .
Mr Dimas inspires confidence , but he appears more interested in industrial policy than the environment .
I hope that the new Commission finds the strength and courage to develop new working methods and to do some new thinking when it comes to what is , for Europe , such an incredibly important issue , that of sustainable economic growth .
Nothing to be sorry for after twenty years in the service of a dictatorship .
That is to your discredit and is difficult both to explain and to defend .
What matters is to get the Lisbon process moving and to give Europeans the maximum amount of opportunities .
We did not , however , have any objection to Mr Buttiglione’s being appointed to another Commission post .
Obviously , there must be no discrimination against Catholics or those holding other religious positions .
The June List has obtained its mandate from voters opposed to the continued centralisation and bureaucratisation of the European project .
Many of these countries are now members of the European Union , a fact that exemplifies what can happen when people are allowed to choose their own path .
We support the demand for a second round of elections under quite different circumstances .
Good luck !     Mr President , what we are now seeing in Eastern Europe is a second wave in the fight for democracy .
The events pose a number of important questions , especially – as Mr Vatanen pointed out – concerning how we go on to view Russia’s own development towards democracy , which is a matter requiring consistency and clarity .
Our only concerns should be for the Ukrainian people and for democracy .     Mr President , as a member of the temporary committee , I abstained from voting on a resolution that I had not been allowed to study first and that I cannot support .
I think it important not simply to dismiss this view , which only six out of twenty-five countries are said to have supported , for the countries concerned are those that make major net contributions .
In other words , this is not a tactic for moving resources to one area or another .
I also wish to emphasise our belief that agriculture should not be exempt from such re-planning as is necessary if it is to be possible to invest in new areas .
It has to be said , however , that the Russia strategy has not been any great success so far .
I am thinking of the concentration of power in the Kremlin , of the media situation – in principle , media freedom is a thing of the past – and of the lack of a political solution in Chechnya .
I am also thinking of very recent developments , namely Putin’s support for Yanukovich in Ukraine and , earlier , for Lukashenko in Belarus .
I hope that this will lead to something more practical so that this forum does not just become a talking shop that skates over the surface of issues , but is a place in which difficult issues genuinely can be solved .
It must not , however , actively side with the dictatorships there or impede the development of democracy .
In that case , Europe needs , on the one hand , to show itself prepared to cooperate with Russia and , on the other hand , to emphasise that Russia should not interfere in other countries ’ internal affairs , irrespective of the common history these countries and Russia may previously have had .
Millions of children with no parents wear themselves out cultivating the food they need .
Better access to medicines must , however , be combined with increased knowledge of HIV and increased provision of information about the disease , together with an ambitious aid policy and fair trade so that the countries concerned can afford economic development that increases trade .     Mr President , I well remember when the HIV epidemic began to spread in the 1980s .
Now , the world has finally woken up , but efforts at prevention are still insufficient .
This will require us to set aside considerably more resources , both for our own HIV programme and for the global fund .
For the first time since HIV/AIDS was discovered , more women than men are now infected .
The consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are far greater for women and children than for men and boys .
Nor are women given the same access as men to health care and to medicines that retard the progress of the disease .
Gender equality , together with sexual and reproductive health and rights , need to be common objectives for every country in the world and , above all , a responsibility for all men
