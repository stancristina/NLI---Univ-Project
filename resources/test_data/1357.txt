responsibility of the Member States .
Take for example the difficulties that contractors encounter if they want to work over the border .
That is quite a mouthful but there is still a lack of substance as far as I can see , and I am convinced we are being short-changed .
The paragraphs that deal with this are actually nothing more than a reprint of the Lisbon paragraphs .
But the Council is , and remains , an opponent as far as we are concerned .
The agreements on the common foreign and security policy bear witness to Parliament ' s total exclusion .
Almost everyone agrees that the directive of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering has worked well .
The pressure on the European Union to step up its fight against money laundering culminated in the Action Plan to Combat Organised Crime , which was endorsed at the Amsterdam Summit in 1997 , and the report and resolution approved by Parliament in March 1999 .
The Commission is largely well-disposed towards the underlying idea or the intention behind the lion ' s share of the proposed amendments , but would prefer at this stage not to go for a technical solution .
Moving on to Amendments Nos 17 , 18 and 19 , the Commission proposal sparked an interesting discussion on whether it would be appropriate to involve certain types of dealers in high-value goods , such as jewellers , art dealers etc. , in the fight against money laundering .
The Commission is prepared to work with the Member States to establish what the role of the market supervisory authorities should be .
The Commission welcomes the fact that there is support for the role of OLAF within the context of the proposal .
I now come to the amendments that the Commission is unable to accept , starting with Amendments Nos 2 and 3 .
Amendments Nos 27 , 28 and 29 .
Amendment No 39 .
Naturally the Commission believes that it has used its authority correctly with regard to its proposal for a decision on the safe harbour , and I hope that Parliament sees it the same way .
Our decision is unilateral .
But the American government has consistently refused to accept them .
The safe harbour also provides for enforcement to be carried out by government bodies .
Participating firms will have to pay compensation in a whole host of circumstances , for example on account of their obligations pursuant to legislation in the United States .
The United States argues that cancellation is not a requirement according to OECD guidelines .
Although these guidelines are open to more than one interpretation , it is difficult to completely rule out that of the United States .
The business communities on both sides of the Atlantic are in no doubt about that .
Parliament will find it is in good company if it does .
By giving expression to its concerns and encouraging the Commission to be vigilant , it would be adding its voice to that of the officials in charge of data protection However , if Parliament were to throw up obstacles , then this would not lead to any improvement in the safe harbour system but would only prolong the existing situation , which would do those involved and the business community no service .
Subsequently , however , their identity cards are collected at reception .
Mr President , I should like to make one observation on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and one on behalf of the Socialist group as a whole .
Amounts will be made available which allow for sufficient personnel and which can subsequently be verified to see whether the plan actually worked .
The whole discussion here today will eventually culminate in the 1998 discharge .
It seems to me that if a spokesman cannot take the trouble to be here for this entire debate and be here on time for his own speaking time he should not be allowed to speak at all .
Another important point is that these days , documents have suddenly gone missing not only within the European Commission , but all over Europe .
It is the Member States that foot the bill for the European Development Fund .
And we can now grant this discharge with a clear conscience whilst taking into consideration the comments included in the Stauner , Kuhne and RÃ¼hle resolutions .
It is they who must improve their books .
This agreement will restrict the rights of individual MEPs , of rapporteurs , to ask for information from the Commission .
In addition , decisions need to be taken on vote weighting and as we see it , it should be the size of the population in the Member States , as is the case in this House , that is the deciding factor .
It is high time Mr Prodi had the authority and rights which a European government should in fact have .
I hope that the words of Mr Joschka Fischer and those of Mr Chirac will not remain words but will be turned into action .
We can do this by driving a hard bargain , yet remaining specific , regarding the planned reforms in Zimbabwe .
Every year , about half a million people are smuggled into the European Union .
This internationalisation of organised crime is in stark contrast to the inability of the EU Member States to adopt a coordinated approach in dealing with the trafficking in human beings .
If we want to prevent tragedies such as those at Dover from happening again , extending the Third Pillar should not be delayed any further , and we are hopeful after President Chirac' s address and Minister Queyranne ' s speech .
Minister Queyranne and Commissioner Vitorino already mentioned it
