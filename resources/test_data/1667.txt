With this report , we want to show our appreciation for the work done by the Commission , by giving it encouragement , by spurring it on and by providing a number of suggestions .
The subject we are presenting therefore has clear boundaries , but it is nonetheless an important subject that I hope can involve a large majority of Parliament .
I feel particularly pleased that we have achieved our aim of sending out a strong political message to the youth of Europe through the reinforcement of the Socrates , YOUTH and Leonardo programmes .
As Henri de Saint-Simon wrote , at such times what is needed is a force able to unite desires , to focus movements and to make interests mutual and commitments firm .
Our political project was rocked by blustery winds back in the 1980s as well ; despite the impending storm , however , strong political leadership enabled us to weather the elements and emerge even stronger than before .
It is not just a case of Robin Hood in reverse , as somebody suggested : there is also the danger , which I should like to avert , that we shall be responsible for burying any hope of a European revival .
I repeat : these free-trade policies have proved to be a failure .
In this Parliament , however , it seems to be taboo to talk about certain subjects .
It is disgraceful .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the compromise reached on the proposal for a directive that the Commission put forward only three months ago is the outcome of serious , professional , intense work carried out together by the three institutions of the European Union .
In my view , this result – this compromise – strikes a balance between the need for security and the need for freedom .
That is precisely why I should like in particular to express my personal gratitude and appreciation for the work of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , in which I took part on several occasions , and of its chairman , Mr Cavada , and rapporteur , Mr Alvaro .
The outcome of these negotiations will , in my opinion , be a directive of undoubted importance if it also includes the corrective measures on which the EU ministers have already reached agreement .
I should like to express my solidarity with Mr Alvaro because I believe that the compromise amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats have made the text put forward by the Commission worse .
Besides , as Mr Cashman very clearly put it , what is the cost of not deciding , what is the cost of not doing anything ?
Nevertheless , ladies and gentlemen , if someone uses a mobile phone to set off a bomb , as unfortunately has happened , or to give instructions to a gang of paedophiles , is it not right that the police and the courts , that is to say the legitimate institutions , should have the tools to prevent and to tackle such crimes ?
The defenders of human rights , whom I applaud today because they are here with us in Parliament , have described to us the political intimidation and physical threats to which they are subjected .
We ask the Commission and Council – which have already done so – to take a firm stand against what occurred , and point out that our association agreement with Tunisia also includes a section on human rights .
Obviously we could – or perhaps should – have gone further .
Paradoxically , however , this directive addresses environmental problems , congestion and safety most effectively through a surrender of competence : it has been decided not to treat urban areas in the same way as sensitive mountain regions , yet on the other hand the full compatibility of the Eurovignette has been recognised , with urban tolls Ken Livingstone being used directly to regulate congestion and combat pollution .
Thanks to the hard work of the rapporteur , Mr Evans , and to cooperation by the Council and Commission , we have achieved a good compromise which will allow us to approve the regulation at first reading and to have it implemented rapidly .
This is an important regulation for disabled and elderly passengers as it guarantees a series of fundamental rights .
Information must be available in a form accessible to all and the protection of privacy will be assured .
We are talking about a reduced level but improved targeting of state aid in order to provide an effective response to the challenges of economic globalisation , enlargement and the need to restore the Union’s competitiveness .
This will prejudice subsequent success in attracting new companies , cause the relocation of uncompetitive companies able to survive only with the help of subsidies , and create unjustified competition among the poorest areas of Europe .
The UK proposal does not even take account of the geographical diversity of the Member States and cuts those Structural Funds that are vital to southern and eastern Europe .
The European Parliament was jointly involved , first with the Commission and then with the Council , in the analysis and debates that took place .
I should really like the Presidency and the Commission to respond appropriately to what we are doing with our development policies .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the end Tony Blair has decided to don the robes of the Sheriff of Nottingham , with his drastic cuts to the budget and hard-line defence of the privilege of the UK rebate .
The need for agreement must not , however , be mistaken for a willingness to accept just any compromise .
To conclude , I should like to
