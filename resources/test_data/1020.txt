it must contain representatives of the central banks of the relevant Member States .
It will be a good compromise between the European Central Bank on the one hand and representatives of the finance ministries on the other .
Mr President , I too begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur .
They should converge but not be made identical .
If we were to opt for just one electoral system , thereby ignoring specific national features , be they geopolitical , sociological or cultural , such a legislative choice would cease to serve the other great objective of the European Union , which is respect for the national identity of Member States .
The rapporteur 's proposal for a preferential vote aims to allow constituents to elect specific people .
Mr President , Mr Anastassopoulos ' report clearly shows that the political unification of Europe requires a Parliament whose members are chosen for the role it has to play along the same institutional and political lines .
However , we Members of the European Parliament are set apart from each other by the way in which each of us was elected to office .
For this reason I support Mr Anastassopoulos ' proposals for a system of proportional representation , and also for the ability of the citizen to express a preference among candidates .
Finally , the election of a number of Members of the European Parliament on a pan-European basis is a positive idea , as long as there are arrangements to prevent the marginalization of smaller countries and of less widely used languages .
This means a majority can create such numerous and such narrow constituencies that the system of proportional representation will degenerate into a monstrous majority voting system .
Moreover , it means that this Chamber will include a second category of Members of the European Parliament , who will be in a superior position .
Will it ever exist ?
In other words we must decide who has the right to be represented and who does not .
Mr President , I think that our colleague , Mr Anastassopoulos , has approached this difficult area with moderation and discernment .
I would just like to make four points .
It is not a matter for us , but we must draw attention to it .
In any case , I think that 5 % is too high a threshold .
However , there are also parties in which the candidates are chosen on the basis of the preference of the leader of the party or his or her entourage .
However , I wonder whether it would not be more advisable to take an overall view of this matter or to deal with it through the normal procedures of the parties themselves , which would result in greater stability and less opposition .
I noted that he mentioned the subject of the rapprochement of Turkey with Europe together with human rights and the Cyprus issue .
Turkey is calling into question the right of Cyprus - an independent country - to have its own defence .
I would like an answer from the President-in-Office .
For its part , the Council appears to be moving towards such a view , arguing that any group that has something to say must take part in the peace process .
I think that the time has come for us to draw our own conclusions and to assume our own responsibilities towards the situation that has been created in the Balkans .
This is a significant declaration , which comes from the majority party in the Albanian opposition .
Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina preserve their territorial integrity thanks to the consistent and judicious policy of the European Union and of the whole of the West .
Mr President , each time we debate in Parliament economic policy and the economic situation in the European Union , words of self-satisfaction of those who have shaped economic policy are saved for the achievements of the economic policy that the European Union is following .
Much the same is happening now .
Firstly , does he think that , with the rigorous implementation of the Stability Pact , which he requested in his speech , it is possible to combat unemployment with the tremendous financial restrictions it imposes ?
Mr President , this report in some way constitutes an account of the activity of the EMI in relation to the completion of its mission .
But the nature of the EMI prescribes this form of report and , as our colleague , Mr Four√ßans , quite rightly mentioned in his excellent report , this is the way in which it must be approached .
I fear that now we are going through a crisis of excessive confidence because the euro was established much more easily than we expected .
Let us not get carried away by the fact that the euro has become established .
Mr President , I wish to thank the President-in-Office .
I would simply like to put a supplementary question to the President-in-Office .
Mr President , I too would naturally like to welcome the President-in-Office on her first appearance in the European Parliament .
I think that , for precisely this reason , the Council should have the sensitivity that is shown by non-governmental organizations and mass movements for the fate of the Parthenon Marbles , and give a more substantial response to this issue .
It is an entirely different one since , after the latest findings and the announcement by the great scientist Ced Claire concerning the damage done to the Parthenon Marbles , I wonder whether a committee of experts might not get together to participate more generally in the scientific investigation into the matter and in the communication of the findings .
This is provided for in the Treaties .
Why is it being sent from pillar to post ?
This was the game that crucified Christ .
