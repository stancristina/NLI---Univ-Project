Whilst fully complying with the SAFA ( Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft ) procedure , which involves the systematic monitoring of aircraft likely to present risks in terms of air safety , the Commission consequently adopted an initiative in the field of air safety in an attempt to ensure three fundamental aspects : gathering and disseminating more accurate information in the field ; on-site inspections of aircrew and aircraft from third countries in Community airports and adopting appropriate measures to remedy any shortcomings found , which could even result in the aircraft being grounded .
This report proposes that the EP’s Rules of Procedure should be amended to take account of the arrangements for multilingualism currently in force in order to address the difficulties that are expected to arise as a consequence of enlargement , in terms of recruiting a sufficient number of interpreters for certain languages .
The obligation for multilingualism established by the Treaties is confirmed and it is recommended that this obligation could be ‘relaxed’ ; with the explicit support of the Members concerned and with transitional arrangements for the new Member States while there is a shortage of interpreters .
I therefore welcome the results that have been achieved and the commitment given by the Council to ensure that the relationship between the EU and Greenland , after 2006 , based on a broader partnership for sustainable development , includes a specific fisheries agreement , negotiated in accordance with the general rules and the principles that underpin these agreements .
I voted in favour .     .
In practice , the major powers are gradually imposing their control , with the other governments playing a subservient role .
As I said in the amendment that I tabled through my group , I wish to express my admiration admiration I know we all share at the exemplary behaviour of the people of Madrid and of Spanish society as a whole following the terrorist attack that took place on 11 March .
The proposal for a regulation does not guarantee these conditions which , bearing in mind the international dimension of the Mediterranean , are sound guiding principles for the common fisheries policy .
Because I fully agree with the rapporteur’s ideas , I voted in favour of the report .     .
The report confirms a fundamental principle that we have always argued for – the good governance of the common fisheries policy - which ‘requires proper involvement of all the fishing industry ’s professionals in the decision-making process for framing and managing the policy’ .
Creating subcommittees is another interesting proposal , because it seeks to ensure closer cooperation in every area .
It is my view that , without an appropriate budget , this measure will be meaningless and , without the majority representation of the fisheries industry in the RACs , the rights of the main players will suffer .
I welcome the excellent work of the rapporteur , who has given voice to the fishermen’s legitimate expectations that these Councils will be set up .
These reports have , unfortunately , become a ritual in the service of a radical and sectarian ideological agenda .
Lastly , it lacked the vigour required for dealing with real threats .
Given the political and post-war situation in the region , I fully share the rapporteur’s opinion that Croatia can become the driving force for progress in the Western Balkans .
I voted in favour of this report .     .
The report contains some aspects that I believe to be fair and others with which I disagree , particularly those underlying its main thesis .
An example of this is the opinion of Parliament’s Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .     .
I support the position adopted by Mr Queiró , which he expressed in plenary , on the need for the Council and the Commission to make a clear and precise assessment of the consequences of Turkey’s accession .
This budgetisation will also enable us to provide more effective responses to one-off situations of the utmost urgency .
The creation of the single currency does not , however , automatically mean that there is a single payment area , in which the same rules apply across the board .
Since then , self-regulation still does not appear to have worked ; the directives have not worked either , as they must be transposed into the law of each country , and this has not been carried out at the same time or in the same manner .
The report should highlight the indifference and the neglect displayed by the Commission and by many Member States in the face of calls for effective measures to improve safety at sea and to help countries affected by disasters .
Nevertheless , the threat of accidents like the disaster is still hanging over us .
Thank you , Galicians .
I regret , however , that the report does not mention improvements in workers ' social conditions and that our proposals to abolish flags of convenience , to make all parties responsible for the payment of damages , and to support investigations of the authenticity of maritime certificates issued , were rejected .
Lastly , I have taken into consideration that the original proposal did not include any measure to allow for the specific situation of outlying countries , whose transport operators , as regards their ability to compete , will be more affected in the short to medium term than their counterparts in Member States in the centre of Europe .
For this reason , it is vitally important either to develop a second generation SIS – Schengen Information System II or SIS II – or to create a visa information system , not forgetting the issue of introducing biometrical data .
Mr President , given that we are at the end of the parliamentary
