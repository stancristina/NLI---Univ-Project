Mr President , yesterday morning , during a television programme broadcast from Milan called ' Telelombardia' , a pensioner , Lucia , telephoned me and told me that she had been robbed on her way back from withdrawing her pension , as she does at the end of every month , and that , because of what had happened to her , she did not know how she was going to survive the month .
In actual fact , a great many citizens are unfamiliar with the rules and laws of the State and do not know how to obtain all their rights .
I would like to make it clear , however , as a Catholic , that I am absolutely convinced that Catholicism is not guilty of the forms of fundamentalism that the report appears to suggest it is .
Ladies and gentlemen , the problem is precisely this : the separation of religion from political power and political decision-making .
It may be politically correct to disregard these facts but in doing so we are preventing Europe from defending itself against the danger represented by Islamic communities , governed by the severe rules of the Sharia which takes as much notice of women 's rights as it does of our right of the family and all the principles of freedom .
Therefore , when I read in point K of this report that , when religious bodies carry out activities of a public nature , they are , just by doing so , as good as committing a crime against an alleged European law ; that is , if , by way of example , a religious body were to run a hospital or a school , it would in some way be a threat to European law , I find this extremely disturbing .
One last plea to Commissioner Byrne : in calling for this new documentation we should request that it be differentiated according to the composition of certain products , for this would reduce the expenditure for small and medium-sized businesses considerably .
Then there is the matter of public opinion .
With continued enlargement , on the one hand we are taking up an historical challenge that we do not , of course , want to miss , but on the other we must also do what we can so that the identity of our cultures and our peoples is not lost .
Mr President , the European Parliament has decided against the right of European citizens to be able unrestrictedly to enjoy natural medicines , which are completely free from side effects .
I basically believe that we need to pay close attention to hygiene regulations and enforce them very strictly , and that standards need to be raised accordingly .
For this reason , the report I am tabling highlights the urgent need to adopt a proactive policy - at the Barcelona summit , let us hope - which is , above all , in line with the Lisbon objectives , a policy mix that makes the social agenda adopted at Nice an integral part of a coordinated economic and social policy centred on the objective of increasing the active population and achieving full employment .
We must not just hope for coordination but promote it too , for instance by proposing - through the Commission - forms of open cooperation between different governments on common projects concerned with research , innovation , lifelong learning and active ageing policies , the latter being a prerequisite for achieving a reform of social security systems that is not disastrous for workers ' pension rights .
The reversal of the unemployment trend and an upturn on the Nasdaq contrast , in fact , with the sharp rise in oil prices , perhaps because of the winds of war blowing through the oil-producing countries .
Each of these aspects taken alone supports the points raised in the report before us , but they also support the need for it to have a wholly European focus , which includes maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact , because another perplexing aspect in the USA is , paradoxically , the increase in floating capital , perhaps as an intentional inflationary nudge to level off the huge public investments that have been made .
In conclusion , what I am trying to say is that not only are the economic and social plans extremely opportune , but so is the harmonious and integrated way they are implemented , with a vision that goes from the new , near borders ? ( The President cut the speaker off )
The proposal to turn employment around is based on a new bargaining structure and real pay flexibility .
Is it true ?
I believe this is a way of tempering the transparency of information with safeguards for the less small companies .
The verdict is generally favourable as regards the identification of their general objectives and the instruments that can be used to achieve them .
We are concerned about the tax burden on work - and the report bears this out ; but there is no proof and it is not rational to think that this might be a consequence of a reduction in the tax burden on capital : there is no sign of this in the data we have before us .
On the subject of direct taxes , Commissioner , the report hopes that progress towards full implementation of the measures contained in the tax package will be completed as soon as possible and , in particular , that any rules discriminating between residents and non-residents , which leave loopholes for fraud and are incompatible with the single market , will be removed .
A subject like the taxation of savings certainly ought to be dealt with in such
