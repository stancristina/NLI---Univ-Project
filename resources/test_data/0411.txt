it precisely clear what the spirit at the Commission and in the Council of Ministers is when you said ' We must protect people from persecution , but we must also protect the citizens of the European Union from floods of refugees ' .
Please also allow us to discuss these substantively political reactions here as well , in addition to the mechanical reactions .
I would just like to address two supplementary aspects .
We not only need an international system to regulate competition but we must also have a code of conduct to control the increase in foreign production and the internationalization and globalization of the marketplace .
Specific framework conditions and a certain commitment on the part of the economy for company relocations can , however , be desirable for the rational deployment of public subsidies awarded in accordance with EU rules , or indeed for the prevention of fraud .
For this reason we need controls and this is why we in the REX Committee organized a hearing and have submitted the report which is to be adopted today at the second attempt .
We in the Committee on External Economic Relations support the report .
An interesting proposal in some amendments is for subsidies to be redistributed along more flexible lines , whereby the total amount of aid remains the same .
The first of these concerns the fact that we have still not succeeded in developing a definitive VAT system in the EU which really works .
( Noise ) Ladies and gentlemen , there are minimum rules of social courtesy and if you do n't known them yet , perhaps you should learn them this morning .
Madam President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although the report prepared by my colleague Mrs d'Ancona on the drawing up of the Convention concerning the establishment of " Eurodac' is , in essence , a factual and technical report - as my colleague has already pointed out - the tone is of great significance for those people involved .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the core of this automatic data processing system relates to the fact that , in principle , future applicants for asylum in the European Union should be fingerprinted as soon as they enter a Member State , as long as they are at least 14 years old .
This is a regrettable fact which should not be overlooked .
And what are we doing ?
Our systems are overloaded and at the end of the day we are unable to offer help or guarantee asylum .
The town of which I am Mayor has the highest percentage of refugees from the Bosnian civil war .
This will be shown very clearly in the remainder of the debate .
My dear colleague , we could also let the Swiss know that anyone who makes it economically impossible for us to transit through Switzerland should watch out that we do n't make coming out of Switzerland economically impossible , not to put to fine a point on it !
We ca n't work together on that basis .
The Commission is taking legal action against Austria over the level of its toll charges , although they comply with the Commission 's Green Paper .
It is not that we want to pass the external costs on to lorries without justification , but rather that the external costs only arose in the first place due to the excessive number of lorries .
If these principles are observed it must surely be possible to create a reasonable European traffic policy and to use the instruments available , including the toll , to create an environment - and therefore people-oriented traffic policy for the whole of Europe .
Let me say once and for all and quite clearly , this behaviour is nothing but more imperialist delusions and status craving .
Listening to the discussions and the Commissioner 's information today , I have to conclude that nothing concrete is coming of today 's debate either .
The impact suffered by Austria as a result is enormous .
For this reason I would like the European Parliament to concentrate on current developments and crisis situations and , this being the case , for light and small arms to play the central role .
I believe it is very important that we continue to hold this position .
But there is also a question which we must ask ourselves .
Knowledge without conscience is a horrific scenario !
A further problem , of course , is the fact that the Russians are now claiming that the Ingushetis helped the Chechens and must therefore be punished .
He promised to push the issue in the Council accordingly .
In addition , every year we are faced with the problem of under-staffing within the Commission .
All this applies to a large extent to the criticisms made by the Court of Auditors in relation to the ECHO programme and the Union 's aid programme , if we just leave out the work Ukrainian .
It should be pointed out that countries with great mineral wealth , such as the former Zaire , get the same support as Ethiopia , among others .
That is not right .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the questions and explanations of the various parties have already shown in how many ways the mountains can be seen .
Another item which deserves support is without doubt better use of renewable energy .
I would like to add to what Mr Macartney said .
On Friday , the last day of the sitting in Strasbourg , I again referred to speakers ' contributions on the subject of transalpine traffic , and at that point I introduced a clarification .
The European Central Bank is responsible for monetary policy .
