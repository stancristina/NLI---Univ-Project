Nevertheless , I would like to commend her on her work .
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament ' s position .
As an islander , however , I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves .
Therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines .
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the South .
The Union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
Mr President , it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for women and young people , and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy .
Mr President , once again we are debating the European Union ' s competition policy .
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies .
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and Member States of the Union at that .
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded , poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business .
We , as the Committee on Transport , are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we are likewise prepared to discuss , at a later date , the legal implications of this communication .
Once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .
However , this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine , which is an important sector of the economy , covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements , which is why our reaction needs to be measured : strict , but correct .
At the same time , it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India .
The safety factor in this type of project , and I am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
Therefore , and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed , it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union .
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : " Yes to Work " and " Back to Work " .
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made .
You tell me that you , as the Commission , have made recommendations .
How many people found work ?
Do we have any figures ?
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and , as far as I can see , an increase in productivity .
The Commission will endeavour , for all these specific guidelines , to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006 .
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law .
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services ' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark .
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark .
The Council , Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000 .
I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .
EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation .
Within the European Commission , the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation , while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control , the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors .
However , this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas .
First let me say that it would be a great help to us , now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament , if you could make specific proposals which we could take into
