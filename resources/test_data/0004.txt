made food aid available for combatants to support the ceasefire of December 2002 and used the rapid reaction mechanism to support the deployment of African Union observers in April 2003 .
This programme , for EUR 172 million , will make available much-needed budget support and promote rural development and good governance , including support to the transitional institutions .
This is necessary to allow free and fair elections to take place in the near future in a climate of security and mutual respect .
However , the Community still provides considerable support of direct benefit to the Haitian population .
In a letter sent by the Commission and the Council at the beginning of January 2004 to the government of Haiti informing it of the extension of appropriate measures , the Union urges the government rapidly to translate its commitment to comply with the requirements of OAS Resolution 822 into concrete actions , which would lead to free and fair national and local elections .
Parliament may be assured that the Commission is actively promoting a solution to the political crisis in Haiti and is using the means at its disposal to respond to the urgent needs of the Haitian population .     Mr President in Office of the Council , given your familiarity with the text of the Convention , I would like you to tell me if , in all honesty , you are aware of a more complete , more appropriate text serving as a basis for a successful conclusion than the text of the Draft Convention ?
Fitoussi’s intention here is to stress the current fragility of the structure of economic governance in the EU , while acknowledging the vital role played by competition policy in economic governance .
Competition policy will only be successful , however , if the Commission is able to create equitable conditions , whereby rules can be applied across all Member States .
The action plan presented by the committee , aimed at concentrating on the most important statistics , at reducing the amount of work outsourced by the institute and at making statistical data available to the public , addresses our main concerns .
These concerns are not , however , confined to Eurostat .
It is unacceptable that , on key points , the 2003 report does no more than repeat what was said in 1990 because absolutely nothing has changed in 13 years .
Community money finances extensive operations to count olive trees and evaluate their productive capacity , an activity that is neither worthwhile nor effective , while it neglects the fight against the adulteration of olive oil .
It also underlines the fact that Parliament is far from being a spent political force .
While the report does not call for any kind of witch-hunt , which would be most unwelcome at the current stage of the European process , it does make it quite clear that Eurostat might not be the only case and , worse , might not be the most serious case detected in the Commission ’s activities .
What timetable does it envisage and what budget does it intend to use for implementing these measures ?
I should like to highlight some of the points in the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Ferrer : - firstly : the vital role of structural funds .
There is currently a serious problem of multinationals relocating ; in my home town of Vila Nova de Gaia , for example , there is a German company , Brax Portugal , threatening to close down within days and to lay off 450 workers , mainly women .
It is therefore essential that the Commission present a concrete , cohesive and clearly defined action plan , in terms of instruments , financial resources and timetable .
A mere monitoring centre will not be sufficient .
It would be essential to establish support mechanisms to take part in trade fairs , to open sales outlets and distribution platforms , and to carry out prospecting missions of target markets , etc .
It is the point where industry , craft and art converge , and it plays a major role in people’s lifestyles .
To do so would be pitifully short-sighted and ethically reprehensible .
On the very day on which we are discussing this report and when we will be receiving Kofi Annan , the United Nations Secretary-General and Sakharov Prize-winner in 2003 , Parliament has received depressing news from the Jurassic Park of dictatorships : we are being prevented from receiving Oswaldo Payá , to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize for 2002 .
The European Parliament has adopted an own-initiative resolution on relations between the EU and the UN , containing key aspects that I believe to be extremely dangerous .
Although this resolution deals with serious issues facing humankind , it does not address them seriously and although it focuses on aspects of power , it advocates creating political and military blocs in a framework of an enhanced multilateral system , strengthening the role of the Security Council and attaching less priority to the role of the UN General Assembly .     .
We are then presented with the impractical idea of enlarging the United Nations Security Council , giving the EU a seat , without considering the more than likely opposition of the other countries that have places on the Security Council , or the fact that it would be hard to persuade France and the United Kingdom to give up their seats .
The report’s aim is merely to improve and provide legal clarification of the Commission text , from a technical point of view .
Although the analysis of the Commission proposal carried out by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy led to only one amendment , the proposal is of enormous importance in the field of plant genetics .
