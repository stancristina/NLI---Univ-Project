additional protocol to the Ankara Agreement would have consequences for the overall negotiation process .
The best way of avoiding that is for Turkey to meet the obligations it entered into before we opened the accession negotiations .     .
Thank you for providing us with those detailed observations concerning economic growth in the Turkish Cypriot community .
We want to improve the working of the Green Line Regulation .
Our view on how to end the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot communities is very clear : we want to execute the financial assistance programme now and we want to facilitate a solution for direct trade , possibly with accompanying measures .
I have been a Member of Parliament for seven years , and in all this time John Bowis has consistently kept this subject on the agenda .
Mental health problems are something which it is easy to keep quiet about .
There is a strong stigma attached to such types of disorder , and there may even be discrimination , which in the worst case scenario might prevent someone from seeking care .
The path to maturity is stonier than ever .
To prevent mental health problems in children and young people in particular , we need to invest more time and money in preventive measures in day-care centres , schools , children’s clinics and school healthcare .
With the right resources , school healthcare units and children’s clinics are in an excellent position to identify problems in children and young people and provide help at an early stage .
Support for a child from parents and the family creates a basis for good mental health .
Treating the problems of the young with drugs should be the last resort .
The problems will not go away by keeping silent about them .
If there is no intervention in young people’s mental health problems immediately , and if no attention is paid to easing the situation regarding access to help , the price paid will be just too high .
A positive , lasting solution is in the European Union’s own interests .
Likewise , the Union , and the Finnish Presidency in particular , are in regular direct contact with Special Envoy Ahtisaari , who recently gave an account of the situation at the meeting of the EU’s General Affairs and External Relations Council on 17 July .
The UN Special Envoy is still trying to persuade both Belgrade and Pristina to take an active part in negotiations on key themes , such as decentralisation of government , religious and cultural heritage , economic issues and the rights of minorities .
The parties continue to hold different views , but the process has been useful inasmuch as it has clarified positions and has helped to explore common ground for a future solution .
The EU is pleased with the decision by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to move on to political discussions on Kosovo’s status and urge both parties to take part in a new round of talks in a constructive way .
Following status determination , the Union’s involvement in Kosovo will cover three areas .
An EU Planning Team has been established by an EU Joint Action and has already been sent to Kosovo to prepare for a possible civil crisis management operation relating to the aspect of the rule of law which I have referred to .
The Union’s future role in Kosovo is being planned in conjunction with the European Commission .
A future international presence in Kosovo will not take the form of a European Union Mission in Kosovo ( EUMIK) .
International action should help Kosovo’s own institutions to take full responsibility for Kosovo’s affairs .
The EU’s future role there will also of course require a considerable amount of financing .
A key factor here will be the establishment of a democratic , multinational Kosovo , with a good basis for economic development and greater integration .     .
Mr President , Kosovo is indeed a part of Europe .
The European Union has a major responsibility for the future of Kosovo .
I fully agree with Minister Lehtomäki and those MEPs who said that UNMIK will not be replaced by any kind of EUMIK , but rather a leaner , more streamlined international presence or international civilian mission .
The United Nations Status Envoy needs our full support to put forward a comprehensive package that will allow the UN Security Council to decide on the way ahead .
The EU needs to give a clear signal that it will stay in Kosovo to play a key role in the implementation of the status settlement and to support its long-term EU perspective through the stabilisation and association process .
The powers of the future international presence in Kosovo should be limited to overseeing the implementation of the status settlement .
After the status settlement , our objective is to ensure that Kosovo becomes a reliable partner , progressing towards the EU together with the rest of the region .
I fully agree with Minister Lehtomäki that we will have to make appropriate provisions in the future to be able to cover this cost .
Let us remember that it is better to cover the costs of economic and social development than to send more soldiers to the Balkans .
The Council’s plan would lead to the disappearance of 1700 posts at the Commission , starting with 170 posts in 2007 .
Please do not ask the EU and the Commission to do more in ensuring external and internal security – be it in Kosovo , Lebanon or the Canary Islands .
EU policy and aid does not come from heaven : it needs competent staff to carry it out .
The current United Nations Status Envoy comes from Finland , and I have special responsibility on behalf of the Commission concerning the Western Balkans and Kosovo
