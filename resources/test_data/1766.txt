third countries which are produced without any protection as regards a decent life for the animals .
Besides , it is not a crime for us to protect poultry farmers , a class which is asking for our solidarity .     . – Mr President , State aid , in other words the workers ' money , is in the firing line , the objective being to reduce it and have management of it controlled by the European Union , so that it can serve the Lisbon Strategy .
It is vital , they say , to reduce State aid , in order for it to have positive results .
The reduction in State aid and its orientation towards servicing the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy will exacerbate still further the situation of the grass-roots classes .
Finally , there should be support for innovative actions on matters of research , development and innovation , mainly in remote countries and areas , especially where there is a large technological divide .     .
Secondly , the fact that we are calling on the European Commission to monitor the emergency of signs of protectionism in the Member States and to report regularly to Parliament on any such signs and , thirdly , the idea that there is a need to ensure that the large European market players find sufficient support and opportunities in the internal market to develop into global market players .
Three billion people in the world have an income of less than two dollars a day , while in the USA the poverty line is calculated to be 11 dollars a day .
It is based in essence on fewer than a dozen petitions prior to 2004 , the authors of which have either reached a compromise with the Greek authorities or are in court and need support .
That is precisely why the Commission proposed a new proposal for a directive , as you said , and took Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for infringement on the basis of the 1983 directive .
The Committee on Petitions does not have the right to play the role of judge and to construe as true , without proof , information such as the place of normal residence , on which the courts are called to rule .
I would refer by way of example to the example of the petition on dismissals from the SY.EL.AE fertiliser factory , a matter on which the drafting of a report was requested but which was never drafted , however , on the grounds that proceedings were pending .
Secondly , the report only concerns Greece , at a time when similar petitions have also been filed for other Member States of the European Union .
It does not stipulate the fines imposed , for which the Member States are competent .
Greek legislation has already been improved with law 2960/2001 abolishing the penalty of smuggling and confiscation of vehicles and making provision solely for temporary seizure pending payment of a fine in order to secure the Greek state .
If that is the case , we too have something to say .
Mr Agnoletto is right to recommend the extension of the human rights clause to all sectors and to all countries and the precedent which he uses to support this opinion is interesting .
Finally , he is right in his final conclusion that the time has come , at long last , for us to look at a new clause with a content which reflects everything we are debating and everything that we commend on many occasions or that , on other occasions , we criticise through the European process .
Second question : are the selective discounts of the democracy clause permissible ?
Third question : do the elements of electoral competition and free elections alone suffice in order to characterise a system as democratic ?
Fourth question : does the Union intend – do we the democratically legitimised Chamber intend – to adopt qualitative indicators for measuring and evaluating the democratic conduct of our private economic and commercial partners and , more importantly , of third European countries which are being called on , or will be called on , to satisfy the so-called Copenhagen criteria ?
However , in taking stock today , we must be honest and say that the results are not particularly positive .
The provision of unanimity for the taking of measures and the suspension of an agreement will continue to cancel in practice any serious effort .
However , we must understand that the serious deficit in foreign policy and in human rights policy is due to and connected with the transnational character and unanimity provision , behind which hide national interests and various political expediencies and priorities .
The vows to remain true to the principle of the full unaccountability of the monopolies were repeated in an arrogant manner today by the President of the European Commission , Mr Barroso .
You are sowing winds and you are sure to reap hurricanes .     – Mr President , the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is calling for the withdrawal of the proposed Bolkestein directive and , in all events , we are seeking the abolition of the principle of the country of origin which is being maintained under the new name of the 'principle of the free provision of services ' .
The deliberate obscurity of the new wording throws wide open the doors to the negative interpretations by the Court of Justice of the European Communities about which Commissioner McGreevy spoke to us .
The fragile compromise between the European right and the socialists , under pressure from reactions and demonstrations by trades union , moderates but does not remove the neo-liberal philosophy and negative charge of the proposal .
