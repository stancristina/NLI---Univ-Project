agencies following the failure to decide about this matter at numerous summits .
A steady stream of new agencies is now being set up , and the good thing about these decentralised units is that they guarantee expertise , concentration upon a particular area and the arms-length principle when it comes to administration .
It is therefore good that , with this budget , Parliament has emphasised that we wish to have control over the development of the agencies in the future , and that we wish to have transparency .     Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the answers I have been given .
When the President-in-Office of the Council speaks of the exceptional circumstances in Italy and of this not having to create a precedent , I would ask if Italy has now itself implemented the common rules so that , form now on , the Italian milk producers too pay a special duty for exceeding the production quotas .     Mr President , many people have good experiences of using herbal medicine to supplement ordinary medicine and treatment .
The area of natural medicine is far from being fully charted .
There are presumably many good products around the world that we have still not used or with which we are unfamiliar in Europe .
We must not rule out the development of all these known and unknown ecologically sound medicinal preparations .
In Denmark , we obtained a similar regulation of herbal preparations a few years ago .
Well-educated and experienced therapists now complain about the lack of legal access to many important preparations for treating , for example , cancer and allergies .
The lack of respect for human rights is , for me , the main reason why we should not here and now remove the European embargo on the sale of weapons to China .
We do not believe the time is ripe .
We know that there are violations of fundamental freedoms , that torture and arbitrary imprisonments take place , that the Chinese authorities do not respect minorities and that many executions occur – more than in any other country in the world .
Are we to close our eyes to the fact that a dictatorship – China – is threatening one of the foremost democracies in the Far East , namely Taiwan ?
When it comes to human rights and democracy , Taiwan is exemplary , while China gives every cause for alarm .
Are we now to be involved in helping the Chinese to rearm ?
RC-B5-0543/2003 on the Members ’ Statute .
The present system , involving non-transparent and tax-free reimbursement of travel expenses , together with reimbursement of general expenses , is unacceptable .
It is not acceptable - for Danish MEPs’ remuneration to be increased by more than 50 % ; - for there still to be issued , alongside the reimbursement of actual travel expenses , a tax-free payment based on distance travelled and time spent on the journey ; - and for the reimbursement of general expenses ( at present approximately DKK 26 000 per month ) still to be paid out tax-free without having to be accounted for .
RC-B5-0543/2003 on the Members ’ Statute .
The present draft Members ’ Statute does not , however , solve the problems satisfactorily .
Because of the very different national schemes for MEPs and the majority’s unwillingness to draw a line under tax-free schemes , it would be most appropriate to leave it to each individual Member State or to the relevant parties/movements in each individual Member State to draw up proper rules for their Members of the European Parliament .     Today , the European Parliament agreed upon a resolution that may bring to an end this year’s debate concerning MEPs’ salary , pension and travel conditions .
With this agreement , the European Parliament has gone so far towards accommodating the Council that there is now finally the prospect of a Members ’ Statute .
I am very pleased about this outcome which means , for example , that MEPs will be obliged to account for their travel expenses .
The amount is a weighted average of the remuneration received by MEPs in the four largest countries .
In addition , it will be possible for the Member States to opt for their MEPs’ paying tax to the Member State .
This is a sensible compromise for which everyone has had to go right to the pain barrier .
At the moment , we see how more and more EU countries are introducing road tolls , often backed by different technical systems .
It is enough to look at the situation in Germany , which has come down unilaterally in favour of a particular system which is patently not operating as intended .
In connection with the German system , there was also another problem , namely that there were not enough boxes available , with the result that hauliers in different countries did not have the opportunity to have these boxes installed .
There is also something else we must avoid in the future .
I think that , in order to be focused upon its users , the system must also ensure , at a purely technical level , that hauliers and their drivers only have to install a single box in each vehicle .
It is also important that users be guaranteed access to a coherent network through a single contract relating to the overall network of roads involving tolls .
I therefore hope we obtain an agreement that puts users in the driving seat .
I am speaking on behalf of my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left .
As I myself read the proposal , however , it is a useful compromise in which Parliament has had a very large proportion of its wishes met
