International Labour Organisation standards and especially if they profit from this violation at the expense of employees themselves .
Commissioner , we can only welcome this text and thank Mrs Gillig for the work that she has done .
Today , in light of the growing threat from election results in favour of the far right in Europe , it is necessary , more than ever before , to show our determination to protect all the fundamental values and principles of our democratic system .
This 'anti-racism ' hysteria is the psychological level of the process whose aim is the general colonisation of Europe .
Unfortunately , I am unable to continue on this subject here , since the European Parliament 's administrative service has decided to cut down every explanation of vote that exceeds 200 words .
These measures would have had a detrimental effect on their relations , developed over some time , with the States from which these illegal immigrants originate .
The EU has an extremely urgent humanitarian duty , first and foremost , to increase security in a country that has been deeply scarred at every level by bullets , famine and mines .
In our view , this amounts to saying that those who do not have property or investments therefore only have the right to die , and Parliament will not even utter a word of protest .
Indeed , unit sales are increasing rapidly in a world where more and more people are living alone .
The progress made is clear to see .
The relationships between trade , development and poverty are complex , then , and we must avoid hasty judgments .
As regards future negotiations on investment , they may prove to be fruitful , but we would warn that direct investments very seldom reach the poorest countries and , when they do , it is in return for tax favours which harm these countries first of all .
Within the WTO , these relations do not actually take place with a view to achieving the priorities set by the United Nations , but are dominated by the 'give-and-take ' philosophy .
I therefore think that all this is positive and , although I do not share the same enthusiasm for Mr Deva 's proposals with regard to the role of multinationals , I believe that overall I will be able to support this report .
Commissioner , those affected by the American embargo in 1973 , as I was , are aware of the price of this reliance and cannot tolerate the level of risks run today .
Community production must regain a dominant share of the market in order to avoid risks relating to residues , contaminants or GMOs .
They suggest setting up a safety net in favour of oilseed and protein crop producers and lastly , undertaking the necessary research work into these crops .
Yet , we are not talking about staff who are attached to so-called privileges and who are unable to accept change : the very job of an air-controller involves constant development and change .
That is why , to put it frankly , if the texts do not make significant changes on these crucial issues , I will be unable to support them in their current form .
Mr President , Commissioner , if one reads the texts proposed by the Commission , one is led to believe that air navigation services might be subject to the Community 's economic rules , which would mean having to publish calls for tender for public services of this particular type .
My colleagues , Mrs Laguiller and Mrs Bordes , and I condemn the breaking up - planned by the Commission - of this public service in preparation to hand it over to private greed .
We must now wait for the next developments .
Radar , radio and information technology are the eyes and ears of air traffic controllers .
Therefore , using charges and applying the polluter pays principle is certainly a good initiative .
The choice of legal instrument that makes up the regulation plays a significant part in this .
The initial response was to reject the report .
Below cost sales is not an act of charity , but the taking over of a market share , which will have to be compensated elsewhere .
I think it is necessary to emphasise this and to reiterate that , without them , the diversity of supply and the guarantee of quality would disappear .
Every year , the European Union produces more than 60 million tonnes of waste packaging .
This is a na√Øve and dangerous assumption .
Creating a Single European Sky seems to me to be imperative if we want not only to optimise the use of our existing airspace , to establish more stringent aviation safety conditions , and the safe and effective management of projected increases in traffic , but also to create conditions allowing European airlines to compete with others .
We should think globally about the intermodality of transport .
.
That would amount to giving credit to the rapporteur when in fact this is the work of the committee .
The real needs of the world 's population are not even addressed .
These efforts will be in vain , however , if our negotiators do not commit themselves to defending our agricultural production with conviction on the international scene .
Many countries were affected by the Rhine and Meuse floods during the first half of the 1990s .
It is also clear that global thinking , either at world level or at European level , must be implemented in practical and local terms , in the field .
We considered it preferable to call upon a new , flexible instrument that could mobilise at least EUR 500 million in 2002 , and EUR 1000 million in future , which would be added to the Fund in case of a disaster .
