I agree with Mr Titley that we have seen this recently mainly over the issue of Turkey .
Total silence , tolerance and the shielding of Turkey .
Thank you very much for your answer , Mr Commissioner , which indeed was very full .
We are all unfortunately aware of the results of this three-year delay .
This then is my fear .
Mr President , I would like to return to the issue of employment since I think it is a fact that the policies are deflationary , and we should take heed of the United States which is talking of the danger - not of inflation or overheating - but of the freezing of the economy , and I do not know where EMU is taking us in today 's conditions .
Why am I saying all this ?
The new prospects for commerce and economic life may keep people in the peripheral regions .
I think that is the desire of all of us in this House .
I also believe that we must ensure that there is information available in as many languages as possible , because this is an issue which is related to equality of opportunity , to enable everyone to have access to this new world which is being opened up .
The histories of Britain and Cyprus were closely linked and to some extent parallel for several centuries .
On the threshold of the new century , the European Union faces many other problems , but entertains many visions too .
And that is not all .
Mr President , I congratulate and thank our rapporteur , Mrs Susan Waddington , on an excellent report characterized - as Susan 's work is always characterized - by completeness , perspicacity , and political and social sensitivity .
Reorientation of our approach to work and hence to vocational training as well , is a demand of our times .
Here are two fundamental thoughts : I believe that in the effort , which Susan 's report mentions analytically , to develop special methods and surveys , we could see , and you too , Madam Commissioner , could look into how to make the best use of Cedefop in Thessaloniki to carry out such surveys .
And as a last additional thought , I would like to mention that in the Eastern European area and in anticipation of enlargement , both during this transitional phase of intensified pre-accession procedures and in the long term with the future prospect of the new countries , we should already be considering how to extend vocational training to make it accessible to all .
Alongside the important vulnerable and particularly sensitive categories , such as women , I want to point to three other important categories , which other speakers too have mentioned .
Mr President , it is very sad that the fate of the Kurds started to preoccupy the European Union more intensely mainly only after a small part of the problem began being exported to the West .
And as has already been said , we are speaking of 20 million people .
Now , of course , things have changed .
I would like the President-in-Office of the Council to follow my speech .
To continue , then .
And my question to Mr Henderson - to which I would like an answer - is whether the General Affairs Council of 26 and 27 January will go to the roots of the problem and whether the proposal made by the Italian Government for an international conference on the Kurdish problem is to be discussed .
However , the European Union is supposedly structured on the basis of the principles of democracy and representation .
The government itself , the socialist government , appointed Greece 's delegates four years ago on the basis of the same results of the local elections , in accordance with which our party , the official opposition , had four delegates .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to ask the President-in-Office : does he not think that a precedent is created by this decision so that everyone can do what they like ?
I am not one to encourage interference in my country 's internal affairs , especially by English representatives , because we have bitter and painful experience of their interference .
So what is happening among those elected ?
Are some considered 'dirty ' and are not , therefore , put forward by the government , while others are 'clean' , in other words party members , and those are the ones put forward ?
I believe this is an issue which , if it is as important as Mr Hatzidakis thinks , should have been debated there .
In any case , I do not think there is a problem about this , as Mr Hatzidakis has tried to represent here , which he ought not to have done .
I think it is very satisfactory and complete , to the extent that it deals with general principles .
Yet , Mr President , that decision and that action we wish to undertake for the future would be pointless unless its scope is world-wide , and in particular , unless it extends to countries which have the ability to go down that road , most of all the United States , where there is a legal vacuum on the subject .
Mr President , from a scientific point of view , considering the cloning of humans by the method used with the now famous Dolly , it must be said that the experiment of creating her was the only one to succeed among very many failures .
Mr President , we still have to consider the ethical , legal and social aspects of the problem , because if cloning is applied to mankind this essentially opens the way towards eugenics .
Will special permits be needed ?
