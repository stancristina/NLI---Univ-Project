Liberal Democrats in this House are proud that three of the authors of today 's reports , Mrs Malmstr√∂m , Mrs Haarder and Baroness Ludford have grappled with these issues and given the House these reports today .
We live in hope that the twentieth century , which Europe has soaked in blood , can give way to a twenty-first century in which the power , the genius and the enthusiasm of humankind can be applied to the construction of a more just , peaceful and sustainable world .
Mr President , this report builds on previous excellent work in the European Parliament and other EU institutions .
Its starting point is the European Year Against Racism 1997 but the context has moved on significantly .
I very much welcome the positioning of the fight against race discrimination firmly in a human rights context by placing it in this joint debate because that is very much the approach taken in this report .
The first theme highlighted is that in the last year we have established two facts in law and in practice .
The first is the legal competence of the European Union to fight racism .
The second is the fact that race discrimination is a breach of a fundamental right and European Union law .
This is reflected in the confirmation through the accession process , not least the Commission communication on which Mr Belder has reported , and I congratulate him , that respect for racial equality and minority rights falls within the Copenhagen criteria .
Could I just say as an aside that the ELDR amendments to Mr Belder ' s report amplify rather than conflict with his report and were tabled because , unfortunately , the Citizens Rights Committee opinion was not voted on in the Foreign Affairs Committee .
The second theme emphasised in my report is to positively welcome diversity as a source of social vitality , economic prosperity and international influence .
European identity is not a homogenous white culture and it can , and must , expand to encompass the experience and culture of minority communities .
Thirdly my report notes that racial prejudice and discrimination poisons our whole society , including for white people .
Surveys show that racism has increased and there is an increase in racist violence and support for extremist parties .
On the other hand there is also progress , however bumpy , and some regions and cities in Europe are becoming at ease with a multi-racial and multi-cultural way of life .
I would cite London , which I represent , as the multi-racial capital of Europe .
Certainly I believe we need to talk a lot about racism and diversity and identity , not sideline the issues or talk in code .
Some may find the language in my report blunt and it is certainly intended to be clear and unambiguous .
This report stresses a rights-based approach and particularly welcomes the prospect of EU anti-discrimination legislation based on Article 13 and other legal measures such as enhanced rights for third country nationals .
But that cannot be the end of the story and there are measures proposed in the field of education , media and politics , and justice in policing , immigration and asylum policy , which would be aimed to back up the implementation of legislation .
Could I just address three aspects which I understand caused some difficulty for some Members of the EPP-ED Group .
The first is the mention of Austria and the entry of Haider ' s party into government and recalling the Parliament ' s decision in February .
I have to say that it would be perverse to discuss the European Union ' s strengthened response to racism without referring to recent developments which have been a landmark in establishing that the European Union is a community of values based on respect for human rights .
The second area where there are apparently EPP-ED hesitations is regarding enhanced rights for legally resident third country nationals of which there are around 20 million in the Union .
My understanding is that there is nothing in this report that the EPP has not been able to accept in the past .
The third area which I understand creates some problems for the EPP-ED Group is the belief that this report breaches subsidiarity by mentioning matters like education and policing .
But as I said in opening , the combination of Articles 6 and 7 , Article 13 and Article 29 of the Treaties have established that the combating of race discrimination is an objective and a competence of the European Union including the area of policing .
There are a few of the EPP-ED amendments which I can accept although it is perhaps a pity that they did not make more input at committee stage .
Could I appeal to Members of that group to deal with their points of disagreement by making explanations of vote .
I believe this report will get majority support here in plenary .
It was adopted by a large majority in committee and some of the supporters of the Conservatives and Christian Democrats may not appreciate their failure to be part of that majority .
Could I just finally say that I can accept some of the amendments from the Green Group and the GUE , particularly the one which I welcome to replace the term "holocaust " by " Shoah " .
There is some confusion from the GUE Group about the purpose of ethnic monitoring which is simply to collect statistics on the progress of ethnic minorities so as to be a basis for future policy .
It is not in order to identify discrimination and I hope they will understand if I reject their amendments on that .
I hope very much that the report will get a large majority when
