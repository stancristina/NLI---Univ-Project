in which the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund interventions laid down by the 1999 regulations was actually implemented .
We cannot conceal our fear that the delays that affected the implementation of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund resources in 2000 might jeopardise the attainment of the goals charted for the crucial 2002-2006 programming period , and that is without even considering the measures from the previous periods .
I will end with ISPA , which would appear to be the reason my report has been slipped into the enlargement melting pot .
The quality of the European Union 's politics must be enhanced too , and the Union must become more than just a large market .
We have already , on other occasions , requested increasingly careful monitoring of the committed resources on the part of the Commission , and this is becoming still more urgent and pressing if we consider that prolonging access to the Cohesion Fund in this way to improve implementation of structural measures in the candidate countries must be seen as a completely new strategy and that it therefore cannot be understood to be a permanent facility .
I would like to focus on the factors which might have been slightly overlooked .
The issue of upstream decisions , with which our citizens are quite unfamiliar and to which they are largely opposed , was mentioned just now , and rightly so .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mr Brok and the many speakers who have helped to present the report before us today on their work .
I share the position of the many Members who have called for caution and rigour as well as boldness when we bring the accession process to a close for each individual country .
It is for precisely this reason that we both fully support the political decision and advocate caution and the need for rigorous respect for the acquis .
We only hope that this condition , which remains binding in environmental matters , will , at last , be fulfilled by the ' Better regulation ' initiatives launched by the Commission in recent days .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on focusing on the priority of accessibility , particularly accessibility for the elderly and people with disabilities .
Indeed , ' Bulgaria continues to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria ? , as stated in the original English version , as opposed to 'is striving to fulfil ? them .
The trial is in progress and the defendant is in danger of being sentenced to 15 years .
These are their crimes : taking part in political meetings not authorised by the regime .
As I have informed the group chairmen , as of 5 p.m. today I have started a hunger strike and , as of tomorrow , I will refuse liquids as well , to ensure that , in view of the seriousness of the accusation , the motion is included on the agenda of the forthcoming Conference of Presidents on 4 July .
In principle , Community assistance is currently restricted to 10 % of overall costs , with the exception of Galileo , which can receive up to 20 % of its funding from the Community .
The Commission estimates that if the rate of funding does not increase between now and 2010 , there is a very strong likelihood that the network will not be fully completed , in particular the railway components .
As a result , Community support would be increased from 10 % to 20 % in order to have a leverage effect and to attract private investors in particular .
Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 establish the general framework , restoring the balance of the Commission 's proposal , which tended to emphasise the importance solely of projects involving the candidate countries .
I hope that , although this presentation has been brief due to time constraints , it has covered all the salient points , and I hope that we will succeed in completing the development of the TENs both for our own sakes and , above all , for the future of Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , I feel that the rapporteurs - Mr Turchi and the draftsman of the opinion - have done a good job of improving on the Commission 's proposal .
To improve this situation , the Commission is going to present an implementation schedule as of this year .
SAB 2 , and SAB 3 as well - which will be dealt with today - have , in actual fact , returned to the Member States a total amount of almost EUR 14 billion of payment appropriations which were not spent in the previous year .
If the situation improves , it will be due not least to the work of the shadow rapporteurs for the budget , which is not always obvious .
We are all aware of the difficulties involved in the management of the budgetary procedure and the pressure on those who are responsible for it each year .
It is better to be bold now than to be sorry later .
This is what I wanted to emphasise in this debate in which both the Commission and Parliament have a back seat .
The Commission and Spain have established a method that can , I hope , be applied by all future Presidencies .
We are gradually overcoming the potential obstacles to a definitive decision on enlargement .
Experience teaches us that we can only make coherent progress by setting definite dates .
Ladies and gentlemen , as it draws near , enlargement is generating a wave of reform throughout the entire Union .
A coordinated and concerted approach is therefore vital in the streamlining processes underway in all the institutions .
