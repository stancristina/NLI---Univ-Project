Why are you rejecting it ?
Tobacco growing has been reduced by 30 % and along with it the number of those employed has fallen by 33 % .
Mr Fischler , you know as well as I do and as well as all of us here , that in those regions it is not possible to grow alternative crops .
I have not heard you put an end to the buying of dairy products because they raise cholesterol levels .
I would like to say to you that the latest statistics from the United States show that the way in which the campaign is being conducted - this American hysteria which has now inundated Europe -, instead of reducing smoking , is increasing smoking among young people .
Let us not create conditions like the prohibition in America .
This is the model of the agricultural policy of the European Union that Mr Fischler told us about this morning .
I have a number of recommendations , which I shall not elaborate on as I do not have the time , as you say .
Secondly , farmers will revolt and take a stand against it , and arbitrary and violent measures , such as those implemented in Greece , with 10 000 farmers taken to court and punished with stringent penalties , will not be enough .
We see this happening in agriculture too .
In this sense I think that we must support the Cunha report and oppose the Commission proposals for the enlargement 2000 programme .
This is described quite rightly in the Cunha report .
There is a danger that we will identify , at a financial level , the policy to develop the countryside with the common agricultural policy , and we are facing the possibility that the CAP will be assimilated and fragmented in the long term within the frameworks of other policies , such as the policy for the regions , for example .
Thirdly , we must look again at the issue of parity when looking both at the different sectors of European agriculture and the different regions of the European agricultural area .
Finally , we must look carefully at the source of financing for the area of enlargement which concerns the modernization of the agricultural sector of the applicant countries .
Madam Commissioner , the efforts of the European Union to achieve economic and social cohesion within its borders must continue unabated while there remain substantial inequalities at both regional and national level and while such tendencies are , in certain cases , on the increase , despite the significant steps that have been taken towards achieving nominal convergence .
The Community budget , up to 1.27 % of Community GDP , of which 0.46 % is allocated to structural policies , may well prove to be inadequate in the future to cover satisfactorily both existing and new countries and policies .
The share of financing for these regions must remain high , while they must be even higher for island regions due to the special problems they face , as recognised moreover by Article 130a of the Amsterdam Treaty .
The implementation of an integrated policy , based on this provision in the new Treaty , is also necessary for the islands , in order to deal with the special problems that arise because of their island status .
I would like to finish by stressing that in the future there must still be a Cohesion Fund for the financing of large structural projects in the fields of transport and the environment , in which countries with a per capita GDP lower than 90 % of the Community average must once again be able to participate .
Have the Commission services not informed the Commission that use is being made of Community resources for government propaganda and for the promotion of ministers ?
There was a programme , Commissioner , in which there was not a single representative of the New Democracy Party , which is the second largest party in the Greek Parliament , representing 38 % of the electorate , and we did not have a representative .
I will conclude by asking you this : do you know whether , in the regional business programmes , the regulations concerning the allocation of advertisement slots to advertising companies have been complied with ?
I very much thank the Commissioner for the comprehensive reply that he has given me and for giving me the opportunity to make the rejoinder which is at the very heart of the debate .
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner how he would comment on the great devastation that has befallen the Parthenon marbles and which was revealed last week in the British press .
It is a sensitive issue which must affect every civilized person and this Community as an organization , since much has been declared about respect for our cultural heritage , which in this case is at risk , not only from the event that Mr Alavanos referred to and which was denounced in the English press , but also because of the fact that these marbles do not have independent artistic value .
I would ask you , as the European Parliament , to address the matter more courageously and more realistically , regardless of the cooperation you may ensure with other organizations .
I would next like to thank the Commissioner for the reply he gave to my question and to simply say to him that I understand the reply .
I will say that , before September , as you have said , they must put forward the proposal in any way they think necessary .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think that today 's debate shows that we all agree that our problem is no longer what is happening in
