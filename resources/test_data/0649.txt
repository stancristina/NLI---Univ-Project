state under conditions of globalisation can only be achieved with radical reforms of employment relations , and the group that considers that the Lisbon Strategy can be implemented under conditions of globalisation without abolishing the social state .
I consider that differences of opinion are the basic privilege of democracy and hence the foundation stone of our Union .
Despite the fight against unemployment , the minor successes achieved are not enough to combat this major problem .
Farmers worry about the reform of the common agricultural policy .
The reason is obvious : there is a serious crisis of confidence between politicians and employment relation theoreticians .
It is respect for the principles on which the European construct was founded : the principles of equality and solidarity .
However , whenever the voice of the people was ignored , tensions and reversals swept away both theories and theoreticians .
This choice forms part of the more general anti-grass roots policy of the ΕU , as applied to maritime cabotage in Regulation (EC ) No 3577/92 on the responsibility of the Nea Dimokratia and Panellinio Socialistiko Kinima governments in our country , in collusion with shipowners , with painful consequences for workers in maritime and shore transport , professional artisans and small and medium-sized farm owners .
Today 's report has several positive proposals in this direction .
This is also the main element of the capitalist system , which is why it is barbaric and inhumane .
The slow rate of the structural reforms ordered by the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy is presented as the cause of the debt and deficit .
This policy is inhumane and must be overturned .
So who is talking about human rights ?
Those who based their wealth on the natives in their colonies for centuries on end ?
Those who support and coexist with dictators who torture their people in order to invade another country ?
Or is that not what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq ?
Who is talking ?
On the essence of the proposal , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , I should like to say , as regards the instrument for stability , that the codecision procedure – which is now accepted by all sides – is certainly , legally speaking , the right procedure .
I wish , of course , to congratulate all the rapporteurs , especially Mr Szent-Iványi , to whose report I devoted most time , both for the fact that he was extremely cooperative throughout the procedure in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , and for the proposals which he formulated .
In other words , I consider that the agreement made – take heed – is important and I trust that it will be applied in the best possible way .     – Madam President , today 's commitment by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that the Commission is prepared to submit a proposal for a separate financing instrument in favour of democracy and human rights is already a positive development .
I wish to say and to point out to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner that the new financing programme for democracy and human rights which she submits – and this is a particularly important and sensitive point – will need to include financing for the rehabilitation centres for the victims of torture inside or outside the European Union .
I agree with the Elles proposals on ensuring the qualitative value of every last euro , especially in view of the new nature of the challenges , which we have met so far calmly and without vision .
Unfortunately , Commissioner , 0.99 % in payments for 2007 raises once again the tragedy of narrow margins for the realisation of our European vision .
It is equally important for the European Union to assume its share of the very heavy political responsibility for tolerating the causes of serious climate changes over recent decades .
The geographical scope must be reviewed , in order to ensure support is extended to other countries beyond our immediate neighbours .
The fund regulation does not appear to take account of cumulative disasters or prolonged events during which a disaster develops gradually , such as drought .
We expect far more , not only as the European left , but also as European citizens .     – Mr President , at a time when Euroscepticism is intensifying in certain Member States , I believe that the European Union cannot remain indifferent towards the problem of natural disasters and indifferent towards the citizens affected by them .
Consequently , we need a global strategy for addressing such problems .
The matters which we examine in the Berend report will proceed under the codecision procedure and , consequently , Parliament will fight to the end ; however , on the matters addressed in the Galeote report , I think that Parliament should not lower the flag either .
They are important to the citizens , they are matters which concern their daily lives and we need to fight to the end and put pressure on the Commission and the Council to proceed in the direction that we are calling for .     – Mr President , the citizens affected by natural disasters , by nature itself , should not find themselves up against the indifference of national and Community governments or the absence of integrated support programmes .
Firstly I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs and to say that the report by Mr Capoulas Santos , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , is balanced as regards the way in which the problems and proposals are formulated .
It endeavours to present it like a global trustee and defender of human rights , an 'exporter ' of democracy to the world .
The references in the report to poverty , the environment , employment rights and so forth are an insult to the peoples groaning beneath imperialist sovereignty and capitalist exploitation .
