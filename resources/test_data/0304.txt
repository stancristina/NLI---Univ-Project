I was impressed by the Commissioner 's balanced response to this question but it does not fit particularly well with the UK Government 's proposal that the secret services - MI5 and MI6 - should perform surveillance of all Internet traffic .
They intend to demand the surrender of encryption codes and to penalise those who fail to surrender them even if the codes have been lost and are unobtainable .
Does the Commission consider that this proposal is , firstly , consistent with civil rights , as enunciated for the Community , and , secondly , in the interests of the development of Internet use in the European Union , as rhetorically advocated by everyone , including in particular the British Prime Minister ?
Question No 31 by (H-0540/00 ) : Subject : Developing countries and farm animal welfare What steps is the Commission taking , both through the Community ' s development programme and its influence on the world stage , to encourage developing countries not to adopt industrial animal husbandry systems , as these pose serious threats to poverty alleviation , the environment , human health and animal welfare in developing countries ?
I thank the Commissioner for that helpful answer and I am very pleased to hear that these issues are being taken seriously .
I wonder though if the Commissioner would say whether or not he would agree that intensive agriculture is not likely to be the way forward for north or south when we consider that the world population at the end of this century will be 10 billion .
If they were all to aspire to eat a US diet we would need four planets the size of earth to produce the extra 9 billion tonnes of grain required .
And , in particular , would he agree , or disagree with the FAO when they say that the trend of further intensification of demand in production is inescapable ?
I find that a very worrying statement coming out of the Food and Agriculture authority and would like to know very much whether or not the Commissioner agrees that such intensification is inevitable or would he agree that there are other alternatives and that those are alternatives that all of us ought to be promoting and pursuing ?
Mr President , what exactly does the Commission consider to be defined , and I quote from the question , as 'industrial animal-husbandry systems ' .
Would it not be unreasonable to discourage developing countries from employing modern , efficient , cost-effective and humane systems of animal husbandry ?
Well that did not hurt , did it ?
I have been waiting for that reply since 2 February and I simply cannot understand why it has taken the Commission so long to come up with that negative .
I accept the negative , but the fact of the matter is that I am a Member of the European Parliament .
I have been waiting five months for that reply .
Why ?
Mr President , the idea that is fundamental to the report that I am bringing forward is that the proposal from the European Commission for a recommendation on this subject should be changed to become a directive and , as you will see from my report , this secured near unanimous backing in the Environment Committee .
The members of the committee agreed with me that a recommendation is far too weak an instrument in this instance .
I suppose a recommendation is really rather the equivalent of us all moving down into the centre of Strasbourg and attending the cathedral in order to make an act of collective prayer .
That really is all that a recommendation is .
There is no way in which the European Commission can go back to Member States and say that they have not complied with a recommendation because a recommendation merely says that they may do something , it does not say that they must do something .
The Commission is very worried about this report because it recognises that if we persist in insisting on a directive rather than a recommendation , the whole thing may founder in the Council .
I recognise the Commission 's worries .
I did faithfully try in the Environment Committee to get the members to agree to a recommendation rather than a directive .
I got a very rude answer from them which I will not repeat to you but which is basically reflected in my report .
They want a directive and not a recommendation .
And , indeed , if the guidelines on environmental inspection which the Commission is so keen to see survive were incorporated in a recommendation , my committee feels that they will simply be ignored .
We want to see a directive which definitely commits the Member States to introduce environmental inspections operating on broadly similar lines .
I must underline that what we do not want to see , in case anybody hangs this round my neck , is a supra-national European environment inspectorate : lots of little men and women in blue uniforms with gold stars rushing round the Member States , reporting back to Brussels saying this is wrong or indeed , in the case of Germany , this is right .
We do not need that kind of supra-national inspectorate .
I believe , and my committee agrees with me , that the primary responsibility for enforcing European Union environment legislation should be firmly lodged where it belongs , with the Member States .
We cannot understand the Commission 's readiness to propose only the minimum possible .
Neglect of European Union environment law forms an alarming background to this proposal .
Yesterday was a historic day in the history of the European Union , not , I hasten to add only because of the visit of President Chirac to Strasbourg , but because
