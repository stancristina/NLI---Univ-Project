which took place at the mini-session in Brussels immediately following these events .
Angola , for example , has powerful armed forces which could have given valuable assistance , or Zimbabwe , just next door , or Nigeria , which has an operational air force .
We know this is not the situation in Mozambique , as poor as the country may be .
We do not yet know the final toll for this disaster .
First of all , we must provide relief and restore hope to the people of Mozambique .
In addition , in cooperation with the local authorities and other countries and organisations , particularly the United Nations , the European Union can make a serious effort to organise and support the reconstruction of Mozambique .
For days there were only seven helicopters trying to bring those people the aid they need , while governments remained silent and the whole world looked on , anguished and appalled .
It is not just the extent of this disaster , and its expression in terms of the number of dead , communities stranded , children with nothing to eat , the destruction of homes and property , or the belated aid many have spoken of today , that arouse our sympathy .
What we really need are measures aimed at effecting a sea change in the underlying causes of the conditions which allow these phenomena to spread .
In our opinion , the main criticism of this proposal for a Commission regulation relates to the opening up of a budget line to non-agricultural organisations and also the reduction in budget appropriations to EUR 4 500 000 .
With our amendment , we hope to see Community cofinancing rise above 75 % for organisations representing small farmers and family-run farms in financial difficulty .
The fact is that the system of aid established in 1989 has been modified several times , but no report has been presented on the application of the present system .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to reiterate the words of Mr Miller , who spoke earlier - and who is regrettably no longer in the Chamber - when he criticised the authors of this question by saying that our main task is to ensure that the rules are complied with .
This subject is obviously a delicate one , and its development has been discussed at great length over the years , with many rules being regularly revised , but what we cannot accept is that the revision of these rules and the development of the bureaucracy always hit the most needy .
Madam President , Commissioner , I wish to congratulate the Commission on this initiative , which I believe to be extremely important .
The Council also heard a Commission communication on this subject yesterday , and I believe that it is becoming crucial to ensure that the hushkits issue is incorporated into a broader strategy for building a new Europe in this area .
Thirdly , development in the future , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , of guidelines for the sustainable development of airports , as an objective basis for the measures to be adopted by the competent authorities , taking into account the needs of communities living close to airports .
To this end , the Council yesterday unanimously agreed upon the flexible framework essential for reaching agreement in these negotiations .
- ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to emphasise that relations with the Mediterranean countries are a priority that has been specifically included in the Portuguese presidency ' s work programme for this six-month period .
As to establishing a free trade area , which is another area in the process of Mediterranean relations , we feel that this should not be seen as an end in itself , but as a means of improving our citizens ' living conditions and of increasing their level of income .
In our opinion , the proposed mechanisms would go some way towards achieving this .
With regard to the role of the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy , which was mentioned in one of the questions to Council , I would like to confirm that the European Union attaches the greatest importance to promoting a coherent and comprehensive policy for the Mediterranean region .
By this I mean that if the common strategy does nothing more than repeat what is in the Barcelona Process , we will gain no added value in terms of a coherent EU policy towards our southern partners .
A further meeting is due to be held here in Brussels in the next few days .
Furthermore , the southern Mediterranean countries have acknowledged this themselves and unless this work towards interregional cooperation in the southern Mediterranean takes place , the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation process cannot succeed .
For this to be achieved , the will to succeed must be present on both sides .
The countries of the southern Mediterranean have to understand that we must be in a position to guarantee equal treatment and that delaying tactics cannot be used to gain advantages in agreements signed at a later stage .
We think that this is of the utmost importance .
Something that should be borne in mind is that the visibility and the presence of the EU in the Middle East peace process should be what the partners in this peace process wish them to be , rather than being visible in the way some countries might wish them to be .
This effort led to the meeting of the Ministerial Steering Group which took place on 1 February , at which the go-ahead was given for most of the multilateral groups to restart their activities as normal this spring .
