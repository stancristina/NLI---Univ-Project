Today , Fatah is regarded as one of our partners ; it was once seen as the terrorist organisation par excellence .
( Applause from the left ) on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that we can all agree that what we have heard today is an analysis .
That means that financial assistance , humanitarian aid and political initiative are called for , and if those things are not forthcoming , then , month after month , there will be weepings and lamentations when we meet here .
I thought it was very good that the Commissioner expressed himself very clearly in this connection : that is precisely what is needed .
Mr President , Commissioner , Chairman , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for his speech clarifying the current position of the Commission on this subject .
It will contribute to the development of European security and defence policy , thus bringing about progress in what is traditionally a core domain of national sovereignty .
It is absolutely essential that observance of embargos be made one of the key criteria for export licensing in an arms-trade treaty .
We all know that we were subject to certain constraints .
The direct neighbours of the European Union play a particularly important role with regard to the security of the Union .
During the German presidency , human-rights issues relating to Uzbekistan have also played a key role in the deliberations of the Subcommittee on Justice and Home Affairs .
It should be particularly useful in that , when the report of the expert group is presented , we shall have the facts on the table and be able to assess whether or not there are obstacles , as it were , to the functioning of the internal market , and what has been the impact on certain sectors to which reduced rates have applied in the past .
This subject was also discussed at an informal meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Oslo on 26-27 April .
Mr Rübig , a lengthy debate has certainly been held in the European Union and in the Member States regarding the transposition of relevant directives .
Naturally , we are aware of the debates which have taken place in the European Parliament and the resolutions adopted by this House .
Military or defence policy-related operations cannot be financed from Community funds .
This contrasts distinctly with the successful conclusion of the EU visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Russia which will be put into effect from 1 June this year , as well as the EU negotiations with Ukraine completed in 2006 , and negotiations with Moldova launched early this year .
The future for the people of Cuba should not be limited to two alternatives : either continuing with Communism or being taken over by the government in Miami .
It takes decades to build up trust but it can be destroyed overnight .
This is of extreme importance for all who will stand before the citizens of Europe .
( Applause ) In the spheres of justice and internal affairs , an area in which people are extremely interested , important progress is being made , for example in the common fight against cross-border crime .
At the same time , many Member States thought it important to give more recognition to the role of national parliaments .
This facilitates increased police cooperation in the cross-border fight against terrorism , criminality and illegal migration in the EU.
The Reform Treaty is necessary so that Europe can hold its course .
We have taken many significant steps forward .
The Polish Government - not the Polish people , who , contrary to their government , are pro-European - should remember that in its history Poland had the liberum veto .
Congratulations !
It is very good to hear the plaudits being shared out more widely today .
We are not forced to stay together for ever .
Then this eventually finds , surprise , surprise , that genetically modified maize is lethal , and woe betide anyone who finds that suspect !
There are alarming concerns in the Member States .
That is a very crucial question , to which we need an answer ! ( The President cut off the speaker ) on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , indisputably , we have raised a very difficult issue with critical European infrastructures .
We are trying to fight people 's disaffection with Europe with things they do not at all want , but the statesmen are often unwilling to bring in the things the public really wants .
The Directive is a law for a free internal market for services .
Unfortunately , the complete deletion of the paragraph headed ' Regulation of the separation between network and operation ' could not be pushed through .
Nevertheless , there is still disagreement over the means , and the precise extent of this .
This is a good decision , including in terms of the future , that enables a more flexible response to capacity bottlenecks in infrastructure .
Both sides have a great deal at stake .
Let me explain why : China is a win-win culture , a culture that strives to achieve harmony .
However , there is a good deal in the mandate .
If we have greater economic growth - which we do , there are more jobs , and the reforms are taking effect , in fact thanks to Gerhard Schröder 's Government , they are already having an impact in my country - if we have more jobs , then there is one thing we need above all : for that growth to be sustainable
