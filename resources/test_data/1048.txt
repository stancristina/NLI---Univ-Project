all we can in universities to ensure that teachers are trained in media education .
Certainly , as Mr Barzanti said , what we must do here is to stress and not abandon the achievements of traditional copyright in the Berne Convention .
It is understandable that people wish to secure more protection for the individual through controls .
How will Europe participate in this ?
In all the countries of the European Union , we need public service broadcasting , and of course private broadcasting as well .
I said on that occasion too that it is not very helpful for us to create images of an enemy , and to extol public service broadcasting as the only true guardian of broadcasting culture .
To enable competition to take place on equal terms , including the financial conditions , the Commission must therefore make it clear that the funding of public service broadcasting through fees paid by the users and/or some form of mixed financing does not contravene the aid provisions of the Treaty .
I would ask you all to look at public service broadcasting just as critically as private broadcasting .
We have held a policy debate on the basis of a first draft by my colleague Mr Monti , in which there were not many supporters for the approach .
The Commission is not demonizing either public or private broadcasting .
Thirdly , on many points it dwells too much on questions of implementation , the responsibility for which lies with the Member States , thereby infringing the principle of subsidiarity and undermining the rights of national parliaments .
The workers concerned receive vastly inadequate recompense for the value of their work ; and local companies cannot compete with cut-price offers resulting from wage dumping .
I would also ask the House to reject tomorrow the three amendments which have been tabled .
I hope that the entry into force of the posting directive will send out a clear social message , and that the people of the Union will pay heed to it .
They earn between DM 5 and DM 8 per hour , and live in shacks or porta cabins in very cramped conditions .
The main cause of the wage and social dumping which is evident in some of the so-called high-wage countries is in fact the alarming rise in illegal terms of employment .
Work-sharing is a defensive strategy ; to defeat unemployment we need new , competitive jobs .
We also favour a smooth transition to retirement and part-time work for older workers .
Mr Rocard 's proposals represent a significant component of a European policy on employment .
For that reason , the process is sometimes quite lengthy , but there is no question about the importance that we attach to Parliament 's right of initiative : we know how valuable it is .
Where matters are covered by general legislation - for example , every Member State has rules against misleading advertising - it is clear that such laws also apply to camping and caravan sites .
So this is also something that we have to bear in mind , but on the point at issue there is absolutely no dispute between us .
As provided for in the OECD agreement , such decisions can be raised in the Parties Group if there is any doubt as to whether they are compatible with the agreement .
This is essentially obvious - but it is not meaningless .
Under the OECD agreement , subsidies of this kind are no longer allowed .
If you have a question for the Council , then put it to the Council , and the Council will give you information about the protocols .
A similarity between somato salm and BST was the reason for the negative opinion delivered by the Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products .
That is the procedure .
Obtaining approval necessitates a whole series of tests , which are very time-consuming , and it may turn out that half the term of the patent , or more , has elapsed by the time the drug goes on the market .
As for strengthening competitiveness , that is one of the aims of EU industrial policy .
This will mean more participants in the market , with a wider range of services and more customers .
That would probably be the optimum solution , but it would require the good will of all concerned .
If there is not , then introducing it is probably the only step that we can take .
What is not addressed by either the report or today 's debate , in my opinion , is the question of what to do about non-wage labour costs in Europe , which are a major element in the cost of labour .
We should not raise workers ' expectations too high , for example with rigid - but mistaken - mathematical formulae such as : 10 % less working time equals 10 % more jobs .
This distinction is logically incomprehensible in the context of a single , comprehensive regulation .
It will be no help for us to regulate transport better .
It is falcons which have ensured the survival of many birds of prey .
We know that there are more than 800 different pesticides , and many of these substances have carcinogenic or mutagenic effects and weaken the immune system .
Back in 1991 , a cost-benefit analysis in the USA showed that 90 % of all pesticides were superfluous .
What we are talking about today concerns consumers in the internal market .
That is why we should recommend retaining the present system for assessing residues individually .
Is Europe there for the people or the people for Europe ?
The Member States , the governments will have to learn that democracy does not interfere with the development of Europe but is essential to it
