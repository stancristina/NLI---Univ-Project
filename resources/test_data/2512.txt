Let us now realise what humiliation and arrogance from those with power and wealth can result in .
Let us put behind us what the cartoons initiated .
Let it be the last thing to cause provocation , and let the next step unite us to build a stronger dialogue – critical , open , permanent and constructive .     .
Mr President , today the core message from Liberals and Democrats is to safeguard and defend freedom of speech , not only in Europe but also in Kabul and Tehran .
That we have seen examples of a European company boycotting Danish goods is unfortunate and not a sign of European solidarity .
However , Muslims should recognise that the global tensions have merely increased support for far-right , anti-immigration parties and have been abused by extremists in and outside Europe .
We must not let extremists triumph at the expense of the moderate majority , and we must stand together in respect for Article 11 of the Treaty to condemn violence and intimidation against Member States .
Censorship and other preventive measures shall never again be introduced’ .
Such a move would contravene the constitutional basis of many liberal democracies and is an invitation to criminalise freedom of thought on a global scale .
However , complaints must be handled through the appropriate legal channels .
In a civilised society , offence can never be grounds for violence .
In a secular , democratic society such as our own , freedom of the press must remain paramount , for it is this freedom that reinforces the principles of democracy and pluralism on which our Union is founded and which are universally acknowledged in international conventions .
This is not to say that freedom of the press should mean total freedom to cause offence .
However , Liberals and Democrats are convinced that the current situation cannot be resolved by the ‘thought police’ , but only through dialogue .
But , Mr Frattini , we draw the line at supporting your proposed code of conduct for the press , and we encourage Mr Solana to draw exactly the same line .
Before I close in Danish , I just want to thank personally the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , and my colleagues here in this Chamber for showing their solidarity .
It is , however , a right that must be neither called into question nor compromised .
We have every reason to expect the opposite to be the case .
President Lukashenko will do everything to defend his position and consolidate his dictatorship .
The opposition has been deprived of equal opportunities to send out its political messages , and the election campaign by the candidate for the united opposition , Mr Milinkevich , is shaping up to be a very difficult one .
I want , however , to make a special plea for Belarus not to be forgotten after the election .
I would thank Commissioner Borg for his undertaking to pursue just such a strategy .     Madam President , quite a few countries have stated that the European Investment Bank could provide loans of up to EUR 10 billion for research purposes or for research and innovation .
I am very interested to know how this is to be managed and how coherence is to be ensured between various research efforts : those using structural funds resources , those made at national level and those made in the EU generally .
A second question concerns the amounts from the structural funds that one might imagine being set aside for research , compared with the amounts available under the Seventh Framework Programme ?
If need be , these dimensions might , moreover , be taken into account with the help of State aid .
Firstly , the conditions of competition must not be repudiated .
Secondly , the aid must be in keeping with the common agricultural policy in general and , thirdly , such aid must of course be compatible with the international commitments we have entered into .
In this connection , I could mention our WTO agreement on agriculture .
According to this agreement , it will be possible to grant limited and specific State aid of no more than EUR 350 per hectare to sugar beet producers in Finland , with a maximum of EUR 90 million per year being specifically targeted at the EU’s ‘outermost regions’ .
In the case of Italy , it has already been possible to grant such transitional aid , corresponding to approximately EUR 11 per tonne of sugar beet per production year .
The reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP reform ) , adopted in 2003 in accordance with the decisions in the agricultural sphere previously taken in Berlin , Gothenburg and Brussels , is now in the process of being implemented .
In connection with the adoption of the CAP reform , there has been no desire whatsoever to renationalise European agricultural policy .     Madam President , I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for her answer .
What is more , I am not for a moment in any doubt that the Commissioner is acting legitimately .
I am no doubt looking , rather , for a political answer and political declaration .
I believe that we need more reforms within the agricultural area during the next few years .
I should therefore like to know what the Commissioner’s attitude is to the use of renationalisation as an instrument of reform .
As I see it , renationalisation would mean our abandoning the common agricultural policy .
At no time has renationalisation been proposed .
If , moreover , I might refer to a relatively topical example , it is clear that I have fought with all the legal means available to me against the proposal for a voluntary modulation of up to 20 % , put forward by the British Presidency in connection with the negotiations concerning the next financial
