, as long ago as November 2001 , decided that its member states could , in emergencies – and I emphasise , in emergencies – abrogate the international patent protection afforded to medicines .
Were there no patents , medicines and vaccinations against many fatal diseases would never have been developed – medicines and vaccinations now within the reach of everyone , including of course people in the developing world .
The second option would be to have a proper codecision procedure , with the Commission having the opportunity to make substantial alterations to the content , and it is this approach that I favour , subject to what is said in future debates , as being , in my view , more suited to the present day .
It cannot fail to be noted that this European Union of ours is resorting , in its weakness – for our organisational teeth no longer bite – to the artificial aid provided by VAT in order to be able to build up a certain amount of tax revenue worthy of the name .
The fact is that the special rules introduced in 1999 – for three years in the first instance – on reduced rates of VAT applied only to a few Member States and to certain labour-intensive services .
Civilian status for the police is one of the things democracy has achieved in Europe ; it is something we have fought for , particularly in the Balkan countries , where police were involved in military actions during the ethnic conflicts .
Although Parliament , being part of the legislative power , should not claim the right to have two official representatives in all executive agencies subordinate to it , it should retain the right to delegate trusted experts to agencies of its choice , as it does with the European Environmental Agency in Copenhagen or the Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna .
There are lessons that need to be learned from the failures and mistakes in the appointment of the Commission last year .
China needs to understand that this attempt to build democracy in Hong Kong would also bring great benefits to China itself .
This directive has as its priority objective the reduction and avoidance of waste batteries , but we cannot overlook the fact that it is also an example of product-oriented legislation for the internal market .
This alteration now further renders harmless , reduces and , to some degree , prohibits these materials and their percentages by weight in batteries of whatever kind .
It is the desire for a consolidated market position that motivates manufacturers to develop more and more new technologies , but a ban at the present time or in four years ’ time would be counterproductive , for they would have to change over their production methods to handle a type of technology that is not yet fully developed , while the research and development sector would not be able to come up with financial resources that this would demand .
The fact is that the implementing measures to be taken at Level 2 are being delayed , and they will actually only be completed at a time when MiFID ought already to have entered into force .
There is also the question as to how seriously the Council is taking this .
I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and to those who assisted us , cooperation with all of whom was excellent and certainly made an essential contribution to our achieving a result .
The new European legislation will also have the important effect of affording consumers greater transparency , with , for example , energy meters tailored as closely as possible to the individual’s needs , and a regular account of consumption that makes it possible to compare one’s own consumption with that of a control group .
Finding the right ways in which to do this is something that needs to be worked at , and that has been achieved outstandingly well in the compromise reached between first and second readings .
That is something that needs to be borne in mind .
Finally , I want to say – and I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say this – that we are , without doubt , in favour of fiscal competition .
This House made it perfectly clear , on 8 June , that its negotiating position on this is in fact not itself subject to negotiation .
We have also used the budget and codecision to foster rural development and to qualify the agricultural policy .
Money from wholly disparate budget rubrics is used to fund the EU’s operations , whether of a military or police nature , and the so-called flexibility instrument makes an additional EUR 40 million available for the CFSP.
It is not that it has been moderate , but rather that there simply has not been any .
Europe adds up to a common interest , not to the sum of 25 national interests .
Many members of the public – as you , Madam Vice-President , will know from your dialogue with them – even believe that the EU magnifies the negative effects of globalisation ; they see how many people – including , alas , many companies – misuse the European Union , enlargement , and globalisation too , as a means of undermining social standards .
A document such as this is comprehensible only to those in the institutions who have to work with it ; it is not something with which one can give the public any real idea of what Europe actually intends to do .
The new law is in the process of being drafted .
The decisions we took in Committee were taken together , without regard to party allegiances , and sometimes unanimously , and the amendments we drafted were excellent
