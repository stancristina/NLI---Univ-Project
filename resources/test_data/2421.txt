To the extent that there are any alternative methods at all , we must naturally try to use these and , ultimately , I also think we should put pressure on industry and manufacturers to develop alternative methods in those cases in which these still do not exist , so preventing as many animal experiments as is humanly possible .
Mr President , it is not the big international companies that are suffering during the coffee crisis .
How can they get away with it ?
' We have no alternative to coffee growing , ' he said .
We have experimented with traditional agriculture , but EU exports of meat and milk at dumping prices mean that we cannot even sell our goods to other African countries .
It is , then , not true , Commissioner Liikanen , that everything but arms solves the problem , for the EU 's agricultural policy destroys coffee growers ' ability to diversify into other forms of work .
The EU must and shall fulfil its responsibilities in this area .
The Development Fund has a surplus of DKK 7 500 million , so why does the EU hesitate to act while the coffee growers go hungry ?
Mr Wijkman had a solution involving mushrooms .
The coffee growers must , however , be guaranteed a minimum income here and now .
It is quite immoral that the international coffee giants can be allowed to exploit the crisis in order further to increase their surpluses , which are already too high .
It is wrong in principle to require countries with high standards in this area to temper their demands in the holy name of EU harmonisation .
The proposal added a further two sweeteners to the positive list of permitted sweeteners .
The June Movement is therefore voting against the overall proposal .
- ( DA ) We have voted in favour of the overall motion for a resolution , because it is most promising at a time when it is very necessary to strengthen the EU 's defence and security policy .
We cannot , however , support the Member States ' and the candidate countries ' being called upon to apply the principle of Community preference in purchasing arms , in order in that way to guarantee the security of supply .
We have declined to vote in favour of the desire for a protocol to the Treaty , adding a collective defence clause for those Member States that wish to divide the obligations embedded in Article V of the Brussels Treaty and so bring the Western European Union to an end .
I have looked forward to its being possible for Cuba to become the 78th member of the ACP group , have been delighted about the political dialogue with the EU and hoped for a rapid Cuban accession to the Cotonou Agreement .
At the same time , I would also call upon the EU to decide at its June summit to postpone any signature of the Cotonou Agreement with Cuba until these people have been released .
The EU should , moreover , also take steps , on precisely the same grounds , to suspend the trade agreements with Israel .
Mr President , I should like to draw attention to the way in which the Danish Government and a number of Danish parties are at present genuinely trying to harass Development Commissioner Poul Nilsson .
I should like to ask you , Commissioner , whether or not you share my admiration for a man who dares to call a spade a spade and who has the courage of his convictions .
That is very significant in a country like Denmark where we drink water directly from the tap .
Roundup is approved and used extensively in the rest of the EU.
It has to be possible , in a case like this , to hold Monsanto clearly liable for what has happened to Danish groundwater .
Plants are genetically modified so that they become resistant to , for example , Roundup , with the result that weeds can be sprayed more vigorously without the crop being damaged .
It should therefore also be possible to hold Monsanto liable for the disease and permanent damage that will be caused by the use of genetically modified crops .
In Denmark , we have banned a large proportion of the pesticides on the market in the rest of the EU.
It has compelled Denmark to use the genetically modified plants without making anyone liable for the pollution of the countryside that this involves .
That is something for which we have waited for many years .
On the other hand , to adopt Mr Manders ' report unamended would be totally to undermine environmental protection in the EU.
There is a need for important changes .
We should have strict or objective liability for forms of environmental destruction resulting from commercial activity .
When it comes to the issue of reducing biodiversity , I think it important that we obtain as broad a definition as possible so that all the habitats and species protected by Community legislation and corresponding national legislation are in actual fact covered .
Finally , I believe that the directive should also cover pollution of the countryside by genetically modified organisms .
In conclusion , a remark on access to the complaints procedure .
As a very last point , a couple of remarks about the legal base itself .
That would , in my view , be a total mistake , and it would in actual fact destroy the rules governing environmental liability already established in many Member States .
I should like to say to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten that I think that voluntary agreements are important but that it is also important we
