I think that since the Dayton agreement , 200 000 of the 800 000 originally intended have actually gone back , at an optimistic estimate .
Take Bosnia , for example , where the new organs of state are still being set up .
As I said before , I quite agree with Mrs Ahlqvist 's assessment of the situation .
It is just unfortunate that we have not yet been able to implement the accompanying measures that were intended to offset the negative effects for Turkey , including the three or four programmes which are currently blocked for reasons with which everyone is familiar .
I do not have time now to go through the whole of the very constructive exchange of views that we had yesterday evening in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , so I will leave it there if I may , although I am entirely at your disposal , should you wish to discuss this question further .
On the issue of foreign and security policy , there is certain to be a strong intergovernmental element , but I do not think it is the Commission 's place to anticipate the outcome of the discussions .
This man , who now has two companies , one in the Netherlands and one in Germany , is not allowed by the Dutch customs authorities to drive a car with a German number plate - which he uses to visit German clients - in the Netherlands , not even if he pays all the relevant taxes for it there .
Is it not strange that our governments should be using the subsidiarity principle as an excuse for refusing to cooperate in setting up an efficient European structure which would be able to warn all our health systems about outbreaks of infectious diseases and epidemics ?
Some countries say the more , the better ; others , including my own country of the Netherlands , say they should only be carried out where projects are expected to have serious damaging effects on nature and the environment .
In my view , this covers all cases likely to have an environmental impact .
If we are to reduce the amount of dangerous substances such as chlorine and heavy metals in waste , industry needs to use them less in its production processes .
Once again , I hope that President HÃ¤nsch will invite the ladies concerned to meet with him to resolve the matter amicably .
Madam President , I think one has to take a rounded view of life .
All of them products with a relatively high value added .
As far as our obligation to abolish refunds is concerned , in monetary terms we have done in one year what we might have done over six years .
Within that context the EU has to make its position on world markets as strong as possible .
Will the Commission do that ?
Madam President , production is becoming globalized and so is the textile industry .
Goods remain stuck in port because they cannot be cleared .
Even within the European Union we are divided .
Let me give you an example of just one part of it .
It is in the interests of the poorer nations that the pledges given by the rich countries in earlier trade agreements should be kept .
The first is minimum social standards .
Have they been complied with ?
We should follow the example of the United States which does not hesitate to protect its own industry .
But the hundreds of thousands who have now fled can draw only cold comfort from statements of the ' I told you so ' variety and from lamentations over missed opportunities .
If that dialogue does not get going , in a regional framework and with international support , in four weeks ' time we shall find ourselves talking again about the crisis in Burundi which will have returned to the agenda .
Because we are hearing nothing more about Burundi , ladies and gentlemen , though there too the situation continues unchanged .
The lack of unanimity in the European Union up to and within the Security Council is also a scandal .
There used to be talk of Eurafrica , Europe-Africa , the name for a special policy between our two continents .
Surely they were set up to keep or restore peace ?
One moment Jerusalem is in flames , the next moment there is renewed talk of a possible solution over Hebron .
A balanced report is the right way to do that , but first of all a few amendments are needed and some factual errors must be removed from the report .
Mr President , I appreciate the clarification we have been given by Council and Commission .
Whilst the Union still has no common foreign policy and whilst constant and vain attempts are made to force a mediating role for it on the basis of financial aid , our disappointment will continue to grow and we shall be excluded from the process .
Mr President , the tension between Israel and the Palestinian authority which heightened when the Netanyahu Government took power has not yet dissipated .
One must also wonder what credibility the Union can still retain as a neutral mediator .
The ELDR Group endorses both premises and is , moreover , in harmony with the tenor of this excellent report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in June of last year the Council adopted a resolution on minimum guarantees for asylum procedures .
Member State governments were quick to react .
The European Parliament has previously sought clarification on this point .
For example , there is no wording which establishes the right of a female asylum-seeker to request asylum independently of her husband .
That is worrying .
And we agree with some of the rapporteur
