But that , of course , makes for an awkward tactical position when it comes to exchanging concessions or bringing in the rules we set store by .
This is an essential dividing line for the future common agricultural policy .
That means we have to ask ourselves some questions about the EU 's international trade policy in order to see whether the fundamental assumptions on which we have built it for decades need re-examining .
Mr President , Commissioners , our first task is to make a correct diagnosis of events .
The discussion that has been proposed is welcome but for the moment should we not also be thinking about initiatives to help the vast number of poor countries who genuinely need results now ?
Did it not negotiate naively before the negotiations ?
Should the Union have spoken with a single voice by giving the Commission an exclusive mandate regardless of the skill of the negotiators ?
On the one side there was the group of the 21 and the group of the ACP and least developed countries and on the other , the United States and Europe : that already makes four major players and perhaps next time there will be even more .
The Group of 21 has 21 negotiators .
Do we sacrifice our 3 % share of the world market or make the Africans a gift of what they wanted : a trust fund of USD 250 million per year organised by an international institution ?
I agree with what Mr van Velzen and Mr Suominen said .
Above all , we must ask ourselves two additional questions , Mr Lamy .
Who was to blame ?
It is essential for developing countries to open up their markets and accept a number of rules .
Several options will need to be considered .
I thank him for his words on parachutes .
On balance , this failure appears harmful , at least in the short term .
Secondly , on the Singapore issues .
It is by considering them as real counterparts that Europe will win a place in the world , in order to help make it more humane .
What is more , these investments , as I have just said , are also in the interests of sustainable mobility .
The discussion on the patentability of software is extremely controversial .
A greater effort to provide a swifter response to petitions received is also called for .
I would not presume to lecture the House on the many objectives contained in existing and draft treaties .
The latter only result in an unhelpful exaggeration of difficulties .
This runs counter to transparency .
The European Union must take account of the most recent information and draft a further reform , which should provide greater protection for our agricultural model .
The question therefore arises as to whether the very framework and terms of reference of organisations of this kind are the reasons why things are going wrong .
In other words , it puts it in the context of the policies of the European Union .
We appreciate many of the suggestions put forward in your report .
The Parliament report and the very important proposals by General Morillon you mentioned a moment ago , Mr von Wogau , both rightly highlight the link between export control measures and the development of a European Union defence procurement policy .
They would like to do the same to certain organisations described by them as terrorist , and to the world of organised crime .
I would like , ladies and gentlemen , to briefly outline the origins of the Commission 's current policy on the financing of actions against torture .
Funds are granted only to the best proposals .
We have all abolished it in Europe , but unfortunately that is not the case in other parts of the world .
In 1997 , we managed to get the Commission to move a little , resulting in this 'decaffeinated ' regulation to improve the production and marketing of honey , with an allocation of EUR 15 to 16 million , depending on the year , for all 15 Member States .
But neither politicians nor scientists should be controlled by the interests of the powerful financial groups that have been harassing us constantly , here and in Brussels , for weeks .
I do also understand , from the words you used , your dissatisfaction and your expectations .
Finally , Mrs Lulling , on the matter of aids under Council Regulation No 1221/97 , the Commission cofinanced national programmes to improve the production and marketing of honey to the tune of 50 % during the 1999/2000 marketing year .
However , nothing decisive has yet come from the authorities apart from reassuring words , the launching of studies and a few limited measures such as the temporary withdrawal of the authorisation for Gaucho to treat sunflower seed in France .
The International Commission on Plant-Bee Relations , whose particular brief it is to examine the dangers threatening bees , has just held an international symposium in Bologna on the subject .
The simple fact that the great powers are wasting enormous sums of money on weapons of mass destruction shows that the present organisation of society is barbaric .
This is precisely why I believe the evaluation that I have just mentioned to be so necessary .
This , in any event , is the type of debate that needs to be held to enable Europe’s citizens to state their feelings about the draft Constitution in full knowledge of the facts .     Mr President , it would have been nice if previous speakers had not doubled their speaking time , because we all have other engagements after this debate .
We must lead the way in order to ensure that enlargement is a success .
There are first of all structural constraints , such as
