We believe that every Member State must remain master of its own territory , that it cannot have the presence of unwanted foreigners imposed on it , and that while there may be cases where it is necessary to give temporary protection , it must be given mainly with an eye to the repatriation of the persons concerned .
The initiative before us today concerns the enforcement of national , administrative expulsion measures against foreigners , even where they have since moved to another Member State .
It would therefore be dangerous to adopt an initiative of this kind to tackle an issue as sensitive as immigration .
Let me conclude by emphasising the importance of transparency in this field .
Confusion continues to prevail with regard to these aspects .
Firstly , a goal which the European Parliament has always sought , protecting young players moving within the European Union , guaranteeing them an appropriate general and sporting education .
These principles are supported by other important points , such as fixed periods for transfers or the duration of contracts of between one and five years .
Be that as it may , the Commission held its ground and was ultimately able to demonstrate that it is not necessary to amend the terms of the Treaty in order to respect the specific characteristics of sport ; it therefore stood firm while keeping strictly to its own sphere of responsibility .
Firstly , at the time of a transfer , training costs are reimbursed for the club responsible for training the young player , and that is applicable up to the age of 12 .
You may rest assured that the Commission will carefully monitor the framing and implementation of this code of conduct .
It will be a matter for the court , the Court of Arbitration , to judge who is right .
What is one thing in theory is completely different in reality .
The Commission ' s opinion is that this should be dealt with in a transparent fashion and that all parties such as rich clubs , less wealthy clubs , prominent , young and average players , should all be involved in the discussions .
Furthermore , only in December 1999 , a Commission statement on the social dimension of sport was submitted to the Heads of State and Government at the Helsinki Summit .
The first is solidarity between the richest clubs and the less wealthy clubs and the second is the protection of young people through a code of conduct .
Who then benefits from the stability of the championships and teams ?
Furthermore , I would like to reiterate that what we have just decided is not a substitute for national law .
It is therefore up to the judges in the Court in Luxembourg to decide on their course of action .
It is true that we have not discussed voluntary work as much as we should .
In a previous report , the Committee on Budgetary Control stated that the slightest fraud of the Community budget must no longer be tolerated .
Mr President , recommending transparency and improving public access to environmental information are aims that have my full support .
Now I know it is partly at the Commissioner 's responsibility , but will he , in pushing forward the ratification of the Community part of the 1996 Convention , also make it clear to Member States that it makes sense for them to ratify the rest of that Convention at the same time so that there is no disparity between the Convention and the way it is applied in different Member States within the Community .
It calls on sporting organisations and the Member States to investigate and monitor such practices and , where necessary , to consider appropriate measures . "
I think that this is very important and is a marvellous thing , and I would also like to reiterate that linguistic diversity is highlighted in Article 22 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I very consciously placed this event within the sector including education , training , linguistic diversity and the learning of several languages , because this area affects most people .
Rest assured that we certainly do take an interest in how the projects and their costs are progressing .
The European Anti-Fraud Office has also said that it has not yet received any communication from the Greek authorities pursuant to Regulation No 1681/94 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the structural policies and the organisation of an information system in this field .
Mr Papayannakis , I have no problem with finding out the cost per kilometre of the underground system in Barcelona , Athens , or in any other city .
In relation to the 2000-2006 programming period that has just started , I would like to inform you that coordination between our departments has again been improved , in order to achieve better interaction between the Habitat Directive and Structural Funds programming .
Less than a week ago , the Swedish Presidency , together with the future Belgian Presidency , invited Parliament and the Commission to participate in this debate .
We know that , in each of our Member States , opinions are diverse and often contradictory .
It is only by holding an Intergovernmental Conference as provided for in the Treaties that the Treaties can be reformed or changed .
To this end , it will also be essential that the structure called upon to accommodate the debate is not a place reserved for experts alone , but rather a permeable structure which is open to external contributions .
I am very pleased to see that this Parliament has remembered that there will in fact be elections in 2004 , that it was not elected in perpetuity , and that there was a certain amount of interference between Parliament and the appointments that had
