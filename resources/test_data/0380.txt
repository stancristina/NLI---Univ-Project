not be possible for it to be used for relocations .
The same applies to companies in the public interest .
If we ensure that this happens and follow up the demands for increased scrutiny and transparency , better rendering of accounts and more stringent auditing , we shall lay the basis for a State aid policy that entails less State aid , and such State aid as there is will no longer distort competition .
Believing that to be the case can easily bring that very situation about .
When it comes to promoting contacts between people , consistency is required .
It is not consistent to begin , as now , by taking positive steps regarding local border traffic and similarly positive steps in the form of the bilateral visa agreement with Russia reached in October of last year , and then almost to double the visa charge from EUR 35 to EUR 65 , something that the Council of Ministers is in actual fact in a quandary about taking a decision on next week in response to a proposal by France .
For example , anyone in Eastern Finland wanting to cross by boat to the Russian side of the Saima Canal would be forced to pay more in visa charges than for the crossing itself .
I therefore call on all my fellow Members to put this period to good use and , at the eleventh hour , to contact their governments in order to forestall this decision .
There is broad support here in Parliament for what such a directive should contain .
There are great benefits to be gained from increasing the proportion of these within the heating and cooling sector .
Moreover , we should be creating a lot of jobs , as this is one of the few spheres in which we are , in fact , clearly creating new jobs in Europe and are rightly heading in the direction of increased growth .
I also hope that the Commission will provide crucial research with the resources required for discovering and developing new technology and , again , I call on it to do so .
This own-initiative report shows clearly and unambiguously what Parliament wants to see in terms of future draft legislation .
We now hope that the Commission will complete the work .     The report discusses an issue in connection with which the value of the internal market has to be weighed up against national self-determination .
The European Court of Justice must first adopt a position and give a judgment .
Moreover , the rules are based on international conventions and , where there are no such conventions , national legislation is accepted .
A number of amendments to be voted on were , however , rather too detailed for elected political representatives to adopt positions on .
Detailed issues relating to periods of darkness , foot pad lesions and first-week mortality in connection with chickens kept for meat production are difficult for a layperson to decide about .
We also wish to emphasise how important it is to make further progress in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation in order to achieve an across-the board consensus in favour of more stringent production requirements where food safety and animal protection are concerned .     I voted in favour of this very weak report because , in spite of everything , it entails improvements in most countries and is concerned with minimal legislation , which means that we are allowed to have more stringent rules .
I voted in favour of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s proposal for a stocking density not exceeding 34 kg by 2013 for the sole reason that it is better than the original proposal .
How we treat our animals says a lot about how developed our civilisation is .
In spite of this , we have voted in favour of the report because , in general , it counsels against State aid .
An example of such an agreement is the Cotonou Agreement , which the EU concluded with the countries in the ACP community .
What is more , the rapporteur also wishes to see the European Parliament allowed to participate in the whole procedure where the clause is concerned .
This issue can better be resolved by existing international bodies .     Mr President , the proposal for a Services Directive is reactionary .
The proposed compromise between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats removes important defects from the proposal , but major ambiguities remain , which are supposedly to be resolved by the European Court of Justice .
Sometimes , a lot of misunderstandings arise and , sometimes , these misunderstandings are exploited in a quite distasteful way .
The services sector is a growing part of our economies , offering major opportunities for jobs and growth .
The principle was clarified and specified in the IMCO’s compromise , which states that it is the host country ’s rules governing labour law , public health and safety that apply .
The compromise now circulating among the big groups has introduced an extremely woolly concept , namely that of social policy .
It now seems , however , as if that compromise is on the way out , in which case that is a state of affairs we cannot but welcome .
Now is the time to do just that .     Mr President , Parliament is capitulating today and renouncing its political role .
Is that democracy ?
Let us vote down this directive .
At the same time , we value national self-determination .
This principle mainly affects services such as construction , cleaning and consultancy .
We shall support the compromise .     Mr President , right now , everyone’s attention is on the European Parliament .
