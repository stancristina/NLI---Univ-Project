it was the day of the first report of a fine levied by the European Court of Justice , an actual fine of EUR 20 000 a day on Greece for failure to comply with a European Union environment directive .
But it is interesting to note that that case was actually launched thirteen years ago and relates to a directive which dates back even further .
At the moment there are currently nine other environment cases which have come back to the Court of Justice for a second time because countries have ignored earlier judgments .
There are no less than 157 cases still pending and I regret to have to say that in many cases the European Commission has not been able to act , to bring cases to the Court of Justice , because it does not know what is happening in Member States as the countries concerned have not reported back to Brussels on what they are doing about legislation .
One of the reasons that they have not reported is that the countries themselves do not know .
Why do they not know ?
Because they do not have systems of environmental inspection which form the essential raft on which the whole edifice of compliance with European environment law is built .
We need the kind of directive that the Environment Committee would like to see .
A recommendation will do no good .
I hope that the European Commission has the courage , and I mean courage , to accept the European Parliament amendments .
I hope that the European Commission has the courage to go into the conciliation process arm in arm with the Parliament against , and it will be against , the Council .
I think some members of the Council are really quite wobbly in the direction of a directive rather than a recommendation .
The tiny concessions so far offered by the Council lodged in the preamble to this proposal are simply not enough .
Mr President , those of us who survived the conciliation procedure for the water framework directive must be delighted that here we have an issue which is entirely clear-cut and easily understandable .
The first issue is that we want equal and effective enforcement of environmental legislation across the European Union and we must all agree to that principle .
The question obviously is why we have not had that before .
Why have the Commissioner 's predecessors not brought forward proposals before now and why are the proposals now introduced so miserably weak ?
There is also a question for Member States .
What have they been doing signing up to environmental legislation if in reality they do not have the means to check properly that it has been carried out and have no intention of ensuring that it is properly enforced ?
I have chemical companies in my constituency in the north-west of England .
Some of them , I am sorry to say , discharge polluting materials into air and water .
They get inspected .
Action is taken .
They are forced to clean up their act .
They pay the price for that .
But they are competing with chemical companies elsewhere in this European Union which are not having to carry out those checks , which are not having to pay the price and they are not able to compete therefore on a level playing field .
It is simply unfair .
The second issue is the clear conflict here between the Parliament and the Council .
Any student who wants to understand conciliation procedure or codecision procedure has a nice straightforward case study here .
We have codecision powers but we have the threat from the Council that if we do not fall into line then they will abandon the whole legislation .
Well , they might as well , as Mrs Jackson has said .
The message for the French Presidency is that we want tangible progress .
We do not want to see this abandoned .
There is room for compromise , presumably over the implementation date .
All the institutions in the European Union want the laws enforced properly .
It is time to give these warm but rather woolly sentiments some real meaning and action .
Mr President , I thank Mrs Hieronymi for the work she has put into this report .
It is important to stress at the outset that this is not just any old report .
It is something that is very dear not only to the members of this committee and the House but also to members of the industry right across the Union .
But in putting this before the House we have to ask ourselves two very important questions .
Firstly , why do we need this programme ?
Secondly , what is the added value that it is going to bring us ?
Only by answering those questions as a House can we go forward to the Council and the Commission with a very strong case .
Why do we need it ?
We are at the very beginning of an explosion of this industry on this continent .
We have to put ourselves in the position of being able to compete in the international arena .
I believe we are able to do that .
I also believe that this industry will be the spearhead of this century , in the same way as coal , steel and the infrastructure of railways were the impetus for the development of the revolution in the 19th century .
It is absolutely vital that we do not miss the train on this one .
It is absolutely vital that we get in there as a series of institutions committed to building this industry .
The second reason is that we have to , in this increasingly homogenised era of global audio-visual content , get into the area of freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of diversity .
