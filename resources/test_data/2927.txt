A year ago , I visited a number of journalists in prison and the trade union leader Mr Pakpahan , and I have protested to the authorities about their captivity on a number of occasions .
Nevertheless , one thing the Council can do is to insist on an agreement for ASEAN to have a democracy clause , as we discussed in relation to Burma .
And who knows , there may yet be a lastminute Kohl-Kok alliance at the IGC to have sport included in the Amsterdam Treaty , which is what Parliament has long wished to see .
This is where we see the effect of having no structural sports policy or approach , and the Commission 's ad hoc tinkering will certainly not solve the problem .
But I find it difficult to accept the reasons given by some people , who say that the Bosman ruling is making it impossible for sports clubs in Europe to promote youth sport .
I know that you are not in favour of them , Mrs Pack , but they are the logical consequence of Articles 2 , 48 and 92 of the Treaty .
And , secondly , an adequate budget for funding the most important aspects of Europe 's approach to sport .
However , I do not think that its approach is firm enough , and things could drag on for some years yet .
An exemption for local public transport is a good move for improving the environment in Europe 's cities , and if it can be limited to the lighter fuels such as LPG in future , things will be all the cleaner .
The PPE Group agrees with the rapporteur that we should not approve any kind of review procedure which leads to exemptions being extended indefinitely .
Given that at least 70 exemptions or exceptions have been granted over the years for various policy objectives , and not always the most convincing ones at that , I am amazed that the Commission is causing so many problems about granting a low VAT rate for labourintensive services , which could promote employment in sensitive sectors .
I am sorry , but it really would not give a fair picture .
By choosing the procedure under Rule 80( 3 ) , Parliament is now able to propose amendments to a request for its assent , whereas normally it would only be able to say yes or no , and there would be no scope for amendments .
The need to respect human rights , democratic principles and the state based on the rule of law is something that deserves our full support , and I wonder whether , in the negotiations with the Council , I should not also add respect for the territorial inviolability of third countries as a criterion .
Rules for this procedure are urgently needed , since we shall not wish to make every temporary suspension permanent .
Every agreement should have a suspension procedure of this kind , and the longer we wait , the more we are guilty of discrimination , which is precisely what we must avoid in the application of universal human rights .
Finally , I entirely agree with Mr Bertens that the approach proposed by Mrs Aelvoet should also apply to all other agreements with third countries .
My specific question to the Commission is therefore : With a view to the employment summit can this become a matter for both the Commission and the national governments ?
We , the Group of European Liberals , are strong defenders of a high level of protection for the environment and clear labelling for the consumer .
Mr President , with just two minutes in which to speak I must of course limit myself to a couple of fundamental comments .
I note that members of the European Commission among others are increasingly trampling on the right to information in your own language .
They were then either not implemented at all or implemented too slowly .
The indirect effect of ICT on the European economy as a whole could lead to the creation of between 0.5 and almost 1.5 billion new jobs .
At the present time just 4 % of Europe 's small and medium-sized enterprises have Internet access .
Hopefully this aspect will not be neglected at the ministerial conference in Bonn .
Mr President , I could not agree more with the previous speaker , Mr Herman .
We do not expect this .
I can inform the Commission that the Liberal Group supports the Commission 's resolve .
We have another view of animal foods and the conditions under which animals are kept and transported .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome Mr Bangemann 's reply .
And that it is precisely this combined formula which can have such harmful long-term effects on the human DNA .
What was considered harmless 20 years ago can today indeed be shown to be harmful .
Finally , scientists who first and foremost investigate the risks linked to the combined use of hormones .
But when it comes to a dam which is clearly damaging to the environment - and this can also be read in the report - then the Committee on the Environment believes that it is very difficult to understand why such a dam should be seen as an environmental project .
This must be the practice , it must be objective .
In the long term it is not possible to justify to the European citizen that there is a lot of money which is not being spent while the individual Member States are being required to contribute more to Europe .
My apologies to all my colleagues who are still here this evening .
I will nevertheless make a number of points , although as I have already said this is more of a debate
