The result of this is merciless competition to undercut in social terms , in environmental terms , and as regards protection in the workplace .
What do I mean by that ?
This must also be clearly stated in the strategic planning .
Does that make the European Union more competitive ?
As a rule , that should not be done .
Let us not promise ourselves anything where the ten new countries are concerned , and then , if we want the 1.0 % Budget that we obsess about , we will be able to save .
In the same way , though , you cannot evade our question , for if we have to set priorities , the same must also be said of the national governments .
There were two that it highlighted : the first had to do with the trans-European networks , where , in a desire to send a signal about enlargement , the commitment appropriations were increased .
Then , we hear reports of internal discussions even at this early stage about the possibility of moving away from the 1.14 % , and then someone puts forward the idea that 1.06 % , or 1.07 % , would be a workable compromise , so let me , as rapporteur , make it perfectly clear that nobody in the other institutions should imagine that Parliament is prepared to negotiate below the margins set as a network by Article 272 of the Treaty .
In Germany , we have a saying to the effect that there is no smoke without fire .
What that also means is that the loss is borne by the local stakeholders who want to get involved in planning , because the planning rules will be implemented at this level far too late .
My Group fully supports the report .
Equally , though , we have to look more closely at imports into the European Union .
The reason why this is such an important issue , Mr Pinheiro , is that the fight against terrorism is also a subject for discussion at the European Council summit and during the preliminary debates .
Rather than defending anyone , I merely appealed to Mr Basescu .
Afterwards , you may speak for three minutes , like Mr Schulz .
Despite any claims to the contrary by Mr Cohn-Bendit , I am not connected in any way to this matter , and I disapprove of his having used bogus arguments which bear no relation to the truth .     .
Europe’s security is also dependent on the situation in its neighbouring countries .
It is claimed that there is such cooperation , but it has been neither full nor adequate .
Is it responsible ?
I know of surveys carried out in Germany which show that people have nothing against Turkey becoming a member of the EU.
I therefore wish not only to congratulate you , but also to encourage you to push forward with these issues .     Mr President , today’s debate about the European summit at the weekend has become a continuation of our discussion about Turkey , which we began on Monday evening , and which we will bring to a conclusion immediately after this debate , when we vote on the Eurlings Report .
In our view , the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in this House is incapable of adhering to a coherent and unified line .
We continue to take the view that the European Union 's record of success would be massively jeopardised by Turkish accession .
Madam President , unlike Turkey , Bulgaria is quite clearly a European country which has made tremendous progress .
I therefore suggest that we discuss all the other tabled amendments , some of which are very detailed , next year when we deal with the longer report which will then be due .
This has not always been the case , and so we have every reason to be gratified .
He is absolutely right : we must demand honesty in relation to Romania as well .
That is why I am appealing to you , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , in relation to the drafting of the presidency conclusions on Friday .
The European Initiative is a well-functioning instrument : this is borne out by the statistics on the use of its budget funds as well as by almost all the human rights organisations which pay tribute to the Initiative and its valuable work .
Firstly , let me say to the Vice-President , Mr McMillan-Scott , that if he had not already invented this interesting procedure , we would have to invent it now .
After that , the implementation begins .
I cannot see it as such .
It is to the benefit of mass livestock farming , a form of livestock farming that will get Europe nowhere .
We will not be participating in this vote .     .
Secondly , we voted yesterday on the EU-Russia summit .
We will not , however , succeed in that by words alone , and so Mr Langen and I have started to develop a holistic strategy which finally interlinks economic policy , foreign policy and development policy .
Many chemical companies still have production operations in India and in other parts of the world where labour and environmental standards are far below those that apply in the European Union or the USA .
A constitution needs values .
The Europe of the future must rather be founded upon the Community method , and upon the Community action of the European institutions .
The events of recent days , in which people have been powerless in the face of forces that no amount of technology has enabled them to confront , show how absolutely necessary it is for action to be taken at the supranational level , with no national borders standing in the
