The Union ' s support for Moldova is thus in place .
It is also important that the Commission guarantees the aid by attaching certain economic conditions to it , so that it is used properly in the right areas , for example , in improving administration , organising basic civil services and increasing economic efficiency .
Parliament is considering a proposal for a Council Regulation on a basis for financing the UN operation in Kosovo , UNMIK , and the costs of the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina .
The first concerns Category 4 .
Category 4 is already overloaded .
This transfer will bring with it a considerable need for additional financing in Category 4 .
For this reason , the regulation must be amended so that Parliament may maintain its power of influence .
Thirdly , if the funding of special envoys is transferred in future to the Council ' s administration budget , as is supposed , it will mean that the gentlemen' s agreement between the Council and Parliament will have to be reviewed .
For this reason , these funds can no longer fall within the scope of the gentlemen' s agreement : the European Parliament must have the right to express its opinion and to influence the use of appropriations for financing the work of special envoys , even though they may have been included in the Council ' s administrative budget .
The proposal for a Regulation may , as far as I can see , be adopted only if the Commission , and the Council too , accept Parliament ' s amendments , since , otherwise , the proposal will go against the present interinstitutional agreement .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Agenda 2000 has created a certain kind of stability for the European Agricultural Policy .
It is necessary for this Parliament to make decisions on a new and ongoing agricultural policy after 2006 .
There has been a considerable rise in agricultural costs ; fuel prices have gone up , and the level of costs in general is showing a constant upward trend .
The farmers for their part have carried out all their duties and obligations .
We may only hope that the other party will also hold to those mutual agreements that have been made .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Schierhuber , for this report , not least because it takes into consideration processing in those countries in particular , which , as Members of the EU , have also taken up the cultivation of flax .
The average yields of flax and hemp are very similar across Europe , in the North as well as the South .
Such being the case , it would be unreasonable if the fringe areas - i .e . the areas around the Mediterranean and the North - were to be placed in an unequal position with regard to aid payable on the basis of area in the case of hemp and flax , which represents such small-scale production in the context of agricultural production as a whole .
Mr President , Mr Markus Ferber has produced an excellent report , on which I wish to congratulate him .
The Parliament Budget is essentially an administrative budget , since wage costs constitute the largest item of expenditure .
This is why , last year , Parliament approved an appropriation of EUR 300 000 for this year ' s budget for the investigation of the efficiency and improvement needs of parliamentary administration .
This increase is so huge that no other institution could even contemplate an increase of administrative costs of this magnitude .
It is worthy of special mention that in this proposal , a new post is even being created for the Financial Control Department , despite the intention to abandon prior inspection altogether .
On the contrary , this Budget is uncommonly slack , and this will make it difficult to gain the approval of the general public .
Mr President , it is necessary in this context to address the issue of the policy of the European Parliament in its capacity as an employer .
Reallocation of resources is necessary , and consequently also reform of staffing regulations .
Mr President , I speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Fraud , of course , affects only a small fraction - i .e . just over 1 % - of the EU' s total budget , but it is a very serious problem which seems to extend to almost all political sectors .
So far , fewer than half of the Member States have ratified the protocol on protecting the Union ' s financial interests .
This process should therefore be speeded up considerably .
Therefore it is important for Member States to have a direct obligation to report cases of VAT fraud , for example , to the Commission .
If we are to restore consumer confidence , it is essential that we do all we possibly can at all levels .
I agree that the Commission for its part has done a good job , a job that Parliament can endorse , whereas Member States must eventually be made to understand that this matter is important and that we must gain consumer confidence .
I should , however , like to draw your attention to one more issue : those countries and farms , which have escaped the animal diseases , must also be able to ensure that they will not have these problems in future .
On the whole , we must firmly hold to the notion that within the internal market , too , human health is the most important thing , and that principles of free competition only take second place .
Mr President , I would like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on her excellent report .
The priority is to protect consumer health , particularly against diseases like TSE ,
