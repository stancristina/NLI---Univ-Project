I should like to congratulate the Members of Parliament on the quality of their amendments expressing Parliament’s concern and interest as regards the risks and results of exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields .
As far as your amendments are concerned , the Commission can accept them as they stand , in that they improve the quality of the text and clarify its meaning .
Amendment No 4 introduces a standardised provision governing sanctions , while Amendment No 5 stipulates the frequency of the Commission report , in keeping with the other health and safety directives .
The proposal is designed to provide a legal basis for continuing financial support for organisations working at European Union level to promote equality between men and women .
We support the common position proposed by the Council in that it responds to the Commission ’s main objectives and incorporates most of your amendments .
Due to the delay in approving this decision , the amendments relating to the transitional clauses need to be included in the final decision , as agreed at the conciliation meeting last November .     . – Mr President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , the European Union has been fighting for equal treatment of men and women for nearly fifty years now and it has made a great deal of progress in the employment sector , with the introduction of legislation to safeguard equal pay and equal working conditions .
Before a detailed proposal was drafted , broad consultations were held with the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women , on which all the Members States and the social partners are represented , together with the insurance and other sectors , the European Parliament and civil society .
Similarly housing , where single parent families , mainly women , face greater difficulties than men in renting accommodation and , of course , the insurance sector , mainly the car insurance , life assurance and pension sectors , as well as health insurance .
I should like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her excellent report , which proposes numerous improvements to our proposal and gives it greater clarity and greater cohesion with previous Community directives .
In particular , we welcome the amendments which bring the Commission proposal into line with Directive 2000/43 on racial discrimination or Directive 2002/73 on equal treatment for men and women in employment .
The above amendments are also in keeping with the discussions held in the Council .
I refer to Amendments Nos 9 and 13 .
We recognise that the representation of the sexes in the mass media and advertising raises serious questions regarding the protection of the dignity of men and women and that , in the education sector , girls and boys are often discouraged from following non-traditional paths , but other complicated issues also arise , such as the freedom of means of communication .
The use of gender-based actuarial factors is not compatible with the principle of equal treatment and cannot therefore be justified objectively .
In this group of 86 % , a woman is treated differently from a man under the same conditions , purely and simply because an inaccurate generalisation is made about the life expectancy of all women .
Nonetheless , we hope that , at the end of this period , the insurance industry will have no problems applying the principle of equal treatment and European consumers will reap the relevant benefits .
Although Article 3 , paragraph 2 of the Treaty makes provision for the Community to aim to promote equality between men and women in all its activities , this provision cannot change the nature of the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty .
The use of gender-based actuarial factors is not compatible with the principle of equal treatment and , consequently , must be abolished within the framework of the directive .
Governments come and go but the rural tribunals stay .
It is certain that no trial or sentence will break their fighting spirit .
The balance is quite clearly worse today than it was ten years ago when there were events and political choices .
Yes !
In a few days , as is our custom , the presiding country will meet the president of the United States of America in order to raise the imperative question of the joint approach to this issue .
It would , of course , be better if this meeting were held in Brussels at long last .
In other words , if we cannot get to the heart of the problem , we must confine the problem .
If the European Union wants to demonstrate its ability , including for its own interests , it is an area which has matured to the point at which it will have the general acceptance of mankind if it makes a positive contribution to resolving the Palestinian problem , which is the tip of a broader problem , but if the tip is solved , it will also be resolved at the base .     .
For its part , the ΕU is continuing its policy of tolerance and support for Israel which puts the slaughterers and the slaughtered on an equal footing .
There will be no peace in the area until the people of Palestine have a homeland .     . – Recent events in Kosovo have completed the ethnic cleansing , with the expulsion of the remaining Serbs and gypsies and the seizure of their property .
The current situation in Kosovo and the tragedy of Yugoslavia in general highlight the extent of the crime committed during the 1990s against the Yugoslavian people and the hypocrisy of the proclamations about protecting human rights from the elected government of President Milosevic made by the invaders when they intervened , preventing it from maintaining order and protecting the inhabitants of Kosovo ( of all nationalities ) against the action of the KLA .
