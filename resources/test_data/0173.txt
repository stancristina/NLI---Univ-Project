The system has become a little confused between the market package and the climate package in this area .
This is important , not only in order to keep prices down and to allow more competition , but also in order to ensure that the various Member States who , as a result of the climate package , may find themselves in a more vulnerable situation , do not become isolated .
This is something that needs to be done , and I hope that most of it will be carried out under the Czech Presidency .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking my colleague from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , Mr Klinz , for his excellent work .
The aim of UCITS funds is to create not only a better and larger funds market , but also an open and consumer-friendly market .
It was also prior to the Lamfalussy process .
The merger of funds and master-feeder-structures will be possible , and cooperation between supervisory authorities will be strengthened , something that was also mentioned by the Commissioner .
However , I think that the present proposal is a good one .
Too much information is not good but neither is too little .
UCITS have cleared the way and become a success and an esteemed trade mark outside Europe , too .
I also support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
I support the proposal for a combined public register .
These authorities appoint officials to implement democratic decisions .
The subjects were not permitted to interfere in the ruler 's affairs .
The second is that the nation 's security , consideration of citizens ' integrity , business secrets , market influence and similar considerations may require exceptions to transparency .
The second explanation , however , is sound and involves a difficult balancing act .
The EU began as a mandarin empire , and still is today , but important steps have been taken : the 1993 Code of Conduct , the acceptance of the Swedish Journalists ' Association 's demands in 1998 , and the Regulation in 2001 .
There is a lot of internal resistance to quash .
Along with a more open market come increased European competitiveness and more efficient equipment production .
At the same time , respect is shown for national security interests and special conditions for supply and the protection of information , for example .
I , personally , am pleased that it has been possible to resolve the most controversial issues with regard to existing EC law .
I think that it is good to address environmental aspects , for example .
One evening when I was watching television , a quarter of all the advertisements were for over-the-counter pharmaceutical products .
I would therefore like us to tighten up the legislation in this area .
Neglected tropical diseases , for example - that is to say an area where there is no buying power - would then be able to obtain new medicines .
I believe that in certain cases this could be a better system for improving research and , above all , for eliminating the purpose of counterfeiting medicines .
I see many advantages to being able , from a political position , to steer research into solving a disease problem instead of treating the symptoms for 30 years with medication that is very lucrative for the undertakings concerned .
I would like better methods to be introduced for investigating the toxicology of nanoparticles .
It is thus thanks to very good collaboration with the French Presidency that this legislation is now being realised , which is a very good thing .
It is predominantly when it is sold to consumers that there are problems .
A proper protective set-up consists of very high-spec gloves that have to be changed every three hours .
It is often the self-employed and companies consisting of just a few staff who are out there cleaning up graffiti or stripping paint .
I think it will suffice to quote the German Chemical Industry Association 's own text , which states that even if there is good ventilation , paints are stripped in restricted areas , the paint residues removed are collected and the DCM pots closed immediately , the exposure limit is still exceeded on a regular basis .
It is , in fact , the case that there are functional alternatives available in all the areas in which dichloromethane is currently used .
All in all , I am , in fact , very satisfied with the agreement .
This was , in fact , the last chance before REACH to ban chemicals in the old-fashioned way .
The reality is that those companies that are currently grumbling will , in many cases , also manufacture the alternatives , while there are also smaller companies that manufacture alternatives .
DCM is used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and as a paint stripper and degreaser , amongst other uses .
Some Member States , such as Sweden , Denmark and Austria , have already introduced a ban on DCM.
For this , I can but give high praise to our rapporteur , Mr Schlyter .
This is a serious failing , and one that I hold the Commission entirely responsible for .
By and large , this is a good agreement .
I urge the Commission , please , is it not possible for you to give us an indication that , in the future , there will be more bans on hazardous substances such as carcinogenic azo dyes , bisphenol A and the flame retardant deca-BDE ?
Following threats from the Commission about legal action in the European Court of Justice , Sweden has now begun to permit deca-BDE.
