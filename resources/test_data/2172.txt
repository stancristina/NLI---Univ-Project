This is a pity , in a sense .
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union .
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , tying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .
Surely this must be the ultimate goal .
Market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies .
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .
Fourthly , I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules .
Mr President , competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force .
How will the Commission , as keeper of the Treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London , Palermo , Helsinki and , soon , Budapest and Ankara ?
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report .
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .
Mr President , we all want to do something about combating European fraud .
Firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union .
Parliament supports this .
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner ?
Mr President , I would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admiration for , the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals .
However , it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled .
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated .
We want more than that , however .
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents .
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care .
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe .
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts .
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of documents .
In my opinion , the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management , but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general , empty proposals .
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that : " It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility " .
The number of departments has been reduced .
In return for this greater degree of autonomy , managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions .
Third , standards in European public life must be upheld .
Crucially , reforms must not be limited to the Commission .
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed .
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories .
The Commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired .
Is this possible ?
Let us be honest .
After all , it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report .
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem .
There is also the need to set up a scheme for so-called whistle-blowers .
It could be coordinated by a kind of European Public Prosecutor who is not involved in prosecution but passes criminal offences on to the national legal authorities .
Mr President , firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague , Mr van Hulten .
When the Commission ' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March , I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change .
Firstly , there is the Commissioners ' individual responsibility .
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch , now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so .
Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .
Secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .
It is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been
