I hope that all these facts show that the regime in Burma is not fit to govern and can no longer be respected or tolerated by the international community .
Does he think it will approve this proposal fairly quickly ?
I would prefer in future for the correct rule from the Rules of Procedure to be quoted , instead of using the name of some random Member .
So in addition to the issue of forced labour , there is every good reason for the Council to consider the Karens ' desperate fight for survival against the Burmese regime and the Thai Government .
This is the first time that the Commission has proposed to apply world trade sanctions on humanitarian grounds , and it has certainly done its work very thoroughly .
We unreservedly support the proposal to withdraw tariff preferences for Burma .
The pensions and health care costs in some Member States could even affect their chances of meeting the EMU convergence criteria , unless we do something to prevent it .
We need to focus our labour market policy on encouraging maximum participation among the potential workforce , and this means that people who are currently excluded from the labour market will have to be reintegrated into the employment process .
The solution to the problem lies in a whole raft of measures such as making the pensionable age more flexible , making greater use of capital investment systems - a point on which I hope Commissioner Bangemann agrees - and premium differentiation .
I would therefore urge that demographic trends should also be included in the annual employment report , or the Essen procedure as it is known .
I will come straight to the point .
More privatization also means that women will have to pay more premiums into private pension schemes if they live longer , and I wonder whether this will actually be the case .
I should like to hear him say that .
The situation has completely changed .
The resolution says that no part of the ban should be postponed for more than two years .
I would ask Mrs Bonino to look at paragraph 3 and to respond by telling us how things can be improved , so that at least some better statistics can be obtained .
Now that the principles of the construction of genetic material are starting to be known , a wave of research into humans , animals and plants is bearing down on us , on which we need to define our views .
It should at least have made the Commission rather more cautious in its approach .
I think it is her first - although I am not absolutely sure of that - but in any event she has been able to bring this difficult and complex technical report to a successful conclusion .
These often do not involve issues that attract particular attention , but ones where some years later , people see that if the directives have been contravened , very serious damage has occurred .
I think the whole House is reasonably agreed on this .
Surely we cannot take various measures in respect of one disease , but not another ?
Secondly , it needs to be less sweeping in certain places .
Nevertheless , I have a number of serious objections to the report as a whole .
This might seem a possible basis for a humane society , but if we do not recognize God 's law in our lives , then not all human rights are safe from attack .
The European Union has made considerable progress here .
Firstly , the inclusion of an article on non-discrimination in the Treaty of Amsterdam ; secondly , a code of conduct for political parties to prevent normally reputable parties from peddling extreme right-wing views for electoral reasons ; and , thirdly , a Monitoring Centre for Racism , which is the subject of this morning 's debate .
We also hope that the Major government will abandon its opposition to the Monitoring Centre , because its argument that there is no legal basis for it is both weak and irresponsible .
There were a good many points in the Commission 's proposal to which our committee - and indeed my group - objected , but we worked hard in the Committee on Civil Liberties with the rapporteur and Members from various other parties , and managed to produce an excellent result without any polarization .
We would emphasize that the Centre should be there to serve the research institutes .
On the pretext of fighting racism - which may exist as a marginal phenomenon , but has not reached sociologically or politically relevant proportions in any Member State - the taxpayer is having to foot the bill for a centre which is merely designed to gag freedom of expression , along the lines of those that exist already in various Member States .
Mr President , the Monitoring Centre is a theoretical instrument for combating racism , but in my view , practical measures are still the most effective ones , such as fighting unemployment , crime and the drugs trade ; establishing a clear and - eventually , I hope - a Community approach to asylum and immigration policy ; and , in particular , promoting education to prevent racism .
I was in Geneva last week , and I found out that the UN Commission on Human Rights is still treating the joint opinions delivered by the European Parliament as intergovernmental statements .
We know why this is .
And promoting growth and achieving the convergence criteria are not mutually exclusive , of course .
I think the only sensible thing to do is to withdraw the proposal as quickly as possible .
Mr President , I should like to speak first of all about
