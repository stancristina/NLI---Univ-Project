There is illegal immigrant status , which is regulated and dealt with in one way .
I believe that we can find this focus in Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou 's report , which I accordingly intend to support . on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done , and in particular on the fact that she has highlighted some important priorities enabling us to ensure that immigration is primarily understood as two-way integration - therefore involving social , linguistic and cultural aspects - that is to say integration based on mutual respect for rights and duties .
Some of the Members who have spoken - Mrs Angelilli and Mrs Morgantini - have raised the issue of communication .
Because there is a fear of reporting such cases , because they are never communicated , because the women themselves are subjected to violence so that they do not disclose the abuses that they are suffering within the free and democratic territory of the Member States .
His report translates in practical terms that which has already been provided for in the report on the Solidarity Fund , which represents the legal and financial basis for intervention in the field of civil protection .
The first signs came in Berlin in 1953 , followed by the cry for freedom in Pozna≈Ñ , in Poland , in 1956 .
They do not speak , however , of rejecting those ideas that led and inevitably lead to dictatorship and oppression .
The European Parliament has , with a great sense of responsibility , acted extremely swiftly and today brings to the attention of the Chamber the final text of the report on the MEDIA programme , which has of course been much improved , making resources more accessible to potential beneficiaries , strengthening cooperation with other Community programmes in the areas of education , training and research , as well as creating easier access to credit for the audiovisual industry in order to remedy the chronic underinvestment in the sector .
Moreover , the use of new technologies represents an inevitable shift towards rationalising costs and consequent competitiveness .
This Agency , created on the model of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency , should not only repair the damage caused by natural disasters , but also , and above all , fund preventative actions aimed at eliminating or reducing the causes of such disasters .
I am looking into the application of the framework decision on the fight against the sexual exploitation of minors and children and against the use of children in pornography .
However , it is quite clear that we must make sure that we root out and clamp down on criminals who use the Internet in order to establish closer contact with young people , who must obviously be protected .
A common thread runs through all of these topics , that of equal opportunities for all : for young people facing the world of work , who have a level of training that differs too much across the various Member States , and equal opportunities for women , who , in this old Europe , have not yet managed to attain the equality to which they are entitled even in the world of work . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I note that the Commission 's strategy has changed : before , we used to have such sound proposals , now , even these have disappeared .

How can we stand by and watch today , as though hypnotised , the flood of madness , brutality , violence and racism in our country ? [ ...] Our political and military leadership lacks substance .

I am tired : in my seven and a half years ' term of office in this Parliament , I have heard the timeworn phrase 'two peoples , two States ' repeated over and over again .
( The President cut off the speaker ) ( Applause ) on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my group is of course in favour of a general , worldwide ban on the production and use of biological weapons and on trade in them , and we hope that the forthcoming Geneva Conference will decide to strengthen the relevant international conventions .
The European Union needs to overcome its inertia and make putting pressure on the United States a key point in the Geneva negotiations . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports this draft resolution , because it sees it as a decisive step in the strategy to oppose the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that was adopted by Europe in December 2003 , and also because it makes reducing the biological weapons threat a top priority .
I too would like to begin with an observation .
It will give us an opportunity to collect further ideas , which , I believe , together with Mr Gargani 's report , will enable us to submit a legislative proposal in the near future .
