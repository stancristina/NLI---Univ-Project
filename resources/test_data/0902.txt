As we imagined , the difficulties in negotiating with the Moroccan authorities have been considerable .
Secondly , I must stress , with considerable bitterness , the lack of openness on the part of the Moroccan authorities involved in the negotiations .
The Commission and the Council of Ministers must shoulder their responsibilities , which involves not merely extending aid until the situation is resolved , but also reviewing the general framework for cooperation with Morocco in the event that this situation drags on .
On Tuesday , we debated in this Chamber the alarming breach in the Irish Sea of the ban on fishing for cod , that dish that is the very essence , by the way , of Portuguese cuisine .
The little information that is available is unclear , despite the fact that negotiations have continued - or so we are told - with various complicated ups and downs .
Does the European Union then not have sufficient weight and influence to convince its partner , Morocco , of the mutual advantages of signing the new agreement ?
What happens if the agreement fails ?
Switching this problem to the Structural Funds and to the Member States would mean discrediting the Union in the eyes not only of those affected , but of the general public too .
It is a sobering thought that the fight to end this activity involves seizing the proceeds of the original crime , which are later disguised as respectable wealth .
My report clearly supports the crux of the rationale behind the framework decision , with proposals that seek fundamentally to enable Member States to confiscate goods gained from serious crimes and to force them to punish offenders committing money-laundering crimes and to legislate against them , without the flexibility offered by the loopholes in previous legal instruments which made it easy for criminals to thumb their noses at the law and to control whole economies .
This would open up a totally unjustifiable and huge area of law consisting of crimes that will not be prosecuted at all .
I agree with the general thrust of the report , but I harbour some doubts as to the rapporteur ' s amendment claiming that this framework decision should also apply to less serious crimes .
We also acknowledge here that professional confidentiality is an essential factor in the administration of justice , since any breach of this law could entail a violation of our citizens ' civil liberties .
Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which has recently been adopted , stipulates that everyone has the right to be advised , defended and represented in the law and Article 48 states that respect for the right of the defence of anyone who has been charged shall be guaranteed .
To conclude , Mr President , I shall limit myself to saying that the position of my country ' s Bar Association on this issue is quite clear : professional confidentiality is the cornerstone and the fundamental duty of the lawyer .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as various speakers have emphasised , we are today looking at three legal instruments dealing with an activity that lies at the very heart of organised crime - money laundering .
We are convinced that this framework decision will constitute a significant advance in enabling common sanctions to be established for all the countries in the European Union .
I repeat , I should like to ask Parliament to revise the date of 31 December 2002 , so that the Commission can present an assessment report on the transposal of the framework decision into national law .
For the Commission ' s part , and we await Parliament ' s opinion on this , we feel that the decisions not to allow tax and banking confidentiality to be invoked if this impedes the prosecution of money-laundering crimes are essential instruments to guaranteeing the success of this legislation at European level .
What I would like to stress here today , from my own point of view , is that this opinion must not only enshrine clear , unambiguous legislation on guarantees to protect defendants and on the conditions in which the confidentiality of the legal professions - and of lawyers in particular - may be legitimately exercised .
You all know how important I consider the issue of such control to be .
Mr President , the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament feels able to support these three initiatives , which , in fact , all have an important role in strengthening an action plan for combating money laundering .
The proposal that we have before us today , that a provisional unit for judicial cooperation should be established , must therefore be considered to be the first stage in the process of creating Eurojust .
Commissioner Vitorino ended the previous debate by drawing attention to the initiative that is now underway for a measure seeking to communitise EUROPOL : we look forward most keenly to the presentation of this proposal so that we can state our opinion .
This is merit that should be retained and encouraged for future projects , specifically future revisions of the European Union Treaties .
Lastly , I have two proposals : firstly , the signing and ratification of this Charter of Fundamental Rights by their parliaments should be part of existing Community rules for candidate countries .
There is , of course , the geographical problem .
And what of the Kurdish question , which arises from the fact that the Turkish State does not respect the basic rights of cultural identity of the millions of Kurds that live there ?
In future , will its clauses have a merely symbolic value or will they become binding for Community institutions and , consequently , for the European public ?
Meanwhile , as I said at the beginning of this explanation
