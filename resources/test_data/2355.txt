within the geographical borders of the Member States or even the candidate countries , but must be based on information from as many countries as possible , if it is to help prevent and combat the problem more efficiently .
For example , in Greece , most of the information obtained so far has been from treatment centres , leaving sources of information from other agencies which might contribute towards a more integrated evaluation of the dimensions of the problem unexplored .
However , according to prison statistics , the majority of drug users in prison are economic migrants who , either because they do not speak the language or because of a lack of information and social exclusion , have never set foot in such a centre .
At least two main criteria must be met if we are to achieve this objective : first , we need reliable assessments of the measures taken and , if they are efficient , we need to implement them , not only in the Member States , but also in the candidate countries , the rest of central and eastern Europe and in any third country with the right legal framework under relevant agreements .
We need to amend it as described in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament .
As far as non-application is concerned , there are still serious delays in certain sectors , including the social sector , to which , I am sorry to see , the Commission ' s report only devotes a few lines , despite the fact that the issues in question relate to social cohesion .
What if each country which took over the presidency had to make a prompt , public declaration of its country 's degree of compliance with Community law , given that it does not make sense for a country to be responsible for administering political matters when it has not honoured its own commitments ?
Despite appearing different , both have the same root cause , which is the national judges ' lack of familiarity with Community law .
Finally , I should like to say a brief word about where the Committee on Petitions can play an important part in improving the degree of application of Community law .
The Helsinki resolution on major enlargement raises the existential question of the institutional structure needed in order for the European Union to function with 28 Member States .
This attitude on the part of the leaders of Europe causes a problem for the following reason : the purpose of this intergovernmental conference was supposedly to lay down the institutional requirements for enlargement .
However , surely these institutional requirements include safeguarding the credibility of the European Union .
I have two comments to make on this .
An extremely interesting dialogue , with new ideas which , overall , strengthened the European vision , irrespective of whether you agree or disagree with it .
Perhaps Feira , in conjunction with the Franco-German dialogue , means that the Intergovernmental Conference was bypassed before it even finished .
I also think , however , that the institutional unity of the European Union needs to be protected .
I think that Feira will go down in the history books not so much for what it said but mainly for what it did not say on institutional issues .
The Portuguese Presidency referred to federalism and to future issues in general , but without , for example , raising the matter of own resources and without a spectacular increase in own resources , enlargement will become practically impossible and politically painful .
In essence , as far as employment , competition and environmental and public health policies are concerned , the Lisbon Summit made minor concessions to the citizens of Europe , but not enough to meet their real needs .
Europe will be complete once we are all involved , including those who want no part in it .
The Turkish checkpoint has been moved into the buffer zone , thereby hampering the movements of the United Nations forces and cutting off a Greek village .
I too wish to raise exactly the same issue : as you know , the third round of talks between the two communities is about to start .
Under these circumstances , the future of Cyprus should give us serious cause for concern .
The question , is this : what is the European Parliament doing in order to get the Turkish forces to withdraw immediately from the 300 metres which they have occupied , thereby extending the territory which they occupy and , more to the point , what is the European Parliament doing to free Cyprus from the occupying forces ?
The question which I am basically asking is what can be done to ensure that products from these regions reach the markets of the Member States of the European Union ?
My question is : exactly what steps can the European Union take in order to create these networks , which did not previously exist , so that these people can sell their products ?
Take , for example , the air embargo , which has not been ratified by a single UN Security Council .
Mr President , I have submitted a similar question , Question No 20 .
We have doubled infant mortality due to the lack of drugs .
The Turkish occupying forces occupied another 200 metres of Cypriot soil and set up a roadblock next to the last British base , cutting off 10 Greek Cypriots who are now hostages .
Perhaps Turkey feels that its compliance is something akin to the Munich Agreement and that is why it is advancing ?
Nonetheless , allow me to risk another question , in the hope this time of receiving a satisfactory answer .
Allow me to say that they both explained the technical aspects of their reports extremely well
