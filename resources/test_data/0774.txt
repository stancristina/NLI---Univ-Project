.
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel , the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum .
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security .
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising .
On the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement .
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment , as well as the transfer of territories .
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted , as well as not approving new ones , pose further obstacles .
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , I believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely .
At present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security .
Currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed .
In conclusion , while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process , Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward .
I sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East , all the key protagonists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved .
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown .
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises .
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised .
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress .
The first is asylum .
It is essential to establish a single European system , but one based on fairness , full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention .
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years .
The second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals .
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression .
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems .
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation-state , and so on .
But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France , including British student , Isabel Peake , who was thrown off a train , shows why we need mutual recognition .
Arrested and released in Madrid , he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon .
Whatever the Eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .
Finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and I hope that the IGC will cover this , to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony .
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists .
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons , nor have the loyalist terrorists , yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community .
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed .
In 1998 , we had 55 murders .
In 1999 , we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured .
Between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people .
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193 , while those against republicans totalled 97.
Since January 2000 , there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans , loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults , one leading to another murder , while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults .
Mr President , that situation cannot continue and needs remedying .
Mr President , unlike some of the previous speakers , I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino .
