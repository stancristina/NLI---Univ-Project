struck the European Union and its citizens have had tragic consequences .
On 27 September the Commission therefore adopted a proposal based on a Council decision which instituted a Community mechanism to coordinate measures for civil protection during emergencies .
Finally , although the structural funds are not designed to address the consequences of natural disasters , they can be used for reconstruction projects if the beneficiary Member States allocate the funds for such uses and the region hit by the disaster is eligible .
The actions must have a transitional nature , one or two years maximum , and they may not continue throughout the programming period .
With regard to cooperation on spatial planning solutions to flooding problems , the Commission knows that the Interreg III guidelines make specific reference to the possibility of formulating joint strategies for risk management in areas prone to natural disasters and drawing up and implementing integrated strategies and actions for the prevention of flooding in transnational river catchment areas .
The European Parliament regularly asks the Commission to intervene on behalf of the victims of these disasters .
In any case , our deliberations will need to consider past experience which would suggest that there are two possible courses of action .
Individual variation is very great .
I consider that the Commission ' s strategy document in this area is very good .
We need greater knowledge , research must be given priority , risk assessment must be accelerated and possible replacement substances must be identified .
We need consultation with Member States , with industry and with a variety of organisations .
Agreements such as time limits on use , restrictions on release onto the market and the phasing in of various risk-free products are often preferable when the circumstances have not been clarified , but where it is valuable to be flexible and to take measures rapidly .
The current Common Agricultural Policy is not only expensive for the Union , but also contributes to higher consumer prices .
The EU' s agricultural policy , in the form of export and production subsidies , should therefore be wound down and , to a certain extent , replaced by subsidies for bio-diversity and environmental measures .
To request a revision of the Financial Perspective at this stage would be unfortunate .
Funds can also be released through mobilisation of the flexibility instrument .
We feel that , if the Member States have the will , they will be able to find available funds that are not being utilised in the budget being worked on today .
In proportion to the Member States ' finances , the Council ' s proposal represents the smallest budget for more than 10 years .
We are firmly resolved to find the funds required in order to be able to provide increased aid for reconstruction and democratisation in the Balkans , including in Serbia , now .
This needs to undergo more extensive reform in the future , partly in order to provide scope for the expansion of the EU.
The EU' s agricultural policy is far too expensive .
On this point , we have voted in favour of amendments that aim to abolish the tobacco subsidy .
However , Parliament has been delighted to accept the Commission ' s proposal to establish new budget sub-headings for local and regional cooperation in the Baltic region within the framework of the Phare pre-accession instrument .
We have therefore voted in favour of Amendment No 3 from the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities , where this is required .
If the European Parliament were now to abolish its Friday sittings in Strasbourg , for example , this would save EUR 1 million .
That , if anything , demonstrates the low level of motivation that this EU project has , even among politically active citizens .
It must be possible to provide education in good administration in order to counter corruption and , in the same way , to support opposition parties .
Mr President , this is a very good report that is humane in intent , but the aim is nonetheless to stop the flow of human beings from and through Albania .
Clearly , they are fleeing from oppression , terror and war , but they are also fleeing from chaos and poverty .
The hard method - the police - can be used when it comes to the trade in children and women and to slave labour .
Our forefathers went to the United States to create a life in freedom , as they believed .
We are trying to stand in the way of those who are doing the same thing today .
Let us try to see the truth with open eyes .
This especially applies to paragraphs 3 and 4 , in which it is assumed as a matter of course that the EU should be allowed - in fact , be almost entitled - to fish in Moroccan waters .
Nor do I think it goes without saying that the EU should finance compensation for fishermen who have fished in waters outside the European Union .
For example , a number of Swedish boats have fished off Morocco .
I should like to ask the Commission whether these matters are being discussed in the negotiations with Morocco .
Mr President , the world ' s largest common legal area is on the way to becoming a reality .
It is essential , if the rule of law is to be upheld , for judicial cooperation in criminal matters to be developed in line with the competences of Europol .
Setting up the provisional unit is only a first step .
In view of the subsidiarity principle , I am therefore opposed to a common catalogue of criminal law and to the EU as a common judicial body in all criminal law - if anyone should happen to see any such development as being of topical relevance right now
