I ask all the Union 's citizens to note that it is therefore not the Commission and the Parliament but their own governments which cannot grasp something as simple as the fact that the reconstruction work in Kosovo must be carried out in Kosovo and from Kosovo .
It simply wo n't do .

This case is interesting .
I consider that these persistent colleagues , who are keen to give their own ruling in the case brought before the Court , thus pre-empting the course of events by pronouncing a judgment without court proceedings , in obvious violation of Article 213 , and depriving the man of his pension rights , are usurping a function which is rightly a matter for the courts .
However , I will take another starting point and say that I , representing the Danish opponents of the Union , the People 's Movement against the EU , owe Mr Bangemann a debt of gratitude .
The truth which is evident today , namely that the large States have unlimited power and outrageous dominance over small , less fortunate States such as the State which I represent , Denmark .
We now owe Herr Bangemann a debt of gratitude for yet another eye-opener .
We are not here to reproach Mr Bangemann for damaging trust in this project .
Mr Bangemann 's offence is that he has made this fundamentally corrupt system visible , so that any European voter could see it and therefore choose to stay at home on voting day , as most people did between 10 and 13 June , thus depriving this assembly of any form of democratic legitimacy .
That was all I wanted to say .
However , we wish to draw attention to three points on which we do not share the group 's position .
We abstained from voting on this point , since the European Parliament 's proposal for a statute is unsatisfactory .3.The point concerning the next Intergovernmental Conference , since we consider that the Conference should only cover enlargement and not be hampered by extensive reforms .
It is an expression which I do not think sounds alarming enough in relation to the problem we are confronted with here and which does not at all convey the seriousness of the matter .
We have all seen pictures of thousands of birds covered in oil .
Obviously , the responsibility lies with the Member States , but I also think I am right in saying that there are two reasons why cooperation at European level is required .
And secondly , we derive a lot of benefit from being able to exchange experience and expertise with one another , so that we can make use of each other ' s experience and support each other in taking measures to prevent and combat damage .
That was recognised in the EU as long as 20 years ago with the first initiatives involving cooperation in this area , and the proposal we now have before us is in fact one which , in reality , extends and implements the cooperation established at that time .
I should like to indicate four areas where I think it is a question of really useful innovations , especially when the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment are included .
It is not only oil spills we are talking about .
It may be a question of leaks from radioactive materials or of leaks which can cause people ' s hormonal balance to be upset .
Any measures taken ought to relate to all these materials .
It is simply a key tool for efficient cooperation in this area so that we might quickly exchange information and so intervene early on .
The third thing I want to mention is the reference in the comments to the Directive concerning harbour facilities for receiving waste from ships .
It is important that ships should easily be able to dispose of their waste .
The final matter I want to refer to is the question of involving neighbouring non-EU countries in Eastern and Central Europe and in the Mediterranean and Baltic areas .
If cooperation is to be effective , then it is enormously important that we involve these countries .
After emphasising these four points , however , I would say that we are very glad to support the proposal , together with the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment .
Madam President , the hearings have provided no clear answer .
We still do not know these 15 men and 5 women .
We shall also insist upon clear answers on the subject of openness .
Will the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control receive all the documents concerning fraud that she requests ?
Will Mr Prodi , here in the Chamber , solemnly promise that there will no longer be documents in the Commission which can be read at COPA , within the national delegations , in the lobbying firms and by journalists but not by ourselves , who have merely been elected by the people ?
Dear Professor Prodi , at the meeting with my group you promised that there would always be a place in Parliament where full information could be obtained from the Commission .
Will you repeat that promise here today in the Chamber , where it is binding ?
As a newly elected Member of this Parliament , I had been rather looking forward to taking part in the democratic process which was planned before we were finally to adopt a position on the Commission .
They had been prepared by officials and by the outgoing Parliament .
This can scarcely be called particularly democratic .
And yet it now looks as if it was not an open democratic process that decided the matter .
What was decisive was the conversation which you , Mr Prodi , had with Mr Poettering from the Group of
