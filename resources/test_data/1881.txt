It is now down to our countries to act ; we have the appropriate instruments , we ought to be able to make good use of them .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are voting in favour of a further redistribution of the funds , on the basis of recommendations that our rapporteurs have tried to optimise , particularly at a time of budget shortages , regarding the distribution of resources and main aims .
Cohesion policy helps distribute the benefits of European economic development , by anticipating change and helping areas that are in difficulty , often for structural or geographical reasons .
Supporting regional identity while pursuing convergence at a European level with regard to development and improving conditions for growth and employment is , in fact , an essential precondition for achieving the Lisbon objectives and boosting the economy , especially at local and regional levels .
We must decide that dumping and relocations need to be combated with specific rules , because they have nothing to do with competition and the market , but actually undermine social cohesion and burden us all with unbearable costs .
There are many cases nowadays in relation to which problems are arising , problems that go by the name of relocation , non-compliance with trade union agreements , and job losses .
I should like to broach two subjects : the issue of building the European research area and the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises .
Building the European research area means building the single market for that most precious of commodities : knowledge .
This negative attitude is linked to the small scale of our businesses , which have an average of four employees , but , although the phenomenon is particularly serious in my country , it also concerns most of Europe .
As regards the other aspect , an industrial policy is understood to mean an integrated policy , which requires integrated , practical measures , but this policy must also be designed – and this is where we call on the Commission to make an extra effort – by bearing in mind all of the various aspects : purely industrial aspects , research aspects , energy aspects and commercial aspects .
I am aware that there are some technical problems , but I am also aware of the political decision that the Council of Europe confirmed some days ago , which we are obliged to respect and to cause to be respected .
We also have Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome , which more specifically states that its provisions shall not apply to the right of association .
I believe that when grounds of reprisal have been ascertained , the judiciary should take particularly strong measures .
There are other provisions that are affected ; and I can only tell you that I shall pass on a request to the competent Directorate-General and to Mr Špidla that this technical study should be considerably speeded up .
I do not wish to comment on what the Prime Minister has said ; but I will say that the Commission envisages that countries must recognise – even if after a transitional period , which we hope will be brief – that the citizens of the new Member States of the European Union have the right to free movement .     Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the Commission ’s attitude reflects its need to understand the situation before taking any decisions .
For this reason I consider that the greater part of manufacturing production should remain in Europe .
I am against dirigisme and protectionist policies .
Taking these specialities as a starting point , we shall gradually be able to take more vigorous action against dumping in order to provide concrete support to revitalise the internal market .
The amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance express a concern that we can share .
In his speech , Mr Vanhanen said that ‘we need more Europe ' , and he was right , for the things your presidency has chosen as the headings for the chapters in its programme – such things as the challenge of globalisation , the new Lisbon strategy , energy , partnership – all these things are now beyond the capacity of nation states to resolve .
That is terrific , and we are right there with you on that , but , in his speech just now , Mr Vanhanen had this to say : ‘ I am convinced that an enlarging Union needs the Constitutional Treaty that was negotiated by its Member States . ’ – Enlargement and the Constitution are two sides of the same coin .
While we are on this subject , let me make a final observation .
Let us take energy : energy cannot be regarded as a commodity like any other , it is the key issue of the future , which requires us to go down the road of the Kyoto Protocol and far beyond , to switch to renewable sources , by abandoning fossil fuels , and not to run the unacceptable risks of nuclear energy use ; it requires fairness and solidarity and not conflicts , trade wars or even , as is sometimes the case , military wars ; it requires another vision of the economy , of society , of politics and of democracy .
Europe is talking about an energy community , and that is a good idea , but , in order to exist , that community requires the aforesaid choices to be made , and made together with the others – from Russia to South America and to Africa – and not against them .
I therefore hope that the Council will be able to support the requests that will come from Parliament in this connection , regarding the instruments that
