members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war .
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects , not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo ?
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?
Briefly , just to follow on from that last point , I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission 's objections , such as they are , would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme , but simply that the Commission has a concern , which it has the right to have under Community law , to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify .
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99 ) : Subject : Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations ( Art . 4.2 ) .
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 ( TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption ?
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination .
For instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian .
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .
Surely what we should be doing , and I hope you will agree , Commissioner , is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice , no matter how sincerely held .
Mr President , the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so .
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that is , by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers ' money in Europe .
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget .
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them .
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes , particularly in third countries , without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing .
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources .
That cannot excuse everything that we came across .
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so .
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock .
From what I have seen of the reform process , it looks good .
I saw some of Mr Kinnock 's papers today , I heard some of what he had to say .
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .
But we need that reform process .
Many of the general points raised in our committee 's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan 's report .
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details .
It groups them together and that is very important .
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to .
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe .
We have to get this right .
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly .
We have to remedy that .
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending .
We need proper information , given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past .
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible .
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue .
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .
Mr President , I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which , as you are all so very well aware , led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission .
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge
