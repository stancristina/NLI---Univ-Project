ranging from domain name management to the risk of a US monopoly , to the German judiciary 's initiatives concerning providers ' real or presumed responsibilities , not forgetting the risk of a proliferation of dissimilar legislation from one country to another as electronic commerce gradually gains ground .
I should now like to hear him comment on the state of play .
I confirm the full support of our group .
Here again , the role of the Union must of course be to provide humanitarian aid to meet the urgent needs of the population , including the thousands of refugees in neighbouring countries , and also to take action to promote dialogue , reconciliation and respect for human rights , if necessary through initiatives of its own .
The Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law , approved by the Government of the Philippines and the former rebels on 7 August 1998 , is being respected .
First let us say what it is not about .
What are the fundamental factors underpinning this report ?
For codes of conduct - voluntary or not - standards , principles and instruments of control to be realistic and effective , they must necessarily be based on the direct involvement of all those concerned : institutions , companies , trade unions , NGOs , etc .
Of course , it is necessary to prevent certain extremely negative cases from ending up polluting the climate and causing foreign involvement to be considered unsuitable .
So supporting European firms in this context is fundamental , because they are the major direct investors in developing countries and play a decisive role in sustainable global socio-economic development .
Progressive expansion of social awareness , international recognition of human rights and free movement of goods , persons , capital and services could be counted among the positive aspects .
Of course we know a close correlation exists between democracy and development , but that can never be used as an excuse to justify anti-democratic regimes and violations of the most elementary human rights , to deny the right to participate in decision-making , to tolerate widespread corruption , and so on .
Given that I agree with everything contained in both the Commission 's communication and Mr Fernández Martín 's report , I do not want to go into the substance of the various initiatives proposed .
In fact few reports have been put together so fast since the Committee on Development and Cooperation came into being .
Mr President , I appeal to you and the office of President to find some time , if only little , during this part-session of Parliament to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the death of a young European who gave his life for the freedom and dignity of his people and his country .
Mr President , I share the view that the Titley report is an important one , and it comes at a significant time .
That is the right road .
Finally , I think it is right to mention that the Titley report contains a small paragraph , which we should bear in mind , on the ratification of the Ottawa Treaty on Anti-Personnel Mines by all the Member States .
We have been following the same policy of not acknowledging that Chinese citizens , like us , have a right to democracy .
We forget about them , we listen to dissidents when they are released from prison and we applaud them , but we forget that tens of thousands of other political prisoners are being subjected to violence and torture and very often killed , even as we debate this report here today .
He forgets the positive examples but he also forgets about North Korea , a vassal of the People 's Republic of China .
No fewer than twenty resolutions have been tabled over the past five years , calling , in particular , for the release of dissidents .
It is easy to get angry with Sierra Leone or Guinea - Bissau , but much more difficult to tell the truth about what is happening in China today .
In the light of all this , I ask you all whether there should not be a radical change in the attitude of the European Parliament and the Commission towards this bloody and oppressive regime .
As Commissioner Wulf-Mathies has frequently told us in committee , communication is needed , a great deal of communication .
I am thinking of sectors like shipbuilding , the motor industry , iron and steel and textiles , all areas in serious crisis and needing to achieve social and economic cohesion even earlier than the rest .
So I hope the Commission will not only continue its work with determination but will also take proper account of Parliament 's recommendations .
Mr President , we definitely need a strategy which targets better coordination of regional policy and competition policy at European level .
In addition to that there is also a problem for the ultraperipheral and island regions which , because of their difficult geographic position and their particular intrinsic nature , are already amongst the least favoured regions in the whole Community .
Here the rapporteur has highlighted the importance of having competition rules capable of guaranteeing the proper and transparent operation of the internal market , bearing in mind that exceptions to free competition , in the form of aid to Member States , are justified for the purpose of preserving economic and social cohesion .
From Rome to Maastricht it was recognised that we needed a cohesion policy geared to strengthening the less favoured regions of the Union , thus substantially pursuing the same purpose - a homogeneous common market .
Secondly , it covers future work on policies and measures to be implemented which are already on the agenda for the next conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention .
