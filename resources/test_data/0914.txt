For this reason the system should be introduced as soon as possible .
It seems as if we are only needed to liberalise the trade in goods and services .
Free citizens cannot trust in a policy that casts everyone in the same mould and turns the electorate into mere consumers .
However , I would like to address another aspect of the issue .
For that reason , the markets are not free .
The money market is a dictator of market forces , as it is not really monitored openly .
However , I fear we shall have problems if we are merely to examine the status of gypsies on a country-by-country basis in the enlargement negotiations .
The problems of the Romanies are nevertheless cause for much concern .
Madam President , I had to vote against Mr Rothley 's report as the whole issue of pay and the switch to a European Union system of taxation , or what in practice is exemption from paying taxes , and the travel expenses scheme , cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of the ordinary citizen .
This is one of the more blatant problems our citizens simply will not condone .
But there should be no kind of chicanery or flat-rate payments made when the travel expenses are claimed later .
The work of MEPs is to some extent bound up with work carried out also in their home countries , where they have their regular place of abode , so that there is no justification for any differences in levels of taxation between them and the rest of the citizens they represent .
We believe that allowing these rules , which we have been calling for and drafting for such a long time now , to come to nothing would harm the European Parliament 's standing and reputation .
The first concerns the users of research .
Organisations that represent the people and democratically elected decision-makers must also be able to participate in the planning and monitoring of research .
We have to make sure that both sufficient resources are available for research into the status of women and the promotion of equality , and that women are represented in groups involved in the selection and appraisal of projects .
In this connection I would also like to stress the importance of research into health and safety at work , which is also well worth investing in .
Finally I would like to state that I am in full agreement with what Mr Fitzsimmons said just now about nuclear research , which is that we should invest in renewable energy resources .
Madam President , first I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Viola for their excellent work .
The budget for next year is being created on the whole with consensus , and with little dissension , among Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
Personally , I am pleased that the planned EUR 130 million of appropriations for the TACIS programme have not been placed in reserve , as it would have paralysed this important programme and jeopardised , among other things , measures to improve nuclear safety .
Closely connected with this will be resolving the EU 's finances , which includes the issue of net contributions .
The Agenda 2000 resolutions will be vital for the budgets over the coming years .
For that reason , we must focus on its entry into force .
For this reason I hope that we can debate this issue just as we did the previous one , in a spirit of cooperation , for the sake of the EU and , above all , its Member States and citizens .
In Parliament 's Committee on Budgets we roundly condemned the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions to pay officials their salaries during the strike in May , but as the view of Parliament is not reflected in the budget , it counts for nothing .
But it lost the wrestling match with the Council .
In the end Parliament always humbly does what the EU political elite wants .
Parliament spent a whole morning criticising the Commission for the ineffectual way it monitors finances .
Thus Parliament itself will be powerless when it comes to looking for those guilty of fraudulent activity regarding EU surplus agricultural produce on the market .
With the European Parliament approach it is easier to squander money all in one go than to squander it in a few small amounts .
Mr President , I cannot overemphasise the importance of the issue that has been raised by some speakers already , that is to say , the basic question of how the Agenda 2000 dossier is to be moved forward .
The Commission has its job to do here , and so have Parliament and the Council , but the Commission must not forget that its particular job is immensely important .
In the field of environmental policy , it has to be said that Commission 's work programme is not the most ambitious .
I would urge the Commission to attend to this , so that next year Parliament can start debating framework legislation that should in particular include proposals for integrating environmental issues into transport , agricultural and energy policy .
Before any new enlargement the European Union must , however , see to it that the policies of the separate northern dimension are realised and that next year the means are found to make progress on those issues designed to make policies in the European Union 's Nordic regions more effective .
This principle is obviously in force .
But of course statistics on staffing and nationality indicate that , depending on official rank , a few nationalities are over-represented and a few
