It is to be hoped that one substantial outcome from the Summit will be the beginning of negotiations with Central America .
That , too , is important , for the promotion of civil society in Latin America is one of the European Union’s concerns , and the alternative summit to which you referred will doubtless be a very interesting event , and I hope that it will be well-conducted and peaceful .
With regard to Colombia , too , I would say to you that we obviously support those responsible for human rights there , and also the victims among the population .
Nevertheless , I wanted to bring these rather more general considerations into the debate .
It is an unacceptable situation , and that alone requires special consideration .
The Court of Auditors also criticised the coordination , stating that 'the coordination of the various sources of Community funding for transport infrastructure projects by the various Directorates-General does not allow the Commission to detect all cases of over- or double funding ' .
We are all well aware of the 'you scratch my back , and I will scratch yours ' attitude .
There were some particularly controversial discussions regarding the Committee of the Regions during the consultations in committee .
It would be interesting to find out why these accounts were not identified in the budget .
As the rapporteur , there were certain goals of which I never lost sight : a functioning internal market in UCITS ; an attractive and safe range of products for investors , particularly for small investors ; and an efficient asset management industry that would have no need to fear increasingly global competition .
What will also have a positive effect will be the industry ’s own initiative and improved interaction on the part of the interested parties , particularly of the supervisory authorities .
The demand for sound national consumer protection rules to prevent the distance marketing of financial services from degenerating into unfair competition and misleading advertising has also been rejected , and that , too , is a shame .
Over one-third of all accidents resulting in personal injury happen at night , and over half of them happen to someone who is on their own .
The cost of their installation is currently estimated at between EUR 150 and EUR 300 , with the ‘possible ’ hope of its ‘possibly ’ becoming cheaper .
If we manage to reduce deaths , and the number of suffering human beings , by 7 000 , then that is worth every effort .
The Commission will , however , give way to the pressure exerted by the German and now have the progress report on the accession countries translated , so perhaps this gives rise to the hope that more use will be made of German under the Finnish Presidency .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Mavrommatis , for his dedication .
It is counter-productive for a language indicator not to be sensitive to these future needs or flexible enough to address them , and so I again urge you all , today , to support the amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , further to Rule 168( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure , I have heard that three of our groups are having problems with this draft resolution , with the consequent risk of there being , on this important matter , which is of course to some degree connected with the debate and with the Members ’ Statute , no majority – or at any rate , not a large one – whereas a large one is what we want .
Things have come to such a pass that their culture is attempting to force ours , even in our own countries , to yield place to it .
My sense of justice has led me to agree to this matter being referred back , since if , in a committee , only eight people vote and certain groups are not represented at all , I think it would be fairer and better to avoid a formal error and send the matter back .
It is a disgrace that Taiwan , the only Chinese state with a democratic system , is not allowed even observer status at the World Health Organisation .
The journeys take a very long time , the lorries used are full to bursting point , and the animals are short of water , food , and ventilation .
Every newly-appointed Commission should , immediately after taking office , draw up a list of the legislative proposals produced by its predecessor indicating which of the pending proposals it is planning to keep.
Current legislative procedures have been reviewed in the light of the new considerations and priorities that have recently emerged .
What they expect is not deregulation , not the erosion of rights and certainties , but rather that European legislation should be clear , simple , comprehensible and usable , so let us work together to that end .     . – Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , I will start by expressing my gratitude to the rapporteur for the very good report but above all for having taken on board the Committee on Legal Affairs ’ opinion to a considerable degree .
My second observation is this : Mr Corbett said , and rightly , that Parliament acquired the right of codecision over a period of time and that there is therefore something missing from Article 250( 2 ) , in that it states only that the Commission can no longer withdraw legislation once the Council has delivered its Common Position , but it does not state that it could not do so either following the first reading in this House .
