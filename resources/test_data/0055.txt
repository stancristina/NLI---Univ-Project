The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention , which expires at the end of this month .
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years .
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries .
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste .
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects .
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity .
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member .

Mr President , I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs --some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lomé Agreement , which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world .
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world .
While others may have the biggest rockets , the EU has the deepest pockets .
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of , and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often .
The Labour Government ' s record in Britain is also a proud one .
Clare Short , MP , is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and , as such , can take her case to the very heart of government .
Gordon Brown , MP , meanwhile , has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour ' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel .
Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban , Labour ' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same .
There is still much to be done , however .
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle .
It must be a 'development round ' , in which developing countries , effectively excluded from previous rounds , are fully included .
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves .
Developing countries want trade not aid , a help up not a hand-out .
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products .
In this way , the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good , to benefit the poor not just the wealthy , the many not just the few .
Thus , whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown , Labour ' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same .
Swoboda report ( A5-0031/2000 )
Mr President , last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine , the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres .
I , like all Members present , am saddened by this loss of jobs .
Equally , I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution .
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company ' s decision .
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes , in this institution , forget that Europe cannot survive alone .
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent .
In my few months here , I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU , nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave .
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective , adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted .
Two days later , Toyota , which employs several thousand people in my region , stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant .
In a world where surely less regulation is the key , we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union , untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens .
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them .
Take a large successful business , add European regulations , and within months you have created a small one .
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here .
Mr President , earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission ' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment .
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion .
What is more , the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority .
Yet , all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies .
