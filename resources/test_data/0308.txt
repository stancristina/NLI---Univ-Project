There has been a great deal of talk about the railways over the past ten years , but it has done little to help .
Decisions need to be taken .
I am not sure whether this excellent and instructive proverb is also found in the other ten official languages .
In this Parliament - and in all the EU 's institutions , including the Commission and the Council - people consistently and with an almost religious zeal follow the once adopted map and ignore the terrain .
Firstly , in our opinion - and in the opinion of many Danish andNordic citizens - the enlargement project is heading in the wrong direction .
It is not a project which is based on democratisation , but one which is about empire-building .
This is a sharp reminder that you cannot ignore the terrain without the terrain taking revenge at some stage .
Thirdly , this summit is taking place only days after we in Parliament were discussing the most serious constitutional crisis the institutions have yet faced , and I can imagine that - as so often in the past - the agenda of this summit will be different from the one which reflects the current political reality .
There are two things to which I would like to draw attention .
These states clearly want to be able to operate in a liberal market and earn money .
They want to earn money and they want access to a liberal market on different terms from those we wish to see .
Should an Ignalina nuclear power station price-dump on the European market ?
And the conflict will intensify later today when we discuss Mr Adam 's second report .
It therefore becomes a debate in which energy is left out of the real negotiations .
And yet we must maintain the demands for closure , even if our colleagues in the Lithuanian Parliament cannot accept them .
At the same time , however , we must be realistic , because the funds we are making available and the financing we can offer is peanuts compared to what such an operation will cost .
It will not work otherwise .
It creates a conflict in the political situation , in the political negotiations connected with accession .
To Mr RÃ¼big , I would first like to say that I do not believe Parliament fulfilled its responsibilities , because we should have sacked the whole Commission in January , but that is by the way .
The question can easily be answered , regardless of the outcome next month of the investigation into the Commission which is currently in progress .
We cannot fire the whole Commission .
I seem to remember that in his speech Mr Fischer said the German Presidency was in favour of giving Parliament increased powers , which would in fact be equivalent to it becoming a real parliament and the Commission becoming a real government .
Have I understood correctly ?
Is that really what Mr Fischer said in his speech here in Parliament ?
Madam President , as all the other speakers here have pointed out , the safety of nuclear power stations is the most important issue when the EU is dealing with the nuclear power sector in the applicant countries and the New Independent States , and it is unacceptable to grant these countries transitional arrangements .
The reaction to this is often that new nuclear power stations will be built instead .
We cannot export views that we ourselves no longer hold to other countries .
Therefore , the most important thing in the Commission 's communication is in fact that it emphasises the need to draw up energy plans for the whole energy sector , and not just the electricity sector , with particular emphasis on energy saving , developing alternative sources of energy and using energy efficiently .
What is needed is something else , and not least in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
Madam President , I am pleased to see that there is a large measure of agreement on the importance of developing new forms of energy among all of us here in Parliament and at the Commission .
That is why demonstration projects are incredibly important .
The good results we obtain in demonstration projects are made available not only to our Member States in the EU , but also to the applicant countries and the third world , where the fastest growth in energy consumption is taking place .
The most capable countries , the most capable institutions and the most capable industries are the ones who will show us the direction in which to go .
And we know that the use of fossil fuels will double by the year 2020 .
I see increased research and the development of new technology as the only way forward .
In the long run , only an increased awareness of the problems through information and education will lead to responsible use of our limited energy resources .
Madam President , the annual economic report confirms that the introduction of the euro has come at a time when the economies of the Member States are far too divergent .
Public deficits are to be reduced without increasing taxes or other charges .
In fact , these are also to be reduced .
That means , for Denmark at least , that we would have to cut tax-financed welfare benefits .
The recommendations to reduce the budget deficit and to increase public investment are directly contradictory .
It is also clearly the reason for the record high level of unemployment in the EU.
The trouble is that this has not happened , and there is no sign that it will happen .
The Adam report has not taken this into account .
Nor does it spell out a clear policy for financing the form of energy which will replace
