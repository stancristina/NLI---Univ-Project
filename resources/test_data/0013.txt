I hope that improved relations between the EU and North Africa may result from the Mediterranean programme .
Today we wait for the outcome of the Lockerbie trial from a Scottish court in the Netherlands , but I understand it is the intention of the British to foster , in future , better diplomatic and other relations with , for example , Libya .
I have a question for the Council .
Could Mr Danielsson confirm that the EU' s Mediterranean programme is coordinated with the enlargement process to which the presidency attaches so much importance ?
I wonder if it might be possible for the Commissioner in his reply to dwell on the criticisms of underspending sometimes levelled at the MEDA programme .
Is it the case that the Commission stands ready when necessary to give administrative support in the formulation of suitable programmes , as they did in the past when I wrote a report on the Alfama and Mouraria areas of Lisbon ?
Is it the case that , if there were to be underspending , the money could be relocated ?
Finally , concerning paragraph 54 of the Na√Ør report , could the Commissioner also confirm that the two Mediterranean candidate countries might be able to participate in the Euromed Heritage programme .
Mr President , it is very appropriate that we are debating these two very good reports only a few days before the Euro-Med Forum , which is due to sit next week .
Various speakers have mentioned the importance of that forum , which must be raised over the coming years if we are to get the Barcelona Process back on track and expanding .
I would like to speak mainly on the funding for the Euro-Med programme , for MEDA , and say I am disappointed at the very low take-up .
The report mentions that is due to poor administration and procedures within the Commission .
A former colleague of mine , Mr Patten , is doing his best to make sure that we do get spending in the right sort of areas - efficiently , effectively , and to meet the needs of the various countries .
I am first Vice-Chairman of the delegation for Malta .
They are not allowed to bid for as much work as they want .
We need more transparency in the spending that is agreed upon .
We need to know where the money is going and - very importantly indeed - we need a better audit trail of where the money has gone because a lot of talk in the media is about misuse and money going down the wrong avenues for the wrong reasons .
That is an abuse of the position that we hold here .
I expect to see a better relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the interest of all the countries in the southern Mediterranean area .
There is a great deal of work to be done , it can be done and , indeed , it must be done .
Mr President , I would like to counsel , if I may , Mr Solana and my very good friend Commissioner Patten to exercise caution in relation to the Middle East at this present time .
I say that , not because I am scarcely an enthusiast for a European foreign policy , but because I believe that at this present time in Israel we are in a very difficult situation .
We have an election and I must remind the House that the State of Israel is the only democracy that exists in the region and that is something that is worth noting .
We have an election for a prime minister which will be crucial in relation to the future of the peace process so we must take care not to be seen as interventionist or interfering .
I remind the House , because I gather there is much fear that Mr Sharon may be elected prime minister , that the peace process in the Middle East , from the Israeli point of view , has always advanced under the Israeli right and it was Menachem Begin who started the rapprochement with Egypt .
I ask the House and I ask the Commission and the Council to proceed with caution .
I ask the European Union to do what it does best .
It has an influence over the Palestinians and it should exercise that influence .
It should be asking Chairman Arafat , for example , why the Palestinians permit in their textbooks the sort of anti-semitism which I hoped we had long put to one side in this world .
We should be asking Chairman Arafat to ensure that the aid that goes to the Palestinians goes to those who really need it .
So , in small measures and not in large - because the United States must take the lead in these matters - the European Union can play a role , but it should not exaggerate its importance .
The role is with the parties themselves , assisted by the great republic across the Atlantic .
Mr President , Members who have been elected to this House have been elected by people of Europe to speak for Europe , to determine what role Europe can play on the international scene .
I am encouraged by the statement of Mr Danielsson , the confidence of Mr Solana and the excellent analysis of Commissioner Patten of the situation on the ground .
I was horrified to witness in the delegation last week the extent to which Palestine is a military occupation .
People of Europe have no idea of this .
It is unbelievable that there is a situation where the Palestinian Legislative Council cannot even meet .
Mayors of towns like Hebron were not able to escort us to places that our ambassador had arranged for us to see .
There is wrong
