Mr President , there is an ever - continuing growth in energy consumption worldwide .
It is vital that we get large countries at the Kyoto Conference , like the USA , Japan , Australia and Canada , to commit to targets after the year 2000 .
For example , increased traffic exhaust is the direct cause of the rise in greenhouse gases in our atmosphere .
We must also include the existence of nuclear power as a way of expanding our selection of energy alternatives and especially of reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
Their role in the whole energy-producing scenario is only marginal .
We must ensure that felled trees are replaced , in one way or another , with new trees .
The aim must be for a more even spread of the composite effects of broadlybased harmonization .
All the EU countries must get involved .
Mrs Heinisch underlines very clearly , in my opinion , the crucial importance of selfevaluation by higher education itself , along with the so-called expert from without .
Researcher exchange programmes also have correspondingly positive effects , especially in the making of human relationships and the creation of trust .
I would have hoped that the Commission might have made bolder suggestions for concrete measures to improve evaluation .
These would involve essential factors affecting evaluation : fast and widespread information exchange , common experiences and a better understanding of cultural differences .
This principle must be borne in mind when discussing European harmonization in quality assurance in higher education .
Itemized standards and rulings from the Community will not work if the variety and independence of colleges of higher education as well as the essential authority of each of the Member States are to be respected .
For that we need still more information on the structure and content of education in other countries .
It is on the basis of these principles that the creation of a European quality assurance network can be given support .
And the main task of the network will be the exchange of knowledge and experience , as well as technical assistance to Member States in creating methodologies for evaluation .
To achieve that , we will need very extensive dialogue on the subject of future needs and improved training to meet those needs .
What we have before us is the result of labour market negotiations .
The greatest problem with the blanket agreement is its limited scope .
The Commission must immediately start drafting a motion for the equal treatment of those in untypical employment relationships , who remain left out of this motion for a directive .
Furthermore , I am afraid that there is a danger that the same kind of watered-down decision will come out of the Luxembourg Employment Summit as from this part-time work contract .
Hopefully my fears are groundless , but yesterday 's meeting of the Council of Ministers was not very promising .
But that would help to create those very jobs which are badly needed in the service sectors .
In its essential internal policy , however , the EU had not acted in the spirit of article 130b .
One example of this is the bio-energy resources of the Nordic regions and their effective exploitation .
The EU seems more concerned these days with the blending of economic policies and monetary systems than the preservation of the essentials of life in remote areas .
The EU should , in the name of cohesion , ensure that the complimentary principle takes root in Member States .
The present system of agricultural aid does not account sufficiently for production difficulties due to factors of climate and other conditions in nature in both the northern and southern peripheral regions .
A workable and efficient cohesion policy requires the EU to aid the development of the regions , given their particular conditions , and to operate more flexibly than it does now .
Furthermore , Mr Izquierdo Collado 's report is an excellent analysis in connection with this .
But as important as it is to analyze , we have to know what is going to follow on from this analysis .
How can the less developed regions gain access to the more developed regions , to tap their resources ?
We must also bear this in mind when we consider what is going to happen in the future to our cohesion fund .
Neither can we underestimate the effects of national economic policies , national structural policies , and EMU.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .
I would ask support for the motion for the amendment which was approved in the report .
The committee voted against the amendment but , through my initiative , we got it in the part-session as revision 18 of the whole Socialist Group .
So-called globalization has , however , meant a change in direction .
Why are decisions on these issues not forthcoming ?
That is why we need a new study , or else we will choke to death .
A ship that gets wider , but not deeper , can hardly keep up straight .
The change of emphasis in the Council 's votes , as planned in the Amsterdam Treaty must be made very cautiously and always respecting the say of smaller Member States .
I have recommended to the part-session of Parliament that all representatives receive the same pay and that only bona fide travel expenses be paid .
The reason was that I do not believe that the intergovernmental conference is any longer the right way to further the development of the European union .
Europol is a good example of how the protection by law of citizens is in danger when governments are disinclined to give either the European Parliament or national assemblies sufficient powers of democratic supervision .
The other example of
