These are issues that should be dealt with at national level .
There is a danger of matters becoming rather ridiculous when the EU goes in for such things .
It is that type of legislation that has a real impact on consumers ’ needs .
I think that the proposal produced by the Commission , namely not to increase EU legislation , is a well-balanced one .     Mr President , Commissioner Verheugen , Mr Toubon , I wish to welcome the Commission ’s proposal for deregulating packaging .
I hope that continued debate will bring our own approach closer to that of the Commission , so that it is the consumer and not the politicians who choose .
It would be bad for competition and for consumers if we were to make matters worse for small and medium-sized enterprises and to use political measures to give market shares to the big conglomerates .
A lot remains to be done before this matter has been satisfactorily concluded .     Mr President , for many countries , Mr Toubon’s changes to the Commission ’s proposal mean new rules being laid down at EU level for an already functioning market .
For example , the Swedish Consumers ’ Association , which works actively with quite a few cooperation groups and associations on precisely these issues to do with packaging , has , on the basis of our contacts with the Association , never heard any wishes expressed concerning fixed pack sizes .
As has been pointed out , however , the regulations are , in this case , unnecessary , and we shall therefore vote against the report .     Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Markov for doing such a good job .
The fact is that the decision we have to take concerns a genuinely European issue .
We must also obtain better conditions for professional drivers , conditions that make driving safer and more secure for them .
At present , we have tachographs that can be , and are , manipulated .
I now think that we can feel satisfied .
The problem is that it is not applied widely enough , and I want to say to the Commission and the Council that the Council too must agree to the proposal we have put forward here in Parliament concerning a new Working Time Directive .
In this Chamber , we have agreed on a constructive regulation covering drivers , and now it is time to obtain a Working Time Directive that also meets Europeans ’ expectations .     If we are to have a functioning European market for goods , it is important for the consumer’s interests too to be safeguarded .
Consumers are at present able to decide for themselves what they wish to purchase by comparing prices .
We must legislate to improve basic conditions of competition and to increase consumer protection .
On the one hand , it may , from the point of view of the internal market , be good to have standards that ultimately benefit the consumer .
I have today voted against the report because it involves regulation of an area about which decisions should really be made not at EU level but by each Member State .     Once again , a report on the EU’s common foreign and security policy , or CFSP , has appeared on the agenda .
For the above-mentioned reasons , I have voted against the report in today’s vote .     We voted in favour of the report .
The Conservatives have set the pace at national level when it comes to many of the measures discussed in the report .
I have voted in favour of the report because it does not expressly recommend legislation at EU level .
It is not , however , the EU’s task to define which measures should be taken in the Member States or by other actors in society .
I also believe , however , that foreign policy is a national matter and that multilateral channels , such as the UN , are the only acceptable alternative for influencing countries not in the immediate vicinity of the EU.
In line with this , many Members have tabled amendments precisely on the subjects of stocking density and the scoring system for foot pad lesions .
I therefore hope that , tomorrow , a majority of this Parliament will vote in favour of these amendments which , as I say , obtained considerable support in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
Separated from their mothers at birth , accommodated in cramped conditions and placed under stress , they suffer throughout their short lives .
I would thank Mr Jørgensen and others for their constructive cooperation .
According to Eurobarometer , the individual animal protection issue that most Europeans want to grapple with is precisely that of improving the conditions of broiler chickens .
Without these improvements , the industry will lose all credibility and is in danger of being destroyed – by low consumer confidence rather than by competing imports .     .
I hope there will be , as there was in the committee , broad support for this new policy , which I hope will make an impact on the future guidelines on State aid policy that the Commission will be responsible for .
Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old , existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies .
A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive , together with old products and low wages , will contribute to Europe lagging behind .
The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be .
We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about .
It must
