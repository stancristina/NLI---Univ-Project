The most controversial aspect is undoubtedly the earmarking which some Member States are opposed to , as has been pointed out .
Women’s organisations also have the capacity to propose solutions which are very close to the ground and therefore very effective .
And naturally my group supports that approach .
This morning in the joint debate it was expressed by Mrs Rühle and Mrs Hieronymi , it has just been expressed by Mrs Prets and I believe that we should all be in agreement .
Six days later , it published the communication we are debating .
Let us start at the beginning , however .
Moving on to the issues under discussion today , I would like to draw the Council and the Italian Presidency’s attention to the responsibilities of this Intergovernmental Conference , which is being held after the Union has opened its doors to democracy .
There is room for fine-tuning , but what we must not do is go further , to the triple majority established at the Nice Summit , because this approach definitely does not work .
We welcome the progress made on structured cooperation on defence under the Common Foreign and Security Policy and we support the Italian Presidency’s proposal on extending the use of qualified majority voting .
There is a clear demarcation line that must not be crossed .
I think good progress is being made on certain subjects , such as the social clause .
I do not see why the Italian Presidency has refused to come up with any alternative proposal to the Convention text when they have done so in several other cases .
That is the political signal we need to give .
These events are clear proof that we need to strengthen economic governance in the Union .
We feel that a rules-based system is the only way to ensure that commitments are respected and to guarantee equal treatment for all Member States .
We must , however , bear in mind the fact that the Council declaration made at the end of the Ecofin Council shows that the Member States understand the need for a growth and stability agreement and also the importance of applying the standards in the same way across the board .
Instead , we will continue along the path taken by the Commission in the past .
Mr Tremonti , as a respected legal expert , you must acknowledge that the rules cannot be ignored in this way .
The Stability and Growth Pact was created before monetary union took place .
It is therefore very important to get the Stability and Growth Pact back on the rails and to enable the Commission to make constructive proposals .
Why is it so serious ?
I do not wish to blame the Italian Presidency , but , Mr Tremonti , the decision by Ecofin is a real botch job .
Secondly , I would take up the famous phrase that the European Union has been built on the basis of crisis and we should learn the lesson from this crisis , particularly in relation to an aspect which has already been mentioned by Commissioner Solbes , and which I fully support , which consists of having a genuine direction for economic policy , something that he has called European governance .
Thirdly – as I pointed out in my initial speech – the Commission carefully considered all these issues , what this means for the future economic governance of the Union , and we will prepare an initiative to improve it within the framework of the current Treaty .     .
Only very positive action by the European Union can put an end to the national legislative jungle which prevents the proper functioning of the European institutions and the European market , the internal market , which is one of our objectives .
I am also convinced , however , that the fact that a significant proportion of the important Community resources which are budgeted for are not used – the so-called RALs – is due to the fact that the regional and local autonomous governments , which execute the majority of projects , have not so far been able to participate in the early phase , either in the drawing up of policies , or in the adoption of strategies , or in the identification of legal obligations prior to drawing up of the respective European programmes .
The Regulation also provided for derogating measures and exceptions to the legislation defining the methods and conditions for interventions aimed at structuring within the fisheries sector .
And the modification we are now debating , as the Commissioner has said , also means extending by twelve months the deadline for eligibility of the expenditure , which will now be 31 December 2004 , and the last date for submission to the Commission of the request for payment of the balance , which will now be 30 June 2005 .
This has been the case recently with the Community halibut fleet in NAFO waters , where the Commission proposed a recovery plan for halibut which was accepted and which involves dropping from 42 000 tonnes this year , 2003 , to 16 000 tonnes in 2007 , a reduction of 62 % .
I would like to end – since I will not have time later – by congratulating Chairman Stevenson , rapporteur for the report on Mozambique , which we are going to deal with next , because it is a wonderful report which deserves our support .     .
In economic terms , the European Union is an enormous market of more than 370 million inhabitants , an expanding market with a deficit in fisheries products .
The Socialist Group therefore supports the amendments of the rapporteur , Mr Stevenson , and those of the Committee on Budgets .
Mr President , I am both proud and honoured
