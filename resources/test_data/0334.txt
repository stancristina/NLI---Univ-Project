Sometimes we find a solution , and sometimes we continue to disagree .
In the human rights area , we have different attitudes to the death penalty .
Through our long-term efforts in combating the death penalty , we have , however , succeeded in influencing American opinion .
The EU had a part to play in this matter through what is termed an 'amicus curiae brief ' of which the US Supreme Court took account in its reflections on the issue .
The American administration has assured us that an American intervention in the territory of an EU country would be - and I quote - 'inconceivable ' . That has been said by both Secretary of State Colin Powell and Assistant Secretary of State Marc Grossman .
I cannot imagine their grandchildren taking it into their heads to invade one of our Member States .
I can assure you that we shall monitor this matter very carefully .
We in the EU will spare no effort to ensure its success .
We probably have to face the fact that universal endorsement of the court is still somewhere in the future .
I have confidence , however , that our arguments will eventually win the day , as they have in the many other areas I mentioned earlier .
By using its veto in the UN Security Council last Monday , the United States took a very far-reaching and unfortunate step in its opposition to the court .
It is essential that a solution be found which does not undermine the EU 's common position and the statute of the court and which , at the same time , leaves the United States still committed to its peacekeeping operations .
Europe as a whole urges the Americans to reconsider this matter .
We view the matter very seriously .
The Council and its members are now continuing the work , for example during the UN General Assembly in New York .
We must not impute more far-reaching motives to the United States than it actually possesses .
We must also note that the United States has clearly repudiated all notions of an invasion of the Netherlands .
Nor has the United States expressed any desire to undermine the International Criminal Court .
As regards the pressing problem of the UN police force in Bosnia , we have , as is well known , agreed to take over the force on 1 January 2003 , and I should like to say to Mr Lagendijk that if , as a result of this conflict , we were to take over the police force earlier , the Council would also find the money to do so .
There are good reasons why the US delegation should consider how the Early Warning System discussed in this delegation can be improved .
I must otherwise refrain from giving Parliament good advice , however .
One might say that Mr Gallagher 's absence from the House and my own presence here are both due to our each having become ministers .
In response to the question , I would say that the controversial law on the media to which the honourable Member refers was adopted by the Turkish parliament on 15 May of this year .
The Council is of the view that , if it were to be implemented in practice , this law on the media would clearly be a retrograde step and would mean further tightening of the restrictions upon the freedom of radio and television broadcasting in Turkey .
The Council would draw attention to the fact that on 13 June , after the matter had been introduced by the Turkish President , Mr Sezer , the Turkish constitutional court suspended five articles of this law , including the article concerning the appointment of members and that concerning economic sanctions in the event of infringements .
The Council would remind the House that the European Commission reacted immediately to this law partly on the grounds that it was not consistent with the politically based Copenhagen criteria and partly on the grounds that it conflicted with the accession partnership , a necessary prerequisite of which is that all legal stipulations prohibiting Turkish citizens from using their mother tongues in TV and radio broadcasts are to be cancelled without delay .
The Council will monitor the situation carefully , since we are concerned here with absolutely crucial principles .
I am pleased that we are agreed on this .
Can we not all agree to keep an eye on the matter and to continue to exert pressure ?
Mr President , I can provide the following information about the Council position .
At the last ministerial meeting on 14 May in Reykjavik , the EU and NATO repeated their promise to develop close and transparent links between the two organisations and stated that progress had been made on a number of points concerning the arrangement in relation to NATO support for EU-led operations .
As is well known , further progress could not be made because one NATO member had expressed misgivings .
In Barcelona , the European Council emphasised how important it is for a permanent arrangement to be reached as soon as possible between the EU and NATO .
The Presidency and the High Representative are doing their utmost to find an acceptable solution for all EU and NATO members , a solution which is , in all respects , in accordance with the decisions made by the Nice European Council and which can facilitate rapid progress towards the goal confirmed in Reykjavik by all the ministers from the EU and NATO countries .
In Seville , the next Presidency - which is to say the Danish Presidency - was , moreover , given the task of furthering this cooperation in conjunction with the Secretary-General , that is to say the High Representative .
Mr President , I have to
