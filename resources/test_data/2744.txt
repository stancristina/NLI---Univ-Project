it is important for us to develop the boat categories .
The present directive contains many technical details that apply to boat safety , and I do not believe that even we , well-informed MEPs who are present here , can cope with it properly .
Just as the Commissioner said , this is in line with the principle of improved regulation .
This does not need to be done with a directive , however .
The same logic should apply to boats as well .
Sweden and Finland have considerably more lakes than all other EU Member States combined .
It is good that environmental requirements are set high even for leisure boat engines , as occurs in this directive .
In addition , we do not currently have the ability to obtain a higher environmental standard for leisure boats on lakes .
Moreover , the transition periods would have to be adjusted to the time required for the development of new engine technology .
If this is not the case , environmental policy will come adrift in troubled waters and among hidden rocks , and then it will be the environment that is damaged .
We note that , yesterday , the Ombudsman once again pointed out the misuse of data protection , that is to say of the personal data laws , to prevent the transparency we desire .
We are talking with forked tongues today in Parliament too .
It is also interesting to see that , in the ongoing consultation procedure on data protection , at least four Member States have proposed significant changes .
Like many Member States , we noted that the discussion on good governance had opened up possibilities .
The amendments we tabled were very modest and not at all extensive .
It seems to me that the Commission is at a complete loss here .
It is very unclear how the Commission is to utilise resources .
It nonetheless seems as if many people prefer not to take account of these proposals but , rather , to stick to national legislation and not accept the signals coming from our citizens .
We should also study the Ombudsman 's draft Convention as it relates , for example , to recourse to the EC Court of Justice , for there are some problematic issues where the conflict has not been solved between the Commission , on the one hand , and the Ombudsman and Parliament , on the other .
Finland is a bilingual country in which the linguistic minority enjoys a high level of protection , as I should like to demonstrate .
You must all appreciate that those words really also apply to everyone else who has been involved in the same process including , of course , all the MEPs who have taken an interest in the Ombudsman 's work and provided encouragement through their advice and criticism .
Finally , I only hope that my successor - and , as you know , there are a lot of very good candidates - will be given the same stimulating and business-like reception as I have been given .
We Swedish Christian Democrats have today voted in favour of the report entailing stricter European exhaust and noise emission limits for recreational craft .
One possible consequence of drawing this distinction is that old engines that cause more pollution will not be replaced by new engines , because these do not meet the more stringent requirements .
In countries where drinking water comes from lakes , emissions cause especially major problems .
Finally , we believe it would be wrong to introduce further , more stringent exhaust emission requirements only three years after the directive has come into force .
On the other hand , we are not prepared at this stage to state in which institution this merged office is to be set up .
Paragraph 23 : We do not agree that Article 28 of the Treaty should be changed so that the costs of military operations within the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy can be funded from the Community budget .
On the basis of several of these views , I have felt compelled to vote against the report .
The majority of Parliament also expresses the view , in Recital I , that the foreign and security policy should be a common policy .
The report contains a number of proposals I cannot support , including the proposal in paragraph 11 to merge the office of Council High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy with that of the Commissioner responsible for these issues and to set up this new office in the Commission .
From time to time , we can even support an armed national struggle for liberation against a dictator , as many of us did against the European colonial powers in Africa .
The weapons inspectors must therefore be sent back into Iraq as soon as possible , and the American threats of a military strike without a UN Security Council resolution must be condemned .
Otherwise , we are just legitimising lawless Wild-West violence in other parts of the world , for example Israel 's massacre of Palestinians or perhaps Russian interventions in Georgia .
Mr President , I wish to address myself in particular to the Danish Presidency , the Minister for European Affairs , Mr Haarder , and the External Relations Commissioner , Mr Patten .
How are we to prevent this ?
At the same time , we find ourselves in a situation in which a Communist government in Beijing in China , whose record on human rights does it little credit , actually has an unlimited right of veto when it comes to the international community 's most important bodies , the UN and the UN Security Council , and the ways in which they are to act to prevent violence and preserve world peace .
