Madam President , the committee proposes to place a Charter of Fundamental Rights at the centre of the Union system , with mandatory effect upon the European Union , its institutions and the agencies .
We do this because there is a great concentration of power at the centre of the Union and it is clearly necessary for the citizen to be protected from abuse of that power .
We believe that the Charter will have three principal effects : first , it will reinforce the constitutional character of the Treaty ; secondly , it will be a point of reference for those , including this Parliament , that wish to drive European integration forward with a greater degree of democratic legitimacy ; thirdly , a Charter that is stylish and forceful will strengthen the profile of the Union for its present and future citizens .
This resolution mandates the European parliamentary delegation inside the Convention .
The Convention has already started the process of drafting the Charter upon the principal lines that we propose and upon the presumption that the final result will be binding .
A strong vote for this resolution will assist the Convention to complete its task and set criteria for this Parliament ' s final appraisal of the results .
We should avoid becoming obsessed with the question of subsidiarity .
The drafting of the Charter will certainly be informed by the application of that principle , but it is crucial that the Charter reflects modern European society with all its pluralism and with all its diversity .
The effect of the Charter will be steady and gradual rather than sudden and revolutionary .
There is also a controversy over the relationship between the new European Union Charter and the existing European Convention of Human Rights .
We are proposing that the Union should itself sign up to the ECHR so that those rights inscribed in the existing Convention would form the solid core of the Charter .
Madame President , our purposes are to write a charter that is so good that Member States will find it shameful to refuse to accept it within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice .
The Charter represents a chance to build a modern post-national society , and marks a bold step forward from the sorrow and the pity of twentieth-century Europe .
I strongly commend the resolution .
Mr President , why do we need such a Charter ?
It clearly is not , as Mr Berthu has said , in order to create a European super-state but more , as Mrs Ber√®s has said , to make it clear to today 's citizens and tomorrow 's citizens that what we are in now is a Community of values : values based on democracy , freedom , equality , solidarity and respect for diversity , values - and I stress this to Mrs Garaud - that unite Europeans across frontiers , from the north , the south , the east and the west of the Community .
The big question is not whether we need such a Charter but what status it should have .
Some have argued that the Charter should simply gather together in a readable form all the rights that currently exist within the European Union .
This would be a valuable exercise : there is clearly a problem of awareness of people 's rights .
Many citizens do not know the rights that exist today .
A document clearly laying out such rights , and making it clear where and how these rights could be exercised , would be valuable .
But if that was all we were doing in the Convention then we should have left it to a team of academics , who frankly could have done it better than a group of 60 politicians .
I believe we have a team of 60 politicians working on the Convention because it is our duty to identify gaps in existing rights , to identify weaknesses in existing structures and to show the political will to correct those weaknesses .
So the Charter must fill in any gaps in existing rights , and it must be binding on the institutions of the European Union .
However , it is clear that not all rights will be equal , at least in the way they are implemented .
The rights need to be in two categories .
There needs to be a list of rights which will be directly upheld by the courts , but there also needs to be another list of general rights which the Community institutions and others will have to take into account when drafting policies ; some in the Court , some simply as background forming a valuable basis when we are taking other decisions .
What is clear , and what unites most people in this Chamber who want such a Charter , is that it must be in the Treaties .
If it is to impact on the citizen it must appear in the Treaties of the European Union .
Mr President , firstly I would like to welcome the Commission 's approach in general to the IGC.
The fact that we are getting this rolling presentation of more detailed explanations of issues is very helpful .
Secondly , I agree with the Commission that this is indeed an extremely delicate issue .
Taxation and social security get to what Mrs Thatcher used to call the nooks and crannies of everyday life .
It is something that affects Member States and their people in a very sensitive way and we have to be careful before the Community moves into these fields .
From what I hear , the Commission has got it more or less right and I would like to put a couple of questions for the sake of clarity .
It is right
