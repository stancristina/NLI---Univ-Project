I would beg the Commission and the Council never again to discuss terrorism and immigration at the same time .
Minister , seven years have passed since Tampere .
I would draw your attention to something else , and that is that the money needed cannot be taken from development cooperation , because that would mean robbing Peter to pay Paul .
It is an entry point to Europe ; it would appear that some of our fellow Members from other countries have not yet understood that .
We must not employ an ostrich-like policy and delegate or transfer responsibility for these flows to countries that are well known for their lack of respect for human rights , such as Morocco or Libya , for example .     Mr President , the Spanish Government 's mistaken policy is flooding the Union with people without documents .
We shall have to implement policies such as the following : greater cooperation amongst the Member States , equal rights and obligations for all immigrants , partnership and cooperation agreements with conditions , bilateral agreements between the Union and countries of origin , including obligatory repatriation clauses .
Hence my protest .
When it comes to borders , however , it appears that each Member State has their own , and they do not feel the need to share responsibility for other borders .
Extraordinary regularisation has been a necessary one-off measure for dealing with the dreadful migratory situation that we inherited from the Aznar government .
In its resolution , my group introduced its grave concern about the violation of the rights of children and the generalised rape of women as a weapon of war .
It is true that the UN is insisting that a United Nations mission be sent to the area , but it is also true , as has been said , that the Sudanese Government’s opposition makes that more difficult .
We have seen very few examples of concrete policies in the sector for promoting equality between men and women .
Precisely when we need to tackle this situation , however , the lack of commitment and support contained in the Commission ’s Communication is regrettable , since it only provides for measures offering a long-term solution and , even then , they are the most painful solutions for the sector , such as restructuring of the fleet .
We would also say to the Commission that we believe it to be necessary to improve and extend some of the measures contained in that Communication , such as those relating to improving marketing and those relating to research into the development of more efficient energy use .
Then they shouted at me : ‘Mettez-vous sur le côté ! [move to the side ]’ , they told me , and I do not know whether you are aware , but the ‘ ’ behind us here is made up of boards with holes in which women’s high heels can get caught , and it is therefore very easy to fall over .
Nevertheless , given that these species are often caught as by-catch , on 26 June 2003 , the European Union adopted a Regulation on the removal of fins of sharks .
That fleet is currently obliged to throw away a proportion of the fins in order to comply with the rules , since more than 80 % of the catches are of a species that I have already mentioned , Prionacea glauca , whose ratio , as we have said , is 6.5 % .
It is difficult to monitor what happens at sea , and there is sufficient evidence to suggest that many Member States are not controlling compliance with Community legislation .
Commissioner , Mr President , I wish to ask that we update and correct the legislation once and for all , because otherwise we are creating a serious lack of confidence in the sector as a result of having rules with which , as I say , it is impossible to comply .
Nevertheless , I would like to draw attention to the fact that we cannot and must not allow it to reduce the guarantees to the consumer of the imported organic product – as the Commissioner herself has said quite rightly – or to create unfair competition for European operators .
Otherwise , we will never have the consumer confidence needed , we will not be able to take advantage of the great potential benefits of this technology , and investments will have been squandered .
That same committee stresses that we do not even have methods for evaluating the risks .
Our policy cannot be to market these products first and then ask questions later .
I would also like to stress the importance of international cooperation .
I will say that it is of particular relevance on a day such as today , when it appears that just a few hours ago we reached a good conclusion in the negotiation on the new legal instrument for the funding of our development cooperation .
After the software patent fight , apparently there are people who are worried about the amendments that the European Parliament would propose .
The number of patent applications filed at the European Patent Office per year has , over the last seven years , increased by about 60 % .
Firstly , I would say that , at the moment , jurisdictional procedures which extend beyond the structure of the European Union do not inspire confidence − we have great confidence in the wonderful institutions of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance − and , secondly , that the issue of languages is not a trivial matter .
It is not inconceivable that such an act may have implications for the global arms race generally .
With regard to the condemnation expressed by all countries in the area and with responsibility being the watchword , I should highlight yesterday
