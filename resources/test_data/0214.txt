way .
Not everything in this constitution is perfect , but I think the decisive thing is that it is better than what we have at present .
That is the truth of the matter , and so I would ask Mr Allister and Mr de Villiers to take an open-minded look at the way things are and not tell their voters and the public things that are not true .
In two years ’ time , the Constitution will be in place .
Economically speaking , Europe is – still – a global player .
Some of Europe’s dreams have already come true .
We must now do everything possible to ensure that this draft becomes reality rather than existing only in black and white .
Rather , what I am talking about is our making use of the means of information afforded by space policy for what we have to do in Europe and also around the globe .
We , in the Legal Affairs Committee , will , though , be dealing with the issues of special interest to us in an own-initiative report , particularly the reform of legal instruments and of the lawmaking process , the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality , and the innovations in the justice system .
It is for that reason that we will be voting in favour of it , and of the report as well .
Is that how we want to win the Constitution ?
Defining the Union as a community of values , the Constitution enshrines a canon of values ranging from the respect for human dignity , which is the highest good , to justice and solidarity .
The Constitution’s weaknesses , too , need to be discussed without accusations of anti-Europeanism being thrown around : for example , the fact that smaller Member States will have fewer ways to defend their interests ; the fact that the European Parliament will continue to be a toothless tiger , particularly in matters affecting foreign and security policy ; and also the fact that Europe’s workers are still exposed to the risk of wage and social dumping .
We have written our shared values into this Constitutional Treaty , thereby making this old continent into something of a new world , for the wonderful thing about this Constitutional Treaty is that we are defining in precise terms what holds us together .
It is generally acknowledged , however , that the European elections were a low point , both in terms of their date and their outcome .
I believe we should make it very clear to them that this European Constitution is in fact a way of addressing these shortcomings .
The draft Constitution lays the foundations for common economic activities , and we will gain a common basis of values shared by all of us , something I see as particularly important .
The European Parliament’s role will be strengthened ; it will elect the President of the Commission .
Firstly , we welcome the fact that the Commission has taken the initiative on this matter , and I hope that , this time , the Council not again stand in its way .
What we can do , however , and as I mentioned before , is to provide particular support for civil society , and also to focus efforts on working with the academic community .
Rather than setting ecology and the protection of the environment against the economy , we need a sensible balance between them .
We Europeans must unite in taking up a position founded upon partnership with our American friends , and so , as you , Mr President of the Council , have said , we in the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , bring determination and passion to supporting you , and wish you great success in your presidency .     Mr President-in-Office , there are many in this House who have , for some time , been keen to see you sitting opposite where you are now , and I am one of them .
The Luxembourg Presidency of the Council proposes that , by 2010 , every Member State should have set in motion tangible and demonstrable reforms in every one of the areas in which the Lisbon strategy requires action .
Similarly , in Palestine , we need to remain involved and to continue giving political moral and financial support , as we have done for years , whilst always taking a critical line when it could not be clearly shown where the money was flowing .
A few months ago , in this House , we commemorated the victims of the terrorist attack in Beslan .
Competition between the Member States is necessary , but this process is likely , to say the least , to shut it down .     Mr President , I wish to make a statement on the way I voted .
The donations made by people in the European Union and throughout the world are a truly overpowering demonstration of goodwill .
The disaster in Asia may well have been natural , but it was also an ecological one .
Tourism must be revived there ; these ASEAN and SAARC countries , some of which I know well , are waiting for us , their friends , to return to them .
Thirdly , I would like to ask the Commission whether , in the interests of long-term support for its aid measures to the worst-hit countries , it is contemplating making use of the Regulation on a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from July 2005 to the end of 2008 , and , if that is the case , by how much does it envisage the preferences for the benefit of the affected countries being extended ?     .
