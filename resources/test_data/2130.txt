I know that in the short term it may be difficult to prove that but I am quite sure that in the long term this is a vital part of making our economies competitive in the wider world .
I also believe that it is very important for us to distinguish between the processes of market efficiency that liberalization implies and other policy objectives that we may wish to achieve , such as the question of universal supply , such as the aims to reduce CO2 and it is very important to keep those two distinct and separate .
I have to say that I share the regret of some colleagues that some countries have been rather backward in implementing these measures and it is ironic that at least one of those countries is that which seeks to accelerate the pace of integration in Europe .
St Augustine 'make me more liberalised but not quite yet ' .
I would like to recognise that the fears of the pessimists that liberalization would lead to cuts in security of supply have been confounded .
Private sector provision has delivered the goods .
I would also like to join in congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent job well done and make two points which have been mentioned by others before .
Firstly , the value of strong regulatory authorities .
It is quite clear from the experience in the fifteen still separate markets that strong regulatory bodies help market access for smaller players , protect the interests of consumers and force the pace of large monopoly-providers which might otherwise feel free to take a more leisurely pace .
Secondly , the value of a timetable .
It was a pity that the Lisbon conclusions did not call for a timetable .
Experience in other areas such as telecom shows that Member States respond better to this incentive and I hope that the Commission will elaborate a specific timetable for liberalization in the months to come .
Mr President , for the railways the status quo is really not an option .
They either have to change or die .
Railways in Europe are in terminal decline , not least in the rail freight sector .
New freight goes by road in Europe , not by rail .
That must change , and I believe it will .
That is why I broadly support the Council position which represents a small but important step towards railway liberalisation .
The alternative to this modest step is no step at all .
That is why tonight , regretfully I cannot agree with the tactics suggested by Mr Jarzembowski because it is a recipe for going nowhere at all , very quickly .
We have to take into account national differences and indeed , social and employment concerns .
Broadly , the Council position has struck the right balance on the charging , licensing , access and separation issues .
They have struck a right balance between both extremes and I would advocate - to use Mr Swoboda 's term - that " third way " should be applied to the railways in Europe .
Labour MEPs have two particular concerns which I know are shared by many other Members : one is the issue of derogations .
We believe that Greece , Ireland and Northern Ireland should have a limited derogation of five years because of their unique geographical and geopolitical circumstances .
Secondly , we hope that the deletion of Article 12 , led by the Liberals in committee , which could deprive citizens and consumers of network benefits and deprive disabled people of access , can be reinserted into the text .
Those basic safeguards must be restored .
The prize for us tonight is that for the first time in history we can achieve liberalisation of the international freight network .
That is an achievable goal .
Let us not throw it away .
Mr President , the proportion of freight transported by rail within the EU has almost halved over the last thirty years .
It is vital , if we are to have a truly sustainable transport policy that this process is reversed .
I congratulate Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski on their excellent reports which , if adopted , will make a major contribution to railway development .
I share some of Mr Watts ' concern , however , about Amendment No 1 in relation to the licensing of railway undertakings and the proposed deletion of the replacement Article 12 .
In any liberalisation process it is very important to ensure that certain standards are maintained , for example those relating to the safety of both workers and consumers .
At the same time we need to prevent artificial barriers being put in the way of the opening up of markets .
Fulfilling both of these objectives requires a delicate balance to be struck .
I doubt both whether Amendment No 1 serves its intended legal purpose and whether it could have the effects that Mr Watts fears .
I believe it could send out the wrong signals .
Instead I seek support for Amendments Nos 23 and 24 which , taken together , should have the effect of securing the second of the two objectives without detracting from the first .
Mr President , I wish to raise once again the point I raised on Monday and again yesterday with regard to Mr Helmer 's comments in this House .
Can I say that I am surprised that on two occasions now I have asked Mr Helmer to comment on the item about the Queen of the United Kingdom supporting the euro , and so far he has failed to do .
Can I say to this House that I understand this must be the first time that Mr Helmer has been speechless .

Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Duisenberg on
