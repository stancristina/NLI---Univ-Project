medium-sized harbours and ports , which are able to accept ships which account for more than 60 % of Community traffic .
Our generation , which invented the information superhighways , now has before it the greatest of challenges , either to turn it from a Pandora 's box into an Ali Baba 's cavern or to transform the danger of the pulverisation of information and the uncontrolled circulation of products into a marvellous area of knowledge and memory .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , since 1987 the European Union has had Fishing Agreements with Angola .
I should like to emphasise the fact that this Agreement is also innovative in other areas , in particular in that it very much respects the principle of conservation of fish resources , allowing for the possibility of declaring biological rest periods on the basis of scientific data calling for them .
I should just like to point out that this Agreement was signed by the Commission with Angola on 2 May 1996 and that the European Parliament was only consulted for its opinion on 12 September 1996 .
Against such a tide , I should say that this is a good Agreement - I am talking about the Agreement with Angola , for both the European Union and for Angola itself .
Quite frankly , we are being messed around !
Very often they protected fraud as a way of carving up trade and a very efficient way of competing with their opponent countries .
I trust in the honesty of Commissioner Monti , I trust in the honesty of Commissioner Gradin , because this is a question of public morals and honesty .
Just over a year ago we had a debate on an identical case of a decision to cut staff in readiness to close down a factory and move a production line away from Setubal .
Fortunately Renault workers in different countries have understood that their fight to face up to 'globalised ' capital has to be united on an international scale and that the solution is not by withdrawing behind national frontiers .
I should like you to know that I , too , am concerned with the effectiveness of the European Union .
But I would like to honour those who before us thought of Europe , who acted in order to transform it and who entrusted us with the task of continuing it , and this means fair recognition of the fact that taking things slowly has always been the reason for its success .
After a few months of tuning up , it seems that it has not even got a partition .
But this has to be translated into more bridges and open doors , not more trenches and closed doors .
Another point on which the people would not forgive hesitations is that of internal security and the fight against organised crime .
Strengthened co-operation is being presented as a means of making progress towards European construction by overcoming the resistance of certain countries .
Mr President , in backing this motion for a resolution we wish , above all , to oppose , for the sake of democracy and solidarity in the European Union , the plans for breaking up the Union by these most unwise proposals .
Therefore , essentially , our disagreement with the proposals initially formulated by Mr Tillich , which had an undeniable merit : the clarity with which they were presented .
We feel that the votes which took place on Monday in the Committee on Budgets would help significantly to change , in a positive way , the initial proposal .
On the other hand , the wording of point 13 is , to say the very least , equivocal and there could be perverse readings , which means that the expected revision of the regulations governing the Structural Fund might be withdrawn , something which of course we could not go along with .
There is a set of policies which ought to be developed and , consequently , we must very seriously bank on public health policies and also the development at the appropriate level of policies on sex education , which are compatible with any positive approach to this problem .
Regardless of the usefulness of paragraphs 17 to 27 , in particular paragraph 26 , for refocusing and limiting , aligning a set of conditions in whose framework we can devise a concept of strengthened co-operational flexibility , simply accepting these with no strings attached seems to me dangerous for the following reasons which I shall set out in brief : 1.-Per se , the notion of flexibility is contrary to the concept of integration and is difficult to make compatible with a single institutional framework , opening the doors to institutions by measure , which shall be decentralised , independent and outside Community States , as is proper in the case of public international law.That would lead to as many institutional regimes for decision-making as there are acts of co-operation between the Member States , which is contrary to the methodology of a single Community law , support for common institutions , from which rights and obligations stem for the Member States , for organised civil society and for the people themselves .
Subjects of reinforced co-operation would be subjects which are external to the European Parliament .
This is just point 1 of our motion for a resolution .
Not as an act of relieving my conscience but - also! - as a reaffirmation of a determination to fight .
We are condemning and quite clearly setting out our position .
But the estimates for the cost to rebuild and repair the damage exceed 13 , 000 million escudos .
We hope that we will see further signs of this willingness to support the needs of the peoples of the Azores
