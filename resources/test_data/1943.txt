We have suffered losses in the cashmere industry .
When these companies in my Member State , in my constituency , were confronted with 100 % import tariffs by the US , at one point it could have led to the closure of the cashmere industry in the Borders of Scotland , with a potential loss of 4000 jobs .
We have another small company , Arran Aromatics , which exports the majority of its products to America .
It has also been hit with retaliatory action by the US.
It employs 50 people on a remote West Coast Scottish island and yet they are suffering from retaliation from the banana war , about which they know little and with which they have no connection whatsoever .
This is deeply unfair .
A lot has been made in this debate of the apparent unanimity of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in supporting Mr Dary 's report .
I should say to you that there were many amendments put forward to Mr Dary 's report in the Agriculture Committee which showed that there were deep divisions in that committee .
We must not take that as evidence of unanimity in any way .
If the colleagues from the southern Member States are going to continue to vote against WTO compliance then they must take the consequences and not the innocent companies in my Member State .
Mr President , we have not debated the issue of this special committee .
As far as I am aware it has never been raised in Parliament .
We are putting it to a vote without any discussion .
I would be interested to know how it was established , where its foundations came from , what its costs are going to be , how it relates to the established committees - industry , public health and the others - and whether it is proper to vote on this without any public debate .
The decision made will cost jobs in Northern Ireland .
This is a wrong decision .
I have no objection to supporting stricter legislation for the European Union , but to apply this to exports is unacceptable and the legal base for this decision is dubious .
We have no right to dictate to others what they do in their countries outside the EU , nor is it wise to export jobs from the EU to third countries where they will simply produce and sell the products and take over our existing markets .
I wish particularly to explain why I voted against the ban on export of tobacco products above a certain tar/nicotine level from the EU and supported amendments that sought to lift that ban .
Above all , I am concerned by the very real risk to jobs of over 1 000 people employed at the BAT factory in Southampton .
There are over 5 000 jobs also at risk related to that factory .
For instance , hundreds of printers in Portsmouth who produce cigarette packaging .
Over 95 % of the output of the Southampton plant is exported .
I fear either the company will relocate , or the markets they serve will be met by other suppliers outside the EU.
So this move will not lead to healthier cigarettes being smoked - but simply to export jobs from Europe .
This is a sad day for the workers in Southampton who must now hope the British government might try to block the move .
I fear they will hope in vain .
I believe smokers should be given full information but then be free to make their own choice .
Additionally , insisting on imposing our standards outside Europe is an example of post-colonial imperialism .
So I voted for freedom - jobs .
I wholeheartedly support the common position on the proposal on tobacco that will strengthen health warnings on cigarette packets in the EU.
We have fought a powerful tobacco lobby to lead the campaign for new cigarette health warnings to cover a third of the surface of cigarette packs .
Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that .
Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these , half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life .
As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco , and 85 % of lung cancers are caused by smoking .
Madam President , I would welcome the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health , like they do in Canada .
If shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking , go ahead and print them on packs .
It is preposterous that the tobacco lobby is seeking to destroy this legislation .
I am fed up of tobacco giants such as Marlboro , Benson & Hedges and Rothmans trying to put a stop to these proposals .
They have misled people for far too long .
At present , warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging .
This is our last-ditch attempt to put labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the true cost of smoking .
Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice .
The proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as 'ultra-light ' and 'low tar ' .
People have been hooked on the idea that 'mild ' and 'low tar ' cigarettes are healthier .
This is simply not true .
Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes - smokers just draw harder to get the same kick .
This legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives .

Mr President , the Labour delegation of the European Parliament voted against Mr Lehne 's amendments to the common position .
