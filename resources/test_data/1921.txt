Equality is not a women ' s issue and can only be achieved through cooperation between both sexes .
Effective traffic surveillance , including vehicle inspections , speed monitoring using modern camera techniques , breathalyser tests , seat belt checks and pupillometer measurement in cases where drug-use may be suspected , is what is needed in the short term to bring down the number of fatalities on the roads .
In order for the target of zero road fatalities to be realistic , more use must be made of public transport so as to reduce the number of vehicles on the road .
We consider this desire to increase road safety to be all well and good , but this is not an issue in which the EU should be investing resources .
This applies also to the field of transport .
Part of the funds obtained would go to the Governments of the Member States and then be earmarked for investments in infrastructure , and part would go to the Commission to use as it sees fit .
It is patently obvious that this will be a merciless blow which will fall hardest on the sparsely-populated counties .
Last week , I received a great deal of material from the Turkish delegation of the Parliament dealing precisely with the internal conditions in these prisons .
In this way , the efforts of the Turkish Government involving military troops and repressive measures also becomes part of a political battle directed against the Kurds and other minorities that populate the Turkish prisons .
The battle between different forces must be fought by peaceful means .
Languages and cultures must be accepted in the schools , especially in the Kurd-dominated areas .
Mr President , I want to thank the Commissioner for using the word solidarity in connection with this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Swedish Presidency sees the EU' s Mediterranean cooperation as an important and pressing issue .
In the economic and financial sphere , we want to work towards an economic and financial partnership which is both dynamic and has a human face .
The concept of prosperity includes both economic growth and social equilibrium .
The aim is to give a dynamic edge to the most important aspects of trade covered by the Barcelona Process and to agree upon the guidelines for continued work .
It is also important to encourage and support trade and cooperation between the partner countries themselves .
To some extent , the way matters stand in the peace process has restricted the potential for progress , but other factors too have had a part to play .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mediterranean cooperation has been exposed to critical and constructive examination in today ' s debate , as well as in the two reports that have been submitted .
The real potential of the Barcelona Process can only be realised if all participants feel that they really own the process and that they are responsible for its different parts .
Just like Mr Esteve , we too , as holders of the presidency , see no conflict between , on the one hand , enlargement and , on the other hand , Mediterranean cooperation .
The aim is for these agreements to be ready by 2010 .
It is also promising that the association negotiations with Algeria , Syria and Lebanon are proceeding at a good pace .
The Council hopes that the revised mediation arrangement adopted last autumn may provide the opportunity for a more efficient and more strategic method of working .
The Council therefore sees this as an aspect we should like to try to cultivate further .
Mrs Napoletano discussed the incredibly important cooperation taking place in the legal sphere .
The Swedish Presidency wishes to promote cooperation in this area .
Questions relating to migration , to which several MEPs have referred in today ' s debate , are an important part of this complex of issues .
Mrs Carlotti touched upon the same subject .
During the negotiations in Taba , the parties came closer than ever before to a negotiated solution .
Despite the difficulties , the parties have not wanted to forfeit the progress achieved in spite of everything .
I would draw the honourable Members ' and Parliament ' s attention to the fact that this statement particularly emphasises the European Union ' s role in the continued work for peace .
The very fact that Mr Moratinos has been able to participate and show the European Union ' s support for the negotiations and its readiness to assist the parties has been of great value to the Union .
I also want to emphasise the significance of the fact that the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , Mr Solana , is part of the international commission under the leadership of Senator Mitchell which is investigating the current violence in the Palestinian areas and which , hopefully , will eventually submit proposals to prevent a recurrence of this violence .
On the initiative of Commissioner Patten , the European Union has also used extra appropriations in order to make funds temporarily available to the Palestinian Authority .
We shall continue to monitor these issues .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like just briefly to comment following this very interesting debate on the important and difficult issue of the situation in the Middle East .
Why do I say this ?
Partly in response to Mr Morillon .
Nonetheless , there is a very strong common desire , noted by the presidency in its contacts with all the other Member States , to work together for a peaceful solution .
The European Union is , then , also engaged in the political process in the most intimate way possible , but we are still awaiting the practical results .
We believe that an
