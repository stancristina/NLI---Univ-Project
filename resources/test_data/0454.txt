Commission .
To conclude , there are individuals amongst the candidates who have against them the appearance of having been involved in some way in fraudulent practices .
What is more , he refuses to speak Dutch , the language spoken by the majority of people in his country , and has made this a kind of trademark of his .
Indeed it is because of these doubts that two critical passages have been included in the resolutions .
We believe this matter should be speedily resolved .
We have no doubts about Mr Prodi' s Presidency .
The weak link , and everyone now knows who it is , is the candidate put forward by the Belgian government .
This government could have done its own country a better service .
He will produce an annual programme and this will , of course , include the things to be done within the various Directorates-General .
Mr Prodi , on behalf of the Dutch Socialists I would like to express the hope that we will be in a position to draw a line under the crisis , with the appointment of your Commission in its entirety tomorrow .
Internal solidarity and solidarity towards others , as I said , that is what we would like to judge you and your programme on in January .
The same goes for the vast majority of the European People ' s Party .
The position of non-governmental organisations in the social sector still has not been determined .
The institutions have high expectations in terms of what the further development of the European Union will bring its citizens .
However , we do not consider it to be a good idea to draw up a European Charter , a new catalogue of civil rights .
The relevant proposal was put forward by the European Commission two years ago , and was adopted by the European Parliament last year .
May I ask you another question Madam President-in-Office of the Council ?
His attitudes were often provocative , which led to him being labelled a euro-sceptic .
After all , the representatives of the European Free Alliance want a Europe which is not just one made up of States .
Therefore , we can expect another amending budget soon .
Once again , the Council and Parliament will have to reach agreement on expenditure on external activities , and the reconstruction of Kosovo will feature here again , too .
But the 10 % linear reduction , the drip-feed method , shows that there has been no serious weighing up of priorities .
Hence the resolution put forward by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Fabra Vallés deserves all our support .
At the beginning of September , only 24 % of the payment appropriations for 1999 had been spent .
Mr President , to begin with , I would like to express my regard for the statement made by the President-in Office of the Council this morning .
Whereas up until recently Portugal was practically the only country to carry this torch , now all the countries of the European Union are rallying behind the East Timorese struggle for independence .
No political parties , no system for the administration of justice , not a single functioning institution apart from the Church .
Nevertheless , it was right to suspend the bilateral aid for Indonesia for the time being , as we have learnt from recent experiences that pressure must be kept up until the whole process reaches a satisfactory conclusion .
The next obvious step is to prosecute those responsible for the crimes recently committed in East Timor , indeed President Habibie ' s pledges support this .
Mr President , in view of the Dutch connection with Indonesia , I would like to start by saying that I am completely astonished by the way in which the world order has again shown such extraordinary naivety when it comes to the international rule of law and the conduct of the Security Council .
We must deliver humanitarian aid to them , but also other forms of aid too , for building up society for example .
The Indonesian army failed to take action to protect the population .
The second step that must now be taken is to send an international peacekeeping force , preferably from within the region , so that the people can be protected and the independence of East Timor can be implemented The third step is to set up a tribunal for the purpose of punishing those who have committed such cruel acts , so that law is upheld and justice is done .
If the murder does not stop in those other regions too , and if the Indonesian government does n' t offer protection , then , in our view , the United Nations should also take action in those other regions of Indonesia .
Mr President , after months of misery it looked as though it was going to be possible for a little ray of hope to shine on Kosovo .
Do you know that a Kosovar needs a visa to travel to Greece ?
That ought , at the same time , to give some substance to the motley collection of talking shops we have now .
In this way everyone can easily see if the interests of their own country are being given due attention .
We can use the Council ' s readiness to modify its proposals as regards the aforementioned board , to show the citizens what the Council ' s true motives are and to what extent it has a horror of wastefulness .
Mr President , we can see whether this project will be feasible from the Council ' s willingness to take up our request to amend their document , a process that will show that Kosovo really is at the centre of interest
