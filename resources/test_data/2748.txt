cover up the illegalities .
As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control , I know that these myths are not true .
It is our job to make citizens aware of the many positive aspects of European cooperation , but we must also take existing problems seriously .
Unfortunately , there are those in the Commission who have not carried out their work properly in this matter , and here I am not only thinking of those who have taken part in actual fraud , but also of those who have subsequently investigated the matter and whose responsibility it has been to inform Parliament .
Those who have not carried out their work properly bear a serious responsibility .
They are helping to fuel the scepticism and alienation about the EU that is extant in many Member States .
In particular , Mrs Wemheuer 's work in this matter has been exemplary .
I feel we are speaking the same language as regards administration and openness in the EU institutions .
Let us hope the same mistakes will not be repeated .
I would like to ask whether the Commission supports the principle of reversing the burden of proof which was passed by a large majority of Parliament in part-session and by the Committee on Institutional Affairs by 34 votes to 0.
In other words , we should reverse the burden of proof , so it takes a qualified majority to close a document .
Mr President , it is important to remember that , basically , the Auto-Oil programme is about improving the environment and human health .
Many studies have shown that air pollution affects people 's health .
These studies clearly show that clear limits must be set on motor vehicle emissions , and clear standards must be set for petrol quality .
Fixed standards are the only realistic way of achieving the air quality desired .
This does not mean , of course , that we should ignore the economic aspects .
Cost-effectiveness cannot be the only basis for assessing individual mechanisms .
So I agree that the directive 's proposals should include the solutions which are best for the citizens ' health as well as for the economy .
I believe it would encourage innovation if demands were made on industry .
Hopefully , the directive concerned will encourage the industry to develop vehicles running on renewable sources of energy .
I can therefore heartily support the Council 's joint approach to all the amendments the Committee on the Environment has made .
Mr President , common consumption rules in the EU are good in principle , as there is a considerable volume of goods in circulation .
Irradiating food must not become the solution to long distance haulage and poor storage .
Shops can continue to sell food past its sell-by date if irradiation is allowed .
I am satisfied with that .
The requirements are stringent , that must be admitted , but it is essential that things happen out in the open , with Parliament 's involvement and in accordance with important health and consumer principles .
They would be if we allowed irradiation , because food would appear to be different from how it actually is .
The need for irradiation as a way of preserving food is also hard to see .
Europe has mountains of food .
Consumers must be able to choose , even in the cases which pass the health test ; I support the studies of the health risks from irradiation .
On the contrary , some of them thrive on it .
This is an aspect the Council has overlooked , but which the European Parliament 's Committee on the Environment will be taking up .
It is pleasing to see the Council of Ministers taking note of the European Parliament 's amendments in its otherwise slightly doubtful political agreement .
Dumps are well down in the waste hierarchy , and there are specific rules dealing with restricting dumping , restricting waste tourism and ensuring environmentally sound dumping if that is the only option available .
As groundwater resources are the drinking water supplies in some countries , it is essential that they be protected as far as possible .
In Denmark , about 90 % of drinking water comes from groundwater .
It is pleasing to note that the proposals include demands for processing biodegradable waste .
It is also pleasing to note that the proposals are now on their way through the decision-making process , as waste is one of the areas where legislative protection is still incomplete .
Mr President , the people of Burma deserve a vote in favour of the statement being debated here today .
The people are being brutally suppressed , and the military dictatorship has not the slightest respect for human rights .
The dictatorship uses the income to tighten its grip on power .
Aung San Suu Kyi , who was awarded the European Parliament 's Sakharov prize , has called on the EU take this action .
Now business is making profits in the country where the anti-apartheid movement has gone furthest .
People must understand that investing in Burma amounts to direct support for the military regime .
It would be better for the Burmese if this regime were overthrown and economic sanctions have proved to be more effective in the past than critical dialogue with someone who does not understand the meaning of the words .
That would suit both the Commission but also , in particular , the Council because I think Mr Henderson 's answer on Burma was rather meaningless .
I would like to thank Doug Henderson for a very clear reply , which I can recognise as a repeat of the reply which Mr Henderson gave to a previous question in the British House of Commons .
