that we agree with Mr Friedrich that it is conceivable that , once the euro has come into being , Europe will have the second largest bond market in the world .
But here , too , I believe the European Commission will have to take action to make the Member States see that they can no longer hang on to outdated policy on this front .
Retailers are looking for cheaper systems .
Confidence in a currency means confidence in the value of the euro .
The observation centres which , according to the rapporteur , will have to monitor conversion to the euro , strike me as completely unnecessary .
A great deal still needs to happen on that front .
Then there is the issue of dual pricing .
It establishes the principle of continuity , but it does leave space for accession contracts which deviate from this principle , for accession contracts which affect continuity .
Quite wrongly , the report concentrates one-sidedly on the problems in this relationship .
Finally , Mr President , there is the arms trade .
They conveyed the flavour of the special relationship between the United States and Europe during the Cold War .
For years and years there have been strong ties between the European Union and the United States .
The building of bridges in the context of the New Transatlantic Agenda , as aimed at and already achieved by the Ties project , involves the public directly in transatlantic relations .
It is clear that the contrasts between the old and new world will come up with increasing frequency in the economic and trade areas , especially when the euro appears to be a success , and the adjustment of the Common Agricultural Policy and enlargement are successful .
As individual Members of the European Parliament , as members of Parliamentary committees , or as Parliament , we are obviously always in favour of a procedure which is subject to codecision , as this obviously means that the rights of Parliament are better safeguarded .
If you look at the package of the five products , they are not really amendments which have all been inspired by extreme concern for the consumer , protection of the consumer and information for the consumer .
They represent progress .
Let us hope that in addition to the amendments surrounding the legal basis , the Commission will also approve the other amendments .
What is missing in the puzzle is the piece that regulates paint thinners .
I note that with this amendment the European airquality puzzle is nearing its completion .
These include concentration disorders , insomnia , dizziness , and in the worst case even loss of memory , personality disorders and depression .
For the rest : excellent advice , which the Council can capitalize on .
In some countries OPS is recognized as an occupational illness , but in other Member States no attention is given to OPS.
On the 30th of March the negotiations with the eleven candidate countries will start and during the first weekend of May the decision on the euro will be taken .
Jean Monnet said of the British : we realize that you respect facts , not hypotheses .
And during the Summit in Cardiff , in mid June this year , the first steps towards the reform of Agenda 2000 will be made .
I was very moved when I recently read an interview with the former President of the European Commission , Jacques Delors , who said that European Integration was brought about on the basis of the economy .
Mr President , after years of bitter negativism the British government 's positive attitude comes as a refreshing improvement .
Regrettably the British government was not prepared to state clearly whether or when England will join the European currency .
Up until now the Union , in contrast to America , contributed directly to finding solutions .
I support the intention expressed by the presidency to make the Union play an active role in the Middle East and Algeria .
Pacta sunt servanda [pacts are there to be observed] .
That is why the guilty have to be tried .
I therefore trust the British government to agree with our wish that this important democratic reform is accomplished this year .
The first is the so-called third way in Europe : economic reform based on employability .
Britain joining the Social Chapter was a great relief to us members of the Socialist Group working in the social sector .
In the follow-up of Luxembourg , attention should first of all be paid to the design of balanced economic management in the Union , and the development of a coordinated European employment strategy , including taxation .
Second point , the Asian crisis .
What are you doing to lift the financial barrier against Turkey ?
Thankfully the Labour government has ended this , and the Social Chapter is able to operate for the Fifteen , and can be adopted in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
It would be a big mistake to underestimate how urgent the need is now for a more social Europe .
Social urgency which will play a part , when we are discussing the third phase of EMU, when we are discussing accession negotiations , when we are discussing taxes and especially when we are discussing employment , which should not merely be training , but also giving people jobs through transeuropean networks , community services , environmental investments , and so on .
Thirdly , women in small and medium enterprises , and female entrepreneurs must be given more attention during professional training and life-long learning .
I wonder whether the European Commission is able to manage this major problem in the right way .
In my opinion too much is still missing at the moment
