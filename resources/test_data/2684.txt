Research has shown that 53 % of consumers trust food claims .
While the regulation for fisheries is a matter for the EU , inland waterways fall within the remit of the Member States .
It is therefore unique that the new initiative to rescue eel should be supported by all those parties in the manner I will describe to you now .
If the European Commission adopts the adjustments proposed by Parliament , as the Commissioner indicated with regard to a large number of points , successful decision-making can be guaranteed with a wide support base – from Sweden to Spain – of fishermen , recreational fishermen and environmental organisations alike .
That also means that the Commission and Council should not let this unique opportunity slip .
As for trade policy and a number of other areas , I am convinced that we will now manage to achieve much better eel stocks in the European Union in five or ten years ’ time .
I would , at the same time , insist on Parliament gaining access to these assessments or impact assessments in good time , so that we are well-informed before we give our opinion .
As the Commissioner knows from internal reports , one of the main reasons for the Dutch ‘no’ was the loss of sovereignty .
It is a first exercise in more open , more pro-active European communication .
Public surveys – I refer in particular to Eurobarometer – have revealed that Europeans have high expectations of the European Union in many areas , which inevitably leads us to conclude that a negative vote on the EU is in any event partly attributable to the fact that the European Union does not perform the way it should .
Indeed , if we clearly state what we want to achieve and then fail to deliver , then this will only contribute to a negative opinion about the European Union , which brings me to my last point .
Despite this , my group remains of the opinion that the present programme is of huge importance in order to improve the environment and to curb the growth in road transport that has got completely out of hand .
The only fundamental observation I should like to make with regard to this programme is that there is no assessment of Marco Polo I. The lack of such an evaluation means that it is impossible to say whether Marco Polo II will have the desired effect , simply because the link between goal and resources used is unknown .
This too can give small enterprises a helping hand .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commission for its positive response to the own-initiative proposal of the Committee on Fisheries .
Both the solution with regard to food profiles and the notification procedure prove that we achieved this in an adult manner .
The word ‘solid ’ refers to facts and actual steps of reform rather than intentions .
I have to say to the Commission that , if it takes its own reports seriously , then I do not believe that those weighty problems that it has flagged in them can be resolved in five months ’ time .
If there is cause for any doubt , we would be better off not mentioning a deferral date and we should not give the candidate countries any guarantees to the effect that they will be able to join if they meet the conditions .
I was one of those who voted in favour of that idea .
The first country that will be at the receiving end of this is Croatia , a country that already meets those criteria better than Romania and Bulgaria , and has much in common with current Member State Slovenia , but may have to wait for a very long time nevertheless .
Secondly , we are against separating the two countries in the way referred to by other speakers a moment ago .
Particularly where Bulgaria is concerned , I noticed that there have been a few misunderstandings between the Commission and that country ’s Government about what the exact criteria are .
However , when the Berlin Wall fell it was brought under post-Communist rule .
I also agree with the Commission that further efforts are needed to combat all forms of intolerance , racism and xenophobia .
Maybe Mr Cohn-Bendit ought to consider to whom he actually wishes to give his support .
Finally , I should like to urge all Members in their own countries , to give the full account , rather than populist talk that is based on xenophobia .
Yet more change is needed in Romania , but particularly in Bulgaria , where some developments appear to have been more negative than anything else .
In the light of the need for persistent pressure , the Commission ’s approach is the best one .
The two countries should not , though , become the victim of the Union’s internal problems or of a lack of solidarity .
I am delighted that the Commission would like to further sustain our mobility as a priority .
Parliament was quick to give its political response in the shape of an inquiry committee under the leadership of Mrs Roth-Behrendt , which carried out excellent research into the state of affairs and the Commission ’s and Member States’ shortcomings .
The agreement reached with the Council at first reading , which is reflected in Amendments 41 to 56 , receives our group ’s unqualified support .
I will not hide my criticism of this lack of dynamism in the development of monetary policy , although I agree that it is not only the ECB that should be addressed but also the political decision-makers , the Ecofin Council and the governments of Member States , which nowadays do not seem to be very inspired by macroeconomic coordination at European level that complements their common monetary
