In the past , people acquired a telephone in order to keep in touch with each other , but now they have become shareholders in a company , which could , for example , be acting as an intermediary in sexual services .
Deregulation created fears of a fall in standards of public services and an increase in telephone charges .
The 1988 regulatory package was well timed and - due to its efficient implementation - worked well in several Member States .
In some countries , however , implementation has been slow and even formal .
We are concerned at the fact that the limited supply of user access has prevented many user groups - in particular those with lower resources - from taking full advantage of , for instance , reasonably affordable Internet access .
Sufficient transparency on the specific conditions for operating licences is required , so that undue delays in the approval process can be prevented .
The objective is to prevent social discrimination and to increase consumer confidence and social cohesion .
We take a negative view of this with the exception of certain special instances .
We were aware , as early as two years ago , that the GSM auction in the USA had resulted in a state of chaos , i .e . bankruptcies .
Those in favour of auctioning believe it to be a good means of controlling resources .
This would be an unfair tax , in that it would be the same for both rich and poor .
This is cause for concern , which , in my opinion , should be looked into in greater detail .
In the end , there will be the fear that as we reduce regulations , i .e . deregulate , these big operators will make mutual agreements and 'reregulate ' , creating new regulations .
This cannot be right .
Mr President , there has been a change over to electronic capitalism , both in Europe and worldwide .
A rapid concentration of the information industry is in progress - at the consumers ' expense .
We must now ensure that public interest is secured - as proposed by Mr Alyssandrakis - and ensure the availability of sufficient frequency bands for use by public broadcasting .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Reino Paasilinna for his thorough and excellent work in preparing this report , but I would also like to thank the Commission , which has done so much in support of this eEurope initiative and the expansion of the Internet .
As the Commission has stated , there has been a lot of progress in the past few years in the EU telecommunications sector , but there is still a lot to be learnt where the mobile phone market is concerned .
In future , it is incumbent on the Commission to ensure more vigorously than ever that the 'roaming ' fees charged to users by operators are brought down in all EU countries to a sensible level based on actual costs .
The operators are not allowed to collect fees from the users , but neither must the public authority collect from the operators .
Therefore 'beauty contests ' between the various operators are clearly more consumer-friendly alternatives .
If we also want to introduce the Internet into schools and libraries and make it available for everybody on a very large scale in future , and if we also want to utilise its future potential in competition with the USA , the Internet will have to be affordable to all .
As things are now , resources are wasted due to overlapping and lack of coordination .
Even worse is the fact that the gap with respect to the USA is widening .
I would prefer to talk about cooperation or strategy , rather than research policy .
Each research community is best aware of its own needs for investment and development - these should not be too tightly controlled by policy .
The participation of women in scientific research within the EU continues to be too fragmented .
Researcher exchange programmes and interaction between research teams are matters which deserve our full support .
Its position as research coordinator should be further strengthened .
On account of the amendments tabled in committee , this report ended up being more wide-ranging ; when dealing with issues related to research areas , we must not focus solely on scientific communities .
It is obvious that , in the preparation of this communication , there has been no horizontal utilisation of the expertise of the various directorates .
Since the discussion on the research area touches , for example , on the enlargement process of the Union and on the vitality of the SME sector , one would have wished that the Commission ' s communication had presented more visions and concrete content .
Keywords in research policy are flexibility , global thinking , and the more effective use of resources than at present .
On no account is it appropriate to enlarge the role of the Union ' s research centres in such a way that the operations of national research centres are made more difficult in the context of resource reallocation .
Increasing , for instance , the mobility of researchers according to need and enhancing the cooperation between the scientific communities of the EU and Eastern Europe will create a reliable and credible basis for research projects .
Mr President , we are going to New York first and foremost to discuss the position of women globally .
In my opinion , a worthwhile contribution to this event would be the concept that the empowerment of women can be regarded as a strategy for the development of society as a whole .
In the eradication of poverty , supporting women , for example by 'micro loans ' ( negligible amounts from our point of view ) has proved a very sound
