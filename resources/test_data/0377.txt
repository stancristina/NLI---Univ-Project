the principle of mutual recognition , protection of personal data ) ; and a Europe that is united , responsible and fair with regard to asylum and immigration through true solidarity between all the Member States , and the fight against the trafficking in , and the sexual and economic exploitation of , human beings .
I am in favour of rules to guarantee that passengers do not remain stranded at their destination , with no alternative means of travelling home or alternative accommodation .
They will thus be able to identify these goods by the social , environmental and safety standards commonly associated with that country .
With its road map for equality between women and men for the period 2006-2010 , the European Commission made a commitment to help eradicate sexual violence and violence linked to the trafficking in human beings .
With regard to the request to organise a European day on violence against women , on the basis of an in-depth study , the Commission has concluded that it would be premature to take such an initiative before a genuine strategy to combat violence has been drafted .
Madam President , I would like to finish on a personal note .
A European text can provide for dispensations , smoking rooms and areas of freedom .
Soil damage , damage to biodiversity , oil dependency , greenhouse gas emissions , groundwater depletion and the development of consumption patterns put us in a very fragile situation , more fragile than 40 years ago .
We must hear the cry of famine and act accordingly .
That would make Europe grow in stature , and it is urgent !
Otherwise , we will not be able to find the right balance to enable us to achieve the objectives of the policies .
Those are my very brief final remarks , Madam President , as I did not wish to take up too much of your time .
In our view , the European Union , together with the Member States , should therefore guarantee the authors ' rights , the intellectual property rights of writers , journalists and scientists .
Accession negotiations with candidate countries must be based on objectively measurable criteria , such as respect for rights and economic criteria , and avoid any kind of subjective reference based on values , religion or culture .
A legal basis cannot be created .
A total ban may be regarded as an act of exclusion , which may prove to be counterproductive .
As further proof of their 'brainwashing ' by pressure groups , they have also rejected Article 9 , which simply refers to one of the reforms to the common agricultural policy already decided on , namely the end by 2010 of direct production-linked subsidies for tobacco growing .
I would like to mention just one case which I think is typical , that of Mrs Tran Khai Thanh Thuy .
I also ask the Commission and Council to continue to want to include in the new partnership under negotiation the clause about respect for human rights in China .
In opening the 'development round' , the WTO members have therefore committed themselves to amending multilateral trade rules in order to ensure that trade really does benefit economic and social development in every country , on every continent .
Now more than ever , we must remember that our objective is the ambitious and balanced conclusion of the Doha Round .
This is an instrument to be adopted using the codecision procedure , but the Council is not here .
Thanks to the GÃ¶ncz report on micro-credit and the controversy that surrounded the financing of this project , I went to see what this famous Progress programme - which the left is so adamant should not be deprived of a single cent for the financing of micro-enterprises and individual initiatives - is all about .
Contrary to what the European Commission is asking , we oppose the idea of reallocating appropriations from the Progress programme to the European Microfinance Facility , because that would send out a negative message to economic operators .
The Commission has powers to verify the measures and the decisions taken by the Member States in relation to the application of European law .
I therefore believe that this is one of the priorities of the new strategy , of the 2020 strategy .
It can encourage the resumption of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean .
Islamic extremism - a shameful abuse of the Muslim religion - and hatred of the West and its values sustain this deadly terrorist network .
I would add , moreover , that respect for these legal and procedural rules is crucial if these targeted sanctions are to be credible and , therefore , effective .
Clearly , the idea is not to change the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact - no one has asked for that .
In my view , it is up to Europe instead to decide what must be done .
The aim of this network is to encourage transnational cooperation among associations of victims of terrorism and to provide greater protection of victims ' interests at EU level .
We must , in fact , launch a European policy that takes far greater account of victims of organised crime and terrorism .
Rest assured that they have left neither Mr Almunia nor I indifferent .
There are , in fact , families that wish to follow a Christian tradition .
I apologise for not being able to give you a better answer this evening , but I am obliged , in all honesty and in accordance with the law , to respond in this way .
From Copenhagen I expect balanced commitments , short- and medium-term commitments , and verifiable commitments , together with financial penalties in the event of non-compliance .
