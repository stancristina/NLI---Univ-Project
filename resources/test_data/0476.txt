Mr Hannan , for he presented himself in the Danish media as a Member of the European Parliament .
All things considered , I think Mr Hannan should stay at home in Britain and mind his own business , and leave us to get on with it in Denmark .
As a result of this and in view of the Danish reservation in the legal sphere , the Danish Social Democrats have declined to vote in favour of the final proposal .
The MEPs of the Left regret that , because of the Danish reservation , the Danish Government has not been able to influence the directive and is the only government not to have the right of veto , just as we regret the fact that , unlike other countries , Denmark will not make more demands of immigrants to Denmark who wish to reunite their families and require them to be self-supporting and to have somewhere to live .
In that case , it would not be the local authorities ' task to support and find homes for the people concerned , as it is at present .
We therefore decline to vote on the report , regretfully because we should like to see a common policy , especially in the field of asylum .
Mr President , as a number of speakers have already mentioned , falls from heights are among the most serious categories of industrial accident and , by means of this report which is a stage in the elaboration of the directive on minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment , we are setting to work on doing something about the problem .
The main features of the rules we are proposing to introduce in this area seem to be clear and , at the same time , appear to take due account of the fact that businesses will have to be able to make the rules work in practice and on a day-to-day basis .
I believe that our rapporteur , Peter Skinner , has striven to find this balance between the desire for clear rules and the need for flexibility and diversity .
However , I believe that it will also be important in the future to work on reducing the risk of accidents by acquiring greater knowledge of how such accidents happen .
When do they occur ?
What can we do to prevent them ?
This is a proper path to go down : the authorities cooperating with the two sides of industry .
The Danish Social Democratic delegation wishes to express its full support for setting up Eurodac for the purpose of comparing the fingerprints of asylum seekers and certain other foreigners .
In compliance with the Danish opt out in the legal sphere , we have abstained from voting in the final vote in view of the chosen legal base for the regulation .
Glase report ( A5-0220/2000 )
Madam President , in a comment on the Danish 'no ' vote on the euro , you expressed the view that the 'no ' side had appealed to an irrational fear .
For the overwhelming majority of those who voted 'no ' , the vote was about democratic legitimacy to make decisions concerning our economic policy .
The Danish people want a far clearer demarcation line between what the EU is to concern itself with and what the national parliaments are to continue to decide on .
As early as December in Nice , however , majority decision-making is to be introduced in the social and labour-market spheres , as referred to in Articles 42 and 137 .
If , subsequently - and with Article 42 as a basis - the circle of people covered by Regulation No 1408 is enlarged , and if majority voting is introduced under Article 137 on , for example , the criteria for granting unemployment benefit , this would have major consequences for both social and labour-market policy in Denmark .
That is simply the basis for the way in which we have organised ourselves .
However , a decision was made , and we must respect this .
The Danish 'no ' vote is not isolationist or nationalistic in character .
A majority of Danes have said 'no ' , as they did in 1992 and 1993 , to more European integration , 'no ' to surrendering more sovereignty and 'no ' to the tools which serve these purposes , that is to say the euro , majority decision-making and a European constitution .
Allow me to stress that the 'no ' votes were delivered by voters right across the political spectrum .
Even half of the ruling Social Democratic Party ' s voters said 'no ' .
The Danish Government and the parties in favour of the euro have done everything in their power to explain away the integration and surrender of sovereignty that are under way .
If the Danish Government had spoken as clearly as Mr Prodi and Mr Poettering did in this Chamber today , there would have been many more people who voted 'no ' .
Denmark , and all free Europeans who are allowed to hold referenda , will say no thank you .
- ( DA ) The Swedish and Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the request to the European Council to arrange for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the Treaty at its summit in Nice in December .
We are pleased to note that the Convention has succeeded in producing a draft Charter .
It is therefore absolutely crucial that there should be a dialogue with the people of Europe about these basic issues .
We believe that , as a political document , the Charter is a good point of departure for this wholly necessary dialogue , which is now about to begin
