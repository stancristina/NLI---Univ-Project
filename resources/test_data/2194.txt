At least from the human point of view , therefore , you have my heartfelt sympathy .
If we - if you , first and foremost - do not involve them in defining the goals and managing the rules we set in place , then no goal will be achievable .
This liberalisation will bring greater efficiency , more competition , greater benefits for consumers and , not least , more employment as well .
Increasing competition between sales distributors and in the after sales market and increasing competition in the manufacturing and distribution of spare parts must therefore be seen as positive .
Mr President , this draft regulation is the product of a lengthy , in-depth process analysing the situation in the motor vehicle sector .
Lastly , independent dealers and repairers will benefit from the new package of rules for it will consolidate their financial independence and provide them with new commercial opportunities .
They are in contrast with the availability and openness to dialogue shown by the Commission towards all the interested parties .
I will now focus briefly on the most important draft amendments contained in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
It would not be a transition : it would , let us be quite clear about this , be a mere waiting period , a period of waiting for a new Parliament and a new Commission in order to decide on the future motor vehicle distribution system in Europe .
I agree that the brand image is the most important competition tool for vehicle manufacturers , but there is no justification for requiring separate showrooms or different staff for different brands and this would remove the financial advantage of multi-branding for dealers .
In my opinion , in its original form , the Commission 's draft already ensures that there will be a service point near a dealer where the dealer subcontracts the activity , but , in the light of the amendments put forward in this regard , a solution could be to require the dealer to inform the consumer of the distance of the premises of the authorised repairer from the sales outlet as well as the location .
You might remember that there were similar reactions when the Commission opposed continuing duty free .
I am much obliged , but I really do not think that working to promote the citizens ' interests is being courageous .
In any case , even if we achieve a project with the FTAA which we might call the FTAEU , we really do not feel that it will be possible to avoid very large demonstrations such as those which took place in Madrid .
One hundred thousand people came to Madrid to demonstrate during the summit - we really cannot say that is insignificant !
Mrs Malmstr√∂m has already mentioned Cuba .
The mafia is expanding increasingly beyond its traditional areas of activity , it is forging literally global alliances , it is penetrating the economic and financial sectors through extremely sophisticated money laundering systems .
The MacSharry and Agenda 2000 reforms ensured - so it is written - a reasonable and stable income for producers .
Modulation has thus far been voluntary .
This aspect therefore warrants a great deal of attention .
The situation is becoming absurd : a directive on the protection of privacy will become a directive clamping down mercilessly on ... on what ?
And why ?
Do we need the clause on combating terrorism in an instrument harmonising and liberalising telecommunications ?
I am pleased to note that this is the position of both the Commission and the Council , which have also proved willing to achieve compromise solutions that go some way towards meeting some of the more reasonable demands of telecommunications undertakings .
I feel that the solution is sensible and sustainable , for the European Parliament certainly does not have the power to make the Council prevent the Member States keeping traffic data for reasons of national security .
I still feel that it is possible to apply the standards which are currently in existence and endorsed at European level to achieve the same end while avoiding the risk of overregulation , of excessive regulation , that is .
I would conclude with a more general observation : we all eagerly await the 2004 review .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am honoured to present today , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , the second reading of Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2/2002 .
Accordingly , in an extraordinary meeting held yesterday , it decided not to endorse the budget amendments tabled in the first reading .
Instead it called on the Commission to commit to presenting an assessment of the situation by 30 September next and to propose at that time any measures needed to address the total transfers and supplementary budget .
We are dealing with a first pillar directive - the liberalisation of telecommunications - are we not ?
Mr President , the rapporteur asked you a question which , in putting this amendment to the vote , you have not answered .
It is my impression - and this is why I voted for the report - that , when everyone sees and knows what we are doing , perhaps we behave better , more honestly , more sincerely .
Of course , there will be many more roads leading in all directions from Brussels , but I would point out the importance , Madam President , of corridors 5 and 8 , particularly corridor 8 which , as you know , according to the proposals of our parliamentary committee , links southern Europe , Italy and the Adriatic with Varna in Bulgaria , on the Black Sea .
I regret , however , not being able to vote for a directive to organise private
