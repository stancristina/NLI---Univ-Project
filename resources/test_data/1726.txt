the Future of the EU , President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing .
He reported on the work of the Convention and we will meet with the Convention 's president again at the Copenhagen Summit .
' From Copenhagen to Copenhagen' - that is the motto of the Danish Presidency .
The Brussels Summit took us a crucial step closer to Copenhagen , while at the same time marking the final stop before the Copenhagen Summit .
What lies ahead of us in the coming weeks ?
Hard work and enduring intense negotiations .
On 28 October I met the Heads of State and Government of the candidate countries to give them a personal and direct account of the Brussels Summit and as early as the following day discussions with government officials began .
It is clear , however , that if we are to achieve a result on time great efforts are needed , along with a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone involved , both Member States and candidate countries .
On behalf of the Danish Presidency I would like once again to thank the European Parliament and the Commission for the sound cooperation and call upon us all to join forces in the weeks ahead too in order to achieve our common aim - to conclude the first round of enlargement negotiations in Copenhagen in December .
In this connection , I am very much looking forward to participating in the great enlargement debate here in Parliament in two weeks ' time on 19 November .
I hope that we here in the Community can send a strong message to the people and governments of Europe that the time has come to conclude ten years ' work , that the time has come to open the gates to our common future and that the time has come to make the crucial decision on enlargement .
I would like to express my thanks for a good debate .
With regard to enlargement , I would like to thank you for the many positive remarks made concerning the Presidency 's efforts so far and concerning the course of the Brussels Summit .
I would like to emphasise that hard work will be required over the coming weeks .
There is a need for considerable political will , but I would like to say that the European Council convinced me that this political will exists and the debate that we have had here today in Parliament has underlined the same thing - that there is a strong political will within the European Union for this enlargement to succeed .
I will therefore concentrate in my response on a number of the main topics that were raised by various Members .
First and foremost , there is the issue of Turkey .
Mr Poettering , Mrs Malmström and Mr Schulz all raised the issue of Turkey and the decision on Turkey which may be made at the Copenhagen Summit .
Turkey is a candidate country .
In other words , Turkey will be able to obtain a date for commencing accession negotiations if and when Turkey fulfils the political criteria .
Turkey must not be measured by different standards to the other candidate countries .
At the European Council in Brussels , we expressed recognition of the progress that has been made .
Naturally we must now keep a close eye on political developments in Turkey following the elections that have been held , and we must then find a balanced solution at the Copenhagen Summit .
The second topic that has been raised by various Members is agriculture and budgets .
Mr Poettering started by asking why we were discussing the long-term financial outlook of the EU Summit here in Brussels at all .
Well , the answer is very simple : it was a precondition for the Presidency and the Commission being given a mandate to complete negotiations with the candidate countries , because certain countries made it a requirement that a decision had to be taken on the long-term financial outlook .
Then Mr Barón Crespo and Mrs Malmström asked : yes , but does the decision made at the EU 's Brussels Summit mean that we can still discuss reforms and agricultural policy ?
The Council will continue to discuss the Commission 's mid-term review of agricultural policy .
In this respect , I might refer to some key phrases in the conclusions of the Brussels Summit , in particular section 12 , which states that direct payments etc etc would be introduced without prejudice to future decisions on the common agricultural policy and the financing of the European Union after 2006 , nor to any result following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the Berlin European Council conclusions , nor to the international commitments entered into by the Union , inter alia in the launching of the Doha Development Round .
The issue of the safeguard clauses was also raised .
I would like to emphasise that there are two types of safeguard clause .
The two specific safeguard clauses concern the common market and legal and internal affairs .
As far as the general safeguard clause is concerned , it is symmetrical in the sense that it can be invoked by both old and new Member States .
Where the specific safeguard clauses are concerned , these can only be invoked in respect of the new Member States , but it is an important aspect that the point of the safeguard clauses is actually to avoid them being invoked ; they will only be invoked if the new countries do not abide by the acquis that they have undertaken to abide by and , since we expect them to abide by this acquis , I hope that the issue of invoking safeguard clauses will not become relevant .
In fact , we have always had safeguard clauses
