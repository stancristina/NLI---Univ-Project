wise deliberations and a number of conclusions .
It can safely be said that there is huge support .
I should like to thank you for your commitment and support .
Up until the negotiations in Copenhagen - that is to say over the next three weeks - we face a huge task in concluding the negotiations with each of the 10 candidate countries .
The Presidency will conduct the negotiations in cooperation with the Commission and with complete respect for the EU rules on expenditure ceilings set in Berlin and for the conclusions adopted in Brussels .
That was what the General Affairs Council recommended to the Presidency at the meeting yesterday .
A great willingness to compromise is required , however , together with great understanding of the other party 's needs and points of view .
The expenditure ceilings set in Berlin must be respected and the decisions taken in Brussels concerning , for example , agricultural expenditure must be respected .
To Mr Bonde , Mr Modrow and quite a few others , I should like to emphasise what Mr Rasmussen also said just before lunch , to the effect that there is no question of the fifteen Member States now going on to write a new treaty to which the 10 new countries then agree , without having had any influence on it .
That is the way things are .
I believe it was Mrs Myller who raised the issue of the new neighbours .
The Council expressed the desire to formulate an ambitious , long-term and integrated strategy in relation to each of these new neighbouring countries with a view to promoting democracy and economic reforms , sustainable development and trade and for promoting stability , prosperity etc on the other side of the new EU border .
It was emphasised that account should be taken of each country 's special political and economic circumstances and that the issue as a whole should be seen in the context of the current deepening of cooperation with Russia .
There was also talk of cross-border cooperation , organised crime , illegal immigration and regional cooperation between the new neighbouring countries .
It was decided in conclusion that the Commission and Mr Solana should be called upon to prepare more detailed proposals as soon as possible , and the decision was rounded off with words to the effect that the candidate countries would be consulted on this work .
This is a complex and extensive proposal covering 150 pages .
Where accession is concerned , it is the Helsinki conclusions that continue to form the basis of the EU 's position .
The Council will take a decision on Cyprus 's accession , taking account of all the relevant factors .
With regard to relations with Turkey , these will be based on the European Council 's decision , also taken in Helsinki .
The Commission 's report stated that fulfilment of the political criterion , which is a prerequisite for embarking upon negotiations , has still not taken place .
Major progress has been made , however .
The economic criteria must be fulfilled no later than upon accession to the EU.
Last of all , I want to say to Mr Maaten and Mr Arvidsson that we all recognise that enlargement from 15 to 25 , and subsequently to 27 or perhaps 28 , Member States requires a new treaty .
That is , of course , why the Convention is sitting and why we must have an intergovernmental conference .
From everything I have heard , however - yesterday , too , from the Member States and the new Member States - there is an awareness of the fact that decisions must be taken so as to prevent the bottlenecks Mr Maaten talked about or , in other words , problems involving the inability to take decisions .
With these words , Mr President , I want to express my sincere thanks for this debate of eight and a half hours which signals massive support for the great project we have under way .
It would be a good idea to have an overview of all the aircraft within European airspace , coordinated centrally : within Eurocontrol , for example .
Obviously it is the countries themselves that are responsible for national air traffic control systems , but would it not be appropriate to have a central overview of all the current and planned flights , whether they be civil or military , in order to improve utilisation of the airspace , reduce the number of delays and lessen the impact on the environment ?
This is to be established in accordance with what has been called the 'all-purpose article ' : the famous Article 235 , now Article 308 , which is unchanged in the Treaty of Nice .
With so many new countries due to join the EU next year , it would be better for us all to focus on consolidation and simplification of the existing legislation rather than continuing to build the Brussels legislative pyramid higher and higher .
All new proposals should be presented in their legal context , so that it is possible to compare proposals for new legislation with the existing legislation .
This approach would make it possible to reduce the acquis communautaire from more than 85 000 pages to perhaps 25 000 pages .
Attempts to create a federal state with an ever increasing amount of legislation could be replaced with a decentralised confederation of states , which would allow the Member States a great deal more freedom .
We want a Europe of democracies based on diversity , as we believe that people will be happier if they can determine their own affairs as far as possible without interference and free from detailed rules drawn up by bureaucrats and lobbyists in Brussels .
