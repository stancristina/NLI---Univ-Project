First , as Mrs Martens wanted to say , it is not only about providing computers .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed by a clear majority that these economic policies should be based on the principle of a socially committed market economy .
Particularly in view of developments in the United States and Japan , responsibility for the world economy falls on the European Union , and we must shoulder that responsibility .
Nevertheless , we should make every effort to secure the liberalisation of the remaining state monopolies .
We call for an increase in the activity rate , especially with regard to women , yet we do not provide sufficient childcare facilities throughout the Union .
This is why it was necessary once again to put the concept of a socially committed market economy at the heart of this report .
These measures must be consolidated by means of an extension of the Maastricht criteria on budget deficits and debt levels to include a cap on administrative expenditure .
But I also bitterly regret that we do not have more transparency and democracy .
Environmental policy must not be an end in itself ; it must have an aim - not only an environmental aim but an aim for companies too , because companies are part of our society , a fact which is just occasionally forgotten in my committee .
I believe that this is a warranted step in the right direction .
Anyone who thinks that the processing of historical waste could be individually financed is dreaming .
I believe that lights should be covered by this directive , but they should not be subject to a recycling target .
The throw-away mentality is an important factor which must also be taken into account when financing is discussed here .
We want recycling to be conducted in a truly systematic manner and on a scale which ultimately makes sound economic and budgetary sense .
It is not the polluter who has to pay - quite the reverse .
For example , it has not hitherto covered those substances for which no data are available at Community level from national monitoring programmes .
Mr President , as a result of our work today , the Water Framework Directive , which entered into force in December 2000 , will be fleshed out with the listing of 32 specific substances in Annex X . The Group of the European Peoples ' Party is in agreement with the proposal from the Commission .
After all , its classification of eleven substances out of the 32 as priority hazardous substances has ensured that their discharge into water resources will be stopped within the foreseeable future .
Now whether this means that it must be eliminated by 1 July 2002 , as specified in the decision we adopted in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , or whether the Commission must table a draft containing supplementary provisions as soon as possible is a question that may be left open for the moment .
However , it is surely well-nigh impossible to explain away this particular contradiction to the European public .
.
The age at which regular alcohol consumption begins , however , is falling steadily .
May I also say that the Commission has produced a good basis for a recommendation to the Council .
Such comparisons create confusion and might even give the impression that particular alcoholic drinks could safely be consumed in larger quantities .
A product is then deemed to be safe when its safety has been verified by an accredited test centre .
Or , if I may resort to sarcasm , do you perhaps want to solve the beef problem at the expense of these new LÃ¤nder in eastern Germany , thereby ensuring that the farms there will be forced to shut down ?
It would have been better to have adopted the proposal we made in Parliament at that time to the effect that there should be an additional mechanism in the degressive premium model to make allowance for the cost of labour .
The fixing of any form of ceiling for the payment of support is therefore an unwarranted additional financial burden on those who have already made investments .
And last but not least , our guiding principle throughout this sector should be the need to produce safe food .
There are a number of academic reports , especially those by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea from last November , that were confirmed at the beginning of this year by the Commission 's Scientific , Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries .
As soon as this proposal has been approved by the Council , the Member States will be able to grant retrospective compensation to their fishing vessel owners in accordance with the provisions of Article 16( 2 ) of the structural regulation .
We feel that we can respond to this best by making an exception especially for owners of very small vessels , as they depend directly on this economic activity and have no other alternative .
I hope that you would not want that !
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to ask you whether the Green Paper also takes account of the fact that eighteen million businesses in the European Union have fewer than 250 employees .
The Third Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement expired on 31 December 2000 and was replaced by a new one that came into force on 1 January 2001 .
And this is a good thing , as we do not want to fish to the point where there is nothing left to catch .
I am also pleased that you , as rapporteur , recommend approval of the proposal .
For this reason the Commission considers the proposal to be unnecessary
