on information sharing , coordination of bodies with some approximation of laws where this is beneficial , but not as a general rule .
.
The ELDR Group has voted for the Ferri report because we want to see a more effective and coordinated fight against organised crime in the EU through developing EU capabilities complementary to national criminal justice systems .
But we opposed paragraph 5 calling for a ( European ) " Public Prosecutor ' s office with jurisdiction over the Member States ' territory as a whole " , implying that the European-level prosecutor would substitute for national prosecuting authorities .
We support an EPP working in parallel with national authorities , but not replacing them .
We accepted paragraph 11 ( b ) as meaning an alignment of national definitions of serious offences so that criminals cannot escape justice by exploiting loopholes , but we are clear this does not mean the harmonisation of all national justice systems .
We accepted paragraph 8 since we support a sensible rationalisation of working languages for essential cross-border cooperation between professionals such as judges and prosecutors on matters like extradition warrants .
Although we supported paragraph 9 , we feel the proposal for sanctions showed up weaknesses at the heart of the purely intergovernmental procedures currently in force .
There are no means to enforce respect for agreed judicial assistance measures , as there would be if the area fell within Community competence .
We need to ensure that the e-publishing agenda is fully taken on board and that this important field can be developed in a meaningful manner alongside the traditional form of publishing , and that there is room for both .
I welcome the emphasis the document puts on linguistic and cultural diversity and the important contribution of the written word to the development of culture in the different European regions .
Seeing that there is much emphasis on linguistic and cultural diversity I trust that references in the report to 'all languages ' encompasses lesser used languages .
E-publishing is especially important for books with a limited market , academic books and books in lesser-used languages are in this category .
It is therefore important that the Commission and Council take this into consideration when considering this report .
Madam President , I refer to the draft regulation on European political parties .
At the last part-session in Strasbourg the Commission was going to give us a statement on that matter .
Subsequently , it was withdrawn and I understand that the Commission has now come to a view on the funding of European political parties .
This is a matter of some sensitivity , especially since there are certain parties represented in this House that might regard themselves , for some reason , as ineligible for such funding , even if they approved of the funding in the first place .
Could you ask the Commission if it would make a statement on this matter at some stage before the House ?
Secondly , Madam President , while we are on Tuesday 's agenda , it is worrying to me that the European Parliament is holding a debate on the Commission 's work programme for 2001 but does not have a resolution on that matter .
This is especially important since there are some 200 measures contained in the Commission 's work programme for 2001 which Parliament will debate , but on which it will have no resolution .
This is a bad precedent .
There should be a resolution , especially since we are supposed to be scrutinising the work of the Commission .
Finally , could I make the observation that far from being the Commission 's work programme for 2001 , we might rename it the work programme of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
Madam President , thank you for that very helpful suggestion .
Not many of us will be here on Thursday evening , unfortunately .
It might be helpful if the Commission could take this on board and tomorrow morning , in the statement it makes on the Commission 's work programme for 2001 - or the Commission and Parliament 's work programme , as I like to call it - make such a statement in public .
Relating to Thursday : President .
I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to withdraw from the agenda the oral question to the Commission , tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats , regarding the Stability Plans in Ireland and France .
Madam President , like Mr Wiebenga , I am amazed that the Christian Democrat/Conservative Group thinks that euthanasia laws in Member States are an appropriate matter to raise at European level .
In the United Kingdom , Conservatives have been very quick to condemn European human rights guarantees as an outrageous interference in national affairs and as a breach of subsidiarity .
We will no doubt hear a great deal from them on that theme in the next few weeks and months in the run-up to a British general election .
It is quite extraordinary that they have supported raising the matter of euthanasia in a Member State at European level , and I note this for the forthcoming election campaign .
Madam President , very briefly in reply to Baroness Ludford 's speech on the question of whether or not there should be a debate on euthanasia , I think it is entirely proper that Parliament should debate euthanasia .
I would personally recommend that there be no vote at the end of such a debate , and indeed my own delegation would expect a free vote because it is a matter of conscience .
Just for the record , I wish to make it clear that my delegation has taken no position on this matter in the EPP Group
