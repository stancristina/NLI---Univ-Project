But whilst I welcome the positive noises coming from Brussels , it is not enough .
Mr President , I am not calling for a nanny-state approach , but simply that , in a civilised society , we recognise the right of children to their childhood .
That is too precious to become the plaything of wealthy , western tourists .
MacCormick report ( A5-0061/2000 )
- My vote in this matter is in support of the need to ensure that the European Patent Office improves its procedures to prevent any patent being used in human cloning .
The University of Edinburgh ' s application for this patent has nothing to do with cloning ( cloning was considered impossible when the patent was filed ! )
It is established and legitimate practice in both academic and biopharmaceutical research to genetically manipulate human cells in tissue culture .
This has been done for many years and is a major method of learning how genes and cells function .
It bears no relation to genetic manipulation of people or embryos .
It is misleading to suggest that the object of this patent is to genetically manipulate humans .
The University of Edinburgh have indicated their willingness to cooperate with any suitable modification of the patent .
It think it should be made clear that the potential application of this patent in human cells is to guide the production of particular cells that could be useful in transplantation therapy for conditions such as Parkinson ' s disease , strokes , diabetes and heart failure .
This is what the Edinburgh research is about .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to an internal matter .
Some members of staff of the European Parliament both here and in Brussels , when they try to enforce European Parliament rules - in other words , no smoking in no-smoking areas or any of the other European Parliament rules - are sworn at and abused by some Members of Parliament .
In other parliaments ushers are treated with the respect that they deserve .
I would hope that happened in the European Parliament .
If the situation does not improve , do you know if there are any disciplinary procedures we could take against those Members who treat the staff in such a disrespectful manner ?
Madam President , I would like to bring to your attention an incident last week where two football fans were tragically murdered on their way to watch their team play in the UEFA Cup .
Football is a sport which transcends the world .
Almost every country plays football .
It is known as a beautiful game .
In about three months Belgium and Holland will play host to Euro 2000 .
There is every likelihood that incidents such as those that happened last week will be repeated again in Belgium and Holland .
Can I ask you , through your good offices , to contact all the Member States who are involved , to try and keep such problems to a minimum ?
Madam President , I would like to be clear that if we have agreed that Zimbabwe would be the fifth point then there is no point in voting in any other points because we already have five points on the agenda .
Madam President , in 1996 I had the great honour of representing the UK Government at the World Congress , which was held in Stockholm , Sweden , under United Nations auspices , on the subject of the sexual exploitation of children .
At that time we took a number of initiatives which we believed would help children , the most vulnerable section of our society .
Mostly they were concerned with issues such as sex tourism and general abuse in countries all over the world .
They did not , in general , relate to matters concerned with the Internet - this new technology , which has come in at an enormous pace in the last few years ; a new technology which has the ability to do good things but also the ability to do evil things .
There are very few regulations which are concerned with what the Internet is used for .
Whilst a lot of countries are keen to see their citizens benefit from the good things it can offer and whilst e-commerce itself is becoming a major feature of life , we have not yet seen any proper regulations to protect those who are abused , and particularly those who are abused by the use of images of themselves in a pornographic manner .
That is the reason for my report - to protect children , to try and help children to avoid being abused in this particular manner .
My report , for the first time , puts forward a definition .
We have been short of a definition until now .
Although there was an initial Austrian initiative , which this report supports , it did not contain a definition .
In our report we have entered a definition which we hope will be acceptable internationally .
We can only deal with this matter if we deal with it in an international fashion .
We are only dealing with it at European level now , but hopefully the world will react , whether it be through the auspices of the United Nations once more or , indeed , through the common sense of other countries .
If we are lucky , we will see a world approach to outlaw these very bad practices .
We have required within our report that European nation states should have action plans for dealing with the abuses which take place .
We are concerned with the production , sale , distribution and deliberate possession of pornographic images showing children .
We want to stamp out this appalling abuse .
In our report we wish to make sure that police authorities throughout Europe take action
