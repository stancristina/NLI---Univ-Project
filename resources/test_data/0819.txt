the estimated losses directly sustained .
The difficulties raised by various national laws are now reduced by this proposal via harmonisation of the Member States ' legal , regulatory and administrative provisions on the addition of vitamins , minerals and other substances .
I voted in favour , because the report is aimed at the approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States , which will lead to closer cross-border cooperation between police forces through exchanges of information and research on criminal offences .
What is at stake is the establishment of a framework for police cooperation - joint operations , mutual assistance and even the possibility of the police force of one Member State taking action on the territory of another .
The objectives of this text , which is aimed at combating terrorist threats and protecting the public , are of the highest importance .
I therefore support the report .
I also endorse the 15 general principles presented by Mr Frattini , which reflect the thrust of the acquis in the area of personal data protection processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters .
Creating the conditions for recovering fish stocks , in this case cod , is vital not only in terms of protecting marine biology resources but also keeping fisheries activity alive .
Our vote against Amendments 20 , 21 and 22 was based on our view that decisions on total allowable catches and quotas should not be automatically linked to the opinions of the Council for the Exploration of the Sea .
If the Commission 's proposal were to go through , thousands of jobs in agriculture and industry would be put in jeopardy , even if in the short term there is still a payment to farmers and a transitional period .
With the right legislative and budgetary procedures for giving the EU the maximum amount of decision-making ability and for making its policies as effective as possible , the new Treaty may help resolve some of the serious problems that Europe is facing .
One only has to read point 6 to justify rejecting the Resolution .
The German Presidency moves full steam ahead , claiming it has a 'mandate ' to 'preserve ' the content and 'substance ' of the so-called ' European Constitution ' in the 'new ' draft Treaty to be presented by December 2007 ( ! ) and ratified by 2009 .
Realism is no less virtuous than idealism .
I voted in favour of this report because I feel it is important that European artists can benefit from an appropriate level of integration in their professional activities .
We are critical , however , of some of the proposals in this report on which Parliament has voted .
This is a matter of particular concern given that no detailed information or justifications have been given regarding the use of these financial resources .
We wish to highlight the fact that the increasing outsourcing of language and translation services , and other types of unstable contract , inevitably affects the quality of the service and undermines the rights of those providing this service .
In spite of the Commission 's efforts at harmonising practices and guaranteeing transparency , it is a fact that there is competition in terms of incentives between EU regions and Member States , which , along with the absence of tax harmonisation , foments the artificial relocation of companies .
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner what he intends to do to ensure equal opportunities for multiple sclerosis sufferers and to raise awareness among the Member States so that they pay greater attention to the problem .
At Community level , these conditions mean agreements with ever smaller fishing opportunities and with ever greater burdens and responsibilities for shipowners .
It is important to mention , however , the change in the sphere of reference : the old fisheries agreements with third countries , which were commercial in nature , has been replaced by the new Partnership Agreements , with fisheries protocols , which will effectively work more and more as development aid .
The report has our backing because it is a complete document that includes two unique Portuguese drinks initially overlooked by the Commission , namely Madeira rum and poncha da Madeira .
I voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report on the proposal for a regulation on the definition , description , presentation and labelling of spirit drinks , because I consider it vital that consumers should not be misled .
At the heart of the dispute was what is meant by the term 'vodka ' . Some said it should only be made from cereals , potatoes and/or sugar beet molasses , whereas others argued that the labelling should enable consumers to distinguish the raw material used in its manufacture .
I voted in favour of the Svensson report because I feel that by creating a range of measures banning the use of cat and dog fur , we will be helping to put an end to this deeply inhumane trade .
The rapporteur strongly endorses this proposal , highlighting however the need to clearly eliminate any legal loopholes that would undermine the import and trade ban as such and emphasising the need to tighten customs checks as well as administrative - and , where possible , also criminal - sanctions applied by Member States in order to create a truly dissuasive framework that would enable this shameful and illegal trade to be brought to an end .
The majority in Parliament 'questions the bill itself as well as the choice and the growing number of industries that have been classified as strategic and essential to national security ' in Russia .
Although improvements have been made in some areas , today 's Russia is far from being a free and open democracy that upholds human rights in full
