have placed the Swedish Presidency in such a humiliating position that it is having to betray its own key concerns regarding transparency and deliver secrecy instead .
We still have an EU in which neither the ombudsman , the Court of Auditors nor the Committee on Budgetary Control can obtain all documents for perusal .
To that extent , we need the commendable Swedish rules on the right of access to documents and the freedom to provide information .
I have three remarks in connection with this question .
Both the Treaty and the question talk about introducing an 'area of freedom , security and justice ' .
However , that is not the case .
It is not going too far to say that the dominant system is one based upon Roman law but , in addition , there exist of course the common law system , which is significantly different , a Germanic and even a Scandinavian legal tradition , and these legal traditions differ from one another on crucial points .
However , there is also , of course , another objective , and that brings me on to my second remark , which is of a legal nature .
Finally , I have a political remark to make .
This empire building through the establishment of a legal system represents one of the most repressive systems of oppression in world history .
What has been established in the light of these words , 'freedom , security and justice ' , is a system of monitoring and control without parallel in world history .
Objection can also be made to this perversion of the language which should ideally , of course , reflect reality as carefully as possible .
If arrangements are to be of immediate effect , as the Commission wishes , the EU must appreciate that the HIPC agreement is quite inadequate .
At present , a sustainable debt is defined in the HIPC initiative on the basis of non-documented sustainability values , and most of those countries that have obtained debt relief are spending more on debt repayment than on health and education .
There are enough tasks to get to grips with .
What we now need is not more words , but action ; and action which hopefully does not end up like the 'Everything but Arms ' initiative in which the Commission produced a fine proposal which , unfortunately , was completely destroyed by the Council which postponed the agreement on rice , sugar and bananas until the year 2009 .
It is simply scandalous and something we cannot live with here in the European Union .
I have an excellent knowledge of this protocol and do not need this summing up .
The Danish debate is about Denmark ' s being able , via intergovernmental agreements , to be associated with parts of what is known as the third pillar , in other words parts of this section of the Treaty establishing the European Community , and I can tell from what the President-in-Office of the Council said that no decision has been reached .
Am I to understand the answer as saying that the Council is unaware of these negotiations ?
The June Movement will not vote in favour of rules which mean that officials are enabled to legislate instead of elected representatives in open assemblies whose work can be monitored .
Mr President , there is quite a gap between the euphoria expressed by some today and the view expressed by others , to the effect that this is a compromise balanced on a knife edge .
The process concerning transparency and public access to documents has , of course , been conducted for a long time behind hermetically sealed doors .
This is in itself a major problem because , in tackling such an essential area as public access to , and scrutiny of , documents - which is fundamental to our having democratically active citizens able to influence the decision-making process - it is crucial to involve people , partly in the debate as to how the rules are to be designed , and perhaps , in addition , to go so far as to listen to some of people ' s objections .
I think we have a result which , in some respects , can be lived with , which in other respects is good but which , on a number of points , is unfortunately a retrograde step in relation to the current situation which is , of course , the result partly of a number of rules , partly of the practice of the courts and partly of intervention by the ombudsman .
All right , but is that not precisely what transparency is all about - enabling people to have a decisive influence on the decision-making process ?
There is , of course , no doubt about the fact that these rules will be of decisive importance to the rules in all member States , but large parts of the rapporteurs ' presentation have been vague and it has been very difficult to get clear information about the whys and wherefores .
I doubt if it will be possible to extract so much as one more document from the EU system than it is possible to extract today .
By far the best thing about this proposal is that we nonetheless have a chance to look at the rules again in 2004 , and I think we have some detailed and substantial work to do before then .
Public access to documents is , of course , the very stuff of democracy .
The conclusion is that this proposal is really worse than nothing .
Many aspects of the rules concerning sensitive documents are absurd , and administering these exceptions is a bit like selling elastic by the metre , as a Danish humorist once put it
