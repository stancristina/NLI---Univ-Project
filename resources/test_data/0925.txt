Commission as regards the provision of objective reasons and statistical information .

Rear-facing child restraint systems which are fitted to the front passenger seat are only permitted if the airbag has been deactivated . 5 .
We might as well start at midnight on Tuesday and work right through until 8.30 a.m.
Madam President , I am sorry , but something seems to have got lost in translation .
An application for the removal of immunity could be lodged tomorrow against any Member of this Parliament - against me , against Mr Poettering , against Mr Haarder , against Mrs Frahm , against any one of us - and , in order to avoid public speculation , the Member concerned must have the opportunity to make a direct statement about the accusations .
The imposition of a minimum jail sentence of six years , or ten years where the circumstances make the crime more serious , should be sufficient to bring trafficking in human beings within the scope of other instruments already adopted for the purposes of enhancing police and judicial cooperation in the European Union against organised crime .
Cross-border cooperation between criminals is well-established , especially as regards the sexual exploitation of children .
The penalty , that is , the term of imprisonment , should be increased from a minimum of eight to a minimum of 10 years , with stiffer penalties being imposed when the victim is under 16 , rather than under 10 .
The European Union and its Member States must adopt a joint approach in cooperation with the third countries concerned .
It is also right that we should discuss the maximum penalties .
Animal welfare is now given far greater priority , and the focus is no longer solely on costs and competition .
The laws on animal welfare should only be developed and improved with the involvement of those concerned .
The only way forward is to do what the Council has suggested - I think this is very important - namely to concentrate on raising public awareness and fostering sensitivity to animal welfare issues .
The task is to put the developing countries on the net as they move towards the knowledge and information society .
Here , too , we must work together with the developing countries to ensure that rules are adopted which enhance the social benefits of the new technologies and are not simply targeted to commercial gain .
Mr President , the Commission and the Council have asked for urgent procedure .
This is why we must expedite our preparatory work .
The Environment Committee has also decided that the authority should be financed from the general budget alone .
Those who deal with livestock and the foodstuffs that are derived from them need a lobby which , in the context of the continuing globalisation of food markets , can make a convincing case for their products and , above all , can protect them from misguided policies .
I lay particular emphasis on this , because there are different perceptions within the Council .
Not so ; let me counter that view by putting it to you that no previous generation in our Member States has ever been able to choose from such a rich variety of good and safe foods .
In my long years of parliamentary work , I have seldom experienced such close and constructive cooperation in a specialised political field .
The rapporteur has reintroduced the formulation from the Directive fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition in the EU , and there is a minimum standard here that we must not undercut , namely the principle that experts from the Commission may conduct on-the-spot inspections in cooperation with the authorities in the Member States .
I am at a complete loss to understand why animals are now being expected to comply with human ethical standards .
We must find some sort of a system to ensure that the comments made by members of the Commission actually reach our ears - either the speeches will have to be shortened or the Commissioners will have to be given more time to deliver them .
Mr Pirker has the floor for a point of order .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the establishment of our own food authority is an essential signal to consumers , whose confidence in food products has been badly shaken in recent times .
Let me add that the Commission , especially Commissioner Lamy , has kept us regularly briefed .
In the present case , as Erika Mann has said , the absence of information from the Council has prompted a host of individual expressions of opinion in the European Parliament .
We largely agree on the substance of this issue .
In other words , we must stand shoulder to shoulder as equal partners and strive for success .
Mr President , I am grateful for the fact that we are having this debate , but I should just like to make two points .
Clever executives always get parliaments involved when foreign policy or trade are at issue .
Commissioner Patten , I am sure that we will do this in a joint dialogue drawing on your experience in this region , so that we will be able to make a contribution to creating a better world .
I believe , for example , that a country like India , which is significant on the one hand because of its abundant population but on the other because of its democratic structure and experience , could be a good partner .
That is why I should like to recall once more here that this European Parliament once said - and on one occasion it also made this a reality - that in the same way that there was a summit between governments there should be a summit between parliaments
