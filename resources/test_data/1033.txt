the Danish Presidency will increase transparency by providing more statistical data and will add a compendium of adopted practices to show how the code is being implemented by the Member States .
That is how the Member States are obliged to regulate the arms trade .
On the basis of Mr Titley 's report and the backing it has received from Parliament , I am able to say that Parliament 's support for the Danish Presidency 's efforts is very welcome and very valuable .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as may be seen from the agenda , I have been asked to issue a statement today under the heading , ' The situation concerning the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) following the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers ( Elsinore , 29 and 30.8.2002 ) ' .
I am alert to the fact that the request for this report has to be seen in terms of Parliament 's wish to be kept informed of the EU 's deliberations following the United States ' request for the Member States to enter into bilateral agreements aimed at preventing American citizens from being handed over to the Court .
I should like to begin by pointing out that , since the Elsinore meeting , there have been further developments concerning the ICC , and I hope that these will have a more positive and long-term effect on the issues that are at present occupying our friends on the other side of the Atlantic .
I am pleased to be able to report that this general meeting went well .
The present draft documents were finalised thanks to focused and significant contributions from all the delegations in the course of the ten meetings of the Preparatory Commission .
Now , the time has come to focus upon the International Criminal Court 's duties in The Hague .
The ICC must establish itself as an effective and independent institution which can accommodate the demands now made by the international community .
Naturally , the ICC 's ability to function properly will depend upon no serious obstacles being placed in its way .
That , of course , leads me on to the problem that I mentioned to begin with and that presumably also occupies Parliament a great deal , namely the issue of the United States ' request for bilateral agreements on non-extradition .
As the Presidency has said on previous occasions , the European Union and the United States share the same basic values .
We have therefore always thought that the United States should be among the participants in the Rome Statute .
Since 1998 , we have tried to accommodate American concerns in relation to certain provisions of the Statute but , as the summer showed , these efforts have been in vain .
We believe that the United States ' decision is wrong , and the European Union has publicly deplored the step taken by the Americans .
The United States ' request for bilateral agreements was first discussed by the Council in the Political and Security Committee ( PSC ) on 26 July .
The common response essentially consisted of telling the Americans that the EU remains committed to its obligations to support the ICC and the integrity of the Rome Statute ; that the American proposal has far-reaching implications necessitating the more detailed analysis in which we also invited the candidate countries to participate ; and that we would come back with an answer as soon as the analysis had been completed .
In the meantime , it was decided that it would be useful to have a short discussion of the matter at the meeting in Elsinore at the end of August .
There , we agreed that the EU should not accept anything that might undermine the International Criminal Court .
We also agreed that the EU should not increase the difficulties in relation to the United States .
We confirmed that the legal experts should examine the matter with a view to arriving at a common assessment which might lead to agreement as to a common and constructive approach on the part of the EU at the Council meeting on 30 September .
At their meeting in New York , the United States and the EU agreed to look into whether we could arrive at a common position .
Some outlines of a common approach are now beginning to emerge , therefore .
Clearly , the present American proposal is irreconcilable with obligations in relation to the International Criminal Court .
On the contrary , we are trying , as I stated , to find a policy that can both sustain respect for the Court and ensure that we can come to an arrangement with the United States too .
If a solution is to be found to the issue of exemption from punishment , raised by the American proposal , it will have to contain a suitable provision ruling out exemption from punishment for those who have committed crimes covered by the jurisdiction of the Court .
That is to say , there must be no exemption from punishment for those who have committed crimes covered by the jurisdiction of the Court .
With regard to the issue of reciprocity , this is not something we want to see .
When it comes to the categories of person to whom the arrangements would be applicable , the United States wants to see a rule that would exclude everyone , and therefore all Americans , from extradition to the ICC.
The issue of specifying in more detail those to whom the arrangements will apply will continue to be discussed up until 30 September .
Rather , they are continuing .
We shall now work hard to achieve a solution that can , if possible , accommodate the United States ' concerns without in any way undermining the Court
