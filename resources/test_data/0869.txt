of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task .
Madam President , I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi 's programme .
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth : the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity , innovation enterprise , the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens .
I have one observation , not a criticism , to make regarding Commissioner Prodi 's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy .
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured .
After all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens .
This is a key priority for us to focus on .
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us : in particular Commissioner Liikanen 's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy .
Yes , e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs .
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses .
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit .
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin 's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union .
Again , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity .
You said in your summary , Commissioner Prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keeping inflation low , innovation , science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs .
I very much agree with you on that , but we can take nothing for granted .
There is still more we have to do , and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that .
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .
Madam President , the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair .
We will be looking for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year .
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy , and will be applying a number of tests .
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy , employment policy and social policy .
At the moment , social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy .
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency .
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect .
The spate of mergers , takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past ; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive .
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change .
That is the successful way to manage change , and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place .
Finally , with the emergence , the resurgence , of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination , and Article 137 to combat exclusion .
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now .
The aspirations are fine , President Prodi , we want those aspirations to be matched by action .
Mr President , I also rise on a point of order .
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament , outside the doors of the Hemicycle , to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate ?
If there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?
Mr President , I wanted to point out an important matter of principle .
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem , which is fair conditions , fair pay and fair hours .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future .
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers .
We must strike a balance between them
