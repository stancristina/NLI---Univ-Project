The difference between the global market prices in 1984 and the price in the European Union was enormous , but it is now considerably less pronounced .
After all , if we compare the EU 's presence in terms of dairy products within the global market today to that in 1984 , the situation is now considerably worse , and that is much to be regretted . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , this debate is one we have been having for many years , with a number of recurring themes .
It is unfortunate for this Parliament that neither the President of the Court of Auditors , nor Commissioner Kallas have spoken one word about the new financial perspectives .
What is different , though , is the reaction to the Court of Auditors ' negative verdict .
The European institutions are demonstrating that they , even at the age of 50 , have not yet reached this level of maturity .
The Council has taken a decision , though , without walking the most basic democratic path first .
Time after time , politicians stress that Europe must look after the core themes and cross-border issues , but this statement by the European Parliament is at odds with that .
This means to us - and we will be putting this request in the resolution - that you have to outline the consequences of the internal market on the European citizens .
I would appreciate a response to this .
Why are human rights not the centrepiece of the Union 's external policies ?
After all , in his speech , in which President Barroso asked for the confidence of this Parliament for his team , he referred to the much-debated nomination of Mr Buttiglione and he said - and I quote : ' However , one good thing will have come out of this unfortunate incident : it has highlighted the importance we attach to decisive political action by the European Union in the fight against all forms of discrimination .
For this Commission , civil rights and an anti-discrimination approach will be top priorities . '
Moreover , we should capitalise on the increased openness displayed by the Council of Ministers .
Although these deserve a special mention in the communication , they are not there .
I am pleased that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has put this oral question , for the problems are , after all , real .
I hope that the Commissioner will advise us as to how Parliament should tackle this .
I am , finally , particularly disgruntled at this House 's capitulation in respect of the maximum enforcement of the achievements that were attained at first reading .
The Quartet is reported to be meeting in Cairo today in order to relaunch the peace process .
That is a good thing .
We hope that , as regards Moldova , the ban will go from the table - we saw an announcement about that today and we would ask Russia not to threaten to have bans on all of the European Union when Romania and Bulgaria enter .
I should like to thank the rapporteurs for all the work they have done , and Commissioner Rehn for the clever and efficient way in which he has prepared the process that will now lead to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU on 1 January 2007 .
I personally am also happy for another reason : I have been participating in so many debates on Romania and Bulgaria , and I am happy that this burden will now shift to other committees in this Parliament !
With the benefit of hindsight , this House should have insisted on the same right of postponement for Bulgaria last year .
Although nobody is enthusiastic , the opinion that another year 's delay will not solve anything now prevails .
This is why today , I will once again be voting against the Moscovici and Van Orden reports .
In this respect , it is important for non-governmental organisations to be actively involved , so that they can monitor national authorities and call them to account once the international agreements are implemented .
Moreover , REACH replaces a set of very impenetrable legislation that has eventually made the European market unworkable .
A sound balance has also been struck in the areas of authorisation and substitution .
I should like to apologise , not least to the Commissioner and Mr Sacconi , for my inability to be present for the rest of the debate , a fact occasioned by a vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , I , too , should like to thank the rapporteur , and not least his staff , for their commitment to this report .
Unfortunately , it transpired that the deletion of Article 1( 1 )( b ) was at stake and that , according to the legal offices of the Commission , the Council and of this House , meant that the other articles in the legislation could not be amended .
What is the role of the government in all of this ?
Another big area of concern for me is the fact that in seven of the Member States , the national judicial authorities have already declared the directive to be inadmissible .
The same applies to our campaigns involving health workers in an effort to double spending in basic health care .
This is something to which the Committee on Development will be devoting much of its parliamentary time , both in terms of programming national policy plans and of monitoring their implementation .
It would be good if the Commissioner were to confirm this , and
