Madam President , naturally we also discussed the situation facing European agriculture .
Preparations are also under way ahead of 2003 for a review of European agricultural policy .
At the moment , the Swedish Environment Minister is in the US together with the Commissioner for the Environment before continuing on to Iran , Japan and China for discussions there .
We addressed issues concerning people in their day-to-day lives .
We did not achieve success in every area but there is no doubt as to the direction in which the Union is moving .
In this way we will create the Union we have dreamed of , a union which is dynamic , successful and which holds together socially .
Madam President , I am pleased to be able to welcome the Swedish Prime Minister once more and see him here together with several of the Swedish ministers .
The 15-page conclusion document mainly describes decisions intended to be taken at a later date .
Football was played for longer than the question which most concerns Europe today was discussed , namely the agriculture crisis .
I think that the Council should evaluate and consider what role these summits should have .
The upcoming Spanish Presidency has an important task ahead in ensuring that Lisbon comes to mean something concrete and is not just words on paper .
Instead one has to put in more effort to be able to achieve competitiveness and increased wellbeing .
Has the presidency any view on the Tobin tax or shall we interpret the Swedish ministers ' publicly consorting with the Attac movement as indicating their position on an international tax on currency transactions ?
What is actually meant by a 'political breakthrough ' in the negotiations ?
The social issues , particularly the question of unemployment , were hardly touched upon .
The second is about reducing the number of unemployed .
I have nothing against measures to increase the available workforce but no one can claim that they provide any direct benefit for the unemployed .
Cutting working hours would also benefit all those who are already in work and make it easier for them to combine work and family life .
It was supposed to be about action , not EU rhetoric , but was that the case ?
On the other hand , they did succeed in agreeing to create a common financial market , which has been eagerly awaited .
We liberals now assume that the Council is prepared to act such that we achieve a solution which can also be accepted by Parliament .
This is an excellent ambition .
My question to the President of the Council is therefore this : according to the Council , what difficulties will be posed in terms of a more cohesive Union by Britain , Denmark and Sweden remaining outside EMU in the long term ?
I would also like to congratulate him on a successful meeting in Stockholm .
If the progress of the Europe of the future is measured only in terms of deregulation , it is clear that the meeting was possibly not a success .
Mrs Carlsson said that the Social Democrats in Europe were having a difficult time of it .
There are clear targets for employment , intermediate targets and employment targets for older people .
This , together with an active labour market policy , means an increased supply of labour but also reduced unemployment .
All these ingredients were present at the Stockholm Summit .
Link this to the open coordination method and we will achieve a coherent policy .
What in fact does it mean politically ?
In this sense the Stockholm Summit was a disappointment .
The US now threatening to withdraw from the Kyoto Agreement is scandalous and the EU' s leaders must consider serious measures to show ...
Mr President , let me briefly comment on what has been said .
I want to talk firstly about foreign relations and secondly about the Lisbon Process , as my initial report was primarily structured in that way .
When we are able to put forward common principles , we must naturally also act together .
Relations must be deepened and developed , and dialogue must be open .
This is far from unimportant .
I primarily see positive effects of this , but I would be a very poor politician if I did not also recognise the difficulties in carrying out such a process .
It is no easy debate .
The process is heading in the right direction , and we are implementing it in such a way that we have the support of national political opinion in each country .
Here I am talking to those who said that we have not produced any initiatives to combat unemployment .
If we are to be proactive in addressing unemployment , we must do so by increasing the cake by developing the economy .
As far as I can judge , the negotiations are successful , but they are not easy .
My task as President-in-Office of the Council is to ensure that the Union ' s regulations are highlighted in the negotiations and that we run the negotiations so as to achieve a change in legislation , markets and political systems in the countries now seeking to join the Union .
I am hopeful that , in the negotiations in the spring during the Swedish Presidency , we shall achieve success that we will be able to describe as a breakthrough .
These are not reasonable conditions for political work , and we have to create greater openness if our citizens are also to have a greater chance of becoming directly involved in what forms the basis of the political decisions .
We all have an interest in this , whether we are participating in the currency union from the
