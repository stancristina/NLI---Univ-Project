Cofinancing by the EU is above all an important helping hand , and we expect that , in any event , half of it will be covered via the EU’s budgets and thus , primarily , via the funds .
Parliament must now have confidence that both the Commission and the Member States will comply with their responsibilities , listen to Parliament and incorporate Natura 2000 into all the relevant policies .
The heads of government made a commitment to do so in Gothenburg and on various occasions subsequently , and this is something they owe both to the citizens of the EU and to our descendants .     – Mr President , I would simply like to say that it is now extremely clear to me how wrong it is that it is not Mr Dimas who is here .
That was already established at the outset .
All our previous experience shows that such opportunities are not utilised .
I am well aware that Mr Frattini is not in a position to do that , but to send a Commissioner who is not responsible for this area and who can therefore only make general comments is not the right way to treat Parliament .     Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to call for us to have the EU’s common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector reformed as soon as possible and the way prepared for a liberalisation of the whole market in sugar .
This gives rise to uncertainty as to how long the present arrangements will last and , especially , as to when they will be changed .
I therefore welcome a final settlement concerning the organisation of the markets in the sugar sector .
I also agree , of course , that we must wait for the appeal over the next two months , but we need to accept the consequences of this appeal once its result is made known .
European sugar production is both efficient and competitive .
Some changes will of course occur , especially regarding where production will take place in future .
That is the very best we can do for the European sugar producers , while we of course have a duty to equip producers to face the competition that exists in the world market .
The latter have arranged their production in accordance with an artificial price in the European market , and they must naturally be helped in the transitional period that will exist on the way to freer competition in the world market .
In fact , quite the reverse is true .
We must of course demand that imported sugar be produced in accordance with the same social and environmental standards for sugar production with which we are familiar in Europe .     Mr President , I would thank the Commissioner for sticking with a reform of the sugar markets , however modest this may be .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believes that sugar production in the EU and , preferably , throughout the world should be regulated by quotas .
Sugar production should instead be set free .
The committee makes a few polite nods in the direction of the developing countries , but it is transparently obvious that its main concern is sugar production in the EU.
We do not help poor farm workers in , for example , Brazil by making export conditions there worse .
In the EU , half of the aid goes , moreover , to the sugar industry .
In Brazil , negotiations with the government could be proposed to make sure that the plantations comply with the ILO’s demands .
The concerns expressed about the developing countries are hollow .
The proposal to use sugar as a fuel is beyond the pale .
We do not , however , think that there is any point in changing the provisions as such if this leads not to better rules but only to rules that are complex in a new way , for the regulation of driving time and rest periods is complicated , and must perhaps in the nature of things be so .
I , for my part , must sincerely thank the rapporteur , Mr Markov for the splendid and comprehensive overview he has taken of this complicated material .
There are , however , a number of points on which my group disagrees with some of the conclusions contained in the report resulting from the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
These include applying the rules on driving time and rest periods to vehicles under 3.5 tonnes .
It would also be quite difficult for the police to know right away whether an ordinary van was being driven for a firm that needed to have a tachograph installed in it .
It is proposed to exclude from the directive vehicles used in connection with a long list of public supply services , such as sewerage , electricity , water , gas etc .
With regard to long-distance drivers , we also think it right and important for the weekly rest period to be organised more flexibly than the Council has proposed .
We have therefore tabled an amendment on this subject .
Subsequently , the issue will be one of whether we can reach a conciliation with the Council .
That is too inflexible and shows signs of too much weight having been given to ease of supervision as a consideration .
The Council adheres , of course , to the view that tachographs should be installed from this year but , as matters now stand regarding adoption of the directive and the ability to install the tachographs at the present time , it seems a bit over the top to insist on this date , and we in the ALDE Group are able to support a postponement
