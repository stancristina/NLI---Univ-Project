I suspect that the small number of Members of this House who have kept in touch with the plant , both the management and the workers ' representatives there over a good number of years , felt the issue more keenly than most .
It exposed a poor safety culture and an inadequate secondary control procedure in the manufacture of MOX fuel .
However , we should note that the response of BNFL to the nuclear inspectorate report has already resulted in very significant management changes .
These have been welcomed both by the inspectorate and by the minister responsible .
I hope that in that regard they will not be accused of having gone native on this particular issue .
I would suggest that one of the roles of Parliament should be to monitor the ongoing management changes that are taking place .
We should also note that the chief inspector and the Commission made very clear to the industry committee that there were no safety implications at any of the Sellafield installations .
Nuclear safeguards were not an issue , nor were there safety issues in relation to transport of nuclear materials .
I am glad that the Commissioner has reinforced that view this evening .
The fuel can be safely used for the purposes for which it was manufactured .
But to say all this must not lead us to be complacent .
We seek to apply standards to the applicant countries in eastern Europe and , I would suggest , beyond the applicant countries in eastern Europe .
European Union standards applicable to all nuclear installations are still something that most of us want to see .
We know that the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association is seeking harmonisation .
I would hope that the Commissioner , as other colleagues have asked , will reconsider her position and actually support and encourage WENRA in this objective .
I am absolutely convinced , on the basis of my own experience in a number of countries that this is the way to reassure public opinion .
It is the reassurance of public opinion that must be our main objective as a Parliament .
Mr President , I asked to speak in this debate not just because I am a Member from the north-west region of England where the Sellafield plant is situated , not just because there could be 10 000 livelihoods at risk if Sellafield was closed , and not because I have any vested interest in the nuclear industry .
I do not .
I asked to speak because I want to try and help to get some truth into this debate .
The trouble is , when you talk about nuclear issues - especially Sellafield - it is dominated by a distortion of the truth .
When Mrs Ahern spoke , she spoke of the NII giving a damning indictment of the plant .
No, it did not !
She spoke of the damning indictment on safety checks .
No, it did not !
It made three safety recommendations and the checks were quality assurance checks , as other speakers have said .
She said the report came from a press statement in The Independent .
No, it did not .
The workers at BNFL raised the issue .
They were the ones who discovered it .
BNFL were the ones who told the nuclear installations inspectorate and their customers what had happened .
She spoke of contamination of the seas in Ireland and Denmark .
I quote from The Independent where seven prominent Danish scientists , who actually study as a professional interest the releases of radioactivity from Sellafield , said on 12 May : " There is no scientific basis for the claim that the present release of radioactivity from Sellafield causes an unacceptable contamination in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions " .
When your mind is made up facts only confuse the issue !
She spoke of the scandal of abuse of safety .
That is an absolute insult to the people who work there , and more so to their families who live near that site !
Those workers would not work in that plant if they thought it was unsafe .
They would certainly not put their families at risk it that was the case .
That is an absolute indictment of those people who work there .
Then she finished by talking about corruption .
That really is the last throw of the dice .
Finally , I say to the Commissioner : the one thing you should do , apart from listen , is to pay a visit to Sellafield and find out the facts for yourself .
That is the best advice that I can give you and many Members of this Parliament also .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Katiforis and Commissioner Solbes , both of whom have displayed a broader than usual understanding of what is necessary for a successful economy .
We must take advantage of the fact that we are in the European Union to do things collectively .
I wish to concentrate on research and development .
I regret that the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy did not draw up an opinion on Mr Katiforis ' s report - it should have done .
Compared to the US and Japan , we are woefully lacking in a proper research strategy in almost all Member States except Finland , Sweden and the Republic of Ireland - countries shown in the Commission paper to have had unusual success .
We need scientists in order to have research and development .
Let us stop young people choosing to do other things .
Let us encourage women .
Let us ensure that competence in widely-used languages is increased .
Above all , let us look at the salaries paid to scientists and technologists .
That is what makes them choose other careers .
Of course
