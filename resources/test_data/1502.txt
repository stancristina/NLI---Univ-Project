However , Europe cannot , under any circumstances , stand aside and do nothing .
They blatantly contradict the Eritrean authorities ' proclaimed desire to undertake democratic reforms .
My second question refers to the fact that a large number of asylum seekers who attempt to enter Great Britain are from Afghanistan .
The second area is that if we fail to harmonise security legislation and mechanisms , we must take coordinated and coherent measures in the two countries to combat those involved in human trafficking , by increasing controls and introducing stiffer penalties , as this activity constitutes an intolerable attack on human rights and is a shameful trade .
Order of business Mr President , you proposed a change to the agenda based on the Council ' s availability , which , of course , we understand .
I have four comments to make on this report .
The Commission has also slipped calls for a common immigration policy into this action plan which really do not belong there .
I am therefore very glad that what we got through the Industry Committee , that is , the call to consumers to demonstrate social awareness when buying goods , is now also to be found in the main report .
Following the Lisbon Summit , Barcelona is expected to step up economic reforms .
I fear , however , that the great expectation that my fellow countrymen have of the Union will be disappointed .
At a time when the European Union is in need of strong economic and social growth and must meet the aspirations of its citizens who are making their voice heard , the Barcelona Summit is being heralded as a decisive step in achieving an accelerated liberalisation of public services that the President-in-Office of the Council earlier referred to as 'a network industry ' .
It is crucial that we listen to them .
These , in our opinion , are the priorities of the Barcelona Summit .
Whilst the human rights organisations welcome every advance that is made , the sheer number of specific cases they deal with demonstrate how much work still needs to be done before we see the democratic Turkey that we all hope and pray for .
Informal contacts between Parliament , the Council and the Commission were continued after the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry were adopted , and the three institutions finally reached an agreement .
The doors of the Council of Europe have been opened to them , and in that forum of discussion and exchange many of the tensions between them have already been eased .
If it were not for the Americans , we would not even have the little pipeline that passes through Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , it is my duty to present to the House a proposal for a regulation concerning the labour-cost index .
These costs are defined as the total quarterly costs incurred by the employer in the employment of labour ( Article 2 ) .
Parliament has proved a committed partner throughout this common enterprise of establishing educational programmes and setting the Europe of education on track .
We are aware of this and very much hope that the Finance Ministers will increase the resources available , so we can pass the increase on to students .
We have adjusted the Erasmus institutional contract to reduce by about 50 % the number of contracts that beneficiaries have to sign .
Following a call to tender , a contractor was appointed in 2001 .
We seem to have reached a turning point .
The budget is not simply a cash register ; there is the issue of unanimity as against qualified majority .
Further , as you have stated , there is a mismatch between the number of objectives agreed and the level of the budget .
Sixty cultural operators from these countries were chosen to be organisers or joint organisers in 2001 .
The need for firmer guidelines and better focusing on objectives has also been highlighted .
The Chairman of the Committee on Culture and the rapporteur also called for better communication regarding the programme and the projects supported .
We hope to imbue all the actions supported with a sense of Europe as well as a sense of culture .
The first of these is of a technical nature and is also contained in the various reports before us today .
These are the foundations on which the citizens ' Europe must be built .
It has been shown that youth exchanges and dialogue help to nip problems in the bud so they do not develop further .
EUR 14 million is allocated to it for the period 2002-2004 , which represents a 40 % increase in available funds .
However , it is their responsibility to waive an immunity that would prevent the courts from carrying out their investigation independently and from finding out the truth of the matter , all the more so since this is a matter which deals with the election to the European Parliament .
Firstly , the representatives from the Member States have succeeded in putting together a complicated arrangement , when it could have been much simpler ; secondly , this complexity will backfire on them ; and thirdly , it will be so much harder to implement because essential expenditure has visibly not been included .
No, of course not .
The principle of an international court , independent of any State , which is able to judge both States and the torturers of colonial wars , the putschists of Latin America , those guilty of genocide in Rwanda and the Balkans or even the murderers of the Palestinian people , is just .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , I would like to
