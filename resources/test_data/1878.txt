corresponding assessment of the so-called ' Lisbon process' , complemented by the decisions of the Gothenburg and Barcelona Councils .
I do not have the time to mention other issues , Mr President , but I would like to end as I began : rather than making grand statements in Spring Councils , we must comply with what has been agreed .
There are clearly other factors involved in terms of productivity and which affect the labour market .
I believe not .
I know that , in relation to the elements I have just mentioned with regard to the pact , you may say to me that these instruments count in those countries with budgetary positions below 3 % in terms of deficit .
If I am asked whether we should be satisfied , I must say that we have made progress , but not that we should be entirely satisfied .
Only if we are able to make progress on all these elements will we have a departure point which will allow us to grow rapidly when the economic context changes .
It is true that we have managed to have many of the amendments we presented at first reading accepted , but it is also the case that we have sacrificed legitimate , well-founded and well-argued aspirations in order to achieve a text which can be accepted by the Council .
Mr Karas has highlighted many of the amendments which have enriched the original text of the Commission and the Council .
We said 'no ' three times : 'no ' to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , 'no ' to tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and 'no ' to unilateralism .
Jimmy Carter , winner of the Nobel Peace prize , has written that , where Iraq is concerned , alternatives to war clearly exist and that a war would be unwarranted .
In our view , a preventive war neither guarantees world security nor complies with international law .
Are we attempting to achieve the fast-track democratisation of a nation - mapped out on the drawing board after the First World War , composed of Sunnis , Shiites , Kurds and Turkmen - or are we attempting to establish a neo-colonial proconsulship , which can only be sustained by the force of these weapons ?
These are obligations that are binding on all our States and on all our citizens .
What makes the UN irrelevant is saying that we will be going to war whatever happens .
Let us recall that the inspectors did not leave the country in 1998 of their own free will , but were expelled because the regime thought that the danger had passed .
Simply saying 'never again ' will not get us anywhere .
I therefore wish , Commissioner , first of all to convey to you this Parliament 's unease at your belated - from my committee 's point of view - reaction to this issue , which also leads us to doubt the legality of the actions referred to in the joint statement issued by senior officials of the European Union and the United States Customs Service on 17 and 18 February .
This is also a requirement laid down in Article 7 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights .
If this is the case , the airlines have the right to claim protection from their authorities , as do , it goes without saying , the Union 's citizens .
In my view , this is unacceptable and this attitude must change .
When it was announced that Question Time was to be cancelled , we were told that these questions would be answered in March .
With regard to this point , I wish to ask the Council a question : is this matter that we are now addressing not precisely one more reason for creating this European coastguard service , not aimed specifically at suppressing what you defined as the 'fight against illegal immigration' , but which would also save the lives of many individuals who , on rafts or by other means , attempt to reach Europe 's coasts and who often fail ?
We ask the Commission to adopt more specific and more effective measures to remedy these shortcomings .
Let us take the opportunities provided by the Treaty and the Structural Funds Regulation to make progress in equal opportunities with projects that fulfil these objectives .
On this basis , the European Commission submitted the proposal before us today , which echoes , almost word for word , the United Nations text .
Focusing on the fight against terrorism in the European Union , I wish to highlight one aspect that I believe is relevant .
In this context , and taking advantage of the Commission 's presence amongst us today - I see that the Council is not present - I shall take the opportunity to suggest the idea that is already beginning to be talked of in the corridors and to which I hope we will soon have an answer ; I am referring to studying the possibilities of creating a mechanism for solidarity at European level that provides formulas for compensating European citizens who have been the victims of terrorist attacks on EU territory .
Our Group also hopes that the Commission will fulfil its commitment to a policy of zero tolerance with regard to internal fraud , and that it duly informs Parliament of developments made in the various cases in progress and in recently-opened investigations .
Mr President , at this moment all over the Basque country demonstrations are being held ( The President cut off the speaker )
Nigeria has one of the highest rates of illiteracy in the world .
The Iraqi people are suffering a twin punishment : the punishment it suffers under Saddam Hussein , and the additional punishment of an unjust war
