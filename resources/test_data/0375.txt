The purpose of the new market mechanisms is to more effectively coordinate supply and demand regarding slots .
Finding long-term solutions has nevertheless been a very slow process in recent years .
Our group believes the present system must be radically revised .
Mr President , Mrs De Palacio , ladies and gentlemen , the airline market is an example of how national egoism is crumbling .
We can promote competition through proper control of slots .
At this stage the Commission has submitted a proposal to us that is slightly larger and broader in scope than the original one , but we cannot wait around for a year in a rapidly developing aviation industry .
I therefore earnestly support the approach that has been chosen .
The slots must also be fairly allocated to foreign companies .
Monopolies are the poor man 's worst enemy , and new Sabenas simply cannot any longer be supported out of the taxpayer 's pocket .
There is still a lot of room in the airline industry for greater efficiency , and that might be said of us here too in the European Parliament , and for that reason I will end my speech here .
It is of the utmost importance for all EU citizens that the single market in blood and blood products that has been set as an objective cannot work without reliable safety standards .
At the same time , however , it must be said that we have managed to reach agreement on how levels of safety can still be substantially increased by making unremunerated blood donation a fundamental principle .
This would not prohibit the payment of travel expenses and compensation for lost working time , which is important for donors of plasma in particular , who often have to travel to another area and give up a lot of their time .
Community legislation is generally of a high quality and easily manages to control even the small details of human life - too small , one is tempted to say .
I shall wait for the Commission to submit a new proposal in which this important detail can be corrected .
Quarrels over diminishing but vital natural resources and decent living space may well be the cause of future conflicts or even wars .
For this reason , natural resources must be brought under sustainable control and growth must be achieved without overexploitation of natural resources .
We are still looking for sufficient levels of commitment to respond to the challenges of the future .
It is the European Union that ultimately has to serve as the motor that will keep development running and help us achieve these much needed steps forward at the forthcoming meeting .
In two weeks ' time in Seville we shall have the chance to do just this and make the European voice heard .
Mr President , the EU has good reason to be satisfied with progress on sustainable development .
However , resistance to it is now becoming a reality and national and commercial interests are clearly coming into view .
To its credit , the Union has especially dedicated itself to slowing down and preventing climate change .
For that reason I want , prior to the meeting at Johannesburg , to propose that the EU should establish a special European Climate Change Agency , whose job it would be to support the Community in policy concerning climatic change .
It would be the task of the European Climate Change Agency to compile data on climatic change and its impact on the environment , the economy and society .
By acting on the best available information the EU can build international partnerships in which selfish national and financial ambitions can be constructively thwarted .
Climatic change is the most serious problem in our history and its most serious threat .
I believe that many will have noticed that it is the European Parliament that has made the most innovative proposals of all , which are now incorporated in this key directive on equality at work .
This means that employers that fail in their obligation to create working conditions that pre-empt sexual harassment may also become liable for prosecution by the courts as a result .
This means that we have created a grassroots instrument that guarantees that employers and employees will , through a united effort , make a survey of areas that are unsatisfactory at their workplace and that they can eliminate them through the same united effort .
In this regard I might say that developments in EU legislation are moving very much in the direction of the Nordic model .
This directive will also afford greater protection from discrimination against mothers and fathers at the workplace .
This is also absolutely vital as there is much debate going on in all our Member States about how men can be included in the promotion of equality .
This directive now forbids all such discrimination .
In this way the European Union can also promote concrete improvements in gender equality in the future Member States .
Parliament should feel very pleased with the results of this conciliation process .
I cannot say whose name this report bore , I am too humble for that .
I would ask the Commissioner about this review and the study that he is going to undertake : are you also going to look at the differences in operation between cable and satellite that also exist in the directive and are also unsatisfactory ?
Mr President , when the European Council convenes at Seville , two years and a few months , or four presidential terms , will have passed since the Lisbon Summit and its ambitious decisions to make the Union the world 's most competitive economic area by the year 2010 .
It would be wrong and disparaging to say that nothing has
