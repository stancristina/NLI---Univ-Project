In the first place the abysmal talks relating to this sector within the GATT Uruguay Round had disastrous consequences which it is difficult to put right .
First a definitive maximum quantity must be set on which further customs concessions may be granted and that quantity must be compatible with the needs of the current Community situation as regards production .
And finally , my fifth point , is that SMEs must be given easier and improved access to international markets .
It is also a hard fact that the number of people wishing to set up business and create jobs is decreasing every year .
When interest rates go down , they go down for the powerful , for those whom the banks see as good customers , but these decreases in interest rates are never applied to small companies .
Over the last five years , they have created between 60 and 80 % of the new jobs registered and are , I believe , a source of what must be a priority for the European Union : job creation .
During one part of the negotiation , a majority of the Council tried to impose its criterion on the European Parliament without giving any reason , demonstrating an attitude which , if I were not watching my tongue , I would refer to as blackmail .
In the light of this , the Commission has presented a new proposal for a compromise which we can accept - and which we are going to vote for - in order not to lose the 562 million ECU earmarked for the more explicit machinery of solidarity and fighting unemployment in the Community budget .
None at all .
Mr President , honouring agreements and guarantees for fulfilling agreements reached within the European Union is the very cement of our credibility and the vital pillar for our political co-habitation .
Mr President , nobody should be under the misconception that the 1998 budget is not going to be a very difficult one and so it is extremely important that we all make every effort to reach agreements and make sure that they are as wide-ranging as possible .
So how can we ensure that these boats are complying with standards and the relevant codes ?
Concerning these amendments , however , I should like to point out some details and make some comments .
Finally , Mr President , Amendment No. 12 on communicating the list of passengers is vital .
These ultra-peripheral regions face the problem of a lag in their economic and social development and , in particular , face problems due to their very remoteness .
This report has the virtue of solving this problem by proposing that we set up , through inclusion in the Treaty , a legal base which provides for the specific treatment of these regions .
In any case , of our Committee on Fisheries where a lot of hot air has been spoken about responsible fishing and selective methods .
This plan emphasises the fact that drift nets are not profitable .
The Italian situation is a very difficult one , with 677 boats involved .
This text sets that ambitious objective and opens the preparatory phase for a future association .
We should not forget the Cooperation Agreement on social development , state modernisation - a very important question , training , education , the environment and research and development concerning new technology .
In both the European Union-Mercosur Agreement and this one there are certain areas which are not defined which does nothing to take away the importance of the political significance but which , in my opinion , does nothing to clarify the agreement either .
This really does show how weak parliamentary political dialogue is , given that there is not even any mention of the European Parliament in the agreement .
When we say that we share common values and democracy , support for human rights , pluralist democracy , we must also recognise that Chile is not a full democracy .
This appeal for shared values comes up against the real fact which means that the Chileans are unable to exercise democratic values , and people who have committed crimes in the past are not being brought to justice by any means in the near future .
As for the type of report , we think that an opinion would have been the right form and we are convinced that this will have less of an effect in terms of political and economic consequences .
I hope that we also agree on demanding full respect of a full democratic model , when we speak about other countries in the Latin American continent .
Today , Chile is a mature country , a country which looks towards three continents from an economic point of view , and therefore it is very important that we should strengthen our economic ties with Chile .
Mr President , the Anastassopoulos report was approved unanimously in the Committee on Legal Affairs .
Therefore I think that the rapporteur 's recommendations that we opt for a directive seem far more appropriate .
What stands out from the 1994 report is its classical methodological approach , which makes it possible to appreciate the foundation of Community measures vis-à-vis those for which , on the contrary , the Commission has no legitimacy to take , because the criteria of Article 3B are not met .
The Community after all is based on the explicit share-out of power .
The third axis of the report is to 'act less in order to act better ' , to use the slogan of the Commission which we share and applaud .
The resolution which we are proposing highlights the confusion which arises from this decision and insists on the vital difference between simplification and consolidation - and clarity as a natural corollary of both of these principles , which are criteria of good legislative practice vis-à-vis the legal nature of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
A distinction
