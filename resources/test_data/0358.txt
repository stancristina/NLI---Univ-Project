need to stress the need for financial support for farm holdings and businesses , which are already bearing the burden of the increase in production costs , which they truly cannot pass on to the consumer .
There are Member States saying we should refund part of our enhanced revenue to low incomes .
I should therefore like you to tell us in your reply why the majority rejects the proposals emerging from France or from Greece and when a decision will be taken on specific measures for farmers and fishermen .     – Mr President , why such panic from Sweden to Greece and from Portugal to Poland ?
Did it not see the intervention of the United States ?
It is controlling Venezuela 's oil by trying to destabilise Chavez .
You will see huge problems soon .
We need to be able to adjust the currency and , above all , we need to be able to take the oil which is ours , oil in Romania and oil in the Aegean which Turkey has blocked .
At the same time , the profits of the multinationals operating in the sector are multiplying at a rapid rate , the concentration and centralisation of capital is intensifying , to the detriment in particular of small and medium-sized enterprises and capital restructurings are being reinforced .
The increase in the consumption of energy in developing countries and the wars and escalations which the monopolies themselves cause are a pretext for increasing prices .
This is an institutional confrontation between the three Community institutions , the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
In this way , the two institutions will acquire a stronger role and a stronger place in the mind of the citizens .
I personally believe that the new Commission will consist of people who are able to meet the challenges of the next five years , which is why we MEPs of the Greek New Democracy Party will vote in favour of it .
However , what was decisive in shaping our position was the hearing on the questions of security , justice and civil liberties .
You referred to the danger of institutional crisis .
You still have the opportunity , you have the jurisdiction to find an institutional and political solution to the situation which has arisen .     . – The creation of the euro was identified in the mind of the workers with a wave of rises in the prices of basic consumer goods , with a harsh austerity policy and with rising unemployment and poverty for workers and benefits for employers .
We are and we always have been opposed to EMU because we support the workers ' interests .
For example , the account of the new counter-terrorism coordinator is not audited by the European Parliament , but comes directly under the Council 's expenditure .
Our question therefore should be : do we want a European Parliament which exercises policy on behalf of Europe or a European Parliament which rubber stamps the funding of policies exercised by intergovernmental institutions ?
If we want to be taken notice of and to represent the Union , then we must send the message out in every direction that we are here and that our role is not cosmetic .     – Mr President , I too should like to start by warmly thanking our rapporteurs , Mr Garriga and Mrs Jensen , for their excellent work .
The Council displayed inconsistency between the objectives it has set and the resources which it ultimately decided to use in order to achieve them .
Ladies and gentlemen , at the first reading on Thursday , the European Parliament must support the restoration of the appropriations for structural policies , in accordance with the strategy which we also followed in the Committee on Budgets , with a sense of responsibility towards the citizens of Europe and towards the objectives which we have set .
In closing , I too should like to warmly thank the Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , for her work and to wish her all the best in her future political career .     – Madam President , following the transition to the Europe of the 25 , the definition of border regions has surely also changed .
My question is clear : will we have a differentiated extension and extension in time of the scope of this truly useful Community action ?
Tampere II speeds up procedures for restricting the granting of asylum , promotes camps for rounding up immigrants outside Europe , introduces biometric data and strengthens obscure , centralised services , EU information systems and mechanisms for legalising repression on the pretext of organised crime and terrorism , thereby shielding the dictatorship of European capital .
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade , I should like to focus on the following : it has already been said and it is a fact that , for the European Union , India is only the fourteenth most important trading partner .
Nonetheless , the precondition on India 's side is that it needs to open up the market further and introduce economic reforms .
There is also room to further increase and intensify work at bilateral level .
India is a huge democratic country in the region with a history and cultural past .
The European Union must take full advantage of this tradition .
The European Union followed a similar tack .
The real reason , as we all know , for such intense intervention is the refusal by Belarus to yield to ΝΑΤΟ and the other imperialist organisations .
No one gives you the right , gentlemen of the Commission , gentlemen of the Council , to teach and export democracy to other countries .
We have seen the present rampant crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
