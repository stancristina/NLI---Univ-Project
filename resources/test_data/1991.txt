This is not only my opinion .
Let me briefly address three points .
By June 2010 , there are expected to be 10 million digitised works and by 2015 , the figure is expected to reach 15 million .
We must make it clear , however , that we need to raise awareness among our citizens and , above all , among young people , that this resource exists .
We also need to consider whether the principle of subsidiarity should be taken into account in this regard , in other words , whether , in this case too , it would be necessary for us to draw up a rough framework using the new criteria and then give the Member States and the regions the opportunity to fine tune it .
Finally , we need to be aware that air travel is one part of the very vulnerable infrastructure which we have in Europe .
It is still not possible to buy a rail ticket which will take you from northern Europe to the south , travelling right across the continent .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there has been a fundamental change in mobility in Europe over the last six days .
Every year , the airlines in Europe are given EUR 14 billion by European taxpayers , because , in contrast to the fuel used by the railways , kerosene is not subject to taxation .
They must also guarantee that they will not reduce holiday allowances or deduct pay for the days on which employees were not able to get to work because of the transport situation .
I would like to take this opportunity to say how important this issue is , against the background of the recent Roma summit in Cordoba , at which you were not present , but which two members of the Commission attended , Mrs Reding , the Vice-President of the Commission , and Mr Andor , the Commissioner for Employment , Social Affairs and Inclusion .
I would now like to come to my final and decisive point .
It specifies some of the details , but the decisive factor is the spirit behind it .
Have we drawn the right conclusions from the financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis ?
However , it is clear that Bali and the two-degree goal do not play a role for any of the Directorates-General .
As the spokesperson on the environment for the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I am concerned that we should create as many sustainable jobs as possible and provide added value on the labour market as a result of the leading role played by Europe in protecting the environment .
She should be making constructive proposals for structuring humanitarian and financial aid following major disasters .
As the no bail out clause states that Member States cannot take on the debts of others , they should not be allowed to profit from those debts either .
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you very much for your assessment of the situation .
However , indicators are not enough .
Of course , it is ultimately a question of humanity , because there really should not be any victims at all .
However , I would like to present briefly the points that are important to the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
We have very similar objectives with regard to climate policy .
There is no mention of protecting the Arctic using targets and standards .
They are a logical continuation of the documents which we adopted last year .
Both types of measures are useful and more valuable if they are implemented at the right time , but they are still awaiting final approval .
The current regulation is aimed in particular at the existing liquidity problems of the five countries affected - Romania , Hungary and the three Baltic states - and is intended , as has already been said , to speed up the absorption of the funds as a result of increased flexibility .
The simplification that everyone here is so much in favour of will mean that large sewage plants and huge waste incinerators will no longer , as is currently the case in the regulation , have to be approved by the Commission when the investment is greater than EUR 25 million , but only when the amount exceeds EUR 50 million .
We will also request a roll-call vote , so that when citizens complain to us at a later date that money has been wasted , we can show them how the Members voted .
Thank you once again for your broad support .
The initial success of this policy was very obvious until 2007 or early 2008 .
In the dairy sector , a fundamental change in policy is needed .
We agree that we urgently need a clear policy statement about how we can regulate markets better in future .
In this context , I would like to propose that in committee , we deliberate formally inviting the institutions we are discussing to the next discharge debate and postponing the debates accordingly if they are not present .
What will not do , however , is the fact that the goal of the accession process is effectively being torpedoed through the back door .
It is much more about handling the EU 's external aid carefully , promptly and as effectively as possible , as well as about detailed documentation and accountability , since it is annoying when projects are not completed on time or there is a lack of clarity about their outcome .
Now we must imagine how , in two years , the European External Action Service may not sit here
