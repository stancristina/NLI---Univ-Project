extension to the Helsinki report that came out a little under a year ago .
The agenda before us is totally acceptable .
For that reason , I hope that non-governmental sporting organisations will continue to be heard after the Olympics meeting in 1999 .
The European Parliament has often expressed its concern with regard to drugs and called for more effective action to counter their use .
It is only natural that the member of the Commission responsible for sports should represent the Union in WADA in the future .
I might also add , on behalf of my group , that we are fully committed to enlargement taking place as soon as possible .
Our group strongly supports constitutionalising the European Union Treaties , and this also means that the reform of the Treaties should be open , with civil society being able to participate in this process .
No doubt in time it will come to form a part of the European Union ' s constitution .
The Nice Summit cannot succeed unless the system of qualified majority voting is extended .
It is very important that the European Parliament is closely involved in the codecision procedure , as , otherwise , it will be even more difficult than before to decide on legislation .
Let us take the example of environment taxation .
President Prodi spoke on the subject of trade policy .
One issue Parliament has had problems with is that we should realise that Parliament ' s size in the future cannot be categorically limited to 700 , as this would also limit the manifestation of pluralism here in Parliament .
This would be a very important position for Parliament to adopt , and we will be able to vote on it tomorrow .
I want to focus on two matters .
My fear is that a rapid armed reaction force will be used more and more often instead of civil crisis management , and more and more rapidly .
Then we will be acting in accordance with priorities and our own philosophy .
It is likely that Russia will often be either party to or otherwise connected with the crises we will one day have to face .
It is also known that President Putin does not take a categorically negative view of these crisis management forces , which I think means there are opportunities for cooperation , and when we know what type of crises we are dealing with , this for me would be an additional factor in achieving a balance in the process as a whole .
The main objective of the reform of the Commission must be a reduction in bureaucracy , increased efficiency and an end to financial confusion .
People in positions of responsibility within the institutions must bear both the legal and financial responsibility for their decisions .
The managers of units and institutions must be given a certain amount of leeway in administration .
Attention should be mainly focused on results , rather than working practice .
An institution and its directors must have clear scope for the best possible administrative practices .
Administrative reform is particularly necessary to improve financial transactions in the European Union .
That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for their successful reports .
In them , attention has been focused on factors that are essential for increased safety at sea .
It is important to tighten up regulations regarding the control of harbours and ports even further , and enhance its effectiveness .
For example , questions of responsibility must be dealt with on a global basis .
For example , for Finland it is vitally important that Russia is included in these agreements .
Mrs Chairman , a series of high-profile ship disasters , particularly involving oil tankers , has hit our continent in the recent past .
Tremendous damage has been caused to nature as well as to the livelihoods of the population living in these areas .
I would like to thank Ms Wallstr√∂m and Ms De Palacio for the action they have taken in the field of maritime safety .
My friends in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism remarked that stricter EU phase-out dates should be adopted .
Presenting new technologies and making improvements to the vessel design are part of this important work .
Madam President , I would strongly urge the case for not removing this report by Mr de Roo from the agenda , as it has been excellently prepared , and we will be preparing to adopt a common position on it next Monday and Tuesday in the final Environment Council of the French Presidency .
There are just 36 amendments , so we really could get through it quite methodically .
I have another request from the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats that the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Peijs on credit institutions be postponed until the January part-session .
I am sorry that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also expressed opinions that the Court ban on tobacco advertising would in some way render this directive null and void .
By no means is that true , as this directive concerns the content of cigarettes and not measures to promote tobacco sales .
Now to the matter of whether the words 'light ' or 'mild ' on brands of tobacco should now be banned .
We must understand that all those countries that have undertaken to draft fairly tough legislation on tobacco have clearly seen deaths from lung cancer and heart and vascular disease brought under control .
Madam President , since the 1970s various Member States have applied the practice of switching to summer time
