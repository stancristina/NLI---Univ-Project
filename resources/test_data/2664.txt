my country , France that bear responsibility for what has happened in Chad .
Mrs Bonino and other Members of the European Parliament will be in Cairo over the next few days in order to defend her and to be with her during her trial .
As Mr Dupuis has just said , her trial will take place next week , but perhaps under international pressure - and I thank Mrs Bonino for having made this appeal , which I myself signed - Egypt will , as we hope , reconsider its decision .
Nobody would be mistaken for thinking that this is an agreement of the heart with this friendly country .
That is why , for my part - and it is my own opinion that I am expressing here and not necessarily that of my group - I think that this resolution is premature and that the situation was conducive to examining the human rights situation with a view to improving conditions in Egypt under the Association Agreement .
Until we adopt a very firm policy towards Pakistan , the Taliban will continue to do what they have been doing for years .
The current situation is difficult .
We are all aware of the logistical support that this country - the People ' s Republic of China - is giving to the Maoist guerrilla movement , a guerrilla movement akin to the Shining Path in Peru .
We must therefore roundly condemn the repression and arrests which followed the death of the king .
The values for which they are fighting are at the other end of the spectrum to the objectives pursued by the former leader of Belgrade .
The compromise reached by Parliament , the Council and the Commission seeks to bridge this gap and to bring an end to the distortion of competition from which the Community is currently suffering .
All the people who have not been consulted and who will not be consulted due to a fear of them voting against are lending them their solidarity .
Lastly , it is an error of moral judgment , because , by upholding the statement made by the General Affairs Council of 11 June 2001 , the GÃ¶teborg Council showed utter contempt for the democratically expressed opinion of a nation , which shows the Europe that it hopes to achieve in a strange light .
The European Parliament believes that the reform can only form part of a constitutional approach .
And I even believe that the changeover to the euro , if we can make a success of this final phase , assumes that we are discussing economic policy as a whole , including monetary policy and , from this perspective , I can only congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Randzio-Plath , the chairperson of Parliament ' s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposals that she has made , and I can only regret some of the votes that were cast in committee .
The litany is long and it does not paint a joyful picture .
It seems , therefore , Mr President , that the citizens of Europe might have to pay a very high price for wanting a single currency when we have different economies , especially since , according to the latest available statistics , it is this , even more than the euro itself , that seems to be contributing to causing greater divergences in terms of both inflation and growth .
First of all , we must improve the guarantees given to the people .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are today faced with a key test on the way that the European Parliament perceives its responsibilities in the area of social protection .
On this point , we think the procedure provides enough flexibility in cases of national emergencies and that the current rate of HIV/AIDS infection in some developing countries constitutes this type of emergency and that intellectual property can also be lifted if a patent is required in cases of public non-commercial use .
We have our own interpretation which we have made clear , but we will not leave the matter there .
This process is beginning to get off the ground although its scope is , in our view , fairly limited at the present time , and it will be the subject of an international initiative , which has , moreover , already been launched by the Secretary-General of the United Nations .
In order to provide a precise answer to your question , Mr Purvis , we believe that there is a strong possibility that the WTO may challenge a marketing ban , if it enters into force .
I am sure you have a good understanding of the risk .
My second point relates to our desire to have some of the WTO rules clarified , in order to allow the European Union to move in the direction that it wishes , and this concerns production methods , for example .
There are risks in what we are doing within the European Union - in some cases , perhaps - with regard to existing laws which are considered to be excessive .
In answer to Mr Berenguer Fuster , I mentioned why the Commission opened proceedings so as to provide Parliament with a more detailed framework .
Your economy turns everything into goods , including the pensioners that you wish to hand over to the finance sharks but , in the same way , it is the working class pensioners who are worn out from working that you are turning into goods , and this is appalling .
When they manage to prove scientifically how a tonne of tomatoes burns all by itself , thereby producing renewable energy , I feel that they certainly will deserve the Nobel Prize .
The Council insisted on including it but this step did not receive unanimous support
