Many people say 'it wo n't happen to me ' until they come across the problem in their own close family or circle of friends .
This battle must be fought on all levels .
For that reason , we in the Socialist Group have also decided to support these organizations and include them in the report .
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is founded on the realization that free trade benefits the world economy and our own economy .
The discriminatory import barriers which we are now discussing were introduced because , if they were given a free choice , consumers would to a large extent prefer to buy bananas from other sources .
But it does not .
The import regulations are very complicated and have given rise to a trade in licences as a result of the extra money consumers are forced to pay .
If we do not follow the WTO 's ruling we will be exposed to costly counter-measures .
I am very pleased that you are positive about carrying out a study on children and how they react to children 's advertisements .
Children should not be a means of making profits .
At least , that is the impression you gave me just now .
The answer which was then given was that a study was under way .
I also think it is important to establish that each Member State has a perfect right to examine each asylum application itself .
We have a legally independent judiciary .
I do not think people will turn this into legal red tape .
What is important is that under these provisions each country has the right to examine an application in accordance with the Geneva Convention .
It was in the Council of Ministers that this was adopted , and it was not at the Commission 's request .
Secondly , an application for asylum made by an EU citizen shall not normally be seen as valid since the Member States shall be regarded , as the protocol states , as 'safe countries of origin' .
In connection with the eastern enlargement , we often discuss questions which concern economics , and on the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment , on which I sit , we also about social rights , etcetera .
Did the countries take it seriously , were they positive and do they intend to do anything about it ?
The applicant countries covered by structured dialogue and with which we have had talks on visits have understood very clearly that we consider it very important that they make sure they get to work on issues such as synthetic drugs .
On the question of our own countries : when we proposed the communication in the spring the idea was that we should put our own European house in order , that is , we in the fifteen Member States should also recognize that we are producers too and make sure that we find solutions .
Some also comes from Russia .
The question is how we are to overcome it .
Since developing countries now have the right to produce freons until the year 2010 , there is perhaps no alternative but to buy them out in one way or another .
Mr President , the other day , the French intellectual Edgar Morin compared Israel 's Prime Minister Netanyahu to the fugitive Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic .
In Israel it is the other way round .
According to the Israeli opposition politician Yossi Sarid , Prime Minister Netanyahu was even in agreement with the latest illegal Jewish acts of colonization in a Palestinian area in Jerusalem .
What would become of Netanyahu , Sharon and the other Israeli 'hawks ' if there were a final peace settlement with a Palestinian state ?
There is also talk of Israel waging a "preventative ' war against Syria .
But in the European Union 's actions there should be no doubt that the main responsibility for the current threat to the peace process lies with the current Israeli Government , not with the Israeli people .
The most important thing now is for the matter to progress .
Development opportunities are what are needed today .
There are well-intentioned proposals to take special groups into account .
There we have in an excellent way been able through competition to allow a small telephone company to take over responsibility for directory enquiry services for all the country 's blind people , and today they have a high level of service .
This is necessary in an insecure world where people are increasingly able to combine different lists , which makes elderly people feel their situation is very insecure .
Nor will it be possible to use the information in such a way without the consumers and users having given their permission .
However , as far as guaranteeing quality and cost levels is concerned , we believe , like the Council and the Commission , that this is a matter for the Member States .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Flemming for her work on this report .
Some of the debate so far has shown , however , that we have quite different views on what an environmental organization actually is .
The citizens ' awareness and ability to participate in the debate are fundamental to democracy .
The benefit should not lie in using environmental organizations to communicate the EU 's policy , but in taking advantage of the experience and views which the organizations themselves possess .
In particular , the criterion of contributing to a multinational approach should be deleted entirely to avoid the suspicion that we are doing this for our own sake .
We know that this will be a great challenge both for the Union and for the environmental sector .
However , I do not believe
