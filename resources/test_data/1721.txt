That way , you will be able to do legally what is currently perceived to be just poor administration on your part .
The Austrian question relates to the Alps but the situation is similar in other mountain ranges such as the Pyrenees too .
We are faced with a boom in freight transport , which will expand even further with enlargement .
Above all , through the amendments we are tabling before the House , we have endeavoured to find a solution which gets away from the ecopoints system , in any case to find a solution for the period stretching from now until 2006 based on the need , as I said , to take into consideration the provisions of the Alpine Convention and , I would say , more generally , the sensitive areas of the Alps .
This is not the case .
I too am convinced that the outcome of the deliberations of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism is the right solution , unlike that presented to us by the Council , and it is a good solution precisely because it reconciles two things which are difficult to reconcile : on the one hand , respect for and enhancement and stepping up of all the efforts to preserve the environment on both sides of the Alps - for there is an Italian side of the Alps as well as an Austrian side - and , on the other , respect for one of the fundamental principles of the European Union , if we really do believe in a European Union , in other words the internal market , the free movement of persons and goods , which are the minimum conditions necessary if there is to be a community of people as well as a community of economic principles .
I urge you strongly to think about that .
I believe that the solution adopted , once again as a transitional measure , by the Caveri report is the best solution possible under the given circumstances .
All this has helped to make the question of the environmental protection of Austria desperate , but we must not forget - and this has never been given any consideration - that there is another side of the Alps , the Italian side , and it will not surprise you to learn that that is where I live .
According to the information we have at the moment , it was Mr Ecclestone himself , who represents the organisation responsible for promoting the Formula 1 championship , who declared publicly that the ban on sponsorship by the tobacco industry in the European Union , which is to come into effect before 2006 , could lead to Formula 1 races being held outside the Union instead .
As regards the specific case of Spa-Francorchamps , the Commission is ascertaining whether Community competition law has been respected .
We have updated a list of projects which are already in difficulties , falling behind schedule , which cannot proceed , but , instead of discovering why they are at a standstill and finding ways and means of speeding up their implementation , we have decided to add to this list and to do so , what is more , with projects which will require a great deal of hard work and commitment .
By critical situation , I am referring to the situation of land transport , Trans-European Networks , sea transport , air transport and transport safety in general .
This strategy is already bringing positive results , but we are still not harnessing the Union 's full potential in terms of growth and innovation .
Of course , this phase of the economic cycle is not helping us , as Mr Yiannitsis said , nor is the current international political situation .
Yet if Europe fails to pull together , all the individual States will disappear from the world scene .
Indeed , I am convinced that the Lisbon Strategy is the best way , even in the current circumstances , to bring our citizens greater prosperity and greater social cohesion .
We must also achieve satisfactory agreements on the Directives on take-over bids , the prospectus and pension funds .
Those objectives , however , cannot be met without far-reaching changes in our societies .
Lastly I feel it is important today to stress our action in the field of education , research and innovation as well .
That means we must invest better and invest more in research and education .
This too is a goal we ourselves set .
This means we must rethink the way we prepare our young people for the labour market and the world of industry , which are growing tougher by the day .
The European economy is still at the starting-post , the necessary reforms are postponed or watered-down at each summit and the hopes of unemployed Europeans of finding work thanks to growth are still closely associated with the revival of the economy of that driving force : the United States .
Despite some timid progress , the basic idea of integrating economic , social and environmental policies has not seen any significant , coherent progress at either Member State or Community level .
Mr President , the fact that my seat is directly opposite yours has not helped me to attract your attention from the start , but never mind .
Mr President , Mr Yiannitsis , Mr Prodi , I have been unable to sleep for several nights ; by not sleeping I cannot dream and this makes it difficult for me to give the explanations of vote which I normally give in this Chamber .
Can we be reassured - and therefore sleep peacefully - that cuts will be made , as is only right , but that this will be done wisely ?
We
