pathway in a common European format , and awarded to students/trainees who have undertaken periods of learning in another Member State ; - a ‘Diploma Supplement’ : attached to a higher education diploma to help third parties to understand the meaning of that diploma ; - a ‘Certificate Supplement’ : attached to a vocational qualification to help third parties to understand its meaning ; - a ‘European Language Portfolio’ : a record of linguistic and cultural skills .
Like the rapporteur , I welcome the extension of the Europass-Training to cover all aspects of education and training .
The programmes aimed at SMEs need an injection of funds but also a change in objectives : they must promote job creation ; support the formation of associations ; support research and training ; provide guarantees for all the critical phases in the life of a start-up company ; improve the geographical spread of support ( broadly concentrated in the countries in the centre of the European Union ) ; and support not just high-technology companies but also traditional and craft enterprises .     . – This Commission proposal suggesting amendments to the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship , in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises , is very important .
The aim of the new Content programme is to make digital content in the European Union more accessible , useable and exploitable , in order to facilitate the creation and diffusion of information and knowledge in areas of public interest at Community level .
Parliament’s amendments neither improve nor help to clarify the Commission ’s proposal .     .
With the events of 11 September 2001 still fresh in our minds , we must not forget the active role played by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism .
In any event , this is the rapporteur’s opinion when he calls for this Agreement to be concluded .
The number of multinational company relocations continues to rise , a phenomenon , which , in Portugal , has already led to thousands of job losses .
The citizens of Europe as a whole , and those in Portugal in particular , demand more rigorous action from the European Union and the credibility of the process depends on reforms being stepped up at Member State level .
Thirdly , this report is ambiguous and implicitly accepts the Commission ’s proposal .
Against this backdrop , the expectations of administrative operators , Member States and the public have resulted in efficiency gains and have led to more ambitious and significant projects .
A common approach to the outermost regions , as provided for in Article 299( 2 ) of the Treaty , is conspicuous by its absence from the Commission ’s proposals .
We know that the outermost regions are , accordingly , the parts of Europe that have the greatest difficulty in making the most of opportunities arising from the great internal market and from the impending enlargement .
I am also pleased that the Cohesion Fund is to be maintained as a support mechanism for major projects in the sectors of transport and the environment in Member States whose GNP is below 90 % of the Community average .
Of course , these projects go hand in hand with the Community regional policy , but the EIB also supports the implementation of the Lisbon neo-liberal agenda .
Given the range of the EIB’s work , information on it should be available in all of the Community’s official languages .     .
This fresh case shows , among other things , how the outsourcing of services by the Commission readily lends itself to such situations .
Freedom of expression , access to information and freedom of employment are all in danger ; this is the logic of business taken to extremes .
This situation has had a genuinely tortuous history , which began last summer .
The resolution on which we voted today concerning the state of human rights and democracy in Pakistan , should be viewed in the context of the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on partnership and development .
The resolution before us reflects the contradictions of current relations between the various countries of the EU and the USA .
Whilst I agree with numerous points in this annual parliamentary report , I must highlight the way in which I believe it is being used , yet again , as a political tool , whereby countries considered ‘friends ’ are protected and others singled out as targets by the USA or by the EU are subject to criticism ; a clear case of double standards .
The report before us is an annual report , which is wide-ranging and addresses a variety of subjects and should be analysed with great care .
I object to the way in which the report has far exceeded its scope .
The fresh trial had been prompted by the 2001 ruling handed down by the European Court of Human Rights , in Strasbourg , which noted the lack of independence and impartiality of the State Security Court , and breaches of the defendants ’ rights , which were to occur again in this second trial .
The report paves the way for the private sector to enter the fields of pensions and health , at a time when over 1.5 million workers in the European Union have swelled the ranks of the unemployed since 2001 , at a time when more and more companies are closing down and others relocating , and when the long-trumpeted upturn is taking its time to appear .
Once the Wall came down , they were able to develop democratically , to share the same cornerstones of the rule of law , democracy and freedom , and to live side by side with us .
Mention has been made here of double standards
