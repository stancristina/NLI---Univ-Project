we have made good progress in establishing some basic rights for consumers .
Adding to this the cross-border perspective of the introduction of the euro , it seemed particularly important to establish a common framework for marketing through these techniques .
As far as information in advance is concerned , the amendments concern information to consumers in advance of concluding a contract and the amendments reject the concept of a right of reflection based on a draft contract as introduced by the proposal for a directive .
Finally , on the general right of withdrawal .
For once I will also praise the work of the Commission service .
When I introduced this directive I told them it would never be approved .
Two fundamental issues have been raised : the need to hold an intergovernmental conference very early in the year 2000 , with a method and timetable to be discussed , and the issue of the constitution , which Mr Verheugen has taken up , as I was delighted to discover this morning .
It must certainly include qualified majority voting , which is not in fact a technical issue , as we all know , but a highly political issue calling into question the sovereignty of the nation states .
That is the point !
First , there is the need to simplify the principles in the Treaty to present clear rules , principles and values to the public , so that they know what we mean when we talk about Europe and Europe 's constitution .
I have two requests to put to the Council .
Madam President , the Treaty of Amsterdam , which can be dubbed the treaty of lost opportunity , only came into force a few days ago and already it needs to have chapters on the institutional issues not resolved in Amsterdam incorporated into it to complete it .
If it wants to be equal to the role it ought to be playing , Europe has got to make up its mind finally to endow itself with a means of determining its own common foreign and security policy .
There must be a definite signal marking the start of an irreversible stage which will lead to the solution the Union needs to operate effectively .
The question is whether we succeed in having a policy which includes the whole continent or whether , through possibly unenlightened choices , we stir up old divisions , create new clashes and open up a kind of trench across the heart of Europe .
I think it is very important that we have spoken with one voice .
Its aims coincide with our established position .
By calling for an the immediate end to the ethnic massacres and the bombing , in the name of the ' European soul' , President-designate Romano Prodi could have taken an influential and balanced role , decisive for the future work of the Commission .
The European Social Fund is certainly the basic Community instrument for applying the four pillars , especially employability , and the regulation we are discussing today is consistent with the objectives of social integration and non-discrimination .
Mr President-in-Office , three thousand Italian citizens are being held up , under the pretext of various orders by the French police , at the frontier between Italy and France to stop them reaching a public , political and European meeting in Paris .
Parliament has had an important voice in defining the guidelines for this reform , but it must have an even more important one throughout the programming period .
We are glad the Council accepted Parliament 's request to restore URBAN as one of the Community initiatives , albeit at the end of the negotiations .
Actually my own country , Italy , is likely to be seriously penalised by the calculation of the Objective 2 ceiling : added to the guaranteed maximum reduction of 33 % there is the reduction caused by the inclusion of the regions coming out of Objective 1 .
In my opinion we must always bear in mind the close relationship between codecision and comitology and now , after Amsterdam , with the power of codecision extended , it is all the more necessary for implementation to be monitored closely and effectively .
At the end of these negotiations we can feel partially satisfied , but I would say very partially , because there is still a great deal to be done .
We are naturally hoping for greater satisfaction on this point in the future , because the European Parliament 's attitude to the issue of monitoring is sure to become increasingly radical and clear-cut .
That is all .
We need to give those entitled the means to carry out surveillance , we need strategies to combat unlawful conduct , and we need to use notification and deletion procedures by means of appropriate electronic instruments .
If I were to seek a leitmotiv running through my modest yet steadfast and devoted work over the fifteen years I have been here , I think I would find it in my determination to help provide Europe , our beloved Europe , with effective instruments to guarantee pluralism of information , protection of creativity , support for the dissemination of European works and new momentum in audiovisual production , making the most out of irrevocable differences between cultures and transforming an apparent weakness into a strength .
I would also like to thank the Commission , which kept its pledge to produce the Green Paper and the White Paper on commerce within the same term of office , making sure that this sector was tackled comprehensively by the institutions .
The final result , although it did not include absolutely all of Parliament 's requests , was very much influenced by the latter through the work of the Committee on Regional Policy , the rapporteurs and the group which conducted the negotiations .
