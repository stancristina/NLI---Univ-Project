on human rights around the world , which , although it contains some points with which we agree , is essentially characterised by an overriding manipulative and reductive view of human rights - political , social , economic and cultural - using them as grounds for interventionism and for exerting political pressure in some countries , always for the EU 's interests and convenience .
I refer to point 10 : ' Reiterates that , in their future Annual Reports on Human Rights , the Council and the Commission should analyse the ways in which human rights are dealt with in other EU policies , such as the Common Foreign and Security Policy , the policies on development and trade and immigration , and other relevant policies relating to the EU 's external relations .. . '
Indeed , an increasing number of countries have removed it from their national law or have established a moratorium on its use .
For this reason , I am not surprised by the bloodthirsty countries that sentence their opponents to death without compunction .
We voted in favour of this resolution on account of its general defence of human rights in the EU Member States , although we do have some criticisms with regard to the wording of one of the points .
Parliament 's annual reports on public finances put forward the same recipe regardless of the economic situation at the time .
This , as we all know , is a political pact , the fruit of the prevailing neoliberal ideology , in which economic justification is just an alibi .
We therefore hope that this text is concluded , ensuring transparent market access conditions without the artificial restrictions that only serve to protect the status quo , in which we are burdened by bureaucracy and in which obstacles are placed in the way of better and more efficient provision of passenger transport for the people .
I voted in favour of the Kaczmarek report on the Horn of Africa : EU political regional partnership for peace , security and development , because I feel it is vital to consolidate the EU 's presence in a region that has been devastated by three major conflicts - in Sudan , Ethiopia/Eritrea and Somalia - and in which a significant proportion of the population , over 22 % , lives below the poverty line .
Imperialism of this kind reinforces the mechanisms of interventionism and militarism , as evidenced by the recent creation of a single US military command for Africa and the installation on the continent of new military bases .
I understand and acknowledge that this is an option with well-documented problems , one that arouses negative reactions , but I feel that nuclear energy should not be ruled out when it comes to the future of energy supply , due to the costs involved , the environmental impact and technological solutions involving the fewest risks .
We therefore register our disappointment that our proposal to support housing cooperatives was not included .
Although the report contains some proposals with which we agree , it neither distances itself from , nor criticises , the neoliberal ' Lisbon ' strategy , with a view to commercialising knowledge , research and education .
There are directives in existence on the worker 's right to information and consultation and on the European Works Councils , which provide for some information to be provided to workers , specifically as regards the development of companies ' economic and social aspects and decisions leading to substantial change in terms of the organisation of work or work contracts .
Firstly , I welcome the retention of a specific programme aimed at preventing and combating violence against children , young people and women , and protecting victims and groups at risk .
Accordingly , we are opposed to the attempts at making the award of resources under future cohesion policy conditional on the implementation of what are known as 'beneficial growth ' policies at national level , such as those forming part of this report .
Parliament has ensured that at least 50 % of budget resources of LIFE+ will be dedicated to project action grants to support the conservation of nature and biodiversity .
I should like to highlight other positive elements such as the EUR 40 million increase in the general budget and the award of 15 % in funds for transnational projects .
This fresh proposal for a directive on environmental quality standards in the area of water policy follows on from the Water Framework Directive , adopted in 2000 .
This will engender dependence , and may serve to deprive workers of production resources given the price of hi-tech equipment .
To tolerate the 0.9 % of GMO contamination proposed by the report would mean accepting GMO contamination of organic products .
The new protocol in place as of 1 January 2007 for a period of six years lays down the fishing opportunities for Community vessels , the financial contribution , the categories of Community vessels that can operate in the Greenland exclusive economic zone and the conditions under which they can operate there .
As such , we support the amendment clarifying this point .
If urban and rural development goes on overlooking nature , our landscape will be dominated by cement and pollution .
I agree that the consequences of climate change will be such that ecosystem services and the specific roles played by the CAP and the CFP should be taken into account , given their importance in meeting targets and in ensuring the long-term existence of biodiversity .
I should also like to highlight the fact that the report states that 'bilateral and regional FTAs ' are a 'sub-optimal ' solution and as such should be launched only when necessary 'to improve the competitive position of EU exporters on crucial foreign markets ' .
