television advertising aimed at children , as this group is particularly susceptible and may have difficulty differentiating advertising from other programming .
Slightly older children can appreciate the differences but not understand the purpose of the advertising .
FÃ¤rm , Hedkvist Petersen , Hans Karlsson ( PSE) , in writing .
Against the background of EU enlargement , it is particularly important that Member States outside the Eurogroup have the opportunity to take part in economic cooperation .
No other country in the world has as many murders of active trade unionists as Colombia .
Criticism can fairly be levelled at the guerrillas for kidnappings and violence against the native population .
Therefore , Colombia ' s government also has direct responsibility for stopping the paramilitaries ' campaign of terror in the country .
The EU' s role must be to uphold human rights , support the peace process and oppose the military escalation of the conflict inherent in Plan Colombia .
If it is not possible for Colombia ' s Left to operate openly and legally , without having its representatives murdered , the guerrillas will not lay down their weapons .
Criticism of this could have been expressed even more clearly in this resolution which we are about to adopt .
Despite the enormous support she enjoys among the Burmese people and the crushing victory she and her party , the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , won in 1990 , she has not been able to take on her leadership role formally .
Representatives of political parties are kept in isolation , thousands of people are in jail for political reasons , dissidents are persecuted and religious and ethnic minorities harassed .
Several prisoners have been released , attitudes towards the NLD have softened and several party offices have been allowed to open .
In anticipation of further signs and surer indications that the junta really would like to enter into dialogue and accept the demands of the NLD , the EU should not however relinquish its common policy .
However , we believe that the directive does not allow patents for genes as such , if they do not contain an invention , and we supported the directive when it was adopted .
We really believe that this is an abuse .
The patent applications which exist , and I have a summary of them here , expressly state that they apply to methods and not to genes as such .
Unfortunately , this is not something that can be dealt with at Community level , but is the responsibility of the Member States .
Madam President , I am rapporteur for the subject of Macedonia which is on tomorrow ' s agenda .
However , the Commission has just informed us that this subject should be withdrawn .
I therefore propose that we withdraw the subject from this part-session and instead address it in the November part-session .
This time , we are debating public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes .
For me as a liberal , it is obvious that the decisions made and the proposals drafted by the public authorities must , as far as possible , be made accessible to anyone interested and affected .
In February of last year , we had the first reading .
Both proposals were broadly supported by Parliament at first reading .
Moreover , it has made a number of changes of its own .
In several cases , the Council adopted a still more prudent approach than Parliament on the issue of OTC derivatives and considered that investments in these had to fulfil more stringent qualitative criteria .
The extension of the Contact Committee ' s powers to include new powers was foreseen in the original proposal .
I do not therefore see any reason to re-open this issue at this juncture .
That is something that no one can want to see happen .
The most contentious issue was that of the capital requirement for management companies .
The compromise finally reached by the Council is , broadly speaking , in line with Parliament ' s stance .
First of all , the compromise reached in Council is a very fragile one , and it would not serve anybody ' s interests to open the Pandora' s box of detailed , technical or politically sensitive amendments .
There are nonetheless certain unresolved issues .
A 'grandfather ' clause is also proposed , whereby existing funds should not have to comply with the new legislation for a transitional period .
In this way , it will be possible to introduce the UCITS directive into the Member States by 2005 , that is to say the year in which the financial action plan is to be implemented .
There is now a good balance between a well-functioning market and reasonably secure protection for consumers .
I want to end by thanking everyone involved : the Commissioner , his efficient and friendly colleagues and my fellow MEPs who have all really shown willing during this difficult period .
( Parliament agreed to urgent procedure ) Proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the separate customs territory of Chinese Taipei ( Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen and Matsu ) to the World Trade Organisation [COM(2001 ) 518 - C5-0488/01 - 2001/0216(CNS) ]
At the same time , the birth rate is falling dramatically .
The most important thing is perhaps to ensure that European women and men can combine professional life with having a family and children .
Precarious and low-paid jobs which require little in the way of qualifications and in which women are over-represented at present are hardly going to attract women .
Quality , which is the recurring theme in the guidelines for the year 2000 , must also apply to work done by women
