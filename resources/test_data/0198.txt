The proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as 'ultra light ' and 'low tar ' .
People have been hooked on the idea that 'mild ' and 'low tar ' cigarettes are healthier .
This is simply not true .
Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes .
This legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives .
Mr President , on a point of order .
Many friends and women who are colleagues in this Parliament have just pointed out that my name appears as one of those who signed against women 's rights .
I want to put on record that I am not against women 's rights .
I have always supported women 's rights .
It must be an error .
Sometimes colleagues bring petitions from delegations and we sign them .
I am sorry about that .
Mr President , I have two short minutes in which to make four points .
Firstly I would like to join in the warm congratulations to Commissioner Lamy and indeed his distinguished predecessor Sir Leon , now Lord , Brittan .
I hope the brevity of my congratulations does not diminish the warmth of them .
Secondly , a point addressed to the Council .
The Council 's attitude towards parliamentary assent to a deal like this is linked to the Council 's parallel attitude towards the Commission 's proposal for its extension of its own powers over areas such as intellectual property and services in Article 133 more generally .
I have to confess I get the impression that there is a certain degree of institutional territoriality here , particularly in the large Member States , where the trade and industry ministries are very reluctant to see the Commission continue to extend its scope in those new areas in WTO trade negotiations and , consistent with that , also reluctant to see the European Parliament increase its influence .
This simply cannot carry on .
It is such a weird anachronism that a policy that was communautarised back in the 1950s is as unaccountable and non-transparent as it is .
I would plead for the internal territorial interests of Member States to be overcome on this particular point .
Thirdly , technical assistance .
It is great that we are going to coordinate with the Americans , but look at the numbers : EUR 25 million is absolutely nothing in comparison to the challenge we face !
We have a total budget for China of EUR 80 million .
Even if we allocate all of that to China-WTO accession it would still not be enough .
We - the Commission , Council and Parliament - have to be a lot more ambitious in actually allocating much more money towards this enormous task .
Finally , human rights .
I hope the fact that we have signed up to this bilateral deal with the Chinese does not leave them thinking that we are going to be any more forgiving on human rights .
It is all the more important that all three institutions should now be particularly robust about the way the Chinese behave in the so-called dialogue on human rights .
Let us not give them the impression that a deal on the WTO means that we are going to be weak on human rights - it should be the reverse .
We should be all the more robust .
Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate Commissioner Lamy on securing such improved terms and a deal with China .
After such a long history of negotiations clearly all that was needed was the question from our committee to push the matter to a conclusion .
Recently I was visiting Taiwan where people clearly hope that the accession of China to the WTO will lead to improved cross-strait relations , and we must welcome that .
I would have referred to Commissioner Patten knowing well the difficulties of dealing and negotiating with China , but he has already mentioned that .
The prospect of a change in the duty on spirits from 65 % to 10 % will be a most welcome one in certain parts of the whisky-producing areas of the UK.
I look forward to sharing that news with them in liberal and liquid fashion .
On a larger scale the position achieved in access to , and faster opening up of , the telecoms market is also good news .
China has such huge potential in this market for growth , and European operators have a great opportunity as world leaders looking for new markets .
I welcome this step in the further integration of China into the world economy but we must recall the emphasis that we , in the European Union , place upon other values in addition to trade .
In that context I would like to call , on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues , for European Parliament participation in the half-yearly dialogue on human rights .
If this Parliament were part of that dialogue we might exert additional pressure for improvement in that field .
I hope the Commissioner will listen carefully to that suggestion .
Mr President , while international big business is busy popping champagne corks in celebration of the agreement on China 's proposed accession to the WTO , China 's small-scale farmers are already quaking in their shoes .
They know that accession to the WTO will be a very mixed blessing for China and that for them , as small farmers , it could spell ruin .
So I beg to differ with Commissioner Patten .
There are many people in China for whom this agreement does not spell good news .
Powerful international agri-business knows that too .
That is why US grain companies like Cargill cannot believe their luck .
They have just been handed the biggest market in the world and can expect US
