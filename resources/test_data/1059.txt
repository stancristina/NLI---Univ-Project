The Council has the opportunity to avoid responsibility for situations such as those which arise in my country , where more than 400 drivers lose their lives every year , without distinguishing between self-employed and salaried workers .
If we really want road safety and the health and safety of workers , it makes little difference whether they are self-employed or salaried .
It should do so if it wants to protect jobs and companies and , if it wants , in summary , the directive that we deserve in the 21st Century .
And the second paragraph of this Article says , ' Every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours , to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave ' .
In 2000 , a modification of the general directive on the organisation of certain aspects of working time was adopted , Directive 93/104/EC , in order to incorporate mobile and non-mobile workers in the transport sector .
There is no need to remind you of the long discussions in Council , which ended with a common position on a compromise accepted by all the States , all the delegations present , and which , of course , I myself accept on behalf of the Commission .
I will refer to a series of amendments , which will be listed specifically tomorrow , which I cannot accept at the moment , although I agree with their content .
I am doing so for safety reasons ; although I fully share this concern , I have a commitment to the Council which I must respect , but you know that you can rely on me to try to seek solutions during the conciliation debates , the final result of which I hope will be as positive as we all wish .
This does not alter the fact that the immense majority of journeys take place safely , effectively and in a way which respects the environment .
For that we have the Commission , the Council and a whole range of organisations .
Greek justice is taking action .
We are not prepared to accept this .
We can also accept Amendments Nos 14 and 10 , which clarify the mandate of the principal directors of this body .
Nor can I accept Amendments Nos 8 and 12 , which imply that it is not necessary for the Commission to approve the Agency ' s programme , nor Amendments Nos 13 and 25 , according to which the decision to make visits to the Member States should depend on a Commission opinion , rather than on its agreement .
Supervising the implementation of the Community acquis will remain the responsibility of the Commission and the Agency cannot replace us in this task .
I am also prepared for us to also make some regional proposals in the event that existing Conventions are not ratified by a sufficient number of States that are members of the IMO.
Nevertheless , given the current situation , requiring shipowners to participate in compensation for damages would contravene the current international rules and we are therefore unable to accept such a proposal .
They are Nos 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 10 , 11 , 20 , 30 , 32 , 33 , and from 43 to 49 .
Under which Community funds will the new Restructuring Plan be financed ?
In Andalusia , there is enormous concern about this issue .
But my question has a different aim .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think we can say that none of us would like to continue to hear that every year in the European Union 500 000 falls from height are recorded , out of which 300 000 result in sick leave of more than 3 days , 4 000 involve serious injuries and 1 000 are fatal .
Perhaps we should not establish a hierarchy , as we would obviously put the employers first , but the workers themselves must always have the necessary awareness and training to take on the risk , accept the risk and know how to respect it .
The issue of self-employed workers still has to be dealt with , as has been pointed out , and the Council and the Commission plan to issue a joint declaration expressing their desire to find a valid solution for all those involved in preparing , carrying out and completing temporary work at height .
However , it is , without doubt , also due to something else which is the lack of transparency in the oil markets .
However we can say , in any case , that our options for energy policy should be focused on controlling demand , both in terms of oil and the other energy sources .
What we plan is , as part of the Green Paper that is being discussed in Parliament , a series of energy saving measures .
All this has led us to engage in a debate , an overall , systematic and comprehensive discussion through the proposals put forward in our Green Paper .
And , as it says in Amendment No 7 , and I quote , " the scientific justification for laying down new conditions is based on the situations obtaining in the northern European countries " .
We are not talking about our aid , but about elements associated with the introduction of a market economy .
Last year , the funding was 50-50 .
I would also like to stress that , when we implement this assistance , we not only insist on establishing a stable economic framework , but also on policies being created that are aimed at achieving economic stability .
There is a series of amendments which , in my opinion , are mistaken in their understanding of the
