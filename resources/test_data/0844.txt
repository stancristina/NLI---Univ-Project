not ratified the EU Convention on corruption in the public sector - which could give rise to situations of objective legal uncertainty .
Although we believe that there is a need for legislation that punishes the types of crime we are discussing - corruption in both the public and private sectors - the issue requires more extensive study in order to prevent the adoption of vague and indeterminate concepts , non-observance of the principle of subsidiarity , the risk of obstacles to fundamental freedoms or distortions of competition and even the use of different legal approaches to the two types of crime in question .
It should be added that the European Commission is getting ready to present an initiative in the form of a communication to this end .
Changes introduced by the rapporteur , Mr Ribeiro e Castro , have improved on the initial proposal .
Hence this proposal for a decision , which is intended to update and improve cooperation in this field and to be legally binding on the Member States , unlike the Joint Action of 1996 .
It would be more useful , then , for the European institutions to focus their concerns on the myriad police organisations already in place , created under the Maastricht and Schengen agreements and which operate without any democratic control or monitoring and which constitute serious breaches of the citizens ' rights and freedoms and of the sovereignty of the Member States themselves .
The proposals for amendments that I tabled , with the support of the specialist parliamentary committee , are all intended to increase the effectiveness of the mechanisms for cooperation and shared use between police liaison officers , whilst at the same time attempting to remedy various shortcomings , specifically in the following areas : guaranteeing fundamental rights in the field of data protection , the regular monitoring of the liaison officer system , through annual reports and the study of these reports ; similar treatment for Europol 's liaison officers and , lastly , funding .
Nevertheless , despite the consequences , I believe that stepping up the fight against illegal fishing is a priority that everyone accepts .
I am therefore , in favour of new control measures at Community level , specifically through : clearer marking and identification of vessels , compliance with the rules , to be monitored by regional organisations , dissuasive and uniform sanctions .
I therefore prefer the European Commission 's original position to that produced by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
The new proposal for a directive therefore seeks to establish , in terms which are in accordance with the EC Treaty , a less restrictive framework , with new objectives for public health protection , in the conviction that tobacco is a product that is harmful to health , that deterrence from its consumption must be promoted , particularly where younger people are concerned .
The Citizens of the European Union have the right to expect the Union to effectively confront the problem of increasing threats of crime , which does not recognise borders and which attacks their freedom and their rights .
This matter has come to be regulated by two acts of differing legal value , because Joint Action 98/699/JHA has not been revoked .
( PT ) As the rapporteur points out , one of the most effective instruments for combating organised crime is the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of illegal activities , particularly when such proceeds are destined for laundering .
Mr President , as you all know , I was the original rapporteur for this report .
Nor do they discuss a budget for a reform of such importance , but uphold the principle of relative stability , which is now discriminatory and grants privileges , because it was established when the EU had only six or nine Members .
( PT ) The Souchet report is quite positive and warrants our support .
.
This is precisely where our main concerns lie .
Mr President , I should like to say the following : this Council position on social dialogue is contradictory .
What measures are you intending to adopt to ensure that priority is given to social issues , specifically in the field of employment , social inclusion , equal rights and opportunities and compliance with the social agenda in general ?
We regret that most of these proposals have not been accepted , although we welcome the fact that some important ideas have been adopted , specifically on the restriction of derogations , enshrining the application of the principle of non-discrimination from day one with the removal of the six-week derogation , thereby guaranteeing some rights in the field of the information and participation of temporary workers and their not being used to break a strike .
We therefore hope that you will support our proposals and reject all those that will , in practice , create greater instability and damage the rights of temporary workers who , in most cases , only resort to taking this type of work when they cannot find permanent employment .
The basic premise is to extend , at Community level , the principle of non-discrimination between temporary and other workers .
This represents a genuine sea change .
Biotechnologies are part of the technologies of the future .
This classical humanism must inspire contemporary science and all citizens .
Nevertheless , the Lisbon Summit outlined an ambitious target for the EU for the forthcoming decade : to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world .
In fact , the action plan and the strategy presented by the Commission resolve , with one wave of a magic wand , the diffuse nature , the incoherence and the shortcomings of the legal framework and of European policies in the field of biotechnologies
