their confidence in the EU and its institutions .
To promote that research is to reduce suffering .     Unlike the Commission , the European Parliament pronounces itself in favour of compensation based upon each accident rather than upon each injured person .
For that reason , I have voted against the European Parliament’s position and , instead , supported the Commission ’s line .     We welcome more efficient administration of the Structural Funds .
Unfortunately , the Brok report is permeated by traditional over-confidence in military interventions as the only way of bringing about peace .
The European Parliament should also strongly support the promising talks now under way between the Beijing Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama .
It is true that new threats and security risks must be combated , above all , by means of political strategies with a view to fighting poverty , protecting human rights and promoting democracy .
Nor do I support increased cooperation within defence policy , which I believe should be subject to decisions on a unanimous basis .
It is the EU’s task to prevent wars , not to make plans for conducting wars .
It is a quite specific conflict , but there are nonetheless many parallels .
We see in many quarters how great powers come into conflict with population groups with different national identities .
Historically , we have a lot of experience of conflicts of this type .
Political solutions have to be sought .
How , in practical terms , the particular conflict is then to be resolved is something the parties must discuss and agree about .
It is not possible for Moscow to dictate solutions .
According to Amnesty International , a total of 1 526 people were executed in these 31 countries , and 3 284 people were condemned to death in 67 countries .
It is nonetheless deeply tragic to have to place the democratic United States on the same list as the two dictatorships .
I do not in actual fact believe , Mr President , that many Americans are aware that the United States does not fulfil the requirements for becoming a member of the EU , and I am convinced that the United States should be influenced to change its attitude .
Might the American people be less humane than ourselves ?
I believe that a very clear approach is required in this area .
The death penalty must be abolished .
My follow-up question to Mr  Frattini is about the way in which the Council Presidency views the fact that more and more countries ’ governments and parliaments have now said that they wish to hold referendums on the draft European Constitution .
Do you take a positive view of this development ?
Mr Burg is now appealing to Israel’s friends to intervene .
Parliament has on several occasions requested us to suspend the association agreement .
My country has avoided occupation , but many of the rest of you live in countries in which people have risen up in resistance to occupation .
That is why we must intervene .
It would be the EU’s first big test as to whether this military capacity is to be used for good or for something else .
This may be seen from the Minutes , and it is the view I take .     Mr President , I appreciate the Commission ’s proposed recovery plan for depleted cod stocks .
As we heard earlier , the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ( ICES ) will tomorrow present its annual report on the fish stocks in our oceans .
Even though I am satisfied with the Commission ’s proposal and believe that it is a move in the right direction , I should also like to have seen the Baltic Sea included , because we know that cod stocks are just as threatened there .
It is completely ignoring the scientific advice and states that the catch is 45 % larger than what international advisers claim .
In the Baltic Sea , we could have fished three times as much as we are doing today .
If the railway issues were handled within the Commission , consideration of these matters could be phased out when it was no longer relevant .
An agency is more difficult to close down , partly because of its symbolic value for the host country .
We also wish to emphasise that we are able to support the establishment of a border administration authority but that we do not wish to see any operational structure or any other form of operative cooperation .     The report is good in many respects .
At the same time , there are things in the report that we cannot accept .
Paragraph 26 states ‘that the joint costs of ESDP operations , including those of a military nature , must be financed through the Community budget’ .
We European Christian Democrats in the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats voted against the proposal ( now adopted by 191 votes in favour , 179 votes against and 39 abstentions ) in paragraph 66 , concerning ‘an international mandate in Palestine , including an international force on the ground’ .
That is to miss the point .
We wish , however , to emphasise that we are opposed to the harmonisation of income tax .
In spite of everything , industry is the backbone of the European economy .
I believe that those present in the House are representative .
I am especially pleased about the target of approximately ten per cent for efforts within the environmental area .
We then have the controversy as to whether there should be one or two regulations for Asia and Latin America .
I am not convinced by the argument that the countries are , apparently , so different .
