ladies and gentlemen , following many legislative initiatives , recommendations and studies , the European Commission has promoted a thematic strategy for soil protection .
As a thematic strategy it intends to implement a scientific policy and carry out much more firm , consistent and coherent work than has been done until now .
I would urge the Commission to develop the draft INSPIRE Directive for the establishment of an infrastructure for a European area of information , which is essential as an instrument for developing these areas and which , at the time , was approved by three Directorate-Generals .
I believe that Parliament must continue to insist on relating water to desertification , the problems of the aquifers , the need to provide new resources , the need to look after these climatic spaces and the advance of the desert .
The problems of identification in this type of livestock are very significant ; the movement of livestock which can take place within one year , which has an enormous influence on the problems of traceability , or the way in which the lives of this type of livestock are spent , which hinders adequate registration and identification by means of the current systems .
The report we will vote on tomorrow contains two compromise amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture , which respect the interests of the European Union 's producers .
To put it clearly , what you want is for the text not to be touched .
With regard to the issues which you have pointed out and which were dealt with yesterday , the Foreign Minister must be a member and Vice-President of the Commission .
I believe we should protest and demonstrate our indignation very clearly to Ecofin , which has taken ten years to accept the Delors plan for infrastructures .
I believe that we should show the minimum of coherence .
Ecofin’s proposals destroy the balance achieved in the Convention , and the European Parliament , knowing this , accepted a formalisation of the financial perspectives in the Constitution , restricting its own budgetary powers , because its power to reject the multiannual framework and to be able to decide against the Council 's position by a very high majority of its Members , in the event of a disagreement in relation to the annual budgetary procedure , was recognised .
My political group calls for the whole of the finance chapter of the draft Constitution to be taken as an indivisible and non-negotiable whole .     Mr President , since I am in agreement with the comments made by Members from my group and several other groups , I wished to use my one minute of this interesting debate to draw attention , like Commissioners Vitorino and Barnier , to a specific issue : the risk of returning to unanimity on such a sensitive issue as judicial and police cooperation on criminal matters .
I am referring to Libya , where I recently had the opportunity to chair a delegation from my parliamentary group .
Within this context , the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers Conference in Naples is going to conclude an objective which has long been pursued by this Parliament , which is the transformation of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum into a genuine assembly .
Finally , Mr President , I believe we must not forget countries which are not part of the Barcelona process – I am referring to Libya and Mauritania .
We should create positive dynamics which could have an effect in economic terms , introducing concepts such as ‘mobility’ , which is more suited to our times than the rigid and bureaucratic rules with which we intend to manage immigration .
As chairman of the Mediterranean Committee of the European League for Economic Cooperation , for years I have been analysing the economic causes of the backwardness of the third countries of the Mediterranean in order to eliminate the imbalances with the European Union .
Whatever is needed and more .
Twelve new countries are going to join ; we also have Turkey and others will join in the future .
I would like – also with regard to this issue – to table a supplementary question , since when there has been a situation of insufficient respect for rights , you have quite rightly acted as the Council in relation to Cuba , but nevertheless , in relation to this other very serious violation of the rights of families , the Council has taken no action .
In this regard , I would like to stress that we cannot treat seafaring workers as second-class workers .
My supplementary question ...     Within the meaning of the Rules of Procedure I have the right to put it .
The signature of agreements is an arguable issue and it would be good if on the basis of the discussion which has just taken place the compromise solution could be reached which would indicate that the European Union is not prepared to accept any agreement unless certain conditions are met .
We believe that we must offer effective help , that the current financial support is insufficient and that therefore we should review the financial perspectives , in order to provide more resources to assist the region in the necessary manner .
Mr President , Commissioner , today we are going to vote on three more reports from the package of seven .
With regard to the conciliation of 24 November , the fundamental issues to be negotiated are going to be , firstly , the financial contribution for each programme , their duration and the application of degressivity – which has already been mentioned – but , above all , it is the issue of the application of the pre-allocation in what we call ear-marking which will undoubtedly be the main stumbling block , Commissioner
