their own the consequences they risk entailing should their young female workers get pregnant ?
This is a question of credibility , that is , a question of European institutions in future being required to comply with the same legal deadlines as everybody else .
However , there are other important changes which have occurred in the meantime .
I also dare to hope that this House will not overplay its hand , as the English sometimes say .
Meanwhile , Member States of the EU have been the largest direct foreign investors in Ukraine since 1991 .
I can look the people of this Foundation in the eye because we are also talking about this issue here , demonstrating commitment .
Commissioner , I would in particular like to wish you much success and perseverance in your efforts to bring Moldova closer to Europe .
In the context of the social dialogue - the European social dialogue in the port sector - the Commission could also broach the subject and propose solutions such as new procedures for loading containers or modified training .
We were too late to hand it in , but it has been discussed with a number of Members .
We recognize that the agenda is very full .
I understand the French Government 's motives for trying to mediate .
For the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party sustainable development means a situation in which the natural raw materials are so used that future generations can also make use of them in the same way .
That should be encouraged in the framework of SAVE II .
CO2 emissions are a cross-border problem and require a European approach .
Recent research has shown that the Union has a leading position in the field of environmental and non-nuclear energy technologies .
What is the result of all that ?
I sincerely hope that the approach of the Commission and Parliament will still be apparent in the directive which eventually comes into force .
Mr President , it is vitally important for our future that we should change our transport system .
One definite necessity is the adaptation of the railway systems so that they can actually use one another 's track and can actually be interoperable .
The existence side by side of the different high-speed train systems , which are only minimally interoperable , makes it harder for carriers to provide over long international routes a service which can compete with air transport because train-units must be made suitable for various systems and will thus be more expensive or because there must be a change of locomotives .
Apart from that there is every reason for adopting measures quickly in order to improve traditional goods transport by rail .
We wish to give the Member States discretion to adopt special rules for transport operations of local significance - I stress local significance - for example transport by narrow-gauge , dock or mountain railways , naturally subject to due regard for Community law and on condition that such rules are not contrary to freedom of movement .
How does the Commissioner think of applying the concept of 'tunnels with characteristics similar to the Channel Tunnel ' ?
Because we are living in a very densely populated part of the world .
It appears from various sources that the introduction of free movement has led to a sharp increase in the incidence and scale of fraud in the export , import and transfer of goods , so we now need to focus our efforts on taking adequate measures to combat fraud .
First and foremost , there is the importance of medical progress .
Finally , the innovative pharmaceutical sector is one of the leading generators of employment .
You can well imagine that sums like this can only be generated by companies with sufficient cashflow throughout the ten years which it takes to develop a new product .
We need to allow products to be developed and marketed as soon as possible , so that production costs can be recouped as quickly as possible .
The rapporteur , myself and others who support this report have been deluged by postcards from Sweden telling us to stand up for liberalization , but whether we are in favour of it or not , there is absolutely no question of standing up for liberalization here .
What this means is that drugs are not only still available , they are becoming increasingly available .
Some people here maintain that methadone treatment , needle exchanges , help centres and sensible primary prevention all actually pave the way to addiction and simply encourage drug-taking .
How can you help addicts to give them up ?
Making addiction a crime also does not work .
Mr President , within every political group in the House there is a majority view and a minority view on the action programme on the prevention of drug dependence .
I am pleased to see that there are a number of amendments which adopt this line in calling for disinfection sets and sterile syringes and needles to be provided in order to combat infectious diseases such as AIDS .
I therefore also oppose the amendments which aim to have harm-reduction adopted as a strategy .
Mr President , the discharge for the 1992 budget has caused something of a stir .
Finally , there was the failure to recover ECU 170 m from Spain for the nonapplication of milk quotas in 1989 .
First the Agriculture Commissioner says he is surprised at the Netherlands ' decision to destroy 60 000 calves , then a few days later we read in the newspaper that the Commission is contributing HFL 20 m towards this measure , which it has itself already condemned as unnecessary and unwarranted .
I think this is an extremely serious matter which undermines the credibility of the entire Commission
