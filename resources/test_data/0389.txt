whole Charter and nothing but the Charter , and therefore an article-by-article , State-by-State analysis .
This commitment must confirm compliance with democratic values and human rights as laid down , amongst others , by the Constitutions and national legislation , as well as by the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950 , which protects in particular freedom of conscience and religion , and prohibits any form of discrimination on the grounds of religion , sex or race .
The legitimate fight for respect for human rights must not be confused with unhealthy fantasies to the detriment of the common good .
Against whom and against what ?
We can move freely .
In financial terms , you would like to emulate the system currently in use in the United States .
The answer to these challenges lies in the new economy of ageing , in inventing a new human planning sector with new diplomas for geriatric assistants and new branches of medicine and associated professions .
I am sure it will be adopted tomorrow , by a strong majority of Parliament , following the proposal of Mr Galeote .
This is especially true in southern Lebanon , where problems of borders with Israel have not been solved .
I remain more than sceptical , however , as to the positive effects of creating a free-trade zone .
We call for strict respect for the freedom of the press , in all its forms , moreover , in particular for journalists or other media that criticise government policy .
A peaceful State means an end to the repression , also mentioned by other speakers , practised against students , political dissidents , and Christians in particular .
Does the European Union currently have a fully credible partner ?
In order to prevent the democratic clause from being nothing more than a dead letter , it is vital to establish mechanisms for the regular monitoring and assessment of its implementation , from the very entry into force of the agreement , in partnership with the NGOs that are close to daily reality .
These principles of additionality , conditionality and impact on transition are the real foundations of the institution .
We act as a lever for implementing these measures and we ensure that we work with the banking sector to improve its competence by training bankers to develop these techniques .
Improving the quality of life of the population , drinking water , transport and municipal services as a whole are part of charging policies .
We welcome the necessary increase in its contributions , particularly to acceding countries .
There is also the capacity to take risks , to evolve in an unstable environment and to provide funding for essential projects , including during times of crisis , as you demonstrated during the Russian crisis .
First of all , should the original political objective not be renewed ?
The first is in response to Mr Blak .
That leads me on to a point that is very important to us , the dialogue with all of the governments and authorities in the region .
Certain fish-farming activities are indeed very often seen as polluting or are thought to harm the environment .
It is intolerable that oyster farmers should once again be victims of inadequate maritime safety and of the dumping of hydrocarbons onto our coasts .
At a time when estimates suggest a considerable increase in the demand for fish and when one of the objectives must be the balanced management of fisheries stocks , aquaculture has a genuine supplementary role to play in supplying the markets .
It is quite clear that , in such cases , public funding cannot be equated with a distortion of competition .
Certainly , fish are used to feed other fish .
I believe that a sound European policy is one which is open to Lebanon , certainly , but that , at the end of the day , Europe 's place is beside Israel .
Indeed , even if its objective is to develop the market economy in these former Communist countries , the social , environmental and public service dimensions have not been sacrificed .
If we receive President Putin , we must do something for the minister of health who has returned to Baku and whose visa has been taken away , for Ahmed Zakayev , to whom I spoke yesterday on the telephone and who is still under house arrest in the United Kingdom or , again , for the foreign affairs minister held without a visa in the United States .
We are combining everything under the heading of terrorism .
Still others are doing their utmost to find passages in Dr Blix 's report to take out of context in order to try to justify military intervention .
( Applause ) Mr Blair and Mr Aznar are isolated in their own countries over the question of war .
Personally , I would like to make a suggestion .
What did we do ?
Is anyone suggesting military intervention ?
At the same time , let us try to obtain negotiations with the Middle East .
Why was the alleged need to disarm Iraq not brought to light before the election of Bush junior ?
I believe we should , and you are probably doing this , inform the Iraqi opposition by all possible and imaginable means that , of course , Saddam Hussein must respond to the questions of the UN inspectors , but that if changes were to take place in Iraq , we could help them by lifting the embargo , solely , of course , on non-military goods .
Lest we be accused of anti-Americanism , I would recall what was written by Scott Ritter , an American citizen and member of the first inspection mission halted in 1998 by a first , or second , or third American war .
