Union - and I am speaking of Greece in particular - are indeed considered to be expendable resources and their health and their lives are being sacrificed by big business to the quest for maximum profit .
Imagine what is happening in the European Union as a whole .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , the work carried out by the rapporteur , Mr Sterckx , whom I should like to congratulate , and by all the rest of us in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has demonstrated that the problem we are examining , safety at sea , is a complex , difficult issue with numerous aspects .
Tax incentives for returning ships to Member States ' flags are also a particularly important factor , because in this way we can limit the number of ships sailing under flags of convenience .
Before moving on to the measures which we propose for the future , we note that there is a problem in numerous countries when it comes to respecting Community legislation .
For example , there is a problem with the disposal of waste in ports .
Here too , the Member States do not appear to be complying directly with requirements which they themselves set .
The Council called for us to proceed in this direction and it would appear that the Council is going to come along shortly and say to our rapporteur , Mr Pex , that it is not prepared to discuss this sort of regulation .
First , because we have already examined the question of the Prestige .
It is not officially called a committee of inquiry .
If we keep on insisting on the issue of the Prestige , we shall simply transfer the internal Spanish dispute to Brussels and Strasbourg .
The particular issue of oil and natural gas reserves which we are examining here cannot resolve the overall problem , especially when it is addressed within the framework of the liberalisation of the market , rather than with the satisfaction of grass-roots needs as the criterion .
It is , however , more than clear that the sine qua non to such energy planning is a radically different social and economic framework .
Then it would have greater validity and greater weight .
I am still having trouble understanding how an economist with Mr Trichet 's immense experience could maintain that , in times of protracted economic stagnation , increasing public spending may damage the recovery of the economy .
Nonetheless , I hope that he will be forced by events to take a different attitude and stance because the central bankers cannot use their stance to say , as Mr Lipietz said , 'après moi le déluge ' , [after me the deluge ] nor can they say 'avant moi le déluge , pendant moi le déluge , et après moi Dieu nous sauve ' [before me the deluge , for the duration of my reign the deluge and after me , may God help us] .
Consequently , I think that we are voting for something which contradicts the Treaties and the Rules of Procedure .
( EL ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution , which makes provision for a series of important measures for safety at sea , such as : the creation of refuges for ships in distress , the creation of a European coastguard for strict monitoring , compliance with rules and prosecution of persons responsible , frequent surveys of high-risk ships , the creation of a special anti-pollution fleet , the creation of special zones for ecologically sensitive areas .
That is why there are funds which have not yet been paid to the Member States and that is creating a problem both with the Community budget and , of course , with the national budgets .
By contrast , there are more positive developments in the new programming period from 2000 to 2006 , although here too , of course , we must be very , very careful .
These , broadly speaking , are also the reasons why , in our committee at least , we propose to return essentially to the preliminary draft budget initially submitted by the Commission as far as category II of the budget is concerned .
The fact that the headquarters of this agency have not been decided should not lead us to conclude that we should also not fund it .
They are demographics , longer life expectancy , the new working models and the new family models .
The second concerned adequate pensions , meaning a dignified standard of living for pensioners , which is something Mr Andersson insists on in his report .
It is clear , on the one hand , that it is important and necessary to change the age limit , for reasons of sustainability and , on the other hand , that this cannot be done on its own , without flanking employment policies which will help elderly workers to remain in the labour market , because today , due to the culture which exists in the labour market , the reality which has existed for many years , it is very difficult for elderly workers over 55 years of age to find work easily .
Finally , we are constantly monitoring the indicators to which we committed in Barcelona and we have agreed on the need to increase the actual retirement age by five years by 2010 .
Two more points : the issue of enlargement , on which we have constant communication with the Member States , so that they can also integrate the issue of mobility .
On the pretext of the ageing population , it is promoting an increase in the retirement age , an extension of working life , cutbacks in pensions , the dissociation of pensions and wages and increased financial contributions by workers .
