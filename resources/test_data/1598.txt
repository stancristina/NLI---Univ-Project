this legislation , it will only make the scheme even more unacceptable for businesses .
The Council is now saying that the Commission can both be and not be at the same time .
We urge the national parliaments themselves to select the person who is to represent their country in the European Commission .
The Danish member should not be the EU 's agent with regard to the Danes , but the Danish electorate 's representative in the EU , and besides : 1 000 committees , 10 000 different laws and 100 000 projects are far too much to be controlled from Brussels .
Put the EU on a diet , and give greater freedom to democracy in our countries !
Madam President , I agree with Mrs Pack .
I would like to say something about the Commission and the problems there have been , and about the criticism that has been levelled .
I would like to emphasise that the Council itself bears a huge responsibility for the fact that things went so wrong .
It was the Council which , only this March , disregarded Parliament and approved the accounts for 1997 , on the very day when the report from the five experts made it clear that the accounts should not have been approved and that Parliament was right .
It is the Council which is now largely responsible for the profoundly obsolete and rigid Staff Regulations .
It is the Council which now has the opportunity to insist that these proposals are carried out to the letter , together with the SEM 2000 and MAP 2000 reform plans , which are sorely needed .
It is only the Council which can abolish the national and geographic quotas in the recruitment policy , so that in future we can recruit the best candidate in every situation .
It is the Council which must ensure that the principle of subsidiarity becomes more than just idle talk .
Instead of this , unfortunately , the Council ended up diluting the sorely needed agricultural reforms , on which there had usually been a consensus at ministerial level .
Mr President-in-Office , I hope that you take all this along with you to your - hopefully fruitful - meeting this afternoon with the new President of the Commission .
In conclusion , I would like to thank you for your resolute stance on the question of Kosovo .
Mr President , the abiding images of the systematic ethnic cleansing in Kosovo are yet more sad proof of the fact that we are living in the bloodiest century in world history .
At the same time they were able , under cover of the peace talks , to continue with the cleansing of the Kosovar Albanians .
At that time 60 000 Kosovar Albanians were in flight , and over the past year several hundred thousand have already been forced to flee .
Milosevic was not unaware that this could be the consequence .
Now he should negotiate , but the bombing will continue until he comes to the negotiating table .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to thank the two rapporteurs , who have produced a well-balanced report which provides an excellent description of the situation .
They say that 'it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good' , and this also applies here , because BSE was in fact the reason why we had the clear-out in the Commission .
BSE was the reason why we managed to expose some major shortcomings within the Commission and became aware that the Commission was not fulfilling its obligations .
The allocation of responsibility within the Commission was not satisfactory , but it has improved .
This , I feel , is extremely important .
A scientific committee must be detached , so that the scientists are not exposed to political pressure when they are asked to deliver opinions .
Finally , I would like to say that BSE is , fortunately , on the way out .
There will continue to be a few cases .
So what can we learn from all this ?
The steps that have been taken appear to be effective , and I therefore believe that we can avoid getting into such a situation again .
We now have an apparatus which works .
We cannot give consumers a 100 per cent guarantee .
Officials who know that their files may be scrutinised by the public at any time are sure to be more inclined to administer them correctly .
This is gratifying , since we are after all talking about consolidating an institution which is still very new , but already well known and valued .
Incredible as it may sound , it is evident from the annual report that even he , who is supposed to be the public 's guarantor with regard to the EU administration , simply does not have full access to Commission and Council documents .
It is therefore clearly necessary to amend Article 3( 2 ) of the Ombudsman 's Statute , so that he has full and unimpeded access to all the relevant documents .
To have a provision whereby the Community institutions can refuse to give the Ombudsman access to documents either by pleading duly substantiated grounds of secrecy , or because officials and other employees are speaking on behalf of and in accordance with instructions from their administrations , is not just unnecessary , it is extremely inappropriate .
Otherwise , the institution is giving the people of the EU a completely false sense of the guarantee of due process of law .
That question is one to be dealt with under the Treaty , but we are getting some clear internal guidelines about what procedures we can use in Parliament .
