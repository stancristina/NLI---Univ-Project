There needs to be a clear dialogue and good cooperation between the institutions of the Union and those acting at local level , that is the municipalities or towns and cities .
For this reason I feel that , in the definition of who can apply for funds from the framework programme , there must be room for organisations other than those we traditionally regard as municipal organisations .
Therefore , I would like to support Amendment No 31 .
The proposal is of course , from an international point of view , an invaluable tool for decision-making in cases where there is uncertainty regarding risks , products or manufacturing methods .
I would also like to appeal to everybody here , in anticipation of tomorrow 's vote , not to weaken the committee 's and the rapporteur 's text by adopting the amendments proposed by the EDD and the PPE.
It is of course also important to increase the legal weight with the aim of making the precautionary principle an international standard .
It is no mean task to define the precautionary principle .
They cannot therefore be dealt with in the same way either .
The principle must be clear .
But there are more examples than mad cow disease alone , examples which are perhaps not as spectacular , but where it is just as important to make decisions .
This is an untenable situation .
We must avoid a situation in which the consumer acts as some sort of paying guinea pig when it comes to new products on the market .
The EU' s budget for next year is one of the smallest relative to the size of the Member States ' GDP.
We have thus found the funds required in order to be able to provide strong support to the reconstruction and democratisation of the Balkans , including now in Serbia .
However , the need for a long-term solution for future budget years remains .
The EU' s agriculture policy is far too expensive .
The budgetary system , along with the methods for openness , auditing and political control , need to be improved and modernised quickly .
We have voted against Amendment No 13 , which was submitted by Olle Schmidt .
Moreover , such adaptation to conditions in the USA would undoubtedly make it more difficult for us to achieve a normal level of tax in both the USA and Europe five years down the line .
The Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament consider that the postal market within the EU should be opened up to competition .
We also consider it unjustifiable that countries in the EU compete in Sweden' s postal market , for example , when they are not prepared to allow competition in their own markets .
We feel that the Member States themselves are much more competent to take care of these matters .
Regional inequalities have arisen and the situation within the postal service has deteriorated - not least for the employees . de Roo report ( A5-0378/2000 )
No steps are being taken to make the EU more democratic or to increase the power of the national parliaments .
On the contrary , the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power .
The enlargement is not being made easier ; rather the decision process in the Council is being made more complex .
I welcome the steps to simplify the enlargement process that were taken at the European Council Summit in Nice .
Mr President , it is precisely because Serbia has chosen the democratic path that there is reason for the European Parliament to remind everyone of two fundamental requirements that are made of any democratic state governed by law , namely that political freedom must prevail - one must not be able to be imprisoned for one ' s political views or for the ethnic group to which one belongs - and that persons suspected of crimes - whether political leaders or common villains - must be put on trial so that their guilt and responsibility can be examined .
The persecution of minorities can never be justified .
Mr President , we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left would have liked to have approved a resolution on the human rights situation and the situation in the Turkish prisons following this debate .
In recent times a number of people have died as a result of abuse in Turkish prisons .
Unfortunately we will be able to see a new example of this on Wednesday next week , when the Assyrian priest Yusuf Akbulut will be brought before a military court in Diyarbakir .
Despite the fact that Tunisia signed up to the UN convention against torture as far back as 1987 , torture is becoming increasingly widespread and institutionalised in the country .
These will now be started at the weekend and on Monday .
It concerns the dissolution of Tunisia ' s League for Human Rights .
Sympathisers with the movement abroad have been prevented from returning .
What crimes they are guilty of is unclear and the action should be dropped .
His family have been given no information as to his condition .
The cooperation between the EU and Tunisia is positive .
I think it is wrong in principle to have such measures in the European Union .
It is also important to point out that there are serious faults in this aspect of agricultural policy .
The system of sales promotion measures is part of what is wrong with the system for the EU' s agricultural policy .
I shall therefore be voting against this report .
The whole of Europe ' s current biological diversity is a result of nearly 10 000 years of struggle and hardship .
There is , however , one area in which the Union has
