situation where mobiles are excluded and other forms of telecommunications are included .
Finally , I would like to draw attention to Amendments Nos 3 and 4 .
Amendment No 3 calls for a clearer and unambiguous formulation of the political aims and principles underlying the further development of the European telecommunications market , which is absolutely essential .
Amendment No 4 highlights the urgent need to devote special attention to implementing the existing directives so that major differences in the liberalisation of national markets do not become entrenched and thereby hamper the implementation of new rules .
We still have 15 partially liberalised and still largely segmented markets .
What we have here is the basis for opening up the European Union market in a genuine sense .
I commend Mr van Velzen 's report to you and congratulate him again on it ; and I congratulate the Commission on the speed , diligence and thoughtfulness with which it has approached the redrafting and relaunching of European Union legislation in this field .
Mr President , at the outset I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr van Velzen , on the preparation and presentation of an extremely balanced report on the important subject of electronic communications .
I would like to focus on a few points relating to this important report .
The Union must keep pace with the technological changes which are taking place globally at this time .
If the economies of the Union are to prosper and succeed , businesses must be apprised of new changes in the field of information technology .
In many ways , the Union is ahead of the United States of America in the field of technology .
EU-technology in mobile-phone systems is well advanced .
Most Union countries have extensive competition in the field of mobile-phone markets .
This is going to continue with the next set of mobile-phone licences known as UMTS licences when the respective EU governments give them out .
I fully support competition in the telecommunications market , because it is good for consumers in terms of the prices they pay for telecommunication services .
The European Union is behind the United States of America with the Internet .
EU governments must redouble their efforts to ensure that all businesses are fully linked up to the Internet and e-commerce companies must be promoted at every turn .
It is very important for social policies , in terms of promoting the Internet in rural parts of Europe , to be incorporated in the EU strategies .
I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating Commissioner Byrne for setting in train the process for the regulating of contracts on the Internet .
The Commissioner has started this process of looking into mechanisms to guarantee consumer protection .
The Commission wants to bring forward proposals to regulate procedures and for dispute mechanisms for contractual arrangements entered into via the Internet .
Entering into contracts on the Internet must bring with it regulatory procedures and dispute-regulation mechanisms so that consumers will enter into such contracts .
In conclusion , in my own country of Ireland there are 750 software firms employing over 23,000 people .
I am confident that this sector will increase as new opportunities and e-commerce fields open up to them .
Mr President , I wish to join in the congratulations to Mr van Velzen on a very good and focussed report and to say that it has been a pleasure working with him .
As a Member new to this House with his first involvement in work on the telecommunications directive , I have certainly learnt a lot from the process , and I think other colleagues have as well .
I want to focus on some of the crucial issues raised in the report and , in particular , the whole transitional period towards a future single open market for all electronic communications .
The important thing about this debate is that by and large there is a strong consensus towards that .
Our colleague , Mr Alyssandrakis , does not agree with that - and it is always good to have his distinctive contribution to our debates .
But Mr van Velzen has quite rightly focussed on some of the difficulties in making that transition and how it is going to be regulated .
The second issue on which there is important consensus is that we do not want a centralised regulatory body at European-Union level .
We want to see the national regulatory authorities have the responsibility , but there are going to be new responsibilities which will need a strong measure of coordination to ensure that process is carried out quickly and effectively .
I should like to say to Mr Liikanen that one of the things to be addressed is that in thinking about combining the regulatory authorities with the overall competition authorities in each Member State , let us not forget that those competition authorities are already taking on significant extra responsibilities through the activities and policies of his colleague , Mr Monti .
We need to ensure that those competition authorities are adequately staffed , conscious of their European responsibilities and prepared to buy in to the coordination process that is being proposed in this report , because they will have that crucial responsibility .
That will need very careful monitoring , a lot of cooperation between the Member State governments and as Mr van Velzen said , we as politicians have an important role to play in putting pressure on the Member States to ensure that process is achieved satisfactorily .
My final point concerns the question of universal service , which has already been mentioned earlier .
It is quite right that in his report Mr van Velzen does not propose that we should move to an extension of universal service at the moment .
Everything we are talking about shows how fast the market is changing .
