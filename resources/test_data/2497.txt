That , in a few words , should have been our message today .
A disproportionately large number of breakdowns occurred during the preparations for putting the nuclear reactor Temelin into operation .
The disabled are rejected on the pretext that the clients or staff cannot be expected to stand the sight of them .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs decided by a majority that these agencies should be set up in the EU Member States rather than setting up a central body at European level .
We cannot accept seeing women and men still not having equal rights at the dawn of the 21st century , seeing the disabled socially marginalised , or people being excluded from society because of their sexual orientation and branded as different .
I think that would create greater uncertainty because we would no longer know who could actually be assisted in line with the Commission programme .
First , I was glad to hear you say the management is to be improved .
Dismantling the internal borders is certainly a substantial step forward , but we must be able to prepare these minorities .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Socialist Group in this House supports Mr van Hulten' s report and therefore also the unanimous decision and proposal from the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Like several Member States , I think there is still some doubt as to what this general reform will cost at the final count or what benefits it will produce .
In future , the administration must be able to react more quickly .
These ex ante controls are essential because , unlike their national colleagues , the Commission officials have wide discretionary powers in many areas of financial decision-making .
Regardless of whether such conflicts have in fact arisen , there is a potential for conflict .
I can understand the concern that in the absence of this ex ante control - before the money is spent - a deficit could appear .
As politicians , we simply have a responsibility , in all the areas in which we act , to protect young people from that surplus .
I believe we must bring up our children to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parents to encourage their children to watch suitable programmes and disregard the less suitable ones .
As a rule these are rooted in a particular cultural , social and societal background .
Children are being faced day by day with a growing wave of media brutality and violence , which is simply too much for them , especially because no limits are imposed on these offerings .
We must , therefore , ensure that the freedoms laid down in the Treaty such as the right of residence and free movement , do not remain empty words .
We have a far more pressing need for concrete legislative proposals from the Commission , than we do for studies and fine declarations and speeches .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights has to be more than a fine proclamation .
That gives us great cause for concern , and we expect that as well as stepping up the pace in matters of equal opportunities policy , there will also be concrete measures .
I will deal firstly with Amendment No 15 .
I am delighted that people have been so willing to compromise today , as indeed our voting has shown .
Despite all the inconsistencies and superfluous proposals , which do nothing to help the cause , I did not want to vote against the report at the final vote .
These are shortcomings that became apparent during the previous elections .
There are a few examples I could mention : the monitoring of weapons exports and small arms through to the end-user , so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there , support for non-governmental organisations and women ' s organisations based there , which are courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation .
With its common position on Afghanistan , the European Union is supporting the United Nations ' special mission in Afghanistan , and the efforts to achieve peace undertaken by the General Secretary ' s special representatives .
Mr President , I would like to take up what Mr Dupuis had to say .
Not us , but the government under Prime Minister Georgievski , and also the Albanian leader , Xhaferi , and above all , the representative of the Council of Europe , Max van der Stoel .
What matters most is that a solution is found which we can all subscribe to .
The Commission is working with the OSCE High Commissioner for national minorities , Max van der Stoel , with a view to providing financial support for the implementation of this important law .
Time and again , we rightly complain that there is too much of a centralising drive in various areas .
Secondly , that harmonised safety standards are applied , including in relation to stability and rescue equipment for inland traffic in the European Union .
It seems to me that a curious discrepancy is starting to take shape .
On the question of the committee of enquiry , the Commission supports the Presidency ' s stance .
The European Union ' s stand on the substance of the peace process has not changed .
But I am prepared to call on my fellow members in the House to have the courage to call a murder a murder and to condemn provocation as provocation and not as counter-productivity , as Mrs Albright said , in order to gloss things over , purely to appear fair towards both sides .
At last , all that is at an end .
Everything must therefore be done to prevent bloodshed , because a civil war in Yugoslavia or Serbia would be a
