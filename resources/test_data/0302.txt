only for the area of the Middle East .
The parliamentary elections due to take place in Palestine on 25 January , with which I shall be involved , will be carried out under the shadow of the pre-election period in Israel itself , where elections are to be held two months later , and will place Israel in a new , post-Sharon , era .
Nonetheless , the Palestinian Authority is working ceaselessly so that free and democratic elections can be held and the democratic opinion of the Palestinian people can be demonstrated once again .
As for the election process in East Jerusalem , it would appear that the matter has been arranged in the same way as agreed by the Palestinians in 1996 .
Elections to the new Palestinian Legislative Council will constitute the prospects and , once again , the proof that the Palestinians can operate democratically .
All the political organisations have their place in the political system in Palestine .
I should like to touch on two major issues which relate to peace in Palestine and the Middle East : you referred to one , Commissioner , which is the drastic economic and social situation of the Palestinian people living in Gaza and the occupied West Bank .
The second issue relates to the unacceptable tactics which the Israeli authorities continue to apply to the occupied Palestinian territories , especially East Jerusalem .
I believe that the European Union should take immediate measures to respond to these unacceptable Israeli tactics .
Other speakers have spoken about discrimination and the problems which women face today on the job market as regards their access and deployment and the particular problems which vulnerable groups face in our society , such as female immigrants and elderly women .
We do not all have the same definition of unemployment , seasonal unemployment and long-term unemployment .
I should also like to emphasise the importance which must be attached to the proposal in the Estrela report for a collective and global approach to the question of women .
They relate to the application of the Lisbon Strategy .
In our opinion , it is very , very dangerous .
These are proposals which ultimately aim to downgrade and further privatise and commercialise existing social services , with the consent of women and working class families .     – Mr President , it has been said repeatedly that the European strategy on employment is a basic means of applying the Lisbon Strategy and makes provision for a European employment rate of 70 % and , more importantly , a female employment rate of 60 % .
Situations such as these arise not only from unequal treatment on pay , but also from a lack of legal protection in professional development , which is affected by family life and , whether we like it or not , it is on this family life that the demographic development of the Union depends .
Inequality begins in the training period .
Objectives to meet 90 % of the demand for day-care facilities for school-age children and 33 % for infants are not enough , unless quality preschool education is provided , which is only the case in a few European countries .
Help must be given not only to mothers of single-parent families , but also to mothers in general bringing up one , two or more children .
Similar threats and sanctions are provided for in cases where provisions are infringed governing confidentiality relating to 'closed meetings ' and the publication of documents which , it should be noted , often circulate on the media .
That is why it aims to organise an arranged 'social dialogue ' and gives the media an even more active role in the attempt to brainwash the masses so that , with a gun to their head , they will consent to the adoption of the European Constitution .
The only positive development for the workers and working classes is the policy to weaken the ΕU and finally bury any attempt to reintroduce any so-called constitutional arrangement of this reactionary body .     – Mr President , I have read the report and listened to Mr Solana carefully .
We must not get caught up in the American mindset .
The constant , daily infringements of Greek airspace by Turkish military aircraft constitute a threat .
That the occupying army should leave Cyprus , that Israel 's occupying army ...     – Madam President , first of all I too should like to take my turn in thanking Véronique de Keyser and Eduard McMillan-Scott for the effort they made , together with the other MEPs , during their mission .
The Palestinians , despite the pronouncements of the West , have unfortunately not yet seen the objective of creating their own independent state being promoted .
Our reaction to the new government cannot be to stop efforts to restart the peace process , as announced by the United States .
Unfortunately Mr Solana is not here today for me to tell him that his statement a week before the Palestinian elections that economic aid to Palestine should be frozen if Hammas won was a very serious mistake .
I have one thing to ask of the Commission : to request the prolongation of the truce by Hammas .
For many of us , this sea is our life .
We want fish stocks to be maintained .
The European Parliament and the Commission have approved a plan of management measures for fisheries in the Mediterranean .
This is our duty , in order for us to protect the Mediterranean , which is our life .
At the same time , the Mediterranean basin is constantly being inhabited by new populaces , resulting in constant aggravation due to industrial , urban and other waste , with a direct and serious adverse impact on fisheries
