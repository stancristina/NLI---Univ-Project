That would be the responsibility of Mrs Diamantopoulou rather than me .
Firstly , the adoption of the sectoral directive on types of work , which lays down a method for weekly calculation , makes it necessary to adapt our Regulation , above all the provisions relating to working and rest times .
The Commission will ensure a balance between flexibility and the control of application .
Mr Tsatsos and I , in our report on the Treaty of Amsterdam , speak of the double legitimacy of States and peoples .
Secondly , because the final text lays down that the regions with legislative powers will not be able to bring cases before the Court of Justice on their own behalf , and that they must do so with the prior agreement of the State .
Two inventions dating back 2 500 years which are foundation stones of the current Europe .
We are counting on your intelligence and flexibility .
Mr Prodi , why do you not propose a world-wide Socrates in order to attract brains ?
With regard to the future of Europe , the Convention has passed its half-way point - as President Giscard d'Estaing reminded us in an article which has appeared today in the press .
It is very important , everything is related , and you are our border with that region .
The European Union has not waited for the recent events to happen to implement an agreed maritime safety policy .
If the Council had agreed to the proposal for single-hull vessels transporting oil to leave Community waters , the Prestige disaster would not have taken place , because it would have had to leave Community waters several months beforehand .
We must coordinate the European response .
Secondly , as well as this proposal , they have committed themselves to adopting , before June , an accelerated timetable for the departure of single-hull ships transporting oil from European ports .
This will be decided by the European Council at the appropriate time .
The way to act is not to make a generic declaration ; which would be the easiest thing to do , but , when it comes down to it , would be difficult to put into practice .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Commission would point out that the issues raised by the honourable Member are linked , in particular , to respect for human dignity and the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading punishments or treatment , principles which are common to all the Member States of the Union .
The Commission would point out however that the report by the Council of Europe which the honourable Member refers to was followed by a detailed response by the Greek authorities , which in the current situation is providing a series of responses to the concerns expressed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture .
Finally , they will have to ensure the prevention of violence in places intended to house asylum seekers , at borders and in residential centres .
The rapporteur has already mentioned the percentage of the European population over the age of 65 , 16 % , an estimated 22 % and 27.5 % for 2025 and 2050 , and that the number of people over 80 is going to increase as well , from 3.6 % in 2000 to 6 % in 2025 and to 10 % in 2050 .
In this regard , the Barcelona Council of March 2002 pointed out the need to initiate and develop cooperation between the Member States on these issues during 2002 and 2003 , the need for an exchange of good practices and information and the need to hold a debate on the common challenges at European level .
Mr President , like other Members , I would firstly like to thank and congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur , Mr Mantovani , because I believe it has really been an excellent idea to produce a communication on the needs relating to healthcare and the care of elderly people .
I therefore hope that this method of open coordination , this detailed and exhaustive approximation of health needs - but also social needs and the humanisation of the lives of the elderly - and of these problems , is extended in future communications .
The rapporteur has already mentioned the long process of debate and joint work between the parliamentary groups with the industry , the Commission and also with the competent administrations of the Member States and finally a compromise was achieved last November following an extremely long conciliation which , if I remember correctly , lasted twelve hours .
I believe that the European Parliament not only can and must communicate that this seventh amendment is a success , but also it would be a mistake for the industry not to take this opportunity to draw up a new communication strategy based on the agreements reached and on its position in favour of the concerns of the consumers , not only with regard to animal experimentation , but also , as we have seen , with regard to other points of the directive which imply greater control of the marketing of these products .
In this regard , the work to create a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly would be a valuable contribution , and I would encourage our Lebanese colleagues to join in with this task together with the European Parliament and the Parliaments of the region .
Secondly , since October of that same year , 2000 , the Hezbollah group has been holding four Israeli citizens as hostages and , in this specific case , and with regard to the people captive or disappeared in the various countries of the region in general - it is calculated that there are 17 000 Lebanese citizens - we must get involved - I would
