societies , and sexual equality was therefore officially introduced .
In return , nurseries were set up , maternity leave was introduced and abortion was legalised in a number of countries .
It worked in the sense that the proportion of women in the labour market was high in relation to what it was in the existing EU countries .
The other side of the coin , however , was that , in many cases , women experienced their work as nothing more than a mere duty , and not as a right , and there was no question at all of equal wages and therefore , of course , no question of equality either .
The EU must therefore make an extra effort to convince women that the EU is something other than a crude market economy .
In this context , I hope that Commissioner Diamantopoulou will follow up on what she has already said along the lines of our being alert to this issue and that she will also intervene if it proves that there has been no proper mainstreaming .
On the basis , however , of the current arrangements , it has to be said that the rules surrounding the regulation on the freezing of funds and economic resources , involving the entry of names on terrorism lists , is without any form of legal certainty .
The situation , roughly speaking , is that the EU 's rules have come about on the basis of the UN 's resolutions , but the UN Sanctions Committee acts , in general , on the dictates of the United States , where the principle applies that that it is better to risk having ten innocent victims than to see one guilty person go free .
What is happening now is an improvement in the legal position in certain respects , but there is a fundamental lack of elementary legal certainty in as much as someone suspected of terrorism should also be entitled to a defence and to be informed of the basis of the accusation .
That is what the amendment by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is , in the first place , designed to remedy and improve .
It is a question of our moving from a position of absolutely no legal certainty towards something resembling legal certainty , and our proposal is aimed at extending such legal certainty by , firstly , entitling people to contest accusations and to be given access to a basic defence and by , principally , resisting a situation in which specific designated groups are branded as terrorists , without having recourse to the due processes of law .
Madam President , the stoning of women must be stopped now .
The Amina Lawal case again makes it necessary to take every possible measure to emphasise the EU 's rejection of such barbaric and inhumane methods .
Stoning must of course be banned in every country of the world , but let the obviously appalling case of Amina Lawal be an opportunity to register our unshakeable opposition to the stoning of women .
It is shocking that there should be no guarantee of Amina Lawal 's ever appearing before a national court , even though the Nigerian Constitution guarantees her life and dignity .
There is still a long and tough struggle to be undertaken to ensure that human rights are both accepted and observed in every country of the world .
Mr President , the resolution Parliament is now on the way towards adopting is backward-looking .
Instead , we should have turned our attention to the future .
In my view , it is incomprehensible that , in recent days , so many people have expended so much effort on working out how to deplore the decision taken by the American and British governments concerning military action in Iraq , an action to which my country subscribes .
It is not the coalition that is responsible for the war in Iraq ; it is Saddam Hussein and his regime .
It was Saddam Hussein who forced them to take it .
Now , we must look forward , as in part does the resolution , I am pleased to say .
The Iraqi people have suffered enough .
We must take joint responsibility for peace and freedom in Iraq .
That is the most important aspect of the resolution we are to vote on .
Mr President , I too find it sad , as well as quite unnecessary , that we should have this dispute about the budget .
Parliament has certainly shown great understanding for the fact that the difficult negotiations concerning the new Member States ' portion of the budget for agriculture and for the Structural Funds are not to be reopened , but we have indicated that what is required must be examined under the heading of internal policy , or expenditure category 3 , for there are a number of problems and , if we do not adjust the budget in the next few years , high-priority areas such as the social dialogue , internal security , training , police cooperation and the creation of a secure working environment could suffer as a result , and we should be unable to fulfil our political priorities .
Many ordinary people fear that enlargement will mean competition from the new Member States in the shape of businesses that do not care two hoots about the working environment .
There is a need to change the culture and to bring about greater awareness , both among businesses and employees , of the need for a secure working environment , and that is something we can do through our agency in Bilbao and by way of the social dialogue .
The Council must respect Parliament 's powers , Article 272 of the Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreement
