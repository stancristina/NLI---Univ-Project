of useful contributions there .
I should add that I asked the Commission back in August about a particular comment in the report , which stated that in August there would be some feedback from SMEs about their response to the project .
However , the Commission did not reply .
I asked again in October where this information was and it finally replied : " What information are you waiting for ?
We do not understand ! "
It was literally only yesterday that I received an e-mail from the Commission stating that there was such information but it had been sent to the Committee on Budgets rather than to our committee - again , not too impressive .
Yesterday , I spoke in the debate on the Doorn report on SLIM concerning bureaucracy .
I should like to reinforce those comments now , because the fact that this report had to go through so many different Directorates before it emerged - including legal , budgets , financial control , general secretariat , regional , innovation , employment and social affairs , research , internal market and competition - is not an impressive way of dealing with an important subject .
I speak not only on behalf of this report but also , I am sure , of other reports that need to go through the same system .
This is just too much micromanagement .
There are too many managers involved and , as a result , the project ends up not being fully managed .
Finally , I have made a few comments about the European Investment Bank taking a controlling interest in the EIF.
This may be absolutely right given its expertise , but we want to ensure that these particular projects are given the priority they deserve .
I am not particularly confident but we shall watch to see how that goes .
I have also called for a full audit , not because of any doubt about the financial probity , but just as a basic management control system .
In conclusion , may I say that the Commission has apparently already written the draft report for the year 2000 .
I should like to ask that we see it now so that we can make a positive contribution now in good time , rather than repeat the timing of the current report .
Here we are in January 2001 debating and voting on a report that was issued back in 1999 .
It is already history .
On such an important subject we want to deal with the present , thereby being better able to shape the future .
Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I very much support this report and in particular the initiatives behind the ETF Start-up Facility and the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Guarantee Facility .
I am sure there is a shared opinion across this House of how important small businesses are .
In my own country , the United Kingdom , the small business population has actually increased in size by one half since 1980 and there is now one small business for every 13 adults in the population .
Small businesses are important not just for jobs but also for trade in this European Union .
I recall talking with the counsellor in the British Embassy dealing with Belgium and the Benelux countries and exports into those countries , who told me that the vast majority , over 90 % of the enquiries which he deals with , are not from large companies seeking to export but from small businesses .
So that is very relevant to us in this House too .
It is relevant because of the Lisbon process .
We welcomed the conclusions from the Lisbon Summit last year : the move towards flexibility , the move towards entrepreneurship , towards innovation that were reflected there .
These facilities should be seen very much as being at the heart of trying to achieve those economic goals .
I would also like to change past practice by congratulating Mr Bushill-Matthews .
I have sat in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with him for the last year or so and I have heard him make the same speech time after time about de-regulation and too much bureaucracy at European level .
He has actually come up with something constructive here , so well done Mr Bushill-Matthews .
Nice to see that you can do some work , or at least others can do it on your behalf .
I particularly congratulate you on your conclusions regarding the need for more transparency and speed - absolute support for that - and on the importance of the high technology sectors - yes , but not just those .
Also , I am very surprised to see you putting emphasis on the need to increase female participation in small businesses .
Congratulations to you for supporting that .
I would have liked to see more on the social economy .
Our cooperative businesses should be seen fair and square as part of the small business sector .
They are particularly important in terms of job creation amongst disadvantaged groups in the labour market .
They are particularly important in terms of socially useful employment and it is an omission that they are missing from the report .
They should not be treated differently ; they should be given extra help .
Perhaps the Commission could comment on that at the close of the debate .
I would also like to particularly support Amendment No 3 from the Socialist Group .
We will be supporting all of the amendments to the effect that bank guarantees behind venture capital are still far too strict , far too conservative and actually prevent entrepreneurs from creating jobs in the UK and in other European countries .
