right of each citizen of the Union to file complaints with the Ombudsman concerning the activities of Community bodies and institutions , if the complainant feels that he has been subject to neglect , carelessness , faulty advice , procedural fault , discrimination , unnecessary delay or unfair action .
The Ombudsman 's policy of advising and guiding citizens is positive and especially important during the first stages of a new institution .
It is excellent news that the guidebook has been published so soon , and its content is in my view good .
An absolute precondition for reliability is that the Ombudsman in his activity is independent .
I would like to congratulate the committee and thank the Ombudsman for his valuable efforts .
The annual report should definitely be circulated as widely as possible , since it includes a clear description of the area of authority of the European Ombudsman and thus forms an important source of information for all citizens .
Increased information will rapidly lead to more complaints .
Therefore the Ombudsman 's office should have personnel in proportion to the amount of complaints .
It would therefore seem natural to have the Ombudsman 's office in Brussels , even if Parliament 's official domicile is Strasbourg .
The list of tasks to be performed by the Ombudsman states that it is his duty to continue to implement efficiently citizens ' rights at all levels of Union administration and a openness of the work carried out by Community bodies and institutions .
It is very pleasing that the Ombudsman , Mr SÃ¶derman , has chosen to take a stand on a matter of such importance to all citizens as openness within the European Union .
The Ombudsman 's area of authority is very closely connected with the citizens ' actual constitutional position in the European Union , and I assume that as soon as he has established his position , discussions could be started regarding a possible extension of the civil rights of Union citizens .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Lehne for an excellent report .
The authorities should prevent criminal money from penetrating the financial system .
A system should be created which would prevent successful money laundering by supporting preventive measures in respect of targets exposed to money laundering risks and which would make it possible to discover , trace and investigate money laundering .
If money has slipped through security measures , this money should be identified , traced , confiscated and the offenders brought to justice .
In the future also enterprises dealing in betting and gaming , real estate developers , companies or individuals in occupations handling valuable objects , accountants and enterprises or professionals offering financial services will in all likelihood be obliged to report .
A number of international organisations are involved in resolving the problems of money laundering .
Slovenia can now start to catch up politically with the other Central and Eastern European countries in relation to the EU.
It was of course welcome that the dispute between the EU and Great Britain concerning mad cow disease was resolved .
The new TACIS regulation , which was difficult enough to produce , was one of the victims of British policy .
Fortunately it was accepted by the Agricultural Council last week , and is now at last coming into effect .
It is worth keeping in mind that stability is best achieved by establishing a variety of financial , cultural and political ties .
The Florence Summit was a disappointment for European citizens expecting firm decisions on reducing unemployment .
This growing frustration will become a real obstacle to building a common Europe and reducing unemployment .
During the transitional period the purpose was to re-assess the Union 's corresponding regulations , so that the new Member States do not have to lower the level of their standards by early 1999 .
We are half way through the transitional period and nothing worth mentioning has happened .
We have reason to believe that the Commission will merely achieve a poor compromise , whereas this would be a perfect opportunity to raise the standard of environmental and health protection in the entire Union .
Citizens of new Member States cannot be expected to accept that the Union would force their countries to lower the standard of environmental legislation .
We have trusted the Commission to fulfil its promises to develop Community legislation during the four-year transitional period so that it is in harmony with the more stringent environmental standards of the new Member States .
Now the time has come to know what the Commission 's measures and plans are and what the timescale is for fulfilling these promises .
What is the Commission 's view on revising Article 104 so that the Member States besides keeping their own higher environmental standards can also introduce new regulations for improving the state of the environment ?
Finland for example wishes to assert its right to maintain a lower level of cadmium in fertilizers , because cadmium is a so-called accumulative substance , which does not degrade but accumulates , thereby increasing the level of risk .
Madam President , I would like to thank Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard for his agreement that it is essential to update Community legislation to a higher standard , to meet the requirements of the new Member States .
Knowing how long it takes for legislation to go through the Union machinery , there is every reason to be very pessimistic .
According to the Commissioner a proposal for the amendment of the classification , packing and marking of pesticides should already have been put forward in July 1996 .
It is of course welcome that by July we will have started regular discussions with new Member States , but should these discussions not perhaps have been started a year ago , so that we could have kept to the proposed schedule
