That is what makes this report so responsible .
We must no longer spend a lot of money and get poor quality in return .
It is not only training , though , that must take greater account of increased life expectancy .
According to reports in the media , there have been irregularities and instances of fraud in connection with the registers .
Our policy , then , must be an utterly unambiguous one .
So let me again ask you to consult not only this House , but also , where necessary , other authorities outside it ; the Court of Auditors , for example , which could certainly check to see whether or not Members are obeying the rules .
The requirement that information be disseminated simultaneously has been done away with .
We must therefore be guided by the principles enumerated in Recital 26a .
We can see from the example of this House how we are constantly deluged with emails , and the appalling amount of junk data that we have ; are investors supposed to work their way through that sort of thing in order to get at the quality information ?
As well as flying from Frankfurt to Peking , I was planning to take a connecting flight with a Chinese airline from Peking to Guilin , and this involved some of the data being transferred from one airline to another , a process that enables the Chinese state to get its hands on a plethora of personal data .
Particularly at the end of a parliamentary term and of a Commission ’s term of office , the amount involved is enormous , and cannot be regarded as satisfactory .
We call for OLAF to get involved in this .
The clear apportionment of responsibility has been central .
As one would expect of him , Mr Bösch has produced a comprehensive report dealing with a whole range of issues related to fraud prevention , and from various angles .
These , too , had been brought to our attention by Parliament .
Let us remind ourselves how the Prodi Commission took office in the autumn of 1999 grandiosely committing itself to , and demanding , zero tolerance for fraud and irregularities .
As these reports have to relate to the project in its entirety , it is impossible to conclude that the whole project is in some way tantamount to fraud .
The internal audit service is independent , something that I believe it did indeed demonstrate while Mr Muis was responsible for running it .
This Regulation provides us at last with a more broadly drawn concept , which will underpin the current implementation strategy in the best possible way .
We also found it very regrettable that the final Commission proposal for a directive took no account of education , decision-making processes , and the content of media and advertising .
The Commission , along with many Members of this House , takes the view that gender should no longer be taken into account when calculating insurance premiums , claiming that this is intrinsically discriminatory .
Now of all times , when the adoption of a European constitution is about to be adopted , it would be a mockery for us to fail to push forward the equality that it – as has already been said – has as one of its core values .
Parliament’s efforts to limit the scope for amending the annexes in the comitology procedure must also be seen as part of this approach for stability and legal certainty .
In accordance with this ‘low requirements for low risk ’ approach , however , we should give small businesses the assurance that evidence of the results of the HACCP principle can be provided in a form acceptable to the firm .
The business operator should see himself as a partner and be seen as one .
As the Commissioner has now arrived , I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning : my sincere thanks to you and your colleagues for your extraordinarily close cooperation in working on the texts of these regulations .
Most people think it is uncivilised to drive animals hundreds or even thousands of kilometres across Europe and the world for slaughter .
That is why I can and must say that it needs to be completely revised to that effect .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , 95 % of live animal transports are by road and we are all familiar with the images of tormented animals confined in a very narrow space for days on end as they are transported across Europe and beyond .
It must all remain within a sensible economic context and it must also comply with the European Union’s laws .
I believe we must insist on their being able to be slaughtered within that radius .
She has made a clear distinction between humans and animals and I , too , would like to reject the disgusting comparison with the Holocaust .
Mr Eichel and Mr Mer might , however , discover the scale of their budget problems sooner .
They are incompatible with international law and there is no need at all to discuss the matter .
I wish the US would devote as much energy – by which I do not mean military manpower – to solving the actual Middle East problem as it is doing to Iraq .
They did , in the end with obviously planned and criminal acts of violence .
I do not believe that ‘Standards before Status ’ is the only way ; so far , it has led us astray .
With perhaps a few exceptions , which the Commissioner has mentioned , they are unfortunately not yet prepared to agree to a multi-ethnic state , and not only to agree to it verbally but also to make it
