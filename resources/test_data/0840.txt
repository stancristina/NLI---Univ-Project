We express the hope that the Slovenian Parliament will be able to promptly ratify this Agreement following the elections on 10 November .
How will the committee approach the whole subject of an active labour market policy ?
The fact is that we always display a form of impotence when it comes to this question .
Our experiences with the single market and the EMU convergence strategy have taught us that the combination of political will , a good timetable and a good follow-up procedure can serve to point everybody in the same direction and this is what we also wanted to do in the case of the employment strategy .
How on earth are we going to be able to ensure that , in the guidelines , economic policy concentrates primarily on employment if this committee is not allowed to have its say ?
I dare to hope , ladies and gentlemen , that the missing pieces to the puzzle will be provided during the IGC and that the committee will come to play an increased role in the Union 's employment policy , in accordance with the Treaty .
The committee is a body supported by the Social Affairs Council charged with the implementation and development of European employment strategy .
I fear that you are failing to get to grips with this committee .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are once again faced with the half-hearted nature of Europe 's attempts to combat fraud , as has already been pointed out by previous speakers and by the two rapporteurs .
Example one .
This non-fictional example shows that we need better solutions , but I will not of course oppose the Regulation or Protocol we have before us today .
We made the list more flexible and supplemented it with sanctions , also adding the question of money laundering in a separate vote which in my opinion was open to dispute .
I believe that if there is one area of policy where we can do ourselves credit this is the one .
National Member States must have nothing to hide in this area and if a Commission official wants to carry out an independent investigation then that should be possible .
It is a step in the right direction .
First of all there is the amendment which allows the Member States to apply stricter tests in other areas than brake systems .
Meantime I see from Page 21 of the Minutes that seven Members claim they had intended to vote in favour of the amendment in question but did not do so due to a misunderstanding over the way in which the amendment was shown on our own electronic display .
Madam President , I sent the President a letter yesterday jointly with Mr Kristoffersen , concerning an amendment , Amendment No 635 to budget heading 1872 .
We should always look at things in a reasonable way but we should not now disrupt the vote on this particular matter .
My Group is not opposed to honest efforts to bring about a policy on tourism .
Mr President , I think Mr Wijsenbeek has since left us , but I wanted just to challenge his concluding remark that sex tourism is only an insignificant part of all tourism .
No excise duties and VAT are levied on air travel and Europe is still not minded to press for that although it has been necessary for years .
Tourism leads to more road building , more hotel beds , and whole coastlines are ruined together with their ecological wealth .
There are those who mock the multiplicity of horrors , wars and disasters , violations of human rights we get through here in a period of just a few hours .
The imposition of Islamic law goes hand in hand with the most brutal and savage punishments .
I think we can only achieve this by exerting considerable pressure on the Taliban government , though I think they have yet to learn how to deal with international organizations .
There are of course wide-scale human rights abuses , both by the government troops , the paramilitaries and the guerilla fighters .
I thus call on the President of Colombia to publish the report of the Colombian Human Rights Commission so that we can conduct a serious review of all the facts .
It is in the interest of a resolution to the conflict in the island and of Cyprus 's accession to the Union that these contacts should be stepped up .
It is certainly not a partial freezing of MEDA funds which will cause the Turkish Government to have a change of heart .
The dismal upshot of this civil war is millions of refugees and total deaths estimated at over a million .
Precisely because the country is so isolated it is not very sensitive to economic and political pressure .
Perhaps we ought to think about giving more support to similar , small European initiatives as a way of helping to bring about an end to the violence .
Mr President , the issue here is human rights and protection of the natural environment .
Mr President , much as I respect the humanitarian sensibilities which Mr Papakyriazis demonstrates in the Socialist Group 's resolution , I must say I was disappointed by it because I certainly never expected to see a lack of political insight on the part of the Socialists .
If the politics are not right nobody benefits .
Because otherwise there would be no end to the conflict and we would have a bloodbath with enormous tribal repercussions .
The text has been signed by members of all the groups .
If we could accept this as an oral amendment we could vote on it .
Because the situation in Croatia is far from democratic .
Mr President , concerning
