In September , at the last meeting we held , we tried to implement a three-phase process in order to achieve , by the end of 2005 , the dream of so many of us - and of so many Israeli and Palestinian citizens - of having two States which might live together in peace and have a joint future of harmony and stability .
The idea that politics rather than violence should return to the centre of gravity is extremely important .
Secondly , the change of Interior Minister , in other words , the Minister responsible for security .
In terms of what is taking place in Israel , I will tell you that this afternoon I had a telephone conversation with the new Foreign Minister , Mr Netanyahu .
Since the first informal meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers during the Danish Presidency , the European Union has maintained a clear position with three essential elements : the objective of the operation on Iraq , the way it should be carried out and our great concerns over its consequences .
Fortunately , on 12 September , even the President of the United States accepted that the debate on this extremely important problem should take place within the United Nations , and I can say that we are pleased that , from 12 September until now , there have been very serious negotiations between all the members of the Security Council in order to achieve a resolution which we hope can be unanimously approved as soon as possible .
I would like to say to you that , to a certain extent , the fact that elections in Israel have been brought forward from October next year to January is something that we can view as fundamentally positive , because it is going to allow us to begin early the whole process which should take us to the final phase of negotiations which brings about the two States we all want to see .
Mr President , I would be grateful if you could give your warning about speaking time at the beginning of the debate , and to the Commission and the Council too , so that we can all have an equal share of the little time available .
I think that this would be a major step forward .
This is , of course , largely although not entirely due , in my opinion , to the war with the Palestinians , which is incompatible with prosperity .
Mr President , I shall try to be brief in order to comply with the time requirements that the Presidency has generously set for all speakers .
Or pessimistic .
The European Union is also making a very significant and effective contribution to this debate , and this has been acknowledged by everyone , amongst the Palestinians and amongst the most intelligent strata of Israeli society , who also understand the importance of this role .
No economy , however much aid we give it , can survive unless its citizens enjoy freedom of movement .
We wanted this to be achieved under the auspices of the United Nations , and we also wanted there to be no automatic initiation of military action .
We also acknowledge , however , that there is a risk posed by weapons of mass destruction , and that this is not the problem of just one country .
Mr President , despite the scope of the decisions adopted at the Brussels Council , I shall restrict myself to making a few comments on the Communication on the mid-term review of the CAP presented by the Commission .
The result will be that 15 % of savings would be made on farms receiving between EUR 5 000 and EUR 10 000 per year .
Mr President , the resolution presented this morning in plenary is indeed the result of agreement and consensus across all the political groups within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Nonetheless , some very worrying elements remain .
The 5 % of farmers who received 50 % of direct aid in 2001 might cope with this reduction but the small and medium-sized farmers certainly cannot .
However , given the time constraints , I will concentrate on the question that concerns me most as citizen of a southern European country , namely the so-called decoupling of aid .
It states that partially decoupled aid is essential .
Parliament should not introduce any changes as this could threaten the consensus .
The Brussels Summit clarified many of the unknown quantities , especially as regards the ceiling on spending .
If this is carried out as proposed , I think the CAP would be holed below its waterline .
The so-called 1994 framework agreement was one of them .
The latter met with Commission officials the very day after the news broke .
Nonetheless , the aim of freezing the production of plutonium in Pyongyang had been achieved .
We therefore believe we must take concerted action along with our friends and allies .
The Commission will be represented by its delegation in Seoul , and will be fully supported by its Brussels services .
In our view , it should ensure that the Community of Democracies develops through objective and non-politicised criteria and procedures .
The rapporteurs have done splendid work .
The directives we are debating today will make the specific stability requirements in the Stockholm Agreement compulsory for all ro-ro ferries operating to and from Community ports .
Two of the amendments deserve special mention .
It is also hard to find anything further to say on a report like this one .
Commissioner , I am grateful to the Commission for accepting the amendments tabled by the parliamentary committee concerning Class C and D ships .
The Commission has given abundant proof of its readiness to provide swift and effective responses to all kinds of situations .
I realise this is not the most opportune moment
