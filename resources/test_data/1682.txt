I would like to thank the Commission for accepting the amendment I tabled on the need for good manufacturing practice to be followed in the preparation of the different vitamin and mineral supplements , for that is the greatest guarantee of quality in terms of consumer protection .
In particular , the insistence on the development of Europe-wide test cycles specifically for motor vehicles , but also the call to make type approval subject to confirmation of the effectiveness of the anti-pollution measures are indications of the European Parliament 's will to take firm action in such a sensitive area as this .
With regard to the document under consideration , I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party calling for the scope of the directive to include an analysis of policy developments from the viewpoints of certain categories of people such as the elderly , the disabled and other vulnerable groups .
We waste time , we confuse the European unemployed , but we do not carry out those reforms which are truly necessary and with which we are all familiar .
We all know it will not be achieved tomorrow , but we declare it achievable under certain conditions .
They are backed by weapons and police forces , whereas economic policy choices consistent with the aims I referred to earlier , supporting competition and growth , active policies on employment , investment in human capital , investment in lifelong learning , equal opportunities and regaining regional structural advantages , are very often largely dependent on commitments that are so solemnly affirmed and proclaimed but so little verified or verifiable .
As we know , the 15 Member States do not have a common economic policy so much as a group of Community guidelines , laws and prohibitions .
Faced with the challenge of globalisation , there must be more effort to give the Union common arrangements and policies based on a common history and culture , and every country must adopt a competitive flexibility .
But it remains desirable that the Union should not only determine its future arrangements rapidly but should also make the principles it repeatedly proclaims increasingly applicable , binding and consistent .
Well , if we are going to talk about practical things to be done and not just high-flown goals , Parliament should make its voice heard in a much stronger , more decisive , more rigorous way , and call urgently for a reform which leads to financially sustainable social security systems which are less unfair in terms of balance between the generations .
In conclusion , Mr President , let us talk less about goals we all agree on - who would not want Europe to be a dynamic economy ? - and a bit more about the choices , some of them painful and difficult , which need to be made as soon as possible .
Now is the time for European environmental legislation to get really serious .
I am not making this up , it is true !
I also voted against Amendment No 9 calling for no debate on this document .
Substances like Viagra are on sale .
This report also calls for a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the effects of that strategy , and an analysis of needs , so as to put in place a made-to-measure plan which takes account of overall economic policy .
In addition , we know that Turkey is hostile towards some Member States of the Union , when all they have done is recognise the Armenian genocide , which is a historical fact .
So , setting aside the past , setting aside what I represent as the heir of the Repubblica Serenissima which stood against the Turks in those days , there is very great concern , and I want to ask you , Madam President , to make absolutely certain that we are not going to have a serpent in our bosom in the near future .
It can work if the Commission uses its knowledge of existing national programmes and projects to become the promoter and monitor of open methods of cooperation between certain Member States on specific priorities , thus testing national governments ' willingness to cooperate and converge to build a European Research Area .
Secondly , the introduction in the Union - also based on some experiments in open coordination - of a system of lifelong learning and training .

The only line on which European integration policy is advancing rapidly is that of repression , because that is easy .
We should not delude ourselves that we can solve the problem by tinkering with the penalties for carriers of illegal immigrants without democratic consultation .
We cannot delude ourselves - I say this to Mr Ceyhun and Members on the left - that partial improvement - we are in favour of certain amendments - of this repressive framework can change the situation .
He is working resolutely towards high quality research , towards greater recognition of the value of the research profession and towards freedom of research .
Lambert Report ( A5-0026/2001 )
In my opinion , Europe truly exists - has the right to exist - above all when it combines the strengths of its 15 component States in order to be stronger , more effective and , in this case , more generous in its cooperation with states who find themselves in a state of want .
