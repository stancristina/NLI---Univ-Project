ridiculous and we wonder what purpose the proposed parliamentary conference will serve .
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution .     , . – The Commission communication and the Napoletano report follow on from and specify the Solana doctrine presented at the Thessaloniki summit setting the priorities for the Union 's foreign policy .
The prospect of creating a Free Trade Area is also offered , provided that they liberalise their markets and join the EU single market , in other words once the western European monopolies have been allowed to penetrate and plunder their economies .
It is concerned about the 'failure of several Member States to spend more on defence ' , which 'may jeopardise the cohesion of ΝΑΤΟ' , which 'remains not only a fundamental guarantee for the stability and security of the Euro-Atlantic area , but also an essential framework for developing joint operations ' .
Needless to add that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn the warmongers and voted against the report .     .
Why this continuing interest on the part of the ΕU ? ‘The stabilisation and association process countries’ , as they are called , ’have become the most challenging test case for a mature and effective European common foreign and security policy’ , the explanatory statement cynically admits .
They experience on the ground the increase in unemployment , shrinking incomes , the campaign against and even the abolition of the eight-hour day and their other rights as a result of the famous Lisbon agenda , the application of which is to be assessed by the Council .
The continuing occupation of Iraq is also resulting solely in increased profits and is continuing to claim victims among the Iraqi people , as well as among the conquerors and their allies as a result of the justified resistance of the Iraqi people .
I should like to make two or three brief comments about this .
Secondly , all the Member States should be represented in the Commission .
Mr Prodi , there is the development initiative to incorporate the programme on priority trans-European networks , Quick Start , which is to be discussed .
Having said which , there is the question of substance .
Woe betide if the principles and regulations of the European Union were considered to apply and that , if they were in our interest we respected them and , if we did not like them , we ignored them .
However , under no circumstances is it allowed for us to consider that it applies , but is not adhered to by those who do not like it , as is happening now .
When it was discovered that the terms of the pact were being infringed by small Member States of the European Union , such as Portugal , they were obliged to proceed to apply harsh measures and spending cuts in order to reduce their deficit to below 3 % , and none of the big Member States now in violation asked for the pact not to be applied .
The reaction is therefore reasonable on the part of the small countries , who see that ‘some are more equal than others’ , as George Orwell said .
Mrs Jensen’s report precisely concerns Parliament’s position on the alignment of rights and the simplification of procedures relating to the workers of the European Union working and living in different places , and today we have the first reading .
Essentially it touches on two fundamental matters in the European Union : the concept of the European citizen , on the one hand , and the right of free movement for workers , on the other .
I would remind the House that essentially within six months , from June to today , there have been very important efforts , exceptionally creative collaboration , and I am very satisfied that the Commission can accept most of the amendments proposed by Parliament , because approval of these amendments will allow the Council to proceed to final approval , following the reading by Parliament .
All this signals an attack on the workers .
When social security is privatised , what sort of insurance will there be for the 20 % of the population of the European Union living below the poverty line and the 8.8 % unemployed , according to the recent Eurostat study ?
We , the Communist Party of Greece , stand by their side .     .
We grieve deeply for the needless loss of human life , even of secret agents on an obscure mission , and we offer our heartfelt condolences to their families .
At the same time , it became perfectly clear that the famous solidarity , should a Member State be attacked , is not only not mandatory , but also comes very clearly under the NATO umbrella .
That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it .
The deadlines were abysmal .
At the same time , the universities are being closed , while the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is being forced to open universities and to ensure the Albanian minority , 25 % of the population , is represented in the parliament and in the government .
It is a fact that tissues and cells help on a daily basis to restore health , which is why we need to lay down a specific European framework which will guarantee supply and sufficiency and , at the same time , safeguard the physical integrity of those who receive them , of the recipients .
The demand for tissues and cells in Europe is far greater than the supply ; thus the imports necessarily being made from third countries must respect the same legislative framework , because this is the only way to prevent the illegal trade
