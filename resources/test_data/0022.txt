Other areas that I have been following with concern , such as the trafficking in human beings and human organs , were also addressed appropriately in this resolution , and that is something new and positive .
We expect their rights to be upheld in all Member States and that the Member States adopt the measures needed to combat the negative images that lead to discrimination , to hatred and to racism towards Roma and to combat ‘Romaphobia’ in all its forms , at local , regional , national or European level .     .
That is where the differences are clear and well-documented .     .
More jobs and economic growth are promised , but the impact of the increasingly financial focus of the economy is shown in stark relief by the high number of financial crises at both regional and world level and by the drain of investment from production to capitalisation and speculation .     .
The socio-economic situation in some of the regions most reliant on the sector is serious and could become even worse if the Commission and the Council continue to shirk their responsibilities .     – All possible measures should be taken to preserve the film industry in EU Member States and accord it the value it merits , given that it represents historical , cultural and human heritage .
The important thing is for Europe to compete with them , on a level of quality that is at least comparable .
The possibility of keeping the opt-out would mean that the Union would be adopting a directive on delicate aspects of minimum standards to be met in the area of health and safety at work , and yet would be also saying in the same directive that compliance with those standards is entirely optional .
Lastly , as regards working time and rest time , there is no reason for Parliament not to abide by the rulings made by the Court of Justice .
What Europe needs to do is to set an example when it comes to protecting rights , and not to veer towards Asian standards in the name of flexibility and competition .     .
The fact that the EU has signed up to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants ( UPOV ) is a positive step towards striking the right balance between the interests of breeders and farmers in terms of reasonable protection of breeders ’ property rights regarding new varieties of plants .
We voted in favour of the report concluding the agreement between the EC and Switzerland on the latter’s participation in the European Environment Agency ( EEA ) and the European Environment Information and Observation Network .
In this context , as in others , dealing with practical reality cuts across geopolitical borders .     .
Whilst this is true , it is not the main reason to vote against the Commission ’s proposal .
According to those studies , the dangers of faecal contamination to children ( the most vulnerable group ) are caused by various bacteria .
We do object , however , to removing the distinction between coastal waters and inland waters , as this would mean that certain bathing areas in Portugal , such as river beaches , would be reclassified as unclean , despite the fact that they are fit for use , and have not given rise to public health problems .
On 21 April , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety adopted 34 amendments to the Council common position on the management of bathing water quality .
The Portuguese coastline stretches for many miles , and bathing in the water is a very popular pastime .
Adopting these two amendments would have serious repercussions for Portugal , given the disproportionate costs involved in relation to the benefits gained .     .
Broadly speaking , the report deals more with the companies themselves than with the repercussions of mergers on the lives of workers and regions , although it does mention that the draft terms of the merger should include the effects of the merger on employment and the opinion of the employees .
The establishment of the ‘legal requirement ’ to deposit the master copy is a further welcome measure in preserving people’s collective memory and identity .
It is also crucial , I feel , to examine the costs involved in the proposed measures and who is to pay , in order to ensure a level playing field for all concerned .     .
Although it is not Parliament’s job to become involved in national-level judicial processes , these values are so important that I shall be voting in favour .     . – In my opinion , Parliament should vote in favour of appointing Mr Smaghi to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) , in line with the draft recommendation drawn up by Mrs Berès .
Whilst it is true that the Stability and Growth Pact comprises a pillar for preventing and a pillar for remedying , it is also true that this political , economic and financial instrument must be implemented across the board .
This forms part of the new framework adopted by the Council for supervising , monitoring and remedying fiscal imbalances .
In the current version , a number of situations – salaried and liberal professions , temporary provision of services and the so-called ‘regulated ’ professions , such as doctors , nurses and architects – are covered , albeit from different perspectives .
We also welcome ‘the introduction of an effective system for managing market crises in order to prevent abandonment of the sector in the face of major price collapses’ .
This is one of the most dangerous aspects of the attacks on workers ’ rights and jeopardises the gains made in a
