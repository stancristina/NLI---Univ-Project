third countries an incentive to comply with the political and economic requirements that form part of agreements .
We must strike a balance in bilateral dialogues , whereby we can still exert pressure but have reciprocity and genuine dialogue as a cornerstone .
In addition , the continuing increase in air traffic will increase the problems at airports , and this will have adverse effects on effectiveness , competitiveness and the environment .
The Commission 's proposals are insufficient , however , and so my report proposes that the Commission draw up , by 2009 , a master plan for enhanced airport capacity in Europe .
The master plan is to be an instrument , or method , to ensure that Member States coordinate their initiatives to promote and expand airport capacity .
Airports have different characteristics , different strengths , but interaction is important .
I should like to thank both the Commission and the spokespeople of the other political groups - Mr El Khadraoui , Mr Jarzembowski , Mr López-Istúriz White and Mrs Lichtenberger - for their extremely constructive cooperation on this report , and I am pleased that Parliament is able to present a clear message showing widespread support in the matters of both capacity and liberalisation of the 'ground handling ' Directive .
They create growth and prosperity , and provide a link between regions , but they also generate noise and pollution and take up space .
It is important , then , that problems be handled in a way appropriate to all parties concerned .
Firstly , we propose promoting environmentally friendly capacity expansion .
Consequently , I also welcome the Commission initiative to incorporate aviation into the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme .
Secondly , it is important for the Commission to follow up on countries ' implementation of the common rules for the allocation of slots .
There must be substantial improvements in this area by 2008 - this is a high priority for Parliament .
It is important , therefore , to establish a dialogue among those European regions with an airport on coordination of capacity expansion .
What are the spatial development plans ?
I hope the Council will support the basic ideas in this report , namely that the Commission 's action plan is insufficient , that guidelines must be developed for optimising and developing airport capacity , that additional capacity is nevertheless required , and that words must be accompanied by action .
The second part of my report concerns ground handling - that is , all the handling surrounding the aeroplane and in the airport , from fuelling and baggage handling to the check-in procedure .
Here , the Commission is preparing for a revision of the existing Directive on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports , which , as we know , is a thorny issue .
We agree that the Commission should carry out an updated analysis of the implementation and impact of the current 'ground handling ' Directive before we put any new liberalisation on the agenda .
We must ensure that there are no monopolistic conditions and that there are clear rules for calls for tender in order to involve users .
Carbon storage is of great significance in connection with the reduction of greenhouse gases .
That is therefore an issue that requires an international initiative .
It is very good that the European Parliament has endorsed the examination of the possible use of the 'polluter pays ' principle under Article 22 , and the assessment of land use under Article 28 , given its great significance in connection with carbon sequestration .
Madam President , if we were to exclude all the countries that had breached the rules of monetary union , there would soon not be many members left .
Inflation is now at around 3.6 % , even though 2 % was promised .
Monetary union is based on a design fault .
How crazy !
The price of money is a means , not an end .
Monetary and currency policy must help people , not plunge them into poverty .
Every single citizen in the monetary union could have been EUR 38 000 better off with a different policy if the growth rate in Europe had only matched that in the United States before the latest crisis .
We must either have a common state with a common government and a common parliament with responsibility for all economic policy , or we must allow the individual countries to manage their own currencies and be content with a common currency with which to finance cross-border trade .
Without reforms , it is not difficult to foresee the breakdown of monetary union .
Perhaps it will be Berlusconi 's Italy who will fall overboard first and have to rediscover the lira .
I am pleased that we still have the good old Danish krone in Denmark !
The Danes voted 'no ' on 2 June 1992 .
I wonder whether , if we do not also vote 'no ' for a third time , the politicians will offer to take the money from us .
It is a step in the right direction - not a big step , but a step nonetheless .
Lobbyists have a major influence within the EU system .
However , the report could be better and the controls on lobbyists could be strengthened if you were to adopt the amendment proposal , which is partly an extension of the statement from the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We must have a register and an ethical code of conduct for all lobbyists , including legal companies carrying out lobbying , that can enter into force before the elections in 2009 .
We must have effective controls and visible sanctions to be imposed on those who breach the adopted rules .
However , it is also a matter of looking inwards .
