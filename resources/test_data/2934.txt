to ask the Council whether it is aware of the enormous contradiction that is involved in aiming for a rapid implementation of the EMU and the complete inability to deal with taxation , a matter with far-reaching effects on the economy and on employment .
Unemployment does however not a constitute a barrier to joining the EMU, since EMU not only improves competition but also increases demand , which helps maintain employment .
Economic and monetary union is a natural extension to the internal market , since full benefit from the internal market can only be achieved through co-operation and convergence within economic and monetary union .
By fulfilling the EMU criteria stability can be achieved .
The political decision-making within the economy , regarding both exchange rates and interest rates , will decrease , and this reduces the benefits of not joining the third stage .
Price stability has to be regarded as an essential objective both within and outside monetary union .
I hope that the Commissioner will see that this is implemented and aim at finding a solution to the situation as soon as possible .
Large Member States play a significant role in this .
The interest rate is a good example of the above .
Finland has discussed joining the European exchange rate mechanism .
In EMU discussions we are talking about necessary savings within the public sector .
The private sector in particular , where there is money , should invest and also spend .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner .
In his report Mr Kofoed deals with the situation of the Baltic salmon in a most creditable way .
There is a danger that entire salmon stocks will become extinct .
Finland , for example , now has such salmon stocks in just two rivers , Tornionjoki and Simojoki .
It is very positive that the necessity to regenerate fish stocks , an issue which is not very well known within the European Union , is included in Mr Kofoed 's report .
Well looked-after fish stocks are of great importance to tourism in Finnish Lapland .
The strengthening of Tornionjoki 's position as a salmon river is to be regarded as good from the point of view of both regional and environmental policy .
I feel that we are here today on the right track on this issue .
I would therefore once more request the Commission to underline the importance of competition , and to make its opinion known on the present situation , where acquisitions in the retail trade clearly have been made at a price considerably higher than the market price .
Mr President , following a virtually unanimous request put forward by lawyers , the Commission has presented a proposal for a directive , which we are now discussing .
I consider this free movement to include not only the free movement of practising lawyers , but also the actual freedom to offer one 's services .
The Commission has however chosen to give a special sectoral directive and to maintain the principle on a restrictive aptitude test .
The purpose of these amendments is to increase the opportunities for a lawyer of one Member State to establish himself in another Member State .
We have therefore presented amendments with the purpose of emphasizing that each lawyer has the right to move to a Member State other than where he has qualified for the profession and to practise the profession in accordance with the regulations of the host Member State .
Not only economic growth but also co-operation between governments and employers ' organisations and trades unions is required in the fight against unemployment .
We have to be able to agree jointly on a policy which would channel economic growth into investments .
It should not be forgotten that we also need to invest in research and education in Europe .
NATO 's decision concerning the possibility of using NATO forces in European operations also fits into the whole picture .
In today 's Europe non-alliance should not be seen as a way of avoiding responsibility , but could instead increase stability and security .
Russia has gone through the first round of its first democratic election and we await the second round .
Since we are hoping that the development of democracy in Russia and other CIS countries will progress , the approval of this regulation is of the utmost importance .
As a practical tool for this work we have the TACIS programme , the development and improved practical applicability of which is the subject of the regulation amendment now being discussed .
Parliament on the other hand has worked within the schedule given , and drawn up a report of its own , the content of which is very good .
A speedy acceptance of the TACIS programme is however essential , which should also be the aim of Parliament 's efforts .
Nor should it be forgotten that these programmes should be implemented in co-operation with regional authorities in Russia and other CIS countries .
The present central position of Moscow in these programmes should be abandoned , and the planning and implementation of the programmes should be transferred to the regions which are in practice carrying out the programmes .
In this regard I would like to put a question to the Commissioner .
I assume that the discussions tonight will be very brief .
The question should be resolved over two separate time spans .
The future of the Nordic Passport Union has to be safeguarded within the next few months of negotiations between the Schengen countries and the Nordic countries .
A pragmatic and realistic solution to the problem is about to be reached .
Similar rights for Iceland and Norway to veto decisions is of course not on the agenda .
On the other hand it is not acceptable to give up the passport exemption clause which has worked for decades
