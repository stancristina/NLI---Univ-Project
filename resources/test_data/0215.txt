For the High Representative , too , that is surely also one of the most important issues that needs to be addressed , namely to ensure that , in these new international multilateral institutions , we also achieve an appropriate new regulation and new distribution of influence and power , where the European Union is not restricted , but where there is acceptance of the fact that there are also new global players .

We have strict rules .
Instead , we expect the Member States to begin to transpose it into national law as early as January of next year .
As I said at the beginning of the debate , we will set the wheels in motion tomorrow .
