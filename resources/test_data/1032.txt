If all of these are not reasons to protect women under international law , then what are ?
The question I would like to ask the Commissioner is to what extent the Commission and the institutions of the European Union are failing to fulfil their duty when they do not propose or adopt Community legislation to prevent this accumulation of solid waste , which is currently making it very difficult to organise the work – in cities , for example – with enormous costs for local authorities in terms of providing these resources .
I would therefore ask that this mistaken decision be reconsidered .
That would make it completely useless .
We are not holding up the transposition of regulations : it is the ministers and their governments who have to obey you .
Finally , Mr President , as well as our group ’s belief in the importance of the step forward in terms of European defence , in relation to external relations I would like to say that my group welcomes and supports the decision of this Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy to award the Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan , to the United Nations staff who have died and also in memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello .
I feel frustration , Mr President , because I have the feeling that we are going to see over the coming days an attempt to reopen all the issues dealt with in the Convention .
Well this has not happened .
I therefore believe that the Intergovernmental Conference must concentrate on genuinely political issues , which have not yet been resolved , on which there is no consensus between the governments and which are very simple : the presidency of the Council and the rotating presidencies , the weighting of votes and the distribution of seats in the European Parliament and the number of Commissioners .
However much it is proposed to increase the legislative competences of the European Parliament , it will still be the governments of the States in the Councils who will give the go-ahead to European laws and regulations which will then be obligatory for everybody .
I believe , Mr President , that this is an aspect of the problem which should not be avoided .
I believe , Mr President , that we must place the emphasis on the fundamental rather than on the peripheral .
The development of a free Europe without borders is one side of the coin ; on the other side are the management of external borders and movement of people .
To the wave of 528 immigrants who a few days ago landed on the Andalusian coasts and in the Canary Islands , we must also add the approximately 70 who , it appears , have died trying to reach the coasts of Sicily .
That amendment called for the recognition of the right to asylum for women who suffer serious persecution and violations of their human rights .
That is because , unfortunately , over the last ten years – as you well know – specifically in Ciudad Juárez , more than 320 bodies of women and girls have appeared .
The President-in-Office of the Council has stressed the special nature of the outermost regions , based on Article 299( 2 ) of the EC Treaty , but , on seeing the projects approved by the Commission , I note that there is only one which could involve the outermost regions , and that is the one relating to sea motorways .
Hence the report – at risk of being accused of utopianism – calls on the governments of both parties and those of all the countries in the Middle East to implement a new educational policy based on the notion of education for peace and geared towards promoting mutual tolerance and understanding between the different cultures and religions .
While this is being achieved , however , we must confront the inescapable reality of the situation , and we do so condemning the terrorist violence of Palestinian factions , as well the Israelis ’ use of excessive military force against the Palestinian people .
Apparently alarmed by the resonance of the so-called Geneva Accord , the peace initiative produced as a result of joint Israeli-Palestinian efforts , Sharon has stated that the Roadmap is the only hope of making progress towards peace with Palestinians .
Even so , as a European , I would insist – and I will end here – that I naturally entirely support the Roadmap , but the report recommends that , in the event that this Roadmap is deadlocked in the immediate future , and in view of the grave consequences that would have , causing greater suffering for Israelis and Palestinians , new options be provided for , in particular , the establishment of an international mandate under the authority of the Quartet in Palestine , which may even include an international force on the ground .     Mr President , Commissioner , a few days ago , on 16 October , the Prime Minister of Malaysia , Mahathir Mohamed , at the Summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , stated that the Jews control the world by proxy .
Almost five months have passed and , over these five months , too many things have happened in those countries .
The European Union now needs to make its voice heard in relation to the conflict which has the greatest effect on our current and future stability .
For example , in paragraph 4 it says that the Palestinian Authority is congratulated on having publicly and unconditionally accepted the Roadmap , when we know – and we have evidence of this – that Arafat , having rejected peace in Taba , has refused to accept any measure which may undermine his power , both in relation to
