Madame President , we too support this proposal .
There are a few things which need to be tightened up to improve animal welfare , in both the 1991 and the 1995 directive .
The reasons are , first , the very great risk of infection amongst living animals and , second , animal welfare .
This puts the animals under stress , sometimes so much so that they die in transit .
This may be a sign that a different approach is needed in this field .
Likewise , border controls must also be tightened .
And last but not least , there is a need for commercial arguments which can help improve animal welfare .
Of course , animals can be slaughtered and then transported .
I believe that the Parliament should not merely pass legislation which retains the old system , but should also think slightly ahead , and so I think that Parliament should discuss this matter at the Agricultural Committee and in other committees in future .
I think this is a step in the right direction , but , as I said , I think we should continue working on this matter .
Mr President , one of the points made in Mrs Weiler 's report on modernizing and improving social security in the European Union is that people should be actively seeking work to be entitled to claim social security benefit .
In her introduction to today 's debate , Barbara Weiler said that she did not think the EMU convergence criteria were an obstacle to reasonable social security .
Just think of the massive demonstrations that have taken place in some of the Member States , where welfare cuts in preparation for EMU have been so serious that people have turned out to protest against them .
In Denmark we have a relatively large public sector , and most welfare benefits are still a national responsibility .
But people are uncertain about the future of the social security system , not least because of the preparations for EMU, where the Danish government is of course trying to meet the criteria , even though Denmark will not be joining phase three of EMU.
As far as the Treaty of Amsterdam is concerned , I am very pleased that the Council still has to achieve unanimity on social security issues , but I would rather it was not just Great Britain and Germany doing the blocking .
Clearly that is not what the Danish negotiators are saying in the Council .
Madame President , I would like to thank Mr Areitio Toledo for the support he has given us and I am sorry he is not in the Chamber today .
I would like to start with a few general comments on the Commission 's implementation of competition policy .
Effective , transparent and predictable management of competition policy is a guarantee of a successful single market .
But , at the same time , I see many challenges to competition policy today .
But let me say that decentralizing competition policy assumes effective , stringent control on the Commission 's part , and the Commission must always be the body which ensures certainty in law .
In the face of globalization , it is also essential that the new countries of Eastern and Central Europe fully enact , implement and abide by the EU 's competition rules .
Extending the Union will necessarily mean that we are undermining our own rules or the European culture of competition .
I am very pleased that the rapporteur has stated that government support both distorts and is totally incompatible with the principles of the single European market .
It is like believing in Father Christmas for some of the Member States to try to prop up unviable businesses or sectors .
Finally , I would like to express deep concern about the group exemptions proposed for certain categories of government support .
I would like to ask the chairman of the Court of Auditors when we will actually get an investigation into the European Parliament ?
My second question , Mr President , concerns the ruling by the Court , where I think we are still not answering the question of why there are so many errors in the payments .
We are failing to have it clarified whether it is actually the Court of Appeal 's method which is at fault , whether it is the Commission 's system of controls which is at fault or whether it is simply the Member States .
Who is responsible for the way things are , and how large a margin of error does the Court of Auditors think is acceptable in the first place ?
Mr President , I read the Court of Appeal 's report with pleasure this year , because I cannot see Denmark mentioned in the report as we were in other years and that is pleasing .
But there is one thing on which I would very much like to have an answer from Mr Friedman : is it the case that we are pumping a mass of EU funds into the Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund without us having any way of seeing what the money is used for ?
Finally , I would say that , until I came down here , I used to read an incredible number of detective novels , and now that I read our annual reports I find that my need for excitement is satisfied .
Mr President , we find today that it was right to set up a monitoring committee .
We can say that roughly two-thirds of Parliament 's demands have been met .
I would like to name some of them briefly .
We have made the fight against BSE more transparent , we got a comprehensive information policy so that we could spread information on the results of
