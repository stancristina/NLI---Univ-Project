More than 28 women having been executed since 1990 .
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Hermange on the quality of her report and also on her generosity in accepting the amendments presented in committee , which will have contributed to enriching the report but , above all , in taking on board the differing sensitivities in dealing with measures for combating a possible situation of inequality : the inequality resulting from disability .
Mr President , it may seem surprising that we on the left congratulate the rapporteur and welcome his report , but we are convinced by its content .
The rapporteur also speaks of the risks which today are of great concern to the population and which relate to the health effects of mobile telephones and mobile communications in general , with the tall masts that are now all over our towns producing electromagnetic waves .
I assume that Commissioner Bolkestein will be aware that the Court of Justice has already set the precedent of annulling an interpretative communication similar to this one , on pension funds , precisely because the Commission exceeded its authority .
I would therefore ask the Commissioner what measures the Commission intends to present in order to allow the Member States which are working to open up and privatise their economies to free competition to preserve the objective of that privatisation ?
We therefore urge that the relevant legislation be updated , with the due participation of this Parliament , and that this should take place , on the one hand , to eliminate these positions of privilege and , on the other hand , to safeguard the actions of the Member States , which have behaved in accordance with the process of the opening up of markets , which are liberalising them and which need the relevant guarantees so that the companies which enter into this European internal market have all the safeguards resulting from being a part of it .
For us it is absolutely crucial that there should be a balance between job creation , competitiveness and social cohesion .
We criticise the United States a lot because President Bush has unilaterally denounced the Kyoto Protocol , but we never ask ourselves why he has done so .
We should do so at the start of the American Presidency in order to achieve a balanced , positive relationship .
Mr President , I should like to begin by pointing out on the positive side that the Stockholm European Council has emphasised the strategy drawn up in Lisbon , and has even added to and strengthened it in certain concrete matters .
Mr President , I intervene in the same sense as my colleague to stress that in the draft resolution in the Blak report - and of course I am intervening after checking with the rapporteur - I want to state for the record first that it is the English version that is authentic .
Mr President , I think there has been a problem with the translations into Spanish , because in the Folias report too , there are clear differences between the English text , which is the authentic one , and the Spanish text .
Secondly , the Lamfalussy report tries to solve this problem by delegating the drawing up of enforcement measures to a stocks and shares committee in which the Council and Commission do not lose an iota of the power they had , while Parliament ' s power is cut back .
In exchange , we have seen concrete and fragmentary proposals - I do not want to return to the debate we had in the previous sitting - from each Member State , which in this case we cannot accept at all , either now or in the future .
Tell us how you intend to move forward .
We must begin to find answers to these questions now , and fast !
I hope that we Members of Parliament , the Commission and the Council will rise to the occasion and succeed in offering European citizens and those who legally wish to live in our territory precisely what we set forth in the recent Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I must stress the need to combat illegal immigration and the vital importance of all the measures being taken to prevent the trade in human beings , the constant deaths in the Straits of Gibraltar , the fight against Mafia-like organisations and the exploitation of these people economically and in the workplace .
But the fact is that I asked a question on a concrete case of human rights , relating to the use of Euskera [Basque ] - the so-called lingua navarrorum - in the Autonomous Community of Navarre , and the Commission replied that as language rights are a subject not in force in the Charter of Human Rights at a European level , complaints can only be made at the level of national institutions and courts .
In view of this situation , when and how does the Council intend to draw the Saudi government into dialogue on human rights for women ?
Would it not be fairer for fishermen to catch fish in accordance with their respective fishing quotas in one unified zone ?
The amendments presented to the House were approved unanimously and incorporated suggestions from other Groups , and right from the beginning I could see that when Mrs Sanders-ten Holte was faced with a Member arguing about legal uncertainties it was clear to her that we should press on and avoid delaying tactics , because above all we had to consider passengers ' interests .
If , one day , citizens are compensated by airlines for their delays , we will have gained a lot of credibility .
The report intends to strengthen the wording of the rule to oblige
