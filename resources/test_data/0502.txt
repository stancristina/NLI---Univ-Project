We also said , however , that the European Union 's attitude , when compared with those of other countries - basically the United States - was the clearest and most forceful option to take in the face of climate change and in defence of the environment .
The report also gives us a clear idea of the problems which exist in implementing our common foreign and security policy .
Those personnel not only have to travel from their own countries very quickly , they also need to be prepared , and prepared for the specific circumstances , because otherwise we shall be too late .
But if I had submitted it - since I was going to ask for the Court of Auditors ' report to be published in the Official Journal - the result would have been that the report would have been delayed for six months ; and the report is a good one , and therefore needed to be approved as soon as possible .
We had also submitted a question which basically expresses the same concern as our fellow-Members ' questions , and that is : why do we not put these implementing measures into practice , why do we not have analyses approved at European level , and why do we not have proper labels which will enable consumers to choose ?
In any event , Madam Commissioner , I believe that all our fellow-Members here have expressed a reasonable concern on the part of the people of the European Union , who do not want to take the risk of consuming products which are a health risk .
What is at stake is the most basic of all human rights , Mr President : the right to live .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is painful to have once again to begin one of our part-sessions by reminding ourselves that , using the force of the word , we are pitted against the force of arms and the force of murder .
Mr President , the report we are debating today represents a great leap forward , because we are now closer to the highly desirable aim of liberalizing Community railways , in such a way as to permit their revitalization in terms of competition with other methods of transport .
Until we succeed in converting routes like Madrid-Lisbon to high speed , our railways will fail to enter the twenty-first century .
However , the Commission must realize that it has to respect what has already been agreed between the unions and the Spanish Government .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr President of the Commission , the debate on transatlantic relations always contains elements of great political interest .
Their legitimate eagerness to help people gain their freedom has sometimes resulted in unusual laws , claiming national security or external threats as a sacrosanct excuse , and leading ( in the case of Cuba for example ) to bilateral relations being placed in a delicate situation .
And I should like to remind the Commission that , on our part , the New Transatlantic Agenda should also take account of the development of the whole American continent , to which we are bound by a wide range of agreements , of varying importance , which will facilitate the great Atlantic market .
However , although we are small in political terms , in the economic sphere , when we act in unison , we are the greatest commercial , financial and industrial power on the planet .
Let us not be naive .
I would like to ask whether , in order to reach those prestigious orchestras which have not yet received sufficient assistance , you envisage setting up agreements with different bodies to make sure that subsidiarity itself does not prevent us from attaining that objective , through lack of musical culture .
That is not the right way to work on anything , but especially not on culture .
What is European unity ?
We will bear that in mind , and as regards the programme we are going to present on 1 May , I have taken note of the wish expressed here , which I absolutely agree with .
All I am going to do is wait for them to send me the list .
And obviously , if a Member State fails to respect the Commission 's decision , the appropriate steps will be taken .
Obviously , that is a very important event in the United Kingdom , but it is probably of less interest in Spain or Greece .
The answer is obvious .
I agree with that European Parliamentary resolution .
I will be very brief , Mr Howitt , because I am not sure whether I have not understood you , or whether you do not wish to understand me .
There must have been a misunderstanding here .
Faced with a problem of this nature - the problem of the growing risk and increased incidence of all types of communicable disease emerging in Europe and elsewhere - we do not see how the Council and the Commission can fail to agree with Parliament , so that we can design appropriate Community instruments .
We do not understand why they should be so little inclined to increase these demands , which represent a practical and heartfelt necessity which would benefit all our citizens .
Even in the hospitals , the medical staff themselves had failed to attach enough importance to cross-infections , which has led to a major increase in this problem .
And once again in this Parliament , we must reject them outright , because they contravene the spirit and the letter of the Treaties , and are an obvious misrepresentation which this Parliament will never be able to accept .
It always tries to keep a low profile , although that
