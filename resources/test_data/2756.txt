The value added , the commercial potential of every connection is going up all the time .
In remote areas the potential for remote shopping and remote services is going to be much enhanced in the new world we are living in .
It is right to keep that under review and not to make a significant change at the moment .
Mr President , I too should like to congratulate Mr van Velzen on an excellent report .
I totally support his emphasis on the need to protect the European consumer .
We must at all costs ensure that the revolution in technology benefits everyone equally and that we do not create an information underclass .
We also need more transparency , especially in roaming and international tariffs .
I believe we should be looking at making invoices much clearer , for example , so that the consumer can tell whether he or she has chosen the right tariff .
Where I differ with the rapporteur , however , is with his concerns on spectrum auctions .
Auctions are a fast , transparent , fair and economically efficient way of allocating the scarce resources of radio spectrum .
Governments should not be trying to judge who will be innovative and successful .
Industry , not government , is best placed to judge the opportunities offered by third-generation mobile telephony .
In the debate today and in committee criticisms have been levelled at allocating spectrum through auctions .
It has been suggested that auctions are simply a device to provide extra money for governments .
That is wrong .
The fact that they raise money is subordinate to other aims such as fairness and economic efficiency .
A well-defined auction with well-informed bidders ensures that licences are awarded to operators that can generate greatest economic benefit .
It has also been claimed that licence costs will just be passed on to the consumer .
I do not believe so .
Auctions allow the market to determine the commercial value of scarce radio spectrum .
More importantly , they give greater opportunities to new market entrants .
Beauty contests often favour incumbents with established track records .
Auctions are fairer than picking winners , which can be more subjective and less transparent .
To conclude , what we are trying to do is to ensure that the EU maintains its position as the world leader in mobile telephony .
The only way to maintain the EU 's global lead in this sector is by maintaining a balance between regulation and innovation and not ruling any option out .
I believe this report will help us reach this goal .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I should be grateful if the ashtrays could be removed again from outside the Chamber .
The President asked for them to be removed and they were removed .
People stopped smoking out there and they have now been returned .
I understand that somebody has ordered their return , against the President 's wishes .
As I keep on having asthma attacks , I hope they will be removed again .
Mr President , I do not want to delay the House , but colleagues may recall that on 14 February there was some discussion at the opening of the part-session regarding a broadcast on the Today programme and Mr Kirkhope , who is a Member of this House .
I should like to read the following apology which was broadcast by the BBC last Monday : " On February 14 2000 , the BBC broadcast a report about a new Register of Members ' interests in the European Parliament , making particular reference to the interests declared by the Conservative Chief Whip , Mr Timothy Kirkhope .
The report , which was later referred to on BBC News , contained a number of inaccuracies .
Mr Kirkhope has not turned himself into a political consultant and has not and does not lobby the European Parliament .
In addition , the BBC report implied that he will for a fee advise on how to handle things in the European Parliament which the BBC accepts is not the case .
The BBC is happy to make this clear and has apologised to Mr Kirkhope for the errors . "
Mr President , it is very relevant indeed because this broadcast followed a week in which the BBC spent a very large sum of public money lobbying the European Parliament about the very report we have just voted on .
Mr President , just for the benefit of Members regarding the last statement made by Mr McMillan-Scott .
If they do not come from the United Kingdom the words " BBC " do not stand for Blair 's Broadcasting Corporation , but many of us seem to think it does .
Mr President , I make this point of order now , whilst everybody is leaving .
I hope that , as well as recording exactly what Mr McMillan-Scott said within his brief explanation of the BBC apology , that two Members - one of the British Labour delegation and one of the British Liberal delegation - who made similar allegations following the broadcast actually now write to Mr Kirkhope and apologise to him personally .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Report McCormick ( A5-0151/2000 )
- I warmly welcome my colleague Anneli Hulth√©n 's recommendation for tighter controls on substances depleting the ozone layer .
This will introduce new controls to the agreement reached at Montreal in 1987 and will provide a higher degree of control of trade in ozone-depleting substances .
When thousands of people from Britain hit the beaches and slap on their suntan lotion to sunbathe this summer , there will be something different in the air .
There will be a measure to prevent the hole in the ozone from becoming any larger .
People will therefore be better protected from getting scorched or going blind from glaring sunlight through an
