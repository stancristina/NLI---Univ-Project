might say that in the situation in Kosovo we saw that we were not prepared .
Obviously , we have to work in cooperation with the UNHCR , as in the Kosovo situation .
At Tampere we in fact agreed some very far-reaching aims .
Now I would like to speak on certain other matters that have been raised here .
Firstly , the Charter of Fundamental Rights : will it be a political act or a draft for a new constitution .
But that will not prevent us from raising the question at some stage that the Union needs some sort of constitution , into which fundamental rights should be written .
I hope that it will acquire a prestigious chairman .
We were charged with the task at the Cologne Summit .
They were discussed on the evening before the meeting at Tampere .
The President of the Republic of Finland , Martti Ahtisaari , spoke on the subject , considering it necessary that the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , the Secretary-General of NATO , Javier Solana , and Balkans representative , Bodo Hombach , should now work together more effectively to safeguard both the implementation of the Stability Pact and , obviously , the progress in practical matters , such as cooperation between Pristina and Thessaloniki .
As for the Obnova regulation , the Council will carefully look into Parliament ' s draft amendments .
I hope this will also be one of those issues that will be settled during the Finnish presidential term , signifying that we have , as it were , got beyond this problem of the institutions , and that is what our citizens actually expect .
They were the Minister for the Interior , the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs .
Generally , what was achieved at Tampere is founded on our adherence to transparency , and we did not , for example , at the last moment produce any surprises for governments or Parliament .
Everything was known ; our draft agenda was available to all .
The conclusions of Tampere will improve further the European Parliament ' s practical opportunities for involvement and monitoring .
The constructive and active nature of the conclusions of Tampere will provide Parliament with better opportunities to participate in the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice .
I would like to thank Mr Suominen for the advice on terminology .
Regarding transparency , may I be so bold as to remind everyone that in the Treaty of Amsterdam it was Finland that proposed a change to the paradigm .
Until then , it was a principle in the Union that documents were not generally public , although there were exceptions .
Now the question is whether all the institutions , within the framework of their own responsibility , will put this principle into practice and whether the Commission will actually make proposals for acts on these issues .
As the country to hold the presidency , we have drafted a certain sort of agenda for that meeting , which comprises all the action required of the conclusions of Tampere , which is to say , what needs to be done , who is to do it , and according to what timetable .
We have to really take the decisions reached there seriously and start work accordingly .
It is a pity that the report contains no 'onions ' , as institutional differentiation would seem to be the only realistic solution for a Union that is expanding fast .
In the future Europe must comprise three institutional circles .
The second circle would be the European Union , which would develop as an association of states in the future .
The inner circle would be the Federation of Europe , made up of an integrated group of EU states that had progressed the furthest : those that belong to NATO and the euro area .
With the proposal for a directive , the commercial use of electronic signatures takes a step forward , but there is still a long way to go .
In addition to the EU draft directive , the International Chamber of Commerce and the OECD have made recommendations on this issue .
An important recommendation has been made on an organisation to promote global electronic commerce , Global Information Infrastructure .
It would be to the European Union ' s benefit to establish an international organisation .
I regret , however , that for most asylum-seekers , the only way to get into the Union is still an illegal one .
Our Group welcomes the increased efforts to fight money-laundering and trafficking of human beings .
But we insist that increased powers for Europol must be accompanied by equally increased democratic safeguards at Union level to ensure respect for civil rights .
The Greens think that the status of third-country nationals needs to be further improved beyond the Tampere proposals .
The EU believes that the CTBT is an important step in the promotion of non-proliferation and the decommissioning of weapons , and its entry into force will be to the benefit of all countries .
The disappointment felt as a result of the decision was expressed , while it was still fresh in everybody ' s mind , in the statement presented by the country to hold the presidency of the European Union on 13 October .
There was also a resolution on the banning of nuclear testing passed at the Tampere Summit .
In assessing the significance of what has happened , we should point out that President Clinton still assures us that he is doing his best to have the United States ratify the Treaty as soon as possible .
There is a long history of trying to ban nuclear testing , stretching back to the 1950s .
