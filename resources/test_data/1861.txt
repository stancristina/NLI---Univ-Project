its liver swell , and increased beef production by means of Caesarian operation .
It is incomprehensible that a civilized international community can permit the existence of a totally unnatural breed of cattle to exist by means of repeated Caesarian operations , where the calf is pulled from the animal by cutting it open .
It is quite appalling that we should be creating economic advantages for businesses that treat animals inhumanely and cruelly in the name of the free market .
That is why we ought to try and reduce the number of animals being transported .
I hope that the decree will be debated and got through speedily .
This really ought to be stopped .
I think the only solution is for the EU to cut the refund made for the export of live animals .
This is obviously a difficult problem .
Mr Virrankoski mentioned that European values include a respect for animals .
Madam President , we must remember that the Union has decreed that community funds can be used in relation to the transportation of animals as long as their welfare is respected .
It rightly outraged the Finnish people .
Not all drivers ' morals live up to the spirit of the decree , clearly .
What is obviously happening in the transportation of animals sometimes , perhaps often , is that the conditions and welfare of the animals are being neglected , and thus spot checks and added vigilance are needed .
The bearer of a transportation permit must clearly be responsible for his load .
The export refund on live animals fits in with Union policy incredibly badly .
So the question is : when can we put an end to this refund ?
Today we have heard that overproduction of beef in the EU area , as a result , for example , of BSE , is the commonly given reason for the transportation of live animals and the export refund .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report , and in furthering its aims we hope to heighten our respect for animals , not only on paper , but also in industry .
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , there have been both social and political problems in fulfilling the criteria for EMU among present Member States .
How do you think social upheaval and other problems can be prevented in these countries while they are taking a series of harsh measures in preparation for membership ?
This is obviously an emotionally delicate issue , but , nevertheless , I would like to stress the practicalities of the matter .
You cannot have a hundred and twenty different coins circulating in the EU area .
And the visually impaired , of whom there are more than ten million , would certainly come off the worst as a result .
The report is otherwise excellent .
Mr President , I support the Commission 's motion to continue with Altener 1 .
The most obvious ways of reducing carbon dioxide emissions are the increased use of nuclear and hydro-electric power .
If a one-thousand megawatt coal-powered station were replaced by just one nuclear power plant , the carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by six million tonnes a year , which is no small amount .
We must also remember that all forms of energy production , including renewable , have an adverse effect on the environment .
Fifteen per cent of electricity produced in Finland comes from fuel with a timber origin .
Wind power , again , works best in localized contexts , where it can produce small amounts of electricity : on islands and in coastal areas .
Although I advocate research generally , I cannot give my approval in this case .
Visions of the future of renewable energy sources do not depend on financial input , as their status in the whole field of energy will never be anything more than marginal .
Mr President , in my opinion Mrs Weiler 's report is excellent , in that it very clearly reflects the importance of a high level of social protection for European growth , competitiveness , and welfare .
The Nordic experience tells us that public services are often of higher quality as well as more cost-effective from the national point of view than private services .
Common services for all the people also guarantee that everyone , rich or poor , gets high-quality service .
Madam President , first of all I would like to point out that it is extremely important for the Commission to use every means at its disposal to ensure that there is real competition in the EU.
As previous speakers also pointed out , increased state deficits give cause for concern .
Predictability in the area competition is also important .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has raised some issues in its opinion .
The Committee on Legal Affairs therefore rejected the communication and questioned the legal basis .
Politically we should ask ourselves whether we want a tale-telling society like the one this communication would ultimately lead to .
Therefore it is also important that these parties have rights .
The Committee on Legal Affairs considers that the communication which has now been adopted is not adequate and wants the Commission to revise it so that we get a balanced treatment of commercial secrets on the one hand and the important rights of third parties on the other .
Competition policy should not be implemented at the expense of social equilibrium leading to threats to the protection of the environment and employment .
Aid to business is now distorting competition to a very large extent and it should be subjected to serious re-evaluation .
This evaluation calls for thorough transparency .
Much aid to business at national and Union level is responsible for unfair advantages for some companies , and others are the victims of it
