As today’s debate also shows , however , there are many common initiatives under way to develop education and training in Europe through exchanges and cooperation .
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can sincerely endorse the creation of a European Qualifications Framework , or what is popularly known as the EQF.
The fact that 32 countries are participating in this form of cooperation makes possible a broadly-based development of education and training and employment opportunities in Europe .
The very fact of concentrating on qualifications already acquired is an important breakthrough .
The focus is on results and actual ability , and not only on the ways in which that ability is acquired .
In this connection , I would emphasise Mr Mann’s call for us to focus more on vocational education , including continuing education .
Moreover , it is important to produce a system that is not unduly complicated .
If EQF is to be a success , it is also important , as the Commissioner has already said , for all the countries to be involved voluntarily and to introduce their own national – or , where relevant , regional – framework systems for assessing qualifications .
It will not be easy , but we are setting ourselves ambitious targets this evening .     Mr President , there were no scholarly books in my childhood home .
Competent teachers in my state school and free book loans in a well-stocked public library opened up the world of books to me .
Teeth , glasses and personal care fall somewhere in between .
The Court of Justice , through numerous judgments , has created an internal market for many services .
At the very heart of representative government , however , is the idea of not merely voting with your pockets , like at the market , but also choosing , through one’s votes , what facilities society is to enjoy .
The June Movement supports the internal market for goods and services and we oppose national discrimination , but we also want to allow voters in each Member State to define the boundaries between the market and society and to determine the level of quality and service , as well as consumer rights .
This is a case where representative government should be able to control the market so that there are also services of general interest for those not born with silver spoons in their mouths .
The Directive has a solid enough legal basis in Articles 175 and 176 , which state that the Member States may retain or adopt provisions with a view to ensuring more extensive protection .
The limit values for air pollution may be in conflict with the internal market , for which reason we do not believe that a directive with Articles 175 and 176 as its legal basis is of itself a sufficient guarantee of the ability of the Member States to retain or adopt provisions with a view to attaining higher levels of protection .
Mr Erdogan , do you perhaps have a map ?
Turkey is not a European country , and as such Turkey cannot be a member of the European Union .
The Heads of State or Government of the EU have promised Turkey that it can , on certain conditions , become an EU member , but those Heads of State or Government do not have the backing of their peoples in so doing .
Two thirds of European citizens do not want Turkey to become a member , and the Heads of State or Government will ultimately be compelled to defer to their wishes if they wish to maintain the trust of their electorates .
I would like to recommend voting in favour of the report , regardless of the fact that some of the wordings in it can be construed as meaning that we regard Turkey’s accession as an objective , albeit one still far from being realised .
We saw this in the case of the famous Danish cartoons of Mohammed in the newspaper and also in the Turkish outcry against Pope Benedict’s speech in Regensburg .
Turkey wishes to stifle Europe’s freedom , our freedom of speech , and membership would mean the formation of a parallel society opposed to European culture .
In particular , we have fought for legal certainty , which is of course protection in relation to the police and other forces of the state , especially for society’s underprivileged .
Never has legal certainty been exposed to such serious threats as it is today .
Moreover , none of the EU’s institutions has shown an ability to implement the eminently necessary change of course .
There is only room for two messages .
The first is that , without having committed crimes on the scale of the United States – with Guantánamo and other torture centres around the world – the EU and the Member States commit outrages every day against both terrorist suspects and refugees who have no rights .
Secondly , the EU’s institutions have no desire to find any explanation for the two basic problems that are at the root of the evils .
This is the root of the evil .
Today , the subject is trade with India .
I was able to concur with most of what it said , and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will , of course , vote in favour of the report .
They are discussed , but in very general terms .
I am thinking , of course , of the Dalits , who are casteless .
They are mentioned , but in conjunction with the Adivasis , as if all that was at issue was a general problem involving minorities .
The Dalits are a despised underclass in several countries , but they are , in particular ,
