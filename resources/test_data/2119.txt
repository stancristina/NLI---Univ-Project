continue to be made to promote the EMU.
If this was discussed , what conclusions did you come to ?
In Sweden this agreement with the EU was publicly proclaimed as a guarantee that Sweden would not have to lower its environmental standards .
We will be greatly disappointed if the Union does not succeed in raising the level of its environmental standards as promised or perhaps even obliges the new Member States to lower their environmental standards .
When will the Commission put forward this proposal ?2.Timescales are required for risk assessment and amendment of the directive on the restriction of harmful substances .
This is why a proper guarantee on the environment should be given during the intergovernmental conference ; an environmental guarantee which safeguards the right to preserve existing legislation and introduce more stringent measures on goods for both environmental and health reasons .
Naturally in the long-term we cannot grant exceptions and special regulations within the internal market and consequently create differences which affect the flow of goods and services as well as free competition .
These serious , cross-border problems which we are encountering today cannot be resolved at a national level alone .
According to the Commissioner the work is on-going .
I wish that we could have rather more tangible evidence that the work does in fact receive priority within the Commission , but I feel more confident after what I have heard today .
Technology , products and limit values are already operating within the Union .
I am convinced that none of the countries withhold essential information .
Nor is it sufficient to hope for a solution regarding Austria 's , Sweden 's and Finland 's transitional regulations .
Pious hopes are not enough .
Nor is it enough that something will be done on cadmium in commercial fertilizers .
We need to know what the Commission is really planning to do .
The Commissioner talked about a detailed assessment of the risks .
In my opinion there are really only two solutions to this problem : 1.That the Commission together with respective governments puts forward firm timescales and presents measures for resolving the problem and thereby gives us an exception in accordance with the environmental guarantee in Article 100a( 4).2.That the Commission simply admits that it has failed and extends the transitional period .It was said earlier that is not only a question of environmental issues .
That is why we have to be more active on this issue than we have been hitherto .
The undertaking given by Commissioner Bjerregaard that no new Member State should have to lower their standard involves considerable measures .
Commissioner Bjerregaard gave an extremely far-reaching undertaking .
Does this mean that the Commissioner considers these documents from the Commission , which present a considerably more pessimistic view on the possibilities of fulfilling these undertakings , to be null and void and that the Commissioner pledges her political belief that Sweden , Austria and Finland will not have to lower a single standard regarding the hundreds of firm cases in question ?
Subcontractors are very different from companies operating in the consumer goods market .
Although the purpose of subsidies and lower interest rates is good , it is questionable whether they are effective when there is a general economic depression .
The current deflationary policy in Europe restricts opportunities for small companies .
Unfortunately these documents do not always lead to firm actions .
Mr Harrison 's report on payment periods in commercial transactions , which should have been issued as a binding document from the Commission .
In my opinion there is no need for statutory payment conditions .
I agree that European companies must be given the same conditions as their American counterparts , and it would be excellent if a working capital market could be established as part of this process , otherwise we run the risk of the good ideas being exploited elsewhere .
Mr President , Sweden is not a wine-producing country but we in Sweden are consumers of the wines and other drinks concerned in this report .
They are not the same in northern Europe as in southern Europe .
We hope that these rules will continue to apply in the future .
Mr President , this is more than anything a small reminder to the Commission and the Council and I hope that they will take note of the different rules on production and health policy patterns which exist in Europe and in the Member States of the EU and thus be able to see this report as providing support , as a matter of principle , for traditional decisions on rules for the production and consumption of alcohol which will also apply in respect of a country like Sweden .
Each time the socialists and other Members on the left have opposed and tried to prevent developments leading to a greater role for the market economy in the areas in question .
This is clearly not the case , which is particularly regrettable .
In the long term those companies which are exposed to competition will also benefit , as they will be compelled to develop and improve their activities .
The trans-European transport networks are also a mixture of national and transnational projects , a mixture of positive and negative projects .
I believe that those who advocate trans-European networks as a means of solving the unemployment problem are wrong .
We construct a motorway at enormous cost but without creating an especially large number of jobs .
We intend to vote against the compromise tomorrow .
There has certainly been an improvement in recent years , not least since the accession of the new Member States .
I wonder somewhat whether it is intended that these measures should be more specific and whether there might be some positive discrimination - in the broadest sense - as regards the appointment of women in the future
