the interests of the workers , leave their fundamental social rights untouched , help to develop less developed countries , respect the environment and respect the rights of all nations to exercise control and decide on their future themselves .
It is sending out a message of resistance and counterattack to the millions of workers , unemployed , small and medium-sized farmers and other victims of the capitalist world order which the WTO is trying to impose .
( EL ) I have to admit that our rapporteur , the German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok , does not mince his words .
Both the motion for a resolution and the explanatory statement are exercises in militaristic , aggressive cynicism about the substance of the CFSP ( common foreign and security policy ) and the CSDP ( common security and defence policy ) .
Russia , the Ukraine , Moldavia , Africa , Latin America and so on are all seen as military partners outside our area .
The report is crystal clear on the division of roles between the two imperialist powers , viz . the USA and the ÅU , which will act in concert with the USA , where possible , or on its own if the USA is not willing or prepared to act .
Who today can dispute the Marxist tenet that war is in the nature of capitalism and , even more so , in the nature of imperialism ?
Mr President , I apologise for my absence .
However , we do not agree that it is a good idea to maintain the difference between mixed meat and milk production subsidies , which the report justifies on the grounds that mixed production unit holders generate additional income from milk production .
If we really wanted to provide income support for these regions and for sheep and goat farmers , we would abolish quotas , increase subsidies and provide other additional incentives .
Bombings which , unfortunately , have the support of our countries ' governments .
Joint investigation teams basically have carte blanche , in that they are set up by however many Member States want to , for however long they want , with the involvement of any services they want and for whatever purpose they think fit .
I see it as a noble industry which has nourished generations of cinema goers and to which we have no hesitation in entrusting our children so that they can learn about the past and acquire a penetrating and analytical perception of the society in which we live and intuition about what will happen in the future .
.
It completely overlooks the quality of these services and the fact that , once they have been liberalised , one section of the population will be denied access to these services because it will be unable to afford the prices charged by the companies which agree to manage them .
The basic aim of liberalisation is to hand these services over to the private sector for speculative purposes .
In Greece , for example , the price per unit for local and long distance calls has risen over tenfold and profits have risen a hundredfold since Greek Telecom and mobile telephony were privatised .
That is why we shall be voting against the report .
Passenger transport by rail , road and inland waterway Mr President , Mr Vice-President , first I think we should all congratulate Mr Jarzembowski on his excellent work , the time he spent on it and , of course , his patience , because this is an exceptionally tricky issue .
This too is another brick in the wall of the single market .
Consequently , we need to look at a whole host of other issues .
Of course there are interests which do not like these proposals .
Thank you , Commissioner , for the information which you have given us .
To give you a specific example , in Greece there have been five cases in which people presented symptoms which related directly to the three active ingredients in these drinks .
I asked you to tell me what your current thinking is in the Commission .
This provoked me , if you like , into tabling a supplementary question and it is on this that I should like you to comment , as the Commissioner at the present stage .
Does the Commission intend to help so that substances can be recognised and banned immediately , thereby reducing the time available for new substances to reach the free market ?
Thank you Commissioner for your reply , but you did not answer my question as to whether the Ministers of Justice , Internal Affairs and Public Order of the fifteen are due to discuss the matter in their forthcoming meeting in Brussels .
I should like to ask , given that it is prohibited to teach Fascist or Nazi ideas about the annihilation of the Jews , if we can accept , on the contrary , that they be taught by Muslim fundamentalists in the light of the specific circumstances which have arisen following the attack on 11 September .
This research is expected to have future applications in four areas of medicine : first , hereditary illnesses , secondly , the most common fatal illnesses , namely cancer , cardio-vascular and degenerative neural illnesses , thirdly , an understanding of the mechanics of various illnesses , which will lead to new , more efficient treatment and drugs and , fourthly , the prevention of disease .
This was the point of the amendment which I tabled together with Mr Nisticò and Mr Purvis .
The draft before us leaves little room for free research which may not bring in results which can be directly applied in practice but which helps to increase our knowledge and acts as a basis for future applications .
