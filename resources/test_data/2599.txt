Globalisation is clearly inescapable and inevitable and is , for the most part , the result of the development of techniques and technology .
With the development of globalisation and advanced technology , with the Net , we can clearly see a trend for the considerable development of cybercrime in all areas : drugs , terrorism , crime of every kind .
Tomorrow , we will be faced with a vast China , a vast India , a large South-East Asia and an organised South America , not to mention North America .
Once again I heard him out , but let me take the liberty of saying that there is one right that I am not prepared to grant him , and that is the right to claim to be speaking on behalf of General de Gaulle .
( Loud applause )
According to the schedule , the Council was to have 30 minutes ' speaking time .
We must also make a success of this agenda , and this means , first and foremost , making a success of the Intergovernmental Conference .
At the European Council in Biarritz , the Convention members will be ready to propose a comprehensive text which is to include economic and social rights .
I was , however , hoping for a clearer commitment regarding the fundamental rights included in the Union ' s agenda , for two reasons .
Apparently , Europe is some sort of vamp provoking everyone into political promiscuity .
Europe ' s role is also to invent an alternative foreign policy based specifically on preventing conflicts , on the need for ever fewer arms .
Mr President , Minister , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals in the TDI Group who , as everyone knows , are European federalists .
We feel instead that the issue of Europe ' s prospects , the issue of the architecture of a new Europe and the issue of the future European Constitution belong right at the heart of the French Presidency of the Union .
We invited the new democracies in Eastern Europe to join us now that they have put the ordeal of Communism behind them and we were right to do so .
I feel that I must congratulate the Socialist government on having convinced the French President so thoroughly .
To some extent , therefore , they form a " constitution " .
What will we be doing , specifically in this IGC ?
We shall see how much arbitration is required , but the French Presidency takes the view that priority should be given to the substance of this issue , given that any kind of text will be a source of inspiration for all of the European Union ' s institutions .
I shall say quite clearly that France , - and here once again for a moment I am speaking on behalf of a major national delegation in the Council - would not be able to accept this .
Over the last three years , a reversal in its external economic situation has weakened its economic fabric , which is structured but ageing .
Zimbabwe has undoubtedly turned a new page in its young history .
The mission must continue its work on the ground , as Mr Schori requested .
We know that most illegal immigration arrives in Western Europe , as a result of smugglers , particularly in the case of those people coming from far-off destinations such as China .
We know , for example , that in order to use the services of a smuggler , it costs a Chinese national between EUR 10 000 and EUR 20 000 and years of illegal work to repay this debt .
In a world that is undergoing profound upheaval , the task of controlling long-term flows must shift from politics to co-development and the stabilisation of the countries in which immigration originates .
The Tampere Council specifically stressed this priority , and I quote : " The European Council stresses the need for more efficient management of migration flows at all their stages .
The French Presidency ' s third initiative was to also submit a draft directive on cooperation in the matter of expulsions .
We have seen requests for asylum increase dramatically in most countries in the European Union .
This issue also involves the fight against organised crime .
This does not only involve monitoring the European Union ' s points of entry , but also monitoring what is happening within our Member States , particularly with regard to the illegal labour market .
In addition to this , forms of closer cooperation could be considered for applicant countries , particularly in the areas of training , equipment , and the exchange of information on criminal networks .
This must be a balanced policy , both in its measures on " the integration of emigrants " and in its measures on "effectively combating networks of organised crime which exploit the victims of the traffic in human beings " We must never lose sight of the balanced approach provided by the two aspects of the European common policy on this issue .
Mafia networks must therefore be harshly punished , but so must the people who exploit illegal labour , since no immigration networks exist without economic networks .
We are rather shocked to hear the words of Commissioner Vitorino , who , on 20 June , on the subject of the Dover tragedy , said that this , amongst other events , was proof of the need for a genuine policy on admission and integration , which makes a definitive break with the fantasy of zero immigration .
Minister , the French Presidency may be content to make the point at the next summit , without any real desire to study the Commission ' s report or to tell us whether the Commission is
