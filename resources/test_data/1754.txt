or overlook the merits of the other organisations which have taken up parallels with the world of agriculture production and interpreted them to best advantage , without mentioning the fact that this broadening out to embrace other activities in itself represents a development of areas of potential recognised by the Union .
Rural tourism is a source of income and , at the same time , a means of protecting a citizen' s land .
It is proposed as a driving force that will speed up the passage to a European agriculture which encompasses as wide a range of production possibilities and sources of income as possible .
In addition to this , there has been a marked return to suppression of journalistic activities , which has been documented in a report by other sources as well .
I would like to thank you in advance for your efforts and for the endeavours of Parliament and the European Commission to protect freedom and respect for the rights of the defence in the trial of these thirteen Iranian Jews .
What is important is that the limits which have been set to protect our communities are respected and that their observance is enforced by the competent bodies .
Our feeling , which will become apparent from the resolution which is to be put to the vote , is that complete priority has been given to a procedure for the development of a free trade area , shifting the emphasis from other policies which , in our opinion , should go hand in hand with the objective of building a free trade area , which we fully support .
The political signal which we must all send out together and the instruments which are decided upon must be capable of successfully relaunching this policy and restoring its status .
We are also concerned at the total lack of interest shown by the Commission in reopening the debate .
This is extremely important , for the mutual benefits are very great .
The Mediterranean policy is set in a context of wide-ranging interests and latent tensions , and it therefore has to include various different elements such as the development of peace-keeping initiatives - now that the Middle East peace process has been relaunched - and we are grateful for the way that the Pope ' s visit to the Holy Land is improving relations between the different religions , leading them towards mutual understanding and support , and the creation of partnership projects involving Northern and Southern Europe , for the very reason that the objective of transforming the Mediterranean into an area of dialogue , tolerance and cooperation that guarantees peace and stability cannot be achieved without firm political will and sustainable , balanced social development .
The process defined in Barcelona in 1995 for building an effective Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is still ongoing , despite the intention expressed by the European Union governments to include the Mediterranean policy among their priorities , an intention fully supported by our group .
What are the specific actions that the Commission intends to adopt to create a genuine cultural , social and human partnership ?
The development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must mean more than this : there is no doubting the fact that it must also promote an infrastructure which is linked to the values of the civil societies , to cultural , social , tourist and sporting exchanges , and linked to the development of these contributions , which are not directly related to the creation of a free trade area but which complement it .
Mr President , Commissioner , I feel that progress in the Middle East peace process is crucial to the development of the Euro-Mediterranean policy , and that this issue is central to the resolution we are debating today .
This will further economic stability , which will go a long way towards defusing some of the social conflict .
If we succeed , if the European Union succeeds in doing this , it will have made a substantial contribution to securing peace in the Middle East .
If we choose wisely , there are certain sectors which would undoubtedly yield good results .
Mr President , I would like to dwell mainly on the issue of immigration , rather than asylum , and consider the issue as a whole rather than examining the situation in these specific countries .
The rules must take into account the implications of admitting immigrants and , therefore , the number of people to whom it is possible to grant entry to the European Union .
Any meaningful migration policy cannot fail to take these considerations into account , for this demographic holocaust , soon to become an economic disaster , calls for proposals for migration policies which are liberal , antiprotectionist and geared to economic requirements and labour market demand , to counteract the prohibitionist and protectionist , nationalistic , ethnic , inhumane policy currently in force in Europe .
This has always been the case , but today we are formally recording it in a document : on the one hand , we have the Council , which maintains a particular line through the individual States of which it is composed and which makes recommendations on the basis of the decisions of those States and , on the other hand , we have the Community , or , rather , Parliament , which advocates a different , more harmonised , more coordinated and more homogeneous approach .
In addition to this , I welcome the fact that the item of natural disasters occurring within our nations has been reinserted in the budget .
We cannot go on like this .
Whatever our attitude to abortion , even those of us who consider abortion to be lawful have always agreed on one point : the right of the mother prevails over the right of the embryo , but the right of the embryo does exist
