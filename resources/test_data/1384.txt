It has also pointed out , in recital U , that ‘criticisms have been directed by international civil society against the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline project’ . ‘Securing religious freedom ’ in the South Caucasus has been incorporated into recital D.
It is what all the Member States , their governments and their politicians have done ever since the Beijing Conference of 1995 .
We are to debate the privatisation of water .
Unlike my fellow MEP , Mrs Eriksson , I have the greatest confidence that the work you are now getting under way will also lead to a result .
There are , in actual fact , more grey suits in this House .
I am a Liberal , but even I am able to see structures , and there are structures in this House .
As a result , families often choose , for purely financial reasons , to have the man work the maximum amount of time – that is to say eight hours and perhaps also overtime – and the woman work part-time .
Thus , both parties may , in practice , have working times of nine to ten hours per day .
It is therefore crucial that we distribute working time equally between men and women , that is to say six hours for the man and six hours for the woman .
This is a crucial issue to which attention must be drawn on , in particular , International Women’s Day .     Mr President , there is no lack of good ideas , either new or old , when it comes to combating discrimination against women .
I wish to express my pleasure at having a discussion of these matters in this House on 8 March with a Swedish Commissioner .
In 1996 , I had the same discussion with Mrs Gradin , who then mentioned the figure of 500 000 .
This no doubt shows that it is now the demand side that must be focused upon .
I think that the joint 1999 campaign was a good starting point before the turn of the millennium .
The application procedure demands so much work and so much expenditure that it is not even worth trying .
There should be more children , but it is no doubt entirely understandable that young people are not having children now , given the prevailing conditions governing the ability to look after children and bring them up .
It would be a waste if all the well-educated women were never able to make use of their knowledge .
In Zambia , several women are murdered every week by their men .
They were a few extracts from Amnesty International’s report on the appalling situation of women throughout the world .
There is a clear link between , on the one hand , prostitution and every cruder pornography and , on the other hand , the oppression of women and violence towards them .
The Lisbon process is certainly needed to strengthen women’s situation in the labour market .
On 1 May , the bells of freedom must ring in Europe , not those of female slavery .     Mr President , Commissioner , I am a feminist .
After he had formed his government in that particular way , it was impossible for Sweden’s political parties to do anything other than ensure that more women were given substantial political responsibilities .
For us Social Democrats , it became obvious that every other member of our political assemblies should be a woman .
When a new Parliament is appointed , it must be characterised by gender equality .
Firstly , women and men must obviously be treated equally .
What we discussed in this House was about both structures and standards .
There is now a kind of trade in sexual slavery in Europe and the rest of the world .
Above all , the debate has shown that we in the Commission must do whatever it is in our power to do to implement the existing legislation and attempt – and why not ? – also to introduce new legislation .
We nonetheless believe that it will be possible for us step by step to succeed this way too .
Every minute , 100 abortions are carried out , almost half of them by people with no medical training .
Rape and sexual violence are also on the increase in Europe .
In the developing countries , reproductive problems are the most important cause of death and disablement where women of childbearing age are concerned .
The EU and the Member States must naturally comply with their obligations and fund and implement the programme of measures from Cairo .
That is perfectly acceptable , and I also have a reservation ; but the deadline for amendments for this sitting expired this evening at 7 p.m.
Quite a few of my fellow MEPs who might have contemplated endorsing these amendments have not arrived here in time because of the problems we always have when we are to make our way to Strasbourg .
Many politicians appear to have given up on the so-called soft drugs .
Misusers must be given treatment , but use must be punished .
That is unacceptable .
There is no doubt a need sometimes to be satisfied with less extensive measures , but I share Mr Schmidt’s perspective on this issue .
There is no requirement to do so , but it is acceptable , and that is how it should be .
No proposals from the Greens or others must come along and regulate Swedish drugs policy .
We Moderates instead advocate effective , individual programmes to help people come off drugs .
It has been hard , but it has been extremely constructive .
That probably constitutes Parliament’s greatest success in this hugely sensitive area about which the electorates in all our countries are extremely concerned .
That is a crucially important point for us as normal consumers when
