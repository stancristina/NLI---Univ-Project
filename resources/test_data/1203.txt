He is well aware of the importance of the nature of the parliamentary cooperation to be set up between Chile , Mercosur and the European Parliament for the institutional development of the agreements .
I had the opportunity to discuss the situation with them just this week in Argentina and Chile .
It has been argued that that is not Europe whereas in fact European companies are setting up in the countries concerned .
Together with the agreement signed with Mexico , they are enabling us to update , relaunch and move forward relations between the European Union and a group of states .
In particular , it is close to the European Union venture .
For us , he is just across the Atlantic .
A study of the latter reveals a model which guarantees equality of opportunity .
I opposed this because I believed it made more sense to have a single public aerial , network , channel and trench along which all the telecommunications services provided by private operators could be channelled .
This is what the Heads of State and Government of both parties called for at the summit held in Rio at the end of June 1999 .
It even shares with us that great collection of values and customs classified as ' Western ' .
Therefore , because this is entirely an issue involving the management of resources by a Member State , I consider a resolution to be completely unnecessary .
Madam President , unfortunately , I , once again , have to request the floor to inform you and the House of another tragedy at sea .
You , Madam President , will continue to back the Spanish strategy , and I will continue to say what my Spanish colleagues dislike most .
The Basque Country , which I come from , wants peace above all , and that peace can only be achieved through mutual democratic respect .
Very soon the Basque Country will have the opportunity to speak freely through the ballot box and then Mr Gorostiaga will see the results of the horror he brings to this House .
I suppose that he is also aware of the trends in participation in European elections over the last decade , and I suppose that he is aware of the vicious campaign being waged against the European Union and its institutions by very powerful sections of the media in certain Member States .
We do not know them .
At the moment it is exclusively the Commission ' s responsibility to define the defence mechanisms for protecting our shipbuilding industry , or what remains of it , in the face of Korea ' s unfair practices .
The disguised cross-subsidies of the Korean Republic , its monetary depreciation and its accounting systems , which are not transparent and do not respect internationally agreed principles , continue to harm the whole of the world market and equally affect Japan , the United States and Europe .
The problem is how to harmonise the various legislation of the Member States and to seek formulas for approximation .
It is therefore urgent , ladies and gentlemen , that this initiative , which we have been discussing for several months , should become reality as soon as possible .
For all of these reasons , I believe it is essential , not only in the case of this initiative , but of others which we are going to deal with next today , and of those which we are no doubt going to continue debating over the coming years , that the European Union adopt clear and fair principles which , of course , comply with the United Nations Geneva Convention of 1951 .
Our objective is to improve the management of migratory movements within a framework of close cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit , stepping up the fight against this type of immigration and combating the criminal elements involved , while at the same time safeguarding the rights of the victims .
Mr President , firstly , I would like to associate myself with my group ' s concern at this proliferation of partial and fragmented measures , which are sometimes incompatible with the Treaties and almost always incompatible with the Community approach , and about which we are uncertain as to whether they come from the Member States or from the Council .
This is good .
Mr President , my group has therefore decided , by majority , to request the rejection of this proposal and for the French and Swedish Presidencies to ask the Commission to present a global proposal on a future common immigration policy for the Union .
I believe that it in doing this we must take clear account of the situation and show a degree of flexibility , which the rapporteur acknowledges , simply to listen to the will of the refugees and to prevent them , as a result of their temporarily weak position , from effectively becoming a burden to be transported to where we , completely regardless of their views , decide .
With regard to the definition of the family , it seems to me that the Commission ' s position that each Member State should apply its own definition of the family is more than reasonable and we are going to support this position .
As well as immediately meeting their humanitarian needs , we also face the problem of where to place these refugees , as this debate is demonstrating .
Is it a proper solution to distribute them numerically according to a system of quotas , thereby replacing the two-fold principle of respecting the will of the Member States and of the refugees themselves ?
Finally , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased that those people who have committed criminal acts for supposedly political reasons have been excluded
