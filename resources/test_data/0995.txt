monitored and evaluated ; ensures that the programmes and goods made available are comprehensively and continuously distributed ; promotes the use of local human resources , thus avoiding heavy reliance on foreign technical assistance and developing local capacity .
The health statistics for developing countries are horrifying : 28 000 children under five die every day , 2 million people die of tuberculosis each year , a million die of malaria , and so on .
I abstained from the overall final vote , however , as I deplored the rapporteur 's failure to resist the temptation to include in the final resolution a paragraph written in that coded , ideological language which , like that of other reports produced by this Parliament , aims simply to enlist EU development policy in the international pro-abortion movement .
Having made this general observation , I must nevertheless point out , in relation to the rapporteur 's comments on the ever-greater cuts in Community assistance to various NGOs , that the participation of non-state actors is not in itself a guarantee that development policies will be effective .
Care must also be taken to consider the state of today 's technology , since it allows television content to be disseminated using different technological platforms , and therefore requires the relevant legislation to be adapted and updated .
The European Union should resist the temptation to 'mould ' the loyalties and characters of the citizens of the Member States .
It also , however , has negative aspects .
( PT ) I agree with the rapporteur 's observations that ' Europe 's cultural industries reflect its national diversity and thus represent an added value to European identity ' and that 'culture is an essential element of European integration' , contributing to mutual understanding between Member States and their people , which is essential and desirable .
While I understand the rapporteur 's intentions and support many of the proposals she suggests , I was unable to vote in favour of this report , and therefore abstained .
I wish , however , to take this opportunity to raise a few basic points about the transparency and clarity of procedures in the way current legislation is implemented .
Our condemnation of fanaticism must be clear , unequivocal and resolute .
Such a move could enable these countries , if they see fit , to promote competition between suppliers of goods or services , thereby potentially reducing additional costs and the risks of corruption inherent in tied aid .
( PT ) I have voted in favour of the report currently before us because I believe it is important to uphold preferential access to EU markets for bananas from the ACP countries , as is the need to reduce , by means of diversifying production , the economic dependency of these countries on the profits made from the sale this fruit .
I would just like to bring up a matter which has already come to the attention of this House several times .
I am disappointed with the Commission , which has ceased to be the driving force behind Europe and become a burden , but I will now stop criticising it !
That is why we always participate in these debates .
These measures must not be forgotten .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work , and the Commissioner for her tenacious efforts in this field .
Assigning liability may be an uncomfortable process , but it is an essential one .
The Austrian initiative , however , poses a complex problem related to the use in the European asylum system of the concept of safe third countries .
That is still an open question at present .
This consensus exists in spite of this initiative 's good intentions with regard to the fundamental issue .
If that happens by the end of the year , as we hope , it would quickly render the Austrian initiative obsolete , since this Directive will resolve the fundamental issue of safe third countries .
Precisely in order to avoid any further ado , therefore , I will thank Commissioner Vitorino , who has today shed some light on the matter and made our short debate entirely worthwhile .
I will also repeat something I have already said once before in this House .
It was important for Parliament to vote on that Directive , of which there is a new version on which we have not yet been consulted .
The Commission does in fact believe that a common framework should be laid down for questions pertaining to transit during the repatriation process , which is why the Commission supports the German proposal .
The Commission , therefore , intends to table a proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for repatriation procedures and mutual recognition of repatriation decisions .
This proposal for a directive aims , therefore , to lay down measures that may be taken by the competent authorities to assist with escorted or unescorted removals at European transit airports .
We must also remember that we cannot implement policies liable to encourage waves of illegal immigration , involving the trafficking and exploitation of individuals .
The citizens of Europe are calling for more economic growth and more employment .
Defining broad guidelines for public spending is more important than the level of deficit .
That responsibility , moreover , is in the hands of Mr Trichet .
We all know that this proposal for a directive responds neither to the economic , scientific and cultural challenges facing the software sector , nor to the imperative to promote innovation , technological development or the interests of SMEs .
Privatising knowledge in a field which cannot , even in the broadest terms , be confused with that of technical and industrial inventions simply means creating new business opportunities .
