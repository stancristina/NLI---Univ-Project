There are one or two of our fellow Members of the House who have to accept that Mr Barroso , the Commission President , had something else in his diary for today .
I appeal to India to reform the Armed Forces Special Powers Act .
At the time , the European Parliament had adopted a relevant report by Mr Katiforis - I was the shadow rapporteur - on the issue of credit rating agencies .
We must ensure that the Commission now presents proper analyses and does not remain in a state of denial .
However , the person who applied the brakes to the Katiforis report was you , Mr Radwan .
That must stop as well .
What we are discussing here , then , is not about short-term necessity .
For years , experts have been warning against high-risk loans , unsecured credit and a bubble waiting to burst in the financial and property markets .
I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her introduction , but I also wish to express my gratitude to Mr Kyprianou for all the groundwork he has done at a difficult time .
Madam President , I would also like to begin with the referendum in Ireland - that is , the Treaty of Lisbon .
Why not ask Mrs Kroes what she thinks of the public banking system in the European Union .
Well , the voice of the past has something to say : the rules of the past are the necessity for the future .
At the time , the Council welcomed these suggestions , but did nothing about them .
Therefore , our resolution is clear on this point .
If a result is not achieved , one must ask why that is .
Mr President , I would like first to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Commission for their excellent cooperation on the preparation of this report .
It is high time for the Community to take action as well .
That requires dealing with both the human side of the problem and of course also the economic needs of the moment .
In summary , I would like to thank everyone most sincerely for the stimulating debate .
Our committee held very vigorous debates about the reports being presented today , with more than 200 amendments , 40 compromise amendments and two hearings for experts and stakeholders , all in close cooperation with the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality .
We point out that in our view , access to high-quality services provides crucial momentum for the social integration of adults and , particularly , for that of children , particularly children at risk of poverty .
Unfortunately , there is also a drawback to this accomplishment , however , which is that these marriages often end in separation , and then there is the issue of the necessary divorce .
We cannot accept 'forum shopping ' .
That is why our committee tabled this oral question to the Council and the European Commission .
A basis for this is also found in Amendment 38 , where we make clear once more - even though this is already stated in the text - that , naturally , only law that is really in keeping with the principles of the European Union and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be applied in the Member States , as that goes without saying as far as we are concerned .

Thus , we are going to give money to Mercedes , BMW and Audi for them to put their money in tax have ns .
Reversing what has not...Transparency is a start when it comes to tackling companies that use tax have ns .
The 10 Member States of ASEAN are not all democracies as we in Europe understand the term , but things are changing .
I call on both the Commission and the Polish Government - as do my colleagues in my group - to make every effort to retain Poland 's shipyards , at all three sites .
The option we have is for the Commission to say that there will be State aid , but that , within the framework of this State aid , we want these workplaces to be modernised from an environmental point of view , so as to guarantee the long-term future of the sites and to ensure that workers have good long-term jobs there . draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by saying that it is clear from this draft report that environmental protection and climate change really matter to the whole of the European Parliament and to all of its committees , but also to the Commission and the Council .
Those involved in the EU institutions need to ask themselves whether this directive , as it currently stands , still - following the admittedly difficult compromise in the trilogue - actually meets the goal for which it was intended .
Special vehicles too are excluded , as we have heard .
