We will therefore have a chance to see the whole picture more clearly , which is necessary to obtain a well-balanced common policy .
I therefore look forward to the upcoming Belgian Presidency ' s focus on the question of the immigration of labour to the Union .
A draft for a common negotiating position for five of the Helsinki countries is expected by the beginning of May .
According to the Commission ' s schedule , an updated negotiating position for the Luxembourg countries will be available in June .
Primarily it is about building a basis for peace , freedom and democracy throughout Europe .
We have promised to do what we can such that in the coming months we will be able to contribute to paving the way for a political breakthrough in the enlargement negotiations .
Today nobody can say how the negotiations on justice and home affairs will proceed in practice .
The candidate countries are responsible for maintaining the rate of the adaptation work such that it is possible to achieve acceptable negotiation solutions .
A trusting relationship between us and an understanding of the conditions and situation under which the other is operating are fundamental preconditions for successful cooperation in the future .
On point after point we were able to see that cooperation has already begun and that the foundations have now been laid as to how we can strengthen this cooperation further .
There are already a number of non-binding legal instruments which were adopted within this field of policy before this policy area was transferred to community law .
The presidency plans to achieve political agreement on this proposal in the next six months .
A directive on conditions for entry and residence for the purpose of paid employment and self employed economic activity will be presented in the first six months of 2001 .
The on-going work clearly shows that we within the EU are operating an active immigration policy .
The final question concerns whether the Council considers it likely that number-based cost allocation between Member States for the reception of asylum seekers will be introduced within the framework of a common asylum policy .
This intention was also confirmed by the Heads of State or Government in Tampere .
I believe that such a common system will lead in a natural way to a more balanced allocation of responsibility between EU Member States .
Finally , at your request , I will take a current example of needless human trafficking , which once again shows that we have to act quickly .
Parliament has submitted a wish that the Council issue a statement on this event .
The Council is working hard to draw up common provisions on the framework for criminal law against those who assist illegal entry and residence .
The candidate countries are also providing information for this system .
By strengthening their asylum system we will all contribute to reinforcing the opportunities for protecting refugees and to ensuring that these countries become less interesting to human traffickers .
Mr President , in view of the short time available , I will address the most important point first .
Alarming figures are presented regarding population trends - Europe is shrinking .
The fact that Europe must be opened up to immigration of labour is a conclusion which even the toughest opposition have adopted .
We look forward to the proposals which the Commission will present in this field .
Some people describe Europe as a Europe which locks people out .
At the moment , there are different policies in different countries .
I also think that we should distinguish between immigration of labour , and asylum and refugee policy .
The latter is based on people ' s need for protection .
Today , however , we are seeing these people remain largely outside society , that they do not have the same rights and that they are not utilised on the labour market .
Mr President , it is touching to hear how loyally the Swedish minister has adopted the propaganda language of the EU liturgy .
Is this freedom ?
There is a word for this , a rude word : - ' Fortress Europe ! '
Mr President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking you for an extremely interesting debate with many interesting questions , but , above all , I would like to thank you for your substantial commitment in the area of legal and home affairs .
Rather our work is characterised by very great dynamism , a deeper cooperation in a Europe which we also wish to see enlarged .
We are working with countries around the Mediterranean and we are working on strengthening our cooperation with Russia and with China - to take just a few examples of the process that is going on and in which the Union is a powerful driving force in this cooperation and in the work on expanding this area .
We have all been incredibly moved and affected by the tragedies and catastrophes that we have seen come to us on our television screens .
However , we must do so in a number of different ways - one way is not sufficient .
We met representatives of five of the Baltic states in order to discuss precisely these matters .
Where this is concerned I want to make a clear distinction between human trafficking which exploits vulnerable people and what we call humanitarian acts .
Humanitarian acts must not be punishable .
As far as the penalties are concerned : these must be severe .
There are two viewpoints from the European Parliament which I , as President , have also brought into the discussions .
The second issue that was also included in the statement from the European Parliament concerns the fact that airlines and
