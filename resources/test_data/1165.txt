In order to do this , I call upon the Commission , as I have done on countless occasions , to provide clarification , that is to make all data available to allow correct information to contribute to reducing this collective psychosis of which , it appears , even we have been victims in part .
This direct intervention must ensure that companies in financial crisis receive the direct State support .
European agriculture is currently experiencing one of the most critical times in its history : our dealings with the agricultural sector are not without repercussion and ultimately not only farmers will be affected but Europe itself because , in the end , the farmers and people of Europe look to us , to Europe , to the institutions , as the entity that must meet their demands .
Madam President , certain Members have correctly pointed out the existence of the MEDA programme , for which I would like to ask if the Chamber would agree to an oral amendment worded : " Calls upon the Commission to set up a special programme for the purpose of introducing , where possible , or extending aquaculture and the development of the fish sector " .
In this respect , the Commission is already aware of my hope that the Aosta-Martigny rail route will finally become part of the trans-Europe network to be established in the coming years .
I feel that these recognition directives will be of particular benefit to doctors and professionals , who will now be able to move easily around the European Union .
At the end of a long discussion and explanation of the benefits of this document , my retired friend asked me : " Would n't it be simpler to make employees turn off their computers completely when they are no longer using them ? "
This is the question which I am still asking , Mr President .
Mr President , I voted in favour of intensifying trade relations with the United States , Canada , Japan , Korea , Australia and New Zealand , which is surely a positive step .
These regulations should thus be extended from European Union States to countries on the other side of the Mediterranean .
I would like to thank Mrs Lucas and the other women who have been arrested and express my solidarity with them .
On the basis of these principles , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market calls upon the House to adopt the Zimeray report .
The issue under consideration has already been analysed by international organisations : principles and rules have already been set in place for incisive action , aimed at preventing the very frequent accidents and the casualties sadly recorded , as both the rapporteur and Mr Stenmarck said .
We therefore support the Commission 's call for the Member States to apply these provisions as of 1 January 2003 .
It is vital to guarantee that Parliament has the right to participate in the regulatory procedure .
It is a road which will clearly be marked by a number of events and priorities , which I shall mention shortly , but , most importantly , it will be taking us already - and I am tempted to say at last - in the direction of the Europe of tomorrow .
We also proposed to set up a European Food Agency , which will come into operation next year .
Today , before this House , I want to say how proud I am of my staff , for whom 2000 was a year of far-reaching internal reforms .
The key elements of this programme are structured around a number of major events .
One of the key goals of our strategy is to restore the right conditions for full employment .
At Stockholm , I will urge the Heads of State and Government to seize the opportunity and not to rest on their laurels : we need to push ahead resolutely with the reforms already agreed upon in Lisbon .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there has to be a stable balance between our policies to ensure that all Europe 's vital assets , our economic assets but also our social capital and our environment , are preserved for future generations .
The views expressed by this House will , indeed , be valuable to the Commission in developing its strategic proposal for the Gothenburg Summit , a proposal which , I repeat , must be practical , or it will be a weak summit .
Trade policy cannot just be concerned with the interests of the business world : we have to ensure that it benefits the world 's poorest peoples .
Over the next ten and a half months , the Commission will be working hard together with the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies to complete the preparations for this extremely important event : a historical event which will have a permanent effect on the lives of Europeans .
Secondly , it opens up the broader , post-Nice debate on the future of the European Union .
What was missing at Nice was , above all , an in-depth discussion in the preparatory stages about what we want from Europe and for Europe .
