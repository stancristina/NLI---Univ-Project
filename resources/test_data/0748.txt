will it gain credibility when it comes to assessing and sometimes condemning the Commission and Member States .
Secondly , I would like to mention the issue of financing .
This would not have been appropriate either , but I would like to take this opportunity to add these specific points to the list which is , in fact , already before you .
The employment situation in Europe seems to be slightly improving .
Mr President , in a situation such as this , surely it cannot be expected from the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats that we come up with a 'hurrah ' resolution .
Mr President , I believe in a common strategy which must be monitored from within Europe .
I think that the Lisbon Summit has given us a new impulse in this respect .
In addition to the positive aspects of summits such as these , I would also like to make room for some criticism .
There should be a convergence programme , a kind of guideline for social security .
I think that the atmosphere is important , but as a basis for reaching sound agreements .
The Union can then also be expected to adapt its agricultural and trade policy in such a way that it is of more benefit to Africa and not , as is now often the case , a source of further disadvantage .
If the Africa Summit in Cairo has led to this kind of realism , then we have created more than just a good atmosphere and we are probably on the right track .
On the photographs from Cairo , the African and European leaders may be rubbing shoulders with each other but , in reality , there is a yawning chasm separating the two continents .
With his statement that Africa does not need democracy but water pumps , Colonel Gaddafi has undoubtedly put into words what many of his fellow dictators think .
The international community should not be tricked into feelings of guilt by the African leaders who do not carry any democratic legitimacy .
This is true , of course , because very often it is not the Ministers for Foreign Affairs who travel to Africa but rather the Ministers responsible for emergency aid who then pursue their policy from there .
It has been stated that we want to make a large contribution and take part in a much more far-reaching debt burden initiative , provided we can link this in with social development .
They should become the norm .
As I understand - and I am delighted to hear it - the European Commission intends to provide more structure to the way third-country elections are observed within the European Union .
The political solution to the Kurdish issue would not only liberate the Kurds , it would also take a heavy weight from Turkey ' s shoulders .
In simple terms : in the extensive amendments to this report , which is excellent by the way , the most important aspect seems to be that either we decide to make life easier for the GMO industry or we decide to give it sleepless nights .
One controversial issue is producer liability .
We are thus delighted that the Council has underlined this principle in the common position .
We regret this toning down .
Tinkering with genes holds unknown risks .
This is good , because in this way we can start restoring confidence in the producer , especially at a time when food safety is so much in the public eye .
Many in Parliament believe that it is the country of origin that should be on the label .
One condition , for example , could be that the identification and registration system must be fully implemented and observed .
However , I would like to ask your attention for a question of principle .
The internal market is a large entity .
But in order to bring the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs as far as possible into line with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I tabled four more amendments in the plenary meeting .
This can be done a ) by introducing codecision for the common trade policy , b ) by introducing an assent procedure for all external agreements and c ) by according Parliament a greater role in approving and monitoring trade negotiations .
In the light of Central and Eastern countries joining the EU , it is vital that uniform , European safety standards for nuclear reactors be drafted .
The second major point is the Union ' s legal personality .
The Commission too has given the matter rather a lot of attention and has devoted a great deal of thought to it .
By the way , Maastricht is not a strange city , Mrs Frassoni , it is a very exciting city where the Dutch-Flemish , German and French cultures all flow into one .
In order to boost citizens ' confidence in the European Commission , it is vital that each Member State should have a Commission Member .
Unanimity should , therefore , be restricted to the bare essentials .
Mr President , a biblical parable teaches the reader to build his house on a rock .
What do we want to achieve as a European Union ?
This high official college should in future not have more or fewer than 20 members .
Unfortunately , the many sound proposals from Parliament are at odds with the willingness of the governments to extend the IGC agenda and reach compromises .
Simply reducing a democratic deficit is not sufficient to improve contact with the citizen .
Madam President , with regard to our Euro-Commissioner , we would ideally like to have one Commissioner per country
