For these solutions to be successful , seamless cooperation is required on all sides .
The budget provides for new posts to be created at both Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee to render the administration of the buildings more efficient .
This division of responsibility must be considered a pre-condition of the project ' s success .
If the rental agreement is finalised before the end of the year , the amount mentioned will be deducted from Parliament ' s budget , as the European Parliament budget is , at present , 20.11 % of Category 5 , whereas Parliament has itself declared a ceiling of 20 % .
The other reason is the reserve related to the Statute for Members .
Because at present it is the Member States that pay the salaries of MEPs , this will mean that the payments are transferred from the Member States to the European Union .
It is quite natural to suppose that a new expenditure item of this kind , which at the same time would diminish Member States ' costs , cannot be included under the ceiling for formerly approved expenditure .
Another priority of this draft budget is increasing the resources of the Court of Justice of the European Union , especially their translation resources .
After this , we expect that the Court of Justice will be able to cope better with its workload , reduce the number of documents left untranslated , and serve Member States , citizens and businesses better in the interpretation and application of European law .
The institutions have an abundance of staff , and it is to the benefit of all that they be used efficiently .
It is very difficult for Parliament , as a decision-making authority , to scrutinise the chart of its own four thousand strong organisation and draw conclusions as to what new posts are needed for what jobs .
Every Member State , however , has had to radically reorganise personnel structures .
That is why in many cases the establishment of new posts is no longer the responsibility of the budgetary authorities .
Firstly , the overall work of an institution is seen clearly , which means that there is less danger of getting swamped in details .
This encourages better and more efficient work , as everyone can find a way to work more effectively and use resources sparingly where the need is greatest .
Finally , I would like to thank all those who helped me to prepare this report .
I would especially like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Terence Wynn , who has given me his support in so many ways , both in practical negotiations and at meetings of the Committee on Budgets , and in personal discussions .
I would also like to thank all the coordinators , especially Reimer BÃ¶ge of the European People ' s Party and Ralf Walter of the Party of European Socialists for their constructive and pertinent cooperation .
Mr President , I would like to express my support for Mr Bourlanges ' s position regarding the amendment of the Financial Perspective .
Our group , the Confederal group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , has another stand in this matter .
Mr President , adopting the budget for the cultural sector is more difficult than usual this time .
Thus the final effort to have these multiannual programmes approved still remains to be made .
It has to be clearly pointed out that the figures presented by the Committee on Budgets do not constitute a stand on the result of conciliations .
We have to alter parliamentary procedures with regard to the budgetary procedure for multiannual programmes that are the object of the codecision procedure .
The worst that can happen , however , is that Parliament ' s position on financing for the programmes remains unclear ; that can be used against Parliament .
As multiannual programmes must in any case adapt to the general Financial Perspective of the relevant budget heading as well as the budget as a whole , it is necessary , in my opinion , for Parliament to enhance the effectiveness of its internal coordination when discussing multiannual programmes and the budget .
The Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises Parliament ' s position as a responsible and effective decision-maker .
Mr President , Mr Duisenberg , the annual report from the European Central Bank shows that the bank has got off to a brisk start , and the steps taken so far have been on the right track .
Nevertheless , much has still to be done to raise the European Central Bank to the position to which it is entitled , though not automatically so .
In discussing the annual report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , we had lively discussions on inter alia the issue of transparency and how it can be gradually increased .
Although transparency has undeniably increased and , for example , press conferences with the President , held after board meetings , have meant a clear improvement in the bank ' s approach , the aim must be to increase transparency further , once the work of the bank becomes established and the teething problems disappear .
Furthermore , the publication of abstracts of board meetings is justifiable , and the justifications for decisions taken must be clearly evident from these abstracts , so that market players can make their own decisions .
It could also be just too big a step to take so early on .
Market viability can be enhanced through the spread of information .
The ECB may also comment on this information , but their analysis must , however , be left to national decision-makers .
We have to remember that , although the euro area has just one monetary policy , we still
