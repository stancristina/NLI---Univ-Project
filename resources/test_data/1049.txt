Member States .
On a number of points , I do not however share the rapporteur 's view .
There are clauses concerning the CFSP and cooperation with NATO that are all too far-reaching .
There is already practical cooperation in the purchase of military equipment , and I do not believe that the creation of a European institute would contribute any added value .
There are clauses concerning the CFSP and cooperation with NATO that are all too far-reaching .
The fact that the resolution was adopted by so slight a margin makes it politically weak .
In the adopted resolution , the European Parliament instead threatens suspension of the Association Agreement by the EU ( paragraph 8 ) .
China is a huge country of growing importance in the world .
WTO membership will make demands when it comes to software piracy , environmental issues , trade unions etc , and we can perhaps be of help .
It seems as if China , just like Russia in the case of Chechnya , is using the fight against terrorism as an alibi in order to commit atrocities against minorities .
We are also anxious about the torture and persecution of democracy campaigners , trade union activists and dissidents , and the attempt to limit freedom of expression on the Internet is of course unacceptable .
These issues must be given the highest priority in our cooperative relations with China .
We had hoped that there might not perhaps have been any 2008 Olympic Games in China but , now that these are in fact to take place , we must use them as a means of exerting pressure .
As long as there are Liberals in this House , we shall stand up for human rights in China .
There now remains a huge job of cleaning up to be done .
It would be much better if such companies were to be issued with certificates of competence that could be referred to when contracts were tendered for .
On the other hand , the link with asbestosis and mesothelioma is very strong .
As I now understand it , there is , then , no decision by EU ministers which must be adhered to in this case .
I should also like to emphasise that this is an important legal rights issue .
I am pleased with the Council 's answer , to the effect that it does not see it as possible in practice to include people not convicted of crimes in such a register and that it considers it unlikely that such a decision would be made .
Time is running out , and the United States is increasing its lead .
In such a situation , it is easy to revert to the solution applied in the past : public funding .
However , that would lead not to strong and healthy companies but to companies which , though certainly new , would be dependent upon subsidies .
One clear example of a country that is deficient in this area is Sweden , which has experimented a great deal with state aid and so excluded healthy competition .
It must be possible for companies which go bankrupt to be given another chance .
However , it is encouraging that the European Parliament is so unified in its view of ageing .
However , we in the Member States of the EU are very bad at making use of the skills possessed by the older portion of the population , particularly in the world of work .
It is also the result of poor working environments that cause people to become exhausted before their time .
This is crucial , especially for the most elderly people of all who have a great need for health care and medical treatment .
It is important that we monitor developments beyond our borders and try to form a global strategy covering the status of the elderly throughout the world .
There must be an improvement in the right of citizens to go to court in order to have their cases tried .
We have abstained in the final vote on the Commission 's proposal on freezing the assets of persons suspected of terrorism .
However , a procedure in which the UN Security Council and sanctions committee decide upon sanctions against individual people , entirely without the latter 's being informed of the evidence or being given the opportunity to have their cases tried in court , is not acceptable .
In this way , there is a danger of legal certainty 's being eliminated .
Clear and distinct criteria governing the way in which people 's names are added to and deleted from the list must be established .
In today 's vote , we have supported a new Council regulation on international terrorism , together with important amendments adopted by Parliament which enhance legal certainty and promote respect for fundamental human rights .
The legal process in support of the Swedes must therefore be pursued further .
The objective of the resolutions - that of fighting terrorism - is both legitimate and urgent , but so too is the objective of bringing about a change to the way in which they are applied .
That is especially important in the fight against terrorism .
There must be room for manoeuvre .
Parliament 's amendments are crucial in order to guarantee EU citizens legal certainty .
In our view , the report represents an outdated agricultural policy inappropriate to the conditions and needs of a modern , global society .
We welcome the Barcelona Process and are therefore in favour of the report .
I have voted against Mr Fatuzzo 's report on safe and sustainable pensions .
I have not therefore been able to vote in favour of the report .
Vlad Cubreacov told me about assassination attempts to which he had earlier been subjected .
