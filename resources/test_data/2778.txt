I want to begin by congratulating the European Council on having reached an agreement that is extraordinarily sound and extraordinarily important .
It is hugely important that these reforms should work .
We have arrived at a compromise that , in the main , supports the Commission 's proposal .
That is completely impossible .
What action are we to take in order to get all this to work and obtain a constructive debate on future agricultural policy ?
This na√Øve confidence in nuclear solutions to serious problems has now given rise to a backlash and caused the EU to appear in an embarrassing and ridiculous light .
What is missing from the joint motion for a resolution is a clear acknowledgement of the fact that KEDO has been wrongly constructed , badly thought out , dangerous and counter-productive right from the start .
Certainly , there is a need to proceed carefully so as not to damage the so-called Sunshine Policy , and certainly there is a need to talk with the Pyongyang leadership in order to drive the normalisation process forward .
As the last person to speak , I can say that .
Regional policy is extremely important for today 's EU , but also in terms of solidarity in the EU of the future .
As the Commission 's reports show , we still have problems , for example with unemployment and wider gulfs between city areas and other regions that are lagging behind .
We know that a very great many regions are very far away from the large markets and have to live with that geographical fact .
Agricultural policy , especially transport policy , must promote regional equality .
We believe , however , that the ways in which Parliament 's resolution is worded give off mixed and sometimes conflicting signals .
Paragraph 21 demands that full use be made of the maximum amount of 1.27 % of GDP.
We have done so because we believe that it is of the greatest importance that expenditure on the common agricultural policy should not increase in the manner proposed in the resolution and that the current interinstitutional agreement should be respected .
The Commission 's prime objective is to create a competitive agricultural sector that is of benefit to consumers , taxpayers and the agricultural sector as such .
We also wish to argue that , as a general principle , food production cannot be placed on an equal footing with industrial production and must therefore be safeguarded by special trade conditions , especially with a view to taking full account of environmental considerations .
On the contrary , the impression conveyed is of a defensive policy , with the European Parliament expressing the view that agriculture must benefit from qualified external protection , that is to say be protected against unfair competition from outside .
We disapprove , however , of recital B , which sets the appropriations to the cohesion policy in stone .
- ( SV ) We Moderates have today voted in favour of Mrs Schroedter 's report because it emphasises the necessity of maintaining the budget ceiling , as well as the need to abolish regional aid in those regions that no longer have GDP levels of less than 75 % of the EU average .
Paying in money to the EU only then to receive it back again in the form of structural aid is not a good way of solving the problem of underdeveloped regions .
As the report very rightly points out , there has been cheating and fraud involving money channelled via the EU budget .
Mr President , I wish also , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , to express my sympathy with those affected by the events in Galicia .
I would ask you to convey to the Commission that we too wish to know about the part played by Latvia in what has happened .
I have tried to find it in the newspapers .
That is why it is good that we now have proposals that are also considered capable of operating legally .
At the same time , it is important , however , to send out the right signals , above all to children and young people .
It is undoubtedly the case that tobacco advertising increases consumption , both by encouraging children and young people to take up smoking and by deterring existing smokers from giving up or reducing their daily consumption .
Madam President , I want to begin by saying that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the Commission 's proposals for reforming the common fisheries policy .
I do not really understand how that could work and how it could possibly lead to our obtaining a smaller fishing fleet .
I can also understand the Commission 's frustration in view of the difficulties in getting the Council and the Member States to accept their responsibility .
Where , for example , the Irish Sea is concerned , a quota 28 % higher than what researchers have considered to be acceptable has been permitted over the last ten years .
There have been no adequate supervisory programmes , and there has been no desire to place limits upon fishing fleets .
Sweden plans to introduce a unilateral moratorium on cod fishing in the Baltic .
We must therefore adopt measures as drastic as introducing a moratorium .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen and future fellow MEPs up in the public gallery , this is an historic day , a kind of preliminary celebration before the big celebration we are soon to hold together .
The Berlin Wall , on the other hand , was , inversely , a way of preventing people from meeting and ideas from being shared .
The European Parliament 's combined
