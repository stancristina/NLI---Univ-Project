this small-scale structure also creates vulnerability and disadvantages in a world moving towards globalization .
The European Parliament had and has no problem with the transfer of resources from 1996 to 1999 .
The Council , however , should carefully peruse and note the relevant passages in the Treaties and in the Interinstitutional Agreement , which state that the budgetary authority has two arms and that these two arms -the European Parliament and the Council - must reach agreement .
May I therefore make one comment to the Commissioner : we were unanimous in the report in regretting that the Commission 's strategy contains timetable for its implementation and that too few of the specific proposals match up to their tasks .
We do not accept the idea of introducing a separate chapter because that only establishes the old colonial situation .
The EPP endorses the consensus that was eventually reached on the plan for Italy and , after careful consideration , firmly rejects the new amendments that have been put before us .
We signed the agreement on 7 November 1995 as the European Union ; it is valid , and yet we are debating it today .
Nowhere in the world are there such strict standards and requirements as in the USA and Europe .
But when you look at this agreement , you find that it contains none of that .
In future the Council should take greater care to ensure that Parliament is duly involved .
It should therefore be carried out by external advisers .
After all , we are seeking to ensure that the proposed legal provisions are comprehensible and clear to those concerned , that the policy-makers become more aware and more informed and , above all , that politics becomes more accountable .
We must ensure the continuity and completion of this necessary adjustment process .
If we do not grant rapid aid , then in my view we will be penalizing those concerned even further , and that is bound to meet with incomprehension outside Parliament and to discredit our Parliament .
Mr President , I am happy to say that this is a report which the Legal Affairs Committee approved unanimously .
On the contrary , this argument must be a pressing reason to get legal safeguards put in place as fast as possible .
The only question is how best to ensure it ?
( Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
I also believe that there should be Community-funded publicity campaigns for organic products , in the interests of public health , but also with a view to promoting measures to improve quality and combat overproduction .
Consequently , if Article 43 is retained as the legal basis , we shall request referral back to committee , so that the Commission is not given the chance of deciding not to fall in with our progressive proposals .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we go on stating the case for organic farming alone and treating conventional farming methods as obsolete , agriculture in the European Union will have no future .
These include the question of whether we actually need a new , additional livestock units formula for organic farming .
Close cooperation is urgently necessary in the reorganization of a great many agricultural holdings , and is increasingly accepted by young farmers .
Maybe it is different in her country .
I should also like to address some fundamental comments to the Council representatives who are not here today : the 1998 EU budget has a lower rate of increase than most national budgets in the European Union , and the Member States should not call for pruning of the EU budget alone , but should also put their own budgetary houses in order .
Surely the Veterinary Office will also need the technical wherewithal to carry out its duties .
Parliament will be devoting particular attention to this issue .
Neither at European level nor in the Member States are biocides regulated in any systematic or uniform way .
Therefore , Commissioner , we shall be very interested to hear what you have to say .
You said that there are major problems concerning the implementation and enforcement of environmental law in the European Union .
Surely it must now be possible to make real progress in implementing environmental law .
It must be possible to bring proceedings against anyone who fails to implement environmental law .
We do not need his foolish proposal on water and river management , but we do need a proposal specifying which toxins those waters should no longer contain .
And one last point - I am naturally in favour of allowing our citizens to bring legal actions .
Even though the overall budget for the telecom TENs , ECU 40 million , will not permit any major strides forward , the purpose and aim of the projects cannot be questioned .
The action is thus guaranteed to continue uninterrupted .
We must introduce people - consumers , employers and employees - to these technologies and allay their fears of them .
It all stems from the question of the internal market .
We have presented an action plan , on which the House is to draw up a report in the near future .
It is to be presented soon , and we shall then report to the House on our position .
I think that we can now adopt this timetable together without it causing us any major problems , since 18 months really should be adequate for a codecision procedure , especially if we are able to evaluate positive experiences .
It is just like collective bargaining .
However , given that it is a complicated sector , the outcome is very positive .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the House is sparsely populated at this hour .
