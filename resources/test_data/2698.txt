benefit accrued by the Cohesion Countries , but also , and above all , the benefits which derive from the global approach of the Member States .
Finally I should like to thank my colleagues for their help with this report and , of course , the staff of the secretariat of the Committee for Regional Policy .
If there were no criteria for the options , the implementation of the Cohesion Fund itself might actually serve to increase the social and local disparities in the beneficiary Member States .
We therefore fully support the strategy announced by the Commission , to step up , by means of the Cohesion Fund , the implementation of Community directives , for example in areas such as water , supply , management and treatment .
Hopes were not high , but the results were even more disastrous than expected .
In spite of that , the Council decisions in this field are disappointing .
Chesa report ( A4-0032/97 ) The recent arbitrary decision by the World Trade Organization on the banana market has revealed a growing and perceptible tendency for this Organization to bend to the interests and wishes of the American economy .
Novo Belenguer report ( A4-0210/97 ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you , know a few days ago Commissioner Emma Bonino , at a press conference , stated that there had been cases of fraudulent exports of beef from the United Kingdom .
Thirdly , as the Commissioner informed the press , albeit without enough detail and without giving all the necessary information , she should now at least inform this Chamber - if possible , with complete information this time .
In this particular case , around half of the Community payments will go into developing the sector , from research to taxation , into non-industrial fisheries , into restructuring the sector as a whole , into the biological protection of resources .
As a basic guideline , we have supported the notion that a twelve mile zone has to be reserved exclusively for local coastal and non-industrial fisheries , as they are the economic and social base of many regions in all nearby countries and in the case of Senegal the essential base for people 's food requirements and their very survival .
Personally and on behalf of my Group , I wish her all the best for the future .
I think that the Commission should pay particular attention to five vital aspects : the advantage of setting out in a single text the legal framework for telecommunications , bearing in mind that the sector 's commercial activity should be facilitated , especially that of SMEs ; secondly , access in equal conditions to networks and services as one of the main obligations of telecommunications exploiters ; thirdly , the need to ensure a universal service so that the liberalization of telecommunications infrastructures and services does not act against consumers ; fourthly , to guarantee transparency in the system of prices and the establishment of a fair billing method ; fifthly , to guarantee throughout the European Union a competitive environment enabling Community telecommunications companies to compete worldwide , as provided for in the recent WTO agreement on the mutual opening of telecommunications .
Two remarks on the lines of others that we have made and that we wish to make as expressions of a position that goes against the current of privatizing liberalization .
For us they are the only way of ensuring that the European Parliament takes part in the proper definition of compulsory spending , especially on farming .
That is because we know that these spending cuts in agriculture - and now in the fisheries agreements - have been adopted in full or in part by the Council and would inevitably go together with other cuts in other budgetary sectors .
The Commission has already made use of this instrument , notably in the field of humanitarian aid , through the framework partnership contracts .
We hope that through these co-financing support programmes , the quality and the accuracy of reporting will improve , and therefore the idea is to extend progressively these pluriannual schemes to as many NGOs as possible .
If you are interested and made a request , I am sure the reply would be very quick .
During that meeting it was agreed that the Donors ' Democratic Development Group would meet regularly with the highest Kenyan authorities to have a dialogue on basic questions concerning the forthcoming elections in Kenya .
The events which took place last week in Kenya , during which 14 people died in violent confrontations sparked off by police efforts to break up rallies called to press for constitutional reforms , proved that the situation is deteriorating and that the need for dialogue between the government , the opposition and the donor community is all the more necessary and urgent .
During the visit I made to Kenya I myself made it clear to President arap Moi and his team that we would be willing to cooperate and even intensify our cooperation , but that our conditions are clear and have been clearly restated in the revision of the Lom√© Convention , particularly in Article 5 on civil rights and political rights , but also with regard to good governance .
Mr President , in Africa in particular , the Commission is already engaged in a major effort to support vaccination programmes .
This has been our policy in the fight against some diseases as I explained to the Director of the World Health Organization and to some NGOs from the other side of the Atlantic and elsewhere who visited me for that purpose .
The Commission has taken the lead within the European Union on the dialogue with the Organization of African Unity , in particular with regard to assistance to the OAU conflict mechanism .
