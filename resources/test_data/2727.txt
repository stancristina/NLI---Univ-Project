resources to work involving the enlarged EU.
The Commission 's annual policy statement has promised a further review of the RELEX Directorate-General 's cooperation and efficiency .
We wish to see results on these points before we agree to 500 new posts .
Mr President , when , a few months ago , we established the guidelines for the 2003 Budget , there was widespread agreement in the European Parliament on three priorities for category 5 .
Through its far-sighted policy , the European Parliament has worked long and hard to bring about the coming enlargement .
This work must also make inroads in the EU 's own organisation .
It is good that the organisation is being streamlined , that the meetings are becoming more open and that the summits are becoming less of a publicity stunt .
Finally , I also wonder about the strategic programme , covering many years , which the Council is to adopt .
.
We believe that the common position is better .
Finally , we would like to stress that it is important in the future to take into consideration the weight of the machines when technical and environmental development is carried out .
It is also a question of consumers ' fundamental right to be able to choose what they buy and what they eat .
There is no scientific agreement on the benefits of GM technology in the area of food .
The technology is controversial and our knowledge of the field is growing rapidly .
When the Commission has acted to modernise the European Union 's policy in this area , regulations for traceability , labelling and corporate responsibility have formed the basis for the policy .
The addition of remains from proscribed GM products must naturally also not be allowed .
Could it be the case that people realise that most consumers would exercise their freedom of choice by not choosing GM products ?
We know that on this issue there is strong pressure from industry and from certain national governments to vote against the line taken by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
However , I believe that they have come too late by around 10-15 years , as GMOs are already being used in the production of a very large proportion of our food .
I profess that I believe in science , I believe in this technology and I believe that we should use our knowledge , but we must be aware that new knowledge always means new risks and requires increased caution .
The consumer requires labelling , and the consumer is always right .
I also support a number of the amendments proposed by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance which go one step further .
As we make a framework decision in the EU which means that EU citizens can be extradited and taken to court for crimes in all Member States , we must also guarantee the Rule of Law .
I listened with great interest to what the Commissioner said about time spent on remand .
I will do my best to replace Mrs Paulsen who put the question .
The Commission needs to take special measures and review the situation .
We know that food prices account for a great deal of what European citizens have to pay out each month , not least those on the lowest incomes .
Will the Commissioner consider at a later stage , when it becomes necessary , producing some form of statistical background ?
Do you believe that this will be a long-term conflict with the US , or are you hopeful that the countermeasures currently planned by the European Union will lead to the Americans coming to their senses ?
The public is very concerned over the handling of genetically modified organisms .
Directive 2001/18/EC , the EU Novel Food Regulation and the proposal on genetically modified food and feed have all been developed on the basis of these requirements .
It also makes it easier to supply correct information to all the players in the whole production and distribution chain .
We believe these measures are an important step on the road to re-establishing consumer and public confidence .
However , I would like to state that the Commission considered this issue very carefully in conjunction with drawing up the proposal .
These amendments restrict the traceability requirements to products demonstrably containing DNA and proteins .
As such , the Commission cannot accept these amendments .
With regard to the purpose , it is important to remember that although traceability makes it easier to implement any necessary safety measures , it cannot be considered a safety measure in itself .
I would also like to point out that traceability is not a tool for dealing with the issue of co-existence .
Therefore , the Commission cannot accept the amendments concerning this issue - Amendment No 27 in its entirety and Amendment No 3 in part .
The proposal therefore requires operators to be able to state exactly which genetically modified organisms are present in the products , as well as to forward this information to the operator receiving the products .
The Commission believes that we should not go further than the provisions in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in order to be able to guarantee harmonised and cohesive procedures in trade with third countries .
This would lead to unnecessary extra burdens on operators .
In this context , it is necessary to repeal Article 4.6 of the directive stating that the Member States shall take measures to ensure traceability at all stages of the placing on the market of GMOs .
The current Community framework for authorisation already includes a number of conditions for authorising genetically modified organisms and genetically modified food , such as the condition that they must not have damaging effects on public health or the environment .
