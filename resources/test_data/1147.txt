We propose to put the burden of proof on the defendant , and we even have amendments that would further pass the benefit of doubt to the accuser and not to the accused .
Then there is the issue of malicious allegations - in which , sadly , we have seen a huge increase - putting a lot of employers to great expense and to great cost .
My own party was accused by a lot of left-wingers of racism because it spoke out on the issue of asylum-seekers in the United Kingdom .
In the case of employers , even if an employer manages to mount a successful defence to these unjustified cases , the time and anxiety of a tribunal or a court hearing will be a huge imposition .
Given the bias of this legislation in favour of the accuser and the prevailing climate of political correctness that we seem to be obsessed with , even many innocent employers will frequently lose their cases , incurring penalties , as well as court costs and lost time .
This legislation , I am sorry to say , is an invitation to trouble makers and those with chips on their shoulders to bring frivolous and vexatious complaints , or possibly to use even the threat of a complaint to secure financial compensation .
( Heckling ) There is , of course , another danger , and that is that employers , aware of the risk of complaints from unsuccessful ethnic minority candidates , may even avoid putting them on short lists altogether , which would be a terrible disaster and completely against the spirit of the legislation .
As so often in this House , we have failed to think through the possible unintended consequences .
This legislation is unnecessary at a European level .
Most Member States already have their own anti-discrimination measures designed to suit their own culture and their own circumstances .
I am proud to say that I am opposed to discrimination and racism in all its forms , but this irrational and unjust legislation will bring Europe further into disrepute among many of my constituents .
I am pleased to say that the rest of my delegation will be joining me in opposing it .
Mr President , I wish to make three points .
Firstly , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , the draftspeople and the Commission - in particular Commissioner Diamantopoulou - on the directive and the report we have in front of us .
It has been a long time coming .
I was the chairman of the European Parliament ' s Committee of Inquiry into the growth of racism and fascism in Europe back in 1986 , when our rapporteur , Mr Evregenis , proposed such legislation .
I myself was the rapporteur for the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia in 1990 that reiterated that demand .
I suppose in a way it was worth waiting .
We have here legislation that will make a real impact on the lives of the 12 to 14 million third country nationals living in the European Union and the 4 million black Europeans .
Secondly , and without subtracting an iota from my support for the report and the directive as a whole , the Council will have to resolve a number of outstanding issues : on representative actions , on the definition of indirect discrimination and , as the previous speaker said , on the burden of proof .
The last of these must be workable , because otherwise we will keep the previous speaker happy !
The best basis is the existing burden-of-proof legislation , which is now underpinned by 25 years of case-law , and where the numbers are not available , expert opinion will suffice .
Thirdly and finally , I wish to warn my colleagues in the PPE Group .
Many of them - the large majority I believe - have been genuinely concerned that Parliament ' s procedures have not given them adequate time to consider the detail .
Yet a few clearly have darker motives .
With Mr Haider and Mr Le Pen lurking in the background , the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento Sociale Fiamma Tricolore promoting racism and xenophobia , the PPE Group , as a whole , should not be surprised if people conclude that if they continue with their technical objections , then this is a thinly disguised attempt to block these proposals which the vast majority of Europe so much welcomes .
Those who lie down with dogs get fleas .
I would like to thank Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt for the work that they have put into this , which has been both a personal as well as a political commitment .
As others have said , this is an aspirational directive about the sort of Europe we want to create .
It is directly relevant , for once , to the lives of many people living within the European Union .
From my constituency of London where a large portion of the population come from minority ethnic groups and where there is a growing number of children of mixed-race relationships , this is an exceedingly important directive .
It is even more important for those areas where people wrongly feel that there is no need for anti-racist or anti-discrimination legislation , because there are no visibly non-white people , but yet they will still vote for parties which espouse racist or anti-asylum seeker policies , because they are afraid of the unknown and the different .
I welcome the directive .
I am pleased Council feels a sense of urgency about it .
I assume this will be reflected in their willingness to take on board what Parliament is saying .
We have to acknowledge that in this House we regularly call upon other countries and governments to recognise the
