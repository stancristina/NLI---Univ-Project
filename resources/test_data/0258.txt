Despite the differing situations in Member States , there are generally fewer women in the labour market , they are most affected by unemployment , including long-term unemployment , and by casual labour , part-time work and atypical , insecure and badly paid work .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish first of all to congratulate the French Presidency on initiating this debate .

The situation with Peru and Mr Fujimori has not yet degenerated into a disaster , Mr President .
The Council must not leave various specific proposals that have been postponed year after year simply hanging in the air .
