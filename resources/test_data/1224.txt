Nevertheless , we will not achieve the interoperability needed by liberalising this sector .
We are responsible to Europe 's citizens .
This situation is untenable , because we are reaching saturation point in road transport , which is imposing a very heavy burden on our economic and environmental systems .
As the draftsman of the opinion of the AFET Committee says : 'the key objective of EU humanitarian action is to respond promptly and efficiently to the needs of the victims of humanitarian crises , in order to alleviate their suffering in a spirit of human solidarity .
I have also been looking at some of the suggestions emanating from the relevant committee as regards the introduction of a safety certificate for train operating companies and for those responsible for infrastructure management .
Still on this subject , I would like to mention the White Paper European transport policy for 2010 : time to decide which refers in various places to the need to reverse the trend away from rail and towards road transport .
These measures deserve our approval , given that they will make a serious contribution to improving road safety .
For the same reason , we think it is important that there should be a forum at EU level , and indeed one already exists , the Committee of the Regions , for exchanging experience on the work of these authorities and to provide them with a means of presenting their views at EU level on matters relevant to them .
I particularly support the need for the Union to find new ways for regional and local authorities to participate in Community activities without neglecting the important role of the Committee of the Regions .
I generally support the diagnosis contained in this report concerning the clearly diverse nature of regionalisation and of the very concept of a region , just as I support the view that regionalisation has 'to a large extent been the result of institutional and political developments specific to each of the countries concerned ' .
So we are faced with a difficult paradox : a land rich in resources with a population living on the verge of misery , hunger and death .
The emphasis placed on monetary policies , on giving priority to nominal convergence and on maintaining the blinkered criteria of the Stability Pact is leading to restrictive social policies and being used to justify such policies , and it is having a negative impact on public health policies and on health care for the elderly , as has become clear in Portugal .
The challenge here therefore remains that of achieving some coherence amongst those who say that they are committed to defending health care and care for the elderly .
In Portugal , for example , if we consider the population of working age , greater longevity amongst women means that since 1995 the number of elderly women has been greater than that of young women .
Even in Greece , the country where public finance makes the lowest contribution to health services , the figure is about 56 % , rising to 84 % in the United Kingdom .
Lastly , I believe that the Greek Presidency should examine the European Community strategy and action programme in the field of public health , with a view to the next European Council in the spring adopting the use of the open method of coordination and a precise timetable for cooperation between the Member States .
I am also pleased that an agreement was reached , stipulating a ban on experimenting and marketing for most testing methods within six years and , with regard to tests for which alternative methods have not yet been tested , a ten-year transposition period for this ban .
Like local , regional or national institutions , the European institutions must also be free to adopt a position , criticise or praise the practices of institutions other than their own .
We wish to distance ourselves clearly from a vision of control and of interference in the domestic affairs of the Member States , which is reinforced in the Treaties and which we criticised at the time , whereas others have supported it and continue to do so .
.
The methodological shift employed by the rapporteur ( and by the narrow majority ) has led to exaggerated views that show utter contempt for the fact that the European Union is one of the few privileged regions in the entire world where human rights and respect and guarantees for these are concerned .
( PT ) I wish to congratulate Mr Pirker on the excellent report he has produced on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled ' Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union ' which I fully support , in particular with regard to the aptness of creating a European Corps of Border Guards .
Nevertheless , it is clear that in the Schengen acquis , structures with competences and powers to define 'common standards ' and processes for police cooperation are already in place .
Despite the rapporteur 's suggestion to create a European corps of border guards composed of special units , to be made available on a temporary basis to the national authorities in high-risk sectors at external borders , when needed and requested by the Member States , which is controversial , my opinion on the report as a whole is positive and I have therefore voted for it .
This must not , however , in light of the experience gained from applying the Schengen acquis , prevent the development of a coordinated policy for the management of current and future external borders , incorporating into this policy the best practices established by the Member States .
( PT ) This report should be seen against the backdrop of the action plan
