We cannot possibly afford to give the competitive edge to outsiders in this way .
Secondly , research and development must be made to benefit the SME sector .
There are 19 million SMEs and we have 16 million unemployed .     . –Mr President , Commissioner , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy has drafted a committee-initiative report on European research policy .
My main message is this : our group is in favour of guaranteeing additional resources for scientific research work .
The Commission ’s proposal for additional funds under the Seventh Framework Programme is justified .
It should not be just business that derives the benefit .
It means to find something by chance that you did not even know you were looking for .
That is an area in which the Greens confuse fission with fusion .
All participants can reap the benefits that result .
In the case of ITER , the beneficiaries include countries not in the EU.
Its central component is price reductions , amounting to almost 40 % , and quota cuts .
There is a certain feature of the reform of the sugar sector which has been absent from previous agricultural reforms .
This would be of no benefit to the EU budget .
I was happy to note that in your opening speech you were prepared to re-examine this point .     Mr President , the good news about the Spring Summit was that a decision was taken to draw up a long-term strategy to reduce greenhouse emissions .
A decision was also taken to consider setting binding targets for the mid - and long-term .
Unfortunately , recent history has shown that it has been considerably easier for the European Union to draw up and agree ambitious targets than it has been to implement them .
It is plainly obvious from all the reports that Romania still essentially fails to meet the conditions of membership .
I vehemently object , however , to the clearance sale of membership conditions that Parliament has agreed to today through its recommendation .
Mr President , I thank Parliament , and the rapporteur Mr Samuelsen , for the forward-looking resolution on the Western Balkans and for the commitment of Parliament and of its Foreign Affairs Committee to the region .
Currently , most of the countries in the Western Balkans are making tangible progress in their relations with the EU.
The years 2005 and 2006 will be crucial for the Western Balkans in relation to the European Union .
The most critical immediate issues concern the conclusion of the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia – ICTY – and the settlement of the future status of Kosovo .
This support for human rights , the rule of law and UN-based multilateralism is the reason why the European Union has made cooperation with ICTY a condition in its relations with the countries in the region .
Looking at Albania , I share the concern expressed in Parliament’s resolution on the political climate , particularly in the context of this summer ’s parliamentary elections .
I have recently written to Prime Minister Nano to underline that the Commission will only be able to propose the conclusion of negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement if the parliamentary elections this summer are conducted in accordance with international standards .
Bosnia and Herzegovina is actively tackling the priorities we identified in the feasibility report in late 2003 .
On ICTY cooperation , there is significant progress , and the trend must be reinforced to lead to full cooperation .
I believe , however , that the country is ready to assume more responsibility for its own future .
I was disappointed that Croatia was not able to ensure full cooperation with the ICTY by mid-March .
As you know , in December the European Council decided that accession negotiations could only be opened on 17 March , if there was full cooperation with the Hague Tribunal .
Croatia must now demonstrate that it is fully cooperating with the ICTY .
Through the adoption of the negotiating framework , the EU has done what is necessary to start the negotiations .
President Barroso and I met Prime Minister Bučkovski in February when he handed over the country ’s replies to the Commission ’s questionnaire .
I am concerned about the OSCE reports on the repetition of irregularities in the latest municipal elections .
The authorities must now react decisively and ensure that future elections can take place in full compliance with international standards .
Yesterday the Commission took a positive decision on the Feasibility Study for Serbia and Montenegro .
Negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement is very different from negotiating accession to the Union .
I welcome the agreement concluded last week on the Constitutional Charter , which ensures the legitimacy of the State Union Parliament .
Efforts should be reinforced until none of the remaining indictees is still at large .
Accession negotiations proper cannot even be considered until the country has achieved full cooperation with ICTY .
This is the beginning of the European road for Serbia and Montenegro .
Kosovo will be high on the agenda in the months to come , with the standards review coming up in mid-2005 , likely to be followed by discussions on Kosovo’s future status .
The Commission plans to present a Communication next week on ‘A European Future for Kosovo’ .
Belgrade also needs to work constructively to settle the issue .
In the Feasibility Study for Serbia and Montenegro , we made it clear to Belgrade that the country ’s EU aspirations are linked to a successful resolution of Kosovo’s status .
Those countries struggling to reform antiquated economies , and to build modern societies based on respect for human rights and the rule of law , have , at the same time , to deal with the
