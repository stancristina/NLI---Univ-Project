Our common interests are based on a desire to maximise security ; this includes security in foreign policy , the fight against terrorism and other aspects , such as the major environmental issues , which need to be resolved .
Changes must therefore be made to these agendas , and we must develop some kind of plan , idea or strategy to form the basis of this transatlantic marketplace .
We need an international conference on debt relief , but the Paris Club , being no more than a meeting of creditors , is incapable of staging one .
I agree with Mr Schmit that it should not only be the countries affected by the terrible natural disaster that are considered when talking of the implications of foreign debt .
The fact is that , ever since the Helsinki Final Act , the vitally important thing about Europe is that every country possesses the right of self-determination – but its people have to fight for it .
His victory is an outstanding one , gained under difficult economic circumstances and in a region still suffering the effects of the Chernobyl disaster , and , most of all , of the Soviet regime .
These specialised staff had been working for the Commission for decades , and over half of them were between the ages of 55 and 59 .
The first tenders have already been invited , and it is reported that the first contracts have already been awarded .
In January 2003 , we made efforts to prevent the execution of his spiritual leader , Lama Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche , and did likewise in November 2004 , when the two-year stay of execution expired .
Our specific concern today is with the fate of a senior Tibetan monk and of a bishop of the Chinese underground church , the brutal persecution of both of whom violates the universally accepted principle of freedom of religion .
There is , however , one area in which no deals can be done , and that is in the field of human rights .
What is going on in Iran must be carefully investigated and examined , and so there are two points on which I cannot endorse this resolution , and in respect of which I will be moving an oral amendment .
I do not see last December’s United Nations resolution as an interruption to this dialogue , but rather as a component of our policy and an admonition to us .
If we are not to suspend trade relations with Iran , with what country does he want us to suspend them ?     Mr President , we are all agreed that trafficking in women and children is a crime ; this case in Cambodia is , alas , but one among many , and there are a great many such cases around the world that are not known about .
We must start by discharging our own responsibilities in Europe and then press home the point to our Cambodian partners that this is a fundamental human rights issue and one on which we will yield not an inch , and we must be willing not only to give them massive support in building up their justice system , but also , within the EU , to clean our own house .     Mr President , please accept my apologies , but I had already said at the beginning of this debate on human rights that two prominent human rights activists , Mr Kovalev from Russia and Mrs Estemirova from Chechnya were here today to receive our group ’s Robert Schuman Medal .
This is a point we must emphasise .     Mr President , I believe that there is nothing left to add .
The European Parliament is the epicentre of developments in Europe , and your presence at tomorrow’s meeting is therefore to be welcomed .     Mr President , I am not sure whether I have correctly understood the formal announcement you have just made .
I saw the profound shock in the eyes of my fellow Member , Mr Poettering , and it was a real treat to observe his reaction .
Saying ‘yes ’ to some and ‘no’ to others is unacceptable .
If you read our resolution , you will see that we are willing to engage in constructive cooperation with you , but only if you , along with your Commission , are willing to build a social Europe .
Deportation to Iran in these circumstances – and we have opposed it in two previous resolutions – exposes a woman to the danger of stoning , persecution or even death .
Welfare benefits are being cut or recipients ’ contributions drastically increased , and schemes based on solidarity are increasingly being shunted towards dependence on private funding .
Anyone calling for flexibility , however , must know that flexibility and social security are not mutually exclusive ; as the Nordic model has shown , the public is in fact willing to accept a greater degree of flexibility if a social safety net is in place and if there are also , for example , extensive opportunities for further training to enable people to cope with the implications of this flexibility , including its social implications .
We must offer a vision to the people of these countries , and so it is certainly worth considering whether there should perhaps be another option besides full membership , an option that does not close the door on full membership but holds out that prospect as a long-term goal .
Among the reasons why things have not worked as well as they should in the past have been the lack of impact assessments of legislative proposals and the inadequate way in which the consultation of stakeholders has been conducted .
Why do we keep conveying the impression to the
