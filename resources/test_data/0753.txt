As the rapporteur for this Parliament on the original resolution four years ago , I cannot but comment that this represents a failure of political commitment in Europe to aiding five million refugees , some of the poorest of the poor , in Asia and in Latin America .
Nevertheless we are here now , and the Socialist Group supports the rapporteur ' s recommendation for adoption of this regulation with the minimum of amendments , already agreed in principle with the Council , in order to allow a fast-track , one-reading approval of the extension , and in reality to allow refugee support projects this year to go ahead rather than be cancelled .
The need for this work remains as strong as it did four years ago .
It is no good us debating conflict resolution in the Parliament and then finding that the sole support to assist people when the guns are put down or when the period of immediate humanitarian assistance is at an end is then forgotten altogether .
This regulation has enabled us to intervene in countries where there is deep conflict with serious abuses of human rights .
For example in Afghanistan , which has today broken all world records for refugees with six million people having left the country since 1992 , leaving the single largest and longest staying refugee population in the world .
Or like the protection of the terrorised indigenous peoples fleeing from Burma .
As one conflict ends another begins , as the half a million returnees expected in Timor by December this year go to demonstrate .
On this regulation , we know that the Council has some divided thinking .
I have to say , Mr Patten , I regret that the Commission does too .
Whilst it has supported projects in Asia to a great degree it has failed to address properly and with sufficient vigour the problems of refugees and internally displaced people in Latin America .
You know that I have spent much time visiting and studying the problems of violent , armed conflict in Colombia .
In that country alone there have been 800 000 internally displaced people since 1996 ; 123 000 new internally displaced people between January and June last year .
It is a disgrace that with this regulation the European Commission in the past has failed to address this problem .
The sort of forced displacement that we have seen in Colombia I have seen too in Chiapas in southern Mexico where the presence of international aid workers is essential for the protection of human rights .
Finally , I would like to congratulate Mr Deva on his report , thank him for his kind words in his speech and endorse what he says .
I know he will be listening carefully to the Commissioner when he sums up to see if he will put on record that promise to ensure that a future proposal for a multiannual regulation comes forward and that the annual reports will be provided .
With Mr Deva we ask those questions of you , Mr Patten , and if we do not get satisfactory answers the Socialists on this side of the House will be supporting Mr Deva in taking a very different stance on this report altogether .
Mr President , it is not only a political responsibility but a moral responsibility that the European Union has to help those in straits outside its boundaries as equally as they can .
This being the purpose of this report , I congratulate its rapporteur , Mr Deva .
To help those in need when it is in our hands to do so , at the end of the day , results in our really helping ourselves .
The Bible as always is right when it states that there is a giving which does not impoverish .
The other side of the coin is also true .
Hoarding does impoverish .
Countries that have serious internal hostilities and all the terrible reaping of that where the innocent go to the wall and countries encouraging displaced persons to return home ought to be helped .
The fact of the matter is that those displaced are mostly women and children .
This makes it even more imperative that action should be taken .
Food supplies , water and sanitation , housing and shelter , education are , of course , the top priorities .
I welcome the recognition of this .
I believe that the four amendments submitted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation must be accepted by the Commission and I hope that the Commissioner , Mr Patten , who did not very often give me happy replies on other things when he was in another office , perhaps today will give me some little encouragement that Christmas is really coming .
It is essential that annual reports are submitted by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council , as is specified .
If such reports are not forthcoming then I could not find my vote to go with this renewal .
I believe that the Commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do .
The financial framework needs to be introduced in keeping with provisions already agreed to .
These provisions must be strictly adhered to and this change is absolutely necessary .
The new text on comitology is necessary and when the long-term future of this regulation is assessed , this Parliament must have before it independent valuation reports , so where improvements can be made they can press upon the Commission to make those improvements .
Where they think this expenditure of finance can be maximised to a better reaching of the objective and target of these regulations , then we should have the information before us so as to give us a good , healthy and proper debate
