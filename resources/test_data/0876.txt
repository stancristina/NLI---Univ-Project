Above all , however , because this storm led to an invasion of salt , which covered the entire lower part of all the islands in the Azores .
All countries which , like Portugal , are fortunate enough to have long coastlines , occasionally experience spills that turn up on beaches with no indication of where they have come from or of who is responsible .
Mr President , I wish to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his answer .
I was part of an EP delegation that visited one of the camps and our feeling was that whilst the camps are working , things are more or less all right .
Commissioner , you should not be surprised by the fact that I too am congratulating you on the answer you have given us .
Lastly , Commissioner , I wish to ask a question on Angola 's intervention in neighbouring countries - because the Angolan Government and its armed forces have indeed been involved in various conflicts in neighbouring countries .
We welcome the European Commission 's original initiative of making craft more compatible with environmental laws currently in force , specifically those concerning : exhaust and particulate emissions that degrade the quality of bathing waters ; and also engine noise , which damages both the environment and the well-being of local populations and holiday-makers .
Can Europe refuse to intervene in a sector that is one of the most promising for its future development ?
Our question is this : what is the Commission doing to achieve this ?
We regret the fact that the EU has not issued a clear and resounding condemnation of this aggression against Iraq and we insist on the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces .
I share the concern that creating the Statute for the European Cooperative Society should respect employees ' acquired rights and the protection of these rights , both when an SCE is set up and in the structural changes of an already-existing SCE.
.
Similarly , I believe that allowing arrangements for the involvement of employees to be renegotiated in the case of substantial structural changes following the creation of an SCE could be at odds with the aforementioned article , which makes me fear for the solidity and viability of these bodies .

There is a clear political attempt by the rapporteur and the committees delivering an opinion to promote the allocation of more and greater powers to Parliament , and they all allege that this claim is merely based on doctrines accepted in law .
Priority must be attached to policies and measures aimed at prevention , for example , developing forms of research and support for access to the best technology available , paying particular attention to the problems and specific characteristics of small and medium-sized companies .
.
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the President-in-Office for his extensive answer , but I feel I must suggest that we need to go further .
Mr President , education is a crucial weapon in the fight against poverty .
The European Union has distinguished itself internationally for its adherence to this approach , both in Europe and with regard to those countries whose development we support .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , one might be surprised at the way in which the first few recitals of this report have been interpreted but , in the final analysis , this merely shows that everyone agrees with the evidence : the disastrous situation facing the European economy , specifically slow growth , the loss of confidence amongst investors and consumers and the increase in unemployment , to which I would add the unsustainable levels of income inequality , poverty and social exclusion .
We must also ask ourselves about the causes of this situation and the answer to this question can be found in the policies that have been pursued to date .
The most shocking aspect of this report , therefore , which closely follows the Commission 's recommendations for this year 's economic guidelines , is the argument it makes for its increasingly neoliberal measures despite the serious consequences they are having .
If this is a sign that the time has come for the European institutions to look more closely at the real state of the Union 's economic development than at the uncritical and , sometimes , irrational compliance with criteria of debatable scientific value , all well and good .
Lastly , it would have been useful if the report had made a recommendation for the evaluation of excessive deficits to include a toned-down golden rule .
We therefore hoped that replacing one member of the Executive Board , in this case by Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell , an Austrian , might help to change the current situation .
( PT ) We have become increasingly concerned about money laundering , which constitutes a source of funding for international terrorism and crime .
Although this proposal is limited , it is a step in the right direction , promoting the harmonisation of customs procedures , with the aim not only of supplementing the supervision of cross-border fund transfers by financial institutions , but also of monitoring cash movements at or above the threshold of EUR 15 000 , which warrants our support .
This outbreak , in conjunction with the other food and health crises that have beset the EU ( BSE , dioxins , sewage slurry , nitrofurans , etc ) , demonstrates the bankruptcy of the current model of agricultural development and the consequences of a CAP based on exports , on bringing prices down and on opening up the markets .
Research and technology must not be developed under conditions imposed by competition and the market .

It should be noted that our group has followed this trial from
