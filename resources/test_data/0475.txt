politicians very well .
We have concentrated on one person , or one body of people , in fact , on one narrow group of people in power .
We should therefore broaden the scope of our political contact with Russia , and , this would help us to understand the changes that take place there so unexpectedly .
I think we should discover how , for example , the competition for transporting food aid granted to Russia by Europe was organised .
The Northern Dimension , medical care , the Nordic regions , etc , will all be important .
Mr President , this time we are discussing Russia ' s financial crisis .
It is just one of those serious inter-related problems , or crises , Russia is struggling against at the same time .
In this I am in full agreement with the view of Mr Paasilinna .
The international community must be patient with Russia .
The European Union must strive to ensure in particular that Russia can develop a workable democratic system for itself , with viable social and economic institutions .
There are particularly favourable opportunities for this in border areas between the EU and Russia , as the bilateral agreement on co-operation in neighbouring areas made between Finland and Russia at the start of the 1990s shows .
Unfortunately , there have been difficulties in communication between the European Parliament and the Duma .
We must hope that it will be organised again as soon as possible .
It might still be appropriate to hold a seminar this autumn , one in which we could acquire more expert knowledge on economic and social conditions in Russia .
Aid has been both used wrongly and granted wrongly .
We in the European Union have granted it in the wrong way .
The whole of the upper stratum of society is party to this corruption .
We just speak of corruption , but we do not say directly that this is a matter of criminal activity .
A typical example is the relief aid granted to Russia last winter in the form of food aid .
We gave Russia relief aid in the form of food to cover the time of the winter frosts , and that food is still on its way to Russia .
That food is being sold in Russian shops , and thus the price of Russian agricultural produce and food is being caused to tumble , and farmers ' hopes of practising their own food production are being dashed .
Food aid was an agricultural policy , which cost us taxpayers a lot more than if a corresponding amount of social aid had been given in the form of money .
In addition to death sentences passed at secretly held trials , we have today had news of new harsh political sentences .
Madam President , the acoustics here are so bad that it is difficult to hear the interpreter .
I request that the volume be lowered .
I would also like to remind you all that only a few weeks ago , when approving the Commission , the Parliament approved a declaration in which it stressed its desire to be involved in influencing the negotiation of international agreements , at the different stages of the negotiations , so it would truly be a shame if Parliament neglected to take advantage of this opportunity .
For our part , we must all swiftly rectify this basic error : this is not so much a matter which concerns producers : these crises are crises of the food production industry and the feedingstuffs industry , for which the producer then winds up involuntarily looking like the responsible party .
It is inconceivable that it has been possible to use sewage sludge for years in the preparation of feed and in fertiliser , although this was banned in the EU ten years ago .
Our European agriculture model has received a heavy blow and , because of this , we must swiftly take up these issues .
For this reason , the factories using prohibited substances must be closed immediately .
Sewage sludge and waste cannot be permitted to be used in animal feed .
What we are concerned with is macro-economic financial assistance for those countries .
The European Union can guarantee that the cost of borrowing is less than it would be if these countries borrowed the funds directly from the international markets .
The aid to be given to Macedonia is the most problematic of these financings , because in this instance it is not only a case of a loan , but also of a grant , to be paid over two years .
The Committee on Budgets draws its attention to this fact .
For this reason , the Committee on Budgets has proposed to the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy that it should demand a revision of the Financial Perspective in this regard , and positive reference has been made to this in the report .
Neither is it unconnected with the fact that at this moment in time there are not sufficient funds available to realise all those projects in Category 4 which the Council and the Commission want to realise and which they have proposed .
Mr President , the promotion of the use of renewable energy sources is of particular importance for environmental reasons .
The Union cannot meet its environmental targets unless the use of renewable energy sources is actively increased .
Renewable energy sources reduce the dependence on imported energy and an increase in their use will also improve competitiveness .
The ALTENER programme is a step in the right direction .
As has been stated here , however , this programme alone is by no means sufficient .
In future we will need to investigate how we can increase investment in the greater use of renewable energy sources
