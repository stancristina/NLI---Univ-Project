I ask Commissioner Patten in closing the debate , first to assure us that the facility will be utilised in response to crises world-wide in support of the EU 's development goals and not just in Europe 's own backyard .
Second , could he tell us how he could make such a promise when year after year the Commission proposes funding interventions in Central and Eastern Europe and in the former Yugoslavia at the expense of budget lines benefiting the developing countries .
Third , will he undertake to bring forward a detailed operational relationship between the rapid reaction facility and the financing of ECHO and indeed explain why he has not at one and the same time brought forward proposals to speed up our humanitarian assistance as part of the reform programme which he knows we support .
Finally , can he tell us is he shares our belief that development is the best form of conflict prevention and to commit himself to enhancing the EU 's development programme to avoid the need for crisis intervention in future years .
Madam President , can I say we have made enormous progress over the last three years in terms of relations with the DPRK.
We have now had three interparliamentary delegation meetings and the resolution calls for the Koreans to come here again to continue the dialogue .
We have seen the European Commission move from not talking to the North Koreans to having an ECHO representative in Pyongyang and we have now moved from five Member States with diplomatic relations to , I understand , thirteen in the process of establishing diplomatic relations with the DPRK.
I would like very much to see the European Community also establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK.
We give money to the KEDO project as Mr Patten has said , we give humanitarian and food aid and are hoping to give other structural assistance , a total of EUR 275 m .
It is crazy to be doing that without having the ability to have a political dialogue .
We need a dialogue on human rights , we need a dialogue on weapon sales , we need a dialogue on economic development .
The reality is that with the collapse of the Soviet empire , the failure to make the transition from the Stakhanovite heavy industries of the past to the new light industries and a series of natural disasters , the economy is in complete crisis .
Observers are estimating that the resulting food crisis has led to the premature deaths of 3 million North Koreans , one in eight of the population .
Today their only exports are raw materials and military hardware .
If we can find a solution , we can help the people of the DPRK to help themselves with food aid and assistance in restarting and rebuilding agriculture , mining and non-nuclear energy projects .
And if we involve ourselves in removing the imperative to export military material then we may force the incoming Bush administration to reconsider its apparent blind commitment to national missile defence with the threat to world peace and stability that poses .
I would like to congratulate President Kim Dae-Jung of the Republic of Korea on his commitment to the sunshine policy which will allow the normalisation of inter-Korean relations and welcome Kim Jong Il 's positive response .
Dialogue is the way forward .
Europe should pursue this not only because it is currently the policy of the Republic of Korea but because it is the right way to go .
Our advantage is that we are not Japan or the United States and we can act as honest brokers in this most dangerous area of the world .
Mr President , I want to propose a technical oral amendment to Amendment No 28 .
I apologise for not spotting the technicality in committee .
Amendment No 28 reads at present : " The Community shall each year set a global ceiling for funding action under this Regulation . "
As Commissioner Patten pointed out during the debate , it is not the " Community " which sets the budgetary ceiling , it is the Budgetary Authority .
I should like to propose orally that we delete the word " Community " and insert instead the words " Budgetary Authority" , so that the amendment would now read : " The Budgetary Authority shall each year set a global ceiling for funding action under this Regulation . "
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) Report ( A5-0338/2000 ) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the situation of frontier workers [2000/2010(INI) ] After paragraph 2
.
I am pleased to join with our colleagues in the Development Committee in adding my full support for the Commission ' s proposal for a new Cooperation Agreement with Bangladesh .
This new agreement is a further sign of our continuing wish to strengthen our relations with Bangladesh .
I hope it will leave the way open for the Bangladesh government to also intensify their efforts to develop the potential of SAARC as a further means of boosting the economy and creating jobs in the region .
The report by Mr Van den Bos and the Miranda resolution clearly set out the main characteristics of the Bangladesh economy and the many challenges facing the government , its institutions , its politicians and its people .
Bangladesh is one of the poorest developing countries .
Almost half of its population of 127 million people is living below the poverty line .
It has lived with and is constantly faced with the dangers of flooding and cyclones .
Despite this , it has managed to show some improvement in the standard of living over the past 25 years .
Economic reforms in the 1990s have recorded significant achievements with GDP , on average , rising to 4.8
