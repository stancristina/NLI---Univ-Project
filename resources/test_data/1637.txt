for people other than experts .
It discusses the fact that the text on buses showing the destination should be white or yellow on a black background and at least 12 cm high .
In the bus I can understand , but should the destination also be announced by a loudspeaker outside the bus too ?
I think that would lead to a terrible racket in many towns where there are a lot of buses .
In that case it might be simpler for the driver to do as he does today , which is to say that we have now arrived at Burträsk or wherever it may be .
I therefore wonder again whether it is necessary to introduce a requirement for an audible signal when this happens .
I would like to return to my initial point which is that I think that , given the difficult material , Mr Murphy has done an excellent job .
I also think it is good that clear emphasis is placed on increased regionalization and thus also decentralization , since it is clearly difficult to see how else we could achieve effective cooperation between ourselves and 70 states as different as those we have in the ACP agreement .
What I miss in the report , however , and what I would like to have seen included , is a clearer indication of the fact that in the long term we are prepared to adapt the trade preferences which currently exist in the Lomé Convention to the WTO 's rules .
The EU was founded by six states with around 200 million inhabitants .
It is quite inappropriate for the European Parliament to make prejudiced comments on Russia 's possible future membership , not least in view of the fact that Russia has not actually applied for membership .
It must be more in the EU 's interest to establish strong ties with Russia which can develop into a closer cooperation in order to strengthen and guarantee peace and security internationally .
The Russian military are now also demanding increased investment in Russian nuclear weapons as a result of NATO enlargement .
It is therefore very important for the EU to help reduce the worries which NATO 's enlargement causes Russia rather than increase them .
What Mr Cassidy said is not true , that only the industry has carried out studies in this area .
I think the Council itself should take overall responsibility , since this affects the environmental situation in the applicant countries .
I see the Council 's answer as very positive and would just like to ask a supplementary question .
Madam President , let me first stress the importance which the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and I personally attach to the effectiveness of aid for the former Yugoslavia , so that reconstruction takes place quickly and people can return to their homes .
We think that is good .
Let me finish by saying that if any conclusion may be drawn from this , it is that Parliament has performed a very important function , precisely the function which falls to Parliament , namely to ensure as a supervisory authority that when there is cause for criticism , that criticism is made , and to ensure that measures are taken to correct what has gone wrong .
I forgot to point out something at the time which I hope is quite obvious , namely that the deadline for tabling amendments also depends on when voting is to take place .
Mr President , like the other speakers , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur , who is not present , for an excellent report .
Of course , the aim of this report is actually to try to simplify Parliament 's treatment of all the annual reports we have to deal with .
If it carries on like this , I think we will find in a few years ' time that most of our work involves dealing with such annual reports .
When I am out and about talking to people , they often ask me why so few Members of Parliament vote .
On the other hand , it also permits a certain degree of flexibility by allowing the substitutes to come from another committee .
In other words , they could be a substitute in the subcommittee and then become rapporteur for a matter which was then taken up by the main committee .
Having said that , I would like to thank Mr Dell'Alba once again for an excellent report which I am certain will be passed by a large majority today .
But despite the report 's very good , detailed explanatory section , it is impossible to relate Mrs Schaffner 's report to the High Level Panel document , as this is only available in French .
The main conclusion of the report is that free movement has largely become a reality .
What surprises me greatly as a Swede is that no account has been taken of the experience and knowhow which the Scandinavian passport system , which has existed for forty years , has to offer .
In paragraph 23 we read : ' Calls on the Commission to make it clear that workers from non-Community countries are not entitled to the full freedom of movement of Union citizens ' within the Union .
Mrs Schaffner also looks favourably upon the compensatory measures .
The Green Group in the European Parliament has always distanced itself from compensatory measures , and we do so again now .
We are also opposed to the report 's assumption that the Schengen Agreement and the Treaty of Amsterdam are already clear and ratified .
Mr President , to the citizen , freedom of movement within the Union is perhaps the most concrete expression of what Europe means
