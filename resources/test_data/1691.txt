bringing them onto the market in the most diverse formats , and improving its access to an ever-expanding interest group .
We demand that the Member States and the Commission should do three things in respect of the negotiations .
Those in favour included France , Finland was among the neutrals and the British , Danish and Dutch were among the opposition .
If we , and our protective agreement , are not to be left standing by the logic of the market and made subject to it , what we need is an effective legal instrument .
As Mr Samuelsen raised the problem of names in connection with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia I would point out that this problem does not occur in the text to be voted on .
There , upon the spot , he was blown to bits by a grenade ; three other people were killed and fifty wounded .
This House must play its part in securing for the people of the Sahara not only humanitarian aid , but also self-determination , to both of which they are entitled .     Mr President , what is the connection between the Western Sahara , the topic before last in our debate , and Lampedusa , which we are discussing now ?
That has gone astray for some reason .
It is an unfortunate fact that human rights alone will not bring about the political solutions that are needed .
It was at one time possible for people to move freely around Europe , with a lifestyle and culture of their own free choosing .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by congratulating Mr Cabrnoch on his report , which is a very good one .
Within the EU – by which I now mean the EU of 27 – health provision varies from one extreme to another .
It is in the new Member States , as a result of budgetary pressure , that public funding is least secure .
It is rightly seen as being likely to become more important in the future , not only in terms of the money that will be spent on it , but also of its potential for innovation .
I am confident that the PROGRESS programme , on which I am the rapporteur , will soon provide us with an instrument for organising the exchange of best practice , which is so urgently needed , and for pushing through a reciprocal and mutual process of learning from one another .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , with a few exceptions , the measures contained in the financial services plan have already been implemented , or are well on the way to being so .
To be sure , having had a great deluge of legislation , we must now consolidate ; we must ensure not only that it is properly implemented , but also that we learn from our initial experience with it , and that we tackle the next legislative project piece by piece rather than with gusto , as we did before .
Secondly , can we not follow the example of the USA , which is now , at least , bringing transparency and a whiff of control into the world of hedge funds ?
Although we are in favour of Lamfalussy , it must not be allowed to result in a loss of democratic control , of democratic legitimacy and of clarity in the reaching of decisions and the formation of opinion .
It seeks to overburden the Member States by drawing up new lists of what it describes as hazardous substances and by imposing tasks to be regulated by the chemicals policy now in REACH.
Despite the provisions on adherence to good agricultural practice , which have been in force for years , the agricultural sector is still the most significant source of impurities in groundwater .
These daughter directives which we are now to adopt must lay down procedures and parameters whereby this high quality standard may prevail throughout the Community .
We want quality standards and social factors to continue to be built in all 25 Member States , with the environment and consumers still being protected .
I hope that future reports will take as their subject the whole European Union , making no distinction between ‘old ’ and ‘new’ , but depicting it as a whole .     Mr President , may I ask whether you were in the habit of addressing Ian Paisley as ‘Reverend ’ in the days when he was a Member of this House , and whether the reverend gentleman would have been expected to stand when addressing the Chair ?     Mr President , I would like to put forward an oral amendment .
Why is this so ?
Mrs Stenzel will not find it difficult , if she looks at the result of the vote , to see that the report would have been lost if our group had voted against it .
It is incomprehensible that this should be passed over in silence , particularly in view of the increasing number of human rights violations in the country .     .
This change puts millions of jobs throughout Europe at risk .
My group supports the justified demand that the murderer or murderers surrender to the police and that the witnesses should make – whether to the police or to the ombudsman or to some other body – statements that will stand up in court and help ensure that the murderer is punished as he deserves to be .
