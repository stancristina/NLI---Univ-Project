out that part of the report constitutes an acceptance of the need for immediate support for the care of the ill and elderly at home in the form of fiscal , social and employment measures , the need to safeguard not just any pension , but a pension which can support a dignified life and the need for a package of proposals so that new insurance legislation can properly assess all the special aspects of women 's work .
In short , without denying the funding aspect of the problem , we have cut it free so that it no longer depends solely on that aspect .
I should like to start by congratulating Mr Cercas , who worked very closely with the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Women 's Rights , resulting in the impressive consensus in today 's debate .
There is a set of policies which , if they are successful at European level , will support and strengthen the sustainability of pensions .
I think that it is particularly important , as numerous speakers have stressed , that pensions are no longer the exclusive preserve of Ecofin and budgetary discipline and have been discussed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well as by the ministers .
It is therefore important , post Lisbon , that the heads of state have agreed for the first time that they need to work together on pension issues .
The subject of pensions has been discussed at all the Councils - in Feira , Nice and Stockholm - and the study to be presented in Göteborg is being prepared by the newly formed Committee on Social Protection .
What is important is that it was decided post Stockholm to examine the method of open coordination on the question of pensions , taking account , of course , of the question of subsidiarity and the specific problems of each Member States .
And may I remind you that the Commission specifically supported the need for the European Parliament to collaborate with the High Level Committee on the subject of social protection and that this collaboration is now under way .
I asked because , in Turkey 's case , although it exercises violence against Cyprus , a dialogue is under way , on friendly terms no less , and it is already a candidate country , while in other cases Mr Solana says that we do not engage in dialogue with countries which exercise violence .
Secondly , the Turkish air force has repeatedly and frequently violated Greek air space , forcing the Greek air force into dangerous interceptions .
Mr President , it is true that the Council has replied and that the Council and Commission have made statements .
Mr President , the report considers that creating this overly centralised and authoritarian structure called Eurojust will give added value .
Provision is also made for the European judicial network to be maintained , while Eurojust will create its own database , that is , there will be four networks with sensitive personal data for the criminal records , four means of filing information on citizens and anyone who enters the portal of the authoritarian fortress called the European Union .
The people of the European Union must reverse this march and they will .
This is clear from events in my country , where the grass-roots movement and democratic powers in general have rallied and are resolutely opposing the new authoritarian and anti-democratic law on demonstrations which the government is currently trying to push through the Greek parliament .
( EL ) The Nice Treaty , which makes provision for a method to fund European political parties , has not yet been ratified by the Member States and therefore entered into force , and yet the Council and the parliamentary committee responsible have rushed to put a report on the statute and funding of European political parties to the vote in plenary .
Mainly using economic incentives as bait , legislation is being passed on what are , to all intents and purposes , binding rules governing the constitution and modus operandi of European parties .
Will a party such as the Communist Party of Greece , which not only appears but is , in fact , clearly opposed to European integration be approved ?
This is direct interference in the electoral system of each country , because higher electoral quotas are being introduced which , in practice , will exclude the voices opposed to the so-called ' European ideal ' , that is , the imperialist nature of the ÅU.
Woe betide that it should say the opposite !
By setting up European political parties as described above , they are trying to get the people to accept the imperialist integration of the EU as a one-way street , as destiny and as the only course available , to hit out at and - if they can - exclude any dissenting voices from the European Parliament and to distance the workers even more from the centres which take the decisions which directly affect them .
It has not proposed any increase in quotas so as to at least cover existing production , preferring instead to focus on the quality of olive oil , as if the healthiest and most suitable product for consumers ' health has been totally unsuitable in the past .
What makes the Commission 's deliberate undermining and blatant hypocrisy obvious is that it examines the application of measures , such as the subsidy per tree , with total indifference as to the disastrous consequences which this will have on the olive groves themselves , the quality of the product and the employment and income of the producers .
Unfortunately , the Commission is able to cover up its unacceptable action with the collusion of the Greek government
