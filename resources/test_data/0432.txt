The real situation in Chiapas today needs to be analyzed rigorously and sincerely .
The resolution which we wish to adopt today represents a modest contribution to that alliance established for the purpose of sharing problems and solutions together .
Our citizens do not want vague promises about Mexico , they want clarity .
It would be good if the Council , as well as drawing up the code I mentioned , could let us know when it has been completed .
I want to record here the permanent support and solidarity that this assembly has shown in regard to this serious problem .
We share these problems with the Basques and the rest of the Spanish people , and we are sure that this resolution will help us to share the values of our European colleagues , as we share with them the values against which ETA and Herri Batasuma fight , that is respect for life and defence of freedom , which make up the soul of Europe .
But our involvement is not limited to condemning attacks in debates like these , it goes beyond demanding what has been agreed in other full sessions .
The Franquist dictatorship could not silence the voice of our people and the people who try to impose their will by means of violence are not going to succeed either , because in history the people 's will , freedom and democracy always triumph over pistols .
Let us not talk now about those democracies which are just emerging from what was previously an authoritarian regime .
The Article I referred to , which the Commission should never have accepted as discriminatory and clearly prejudicial to Community interests , establishes that joint enterprises are obliged to have a crew who live exclusively in Latvia .
Therefore , Mr President , I think that in future we should not adopt these kinds of clauses and urge the Commission in future not to include them in fishery agreements .
In reforming the Structural Funds we have to look at the specific problems of these regions , what to do to maintain , protect and empower their own surroundings , making use of endogenous development and bearing very much in mind the very fragility of these natural surroundings when they are attacked by the use or misuse of foreign elements which can spoil the land and its natural features .
The Commissioner was discussing the need to keep Community regional policies fairly straightforward but , within this simplicity it would be of more interest to empower these areas as the Commission - I am sure - will try to do in its new proposals .
Nor do we doubt the professional and political competence and honourableness of Mrs Cresson , who until very recently combined her position with an elected mandate .
Well , that is what we must prevent .
That is why , Mr Santer , your statement today about Commissioner de Silguy deciding not to participate in the French regional elections is good news for all of us who want the Commission to be consolidated as the future government of Europe .
History also shows us that of all the ghosts of the past , the most disturbing and horrific is anti-Semitism .
However , there is a double standard here , because whereas being Arab or Muslim implies that you are a dangerous person - an extremist , a fanatic - on the other hand , such people make good beasts of burden for doing those jobs which nobody else wants to do .
Racism and xenophobia are not just the preserve of the ultra-right and the ultra-conservative sectors .
We need to organize campaigns against it .
Toughening up asylum legislation is not the right approach ; in fact , it is the complete opposite .
Showing once more the need for the European Union to help make it possible for spiritual leaders of the various minorities present in Europe to be trained here , as with the Muslims , would go a long way towards creating a climate of better understanding .
As has already been said here , we should congratulate ourselves on the progress represented by the Treaty of Amsterdam in this respect .
In combating racism , it is essential to attend to the question of education , which means making sure that the new generations are well informed about what is happening when we talk about racism and discrimination .
Let us hope that in future debates in this House we will be able to congratulate ourselves on having made significant progress in this area , and that the problem of racism will disappear for ever from our agenda , because of having also disappeared from our society .
First of all , and not just as a ritual , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for having adopted a fairly novel approach to Parliament 's opinion on the report presented to it by the Commission .
Firstly , the slowness of the Member States in first transposing Community law and then applying it correctly ; secondly , the fact that the people of Europe are unaware of this Community law ; and thirdly , the fact that the laws are difficult to understand .
The law is directed at the citizen and it is the citizen who must use it .
Similarly , we must make sure we do away with the futile suffering of animals as a result of acts or negligence on the part of human beings .
That is why my group will be free to vote on the legislative proposal as they see fit , as regards converting the proposal for a recommendation into a proposal for a directive .
This aspect of water , as a basic resource , is becoming more significant as time goes by
