the last vote on acts of God , I voted in favour and not against .
A short while ago , like many other Members , I went to collect the documents from the distribution point and found that they were only available in French , English and German .
I believe that you too , coming from Portugal as you do , will wish to respect the Rules and your own language , and that we should continue the debate only when the documents are available in all the European Union 's languages .
Mr. President , the statement made by the Commission today is indeed very important , it is substantive , it is a step in the right direction , and it provides a structure and framework for the coming years , which is essential if the European Union as such is to know which way it is going .
In that connection , the European Parliament 's position was completely clear .
They participate in the access on partnerships , they take part in all the general debates and in all the decisions , as listeners or observers .
In essence , therefore , countries not in the first stage of negotiations will be taking part as if they were normal participants , other than in the process of those negotiations as such .
In other words , countries which seem to satisfy the prerequisites today may suddenly no longer do so , and others which do not at present may do so later on .
I do not see why we have to punish those countries by imposing , for example , financing conditions for their public debt worse than those applicable to the other countries .
I listened with great interest to what the Commission said , namely that their mandate was to carry out an objective analysis .
I listened with great interest to what Mr Van den Broek and Mr. HÃ¤nsch said , namely that the prospect of accession might be a catalyst for the solution of the problems there , but that must never be regarded as some way of holding the Republic of Cyprus hostage in relation to accession and political developments .
Besides , what with immigrants , the occupying forces and others , the composition of the population is anything but good for the permanent residents of Cyprus .
So far as the economic aspect is concerned , I cannot of course comment in detail .
It simply redefines targets and , of course , does something very good : it does away with automatic transfer of resources , and rightly so , because resources should be transferred according to need and not by some automatic mechanism which often takes no account of reality .
I listened to President Santer telling us that there will be a new IGC at which many issues would be decided and many new positions approved , or some of the current ones would be reviewed .
The political and other developments may be completely different and we may end up with far greater needs .
Mr. President , this debate is worrying me .
Secondly , I am also worried by the fact that just a few weeks after Amsterdam , the Commission and its President have come here to tell us that we must proceed with a new review of the Treaties , in order to solve institutional issues .
Fourthly , I would wish for a more open approach with broader perspectives for Bulgaria and Romania as far as enlargement is concerned .
That is why there is never a mention of resources for unemployment , but on the contrary , there are clear references to restriction , reduction of CAP and Structural Fund expenditure , and again the burden of cost will fall on countries that derived some relief from those provisions .
Furthermore , Mr. President , the Commission is illegitimately introducing certain issues , such as support for Turkey and an assertion and confirmation of the hostage status of Cyprus , by saying that accession will supposedly be achieved by negotiations but will always depend on the will of Denktash , Turkey and the Americans .
Mr. President , a great deal has already been said .
The President of the Commission spoke of a new Marshall Plan .
Besides , Cyprus - and this should be stressed - is the only candidate for accession that satisfies all the requisite economic criteria .
Finally Mr President , so far as the CAP is concerned , I would like to stress that as we all know , for a very long time efforts have been made to annihilate the agricultural economy of the South .
Unfortunately , there is another Turkish invasion .
But for Ankara , as its President declared a few days ago in Brussels , there is no war , there is no nation of 14 to 15 million without rudimentary human rights , without the possibility of being educated and communicating in its own language .
The political solution to the Kurdish problem and respect for human rights are conditions laid down most clearly for any kind of cooperation between Turkey and the European Union .
He expressed himself far more clearly to them than to us here , in Parliament .
It is a substantive issue , and I think that ought to be understood by the political leadership in Turkey .
We need a new start with Turkey , and let us adopt that as a working hypothesis and accept it .
Turkey is a part of European history .
I think we should regard that as a very important factor in the development of the situation in Albania .
That is what the European Union should be looking at , and not supporting military rule in Albania .
If some people have been disappointed , I am sorry .
