President , I speak for the European People 's Party and European Democrats .
I would like , in introducing our group 's position on this , to welcome the work done by Mrs Haug and by our own rapporteur , Mr Ferber , to thank the Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , and also the Council President , Mrs Parly , for their significant assistance in achieving a budget on 23 November which , as the presidency has rightly pointed out , was a landmark in the way in which Parliament , the Council and the Commission have been able to help decide collectively a budget for the European Union .
We have a budget which is under 1.06 % , we have a budget , Mr Colom , which is within the financial perspective .
I suspect that , to put it simply , flexibility is for small amounts and revision is for large amounts , but we will see in the next few years how that will go .
But I would like to thank both the Commission and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for their remarks about the joint declaration which we have put together , because that is also a first indication of how we are going to monitor improvements and performance in the running of the programmes , particularly in category 4 .
Turning to that for a moment , we have a lot of work in front of us and we await with interest the report by Mrs Schreyer , preferably before 30 June , so that we can use its contents for shaping up the 2002 budget .
But in thinking about the question of the backlog on commitments and how we limit the duration of new commitments - obviously this comes into the domain of the financial regulation which we will have to negotiate .
We believe it is absolutely fundamental that this progress report should be seen to restore the confidence of our citizens in the way in which the European Union institutions operate .
A word on the reserve , Madam President-in-Office of the Council .
You said , if I understood you correctly , that we should not be using the reserve because it was against the rules to do this .
We use the reserve , particularly on first reading , to draw attention to particular points of weakness in the way in which policies are operating .
The information policy in the institutions at the moment is a scandal and therefore , rather than putting money on the line for information policy when we know it is not being used effectively , we are going to be keeping much of that money in reserve waiting for the Commission to come up with the right proposals .
Of course , the solution would be to allow us , as a joint budgetary authority , to lift funds being spent during the year and that may be an invention which we can insert into the revision of the financial regulation .
Lastly , I would say , looking to the future , that Nice has shown us that there is perhaps a feeling that we are shifting a little bit towards intergovernmentalism , with the Council deciding on the numbers of our Parliament without our being consulted beforehand .
Our confidence as one of three institutions , will only be maintained - and therefore the institutional agreement and the financial perspective maintained - if we manage to create mutual confidence and if we are consulted at every stage on our fundamental interests .
I congratulate my colleague Mary Honeyball on her first report for the European Parliament .
Summer time should be a matter for the Member States but it is right that the EU should harmonise the start and end dates .
I welcome the agreement to continue to begin summer time on the last Sunday in March and to end it on the last Sunday in October .
Given the planning needs of certain sectors such as transport , communications , tourism and computer and other technology I welcome the proposal to make these arrangements permanent subject to a Commission review every five years .
.
I welcome this report by my colleague Carmen Cerdiera .
The report aims to ensure that all victims of crime in any EU Member State should receive the same minimum treatment .
Appropriate measures should be taken to provide crime victims with the following rights : to provide and receive information ; communications facilities ; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid ; a suitable level of protection and privacy ; the possibility to seek compensation under criminal procedure and to dispute settlement through mediation .
The victim must be treated as a person in a particular situation of disorientation and distress - factors that are likely to be all the more acute if the crime happens to the victim in a Member State other than his/her own .
.
Although we support the content of the report and are very sympathetic to victims of crime throughout Europe , I , as a British Conservative , have reservations regarding certain aspects of the report .
I believe we have adequate protection for such victims under Article 6 of the Council of Europe 's Convention on Human Rights , and this report is yet another example of unnecessary proposed European interference into an area which is already covered by agreements between Member States , as well as 25 other non-EU members of the Council of Europe .
The British Conservative Party does not support EU prescriptive measures to harmonise criminal law in the EU which must remain the competence of the Member State .
Madam President , I wholeheartedly support this report on better protection for victims of crime which demonstrates yet again in the EU 's commitment to combating crime and protecting our citizens .
