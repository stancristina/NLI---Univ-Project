I do not wish to trawl through the figures recording the consequences of the hurricane again .
The resolution explains in great detail that all this is possible provided that two conditions are upheld and satisfied .
In other words , Mr President , Members of the Commission and the Council , I feel that it is time for the European Union to stop just declaring its solidarity and secure genuine , substantial fairness .
I used the word 'problem ' intentionally , for the very reason that the absence of an adequate immigration policy has meant that our citizens often perceive all forms of immigration as a problem , a burden and even a hazard , instead of as a social and economic resource and a source of cultural enrichment .
I hope that the next four years will be better and more fruitful for all of us .
I would be willing to help and even accommodate asylum seekers . "
In my opinion , the forecast , as it was established at the end of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament , is precise and essentially correct .
Consequently , public expenditure will also be reduced .
It was only after the intervention of the Polish authorities , who , moreover , recognised the validity of the document - and this bodes well for enlargement - that I was allowed to continue my journey .
The future of the development of Europe and the validity and sustainability of the institutions of the Union is at stake , with the now sure and fast-approaching prospect of enlargement to include a further 12 countries , and our relations with the citizens and their approval and support are also at risk .
We await the responses with confidence .
The warning signs are starting to become apparent in the paralysis which has affected us in recent months .
The first is total observance of the acquis communautaire ; the second is the abolition of the right of veto for every Member State ; the third is full respect of the roles of Parliament , the Commission and the Court of Justice in the decision-making procedures with regard to the initial introduction and implementation of closer cooperation .
I voted for the motion and the result is successful , but I would like to know how much longer we will have to wait before Parliament votes for interest and compensation to be paid in cases where governments delay pension payments ?
More duty .
A large group of young Italians with Lega Nord flags are calling out insults to the effect that the Italian flag should be burnt and shouting " Down with the Italians ! " .
Forgive me Mr President , but I feel that these matters must be dealt with while the time is ripe , for otherwise , if we do not speak out , these demonstrations will end up being perceived as the norm .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has examined the Commission ' s 10th annual report on the Structural Funds regarding the implementation of operations during 1998 .
Furthermore , we have noted that the results of the interim evaluations are frequently not comparable or quantifiable because unsuitable and inadequate indicators have been employed , which is why it is absolutely necessary for us to have objective criteria and more suitable assessment methods for assessing the results of the programmes .
I , myself , have tabled a technical amendment , the third amendment , which corrects a transcription error likely to cause confusion and make paragraph 28 inconsistent with the rest of the report .
Suffice it to say that there was a considerable delay in the use of many of the appropriations , although improvement was apparent at the end of the programming period , obtained purely by mathematical calculation through transferring Objective 2 appropriations to Objective 1 .
Having said this , I think it is time for the European Parliament and also the Commission and the Council to engage in a debate - and I know that the president of our delegation does not entirely share this point of view - on the future status of Kosovo , the future status of Bosnia , and therefore also , directly , that of Serbia .
This is the result of a policy which we , the radicals , definitely did not want , but which the international community wanted , and to which we can no longer turn a blind eye .
And those who have remained are regularly attacked and , in many cases , killed .
In the interests of the protection of human rights , we must not violate international regulations and we must start by observing the Geneva Convention .
At this point , let us mention fundamental freedoms : for these freedoms to be established the embargo policy must be abolished .
Mr President , I would just like to say that , in my opinion , amendments should be accepted or rejected on the basis of their content and not on the basis of who has put their name to them .
Why launch a discussion ?
So , in fact , we are currently trying to solve a problem largely created by the Treaty of Amsterdam itself and , what is more , we are going to solve it to our disadvantage as it is clear that asylum standards cannot be harmonised from the bottom up - for who would dare ? - but rather towards the top with all the in-draughts normally caused by this type of policy .
Furthermore , I consider that it would be appropriate for the Commission to apply this decision retroactively and share the burden borne by those who accepted Kosovar refugees between the Member States of the European Union
