.
I know that I am not abiding by the agenda , because this is a sitting for discussing problems and I am not doing that .
Mr President , I am also one of those who have an enormously positive view of the building .
There have been times - such as this week ' s part-session , which has coincided with the fair - when there has been considerable disruption as far as access to the Parliament is concerned .
In agricultural production , quantity has taken precedence over quality and this has caused the balance to be upset .
We talk of animal welfare , but this welfare must begin with food .
Secondly , we must fight fraud relentlessly , and to this end it is necessary that some sectors , which have paid an unfair price for this dioxin crisis , are compensated by means of market measures .
Mr President , our position has been very well explained by Mr Wurtz and Mr Sylla .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Members , firstly , for their analysis of the problem and , secondly , for their generally positive reaction to the proposal which is being examined here today .
Balance of payments aid is aimed at boosting a country ' s reserves in such a way that it can confront its external payments problems , which always have a compensation : it is always either the provision of services or the supply of goods which is being paid for .
Therefore , whether or not there is an agreement with the International Monetary Fund , there will be support for FYROM , although it must clearly be conditional upon the application of the necessary reform programme so that these funds will be put to specific effective use .
In these two respects , we are in absolute agreement .
However , we do not believe that this point should be included in the text of the decision .
We are not here to discuss whether or not we should support the basic needs of the population .
With regard to Amendment No 3 , however , I would like to make an additional point .
In Amendment No 6 , the Commission is asked to inform Parliament before carrying out the second payment of balance of payment appropriations .
The resolution you propose involves a revision of the Financial Perspective .
The difficulty is which solution to adopt .
Furthermore , to an extent , both Mr Langen and Mr Robles Piquer have demonstrated that this is not an ideological issue , that we must not mix up questions of liberalism or non-liberalism with what must be our ultimate common objective , which is to promote the use of renewable energy in Europe .
Please allow me , having congratulated Mr Langen on his magnificent work , to also express my gratitude to all the other speakers during the debate .
Amendment No 4 is acceptable in principle , although the Commission considers that it does not so much constitute a third objective of the programme but rather an expansion of the first objective .
But alternatively , during our future discussions , we could talk about this issue so that we can specify who and what we are referring to , which would be the most appropriate way , from our point of view , to deal with the concern that this amendment clearly raises .
I would like to express my thanks once again and say that I hope that the final revision will contain the definitive formula and therefore provide an impetus for the ALTENER programme , which will clearly promote the use of renewable energy in Europe .
As for Amendments Nos . 12 and 13 , which replace Amendments Nos . 11 and 5 , which the Honourable Members have referred to , and which refer to the involvement of Committees , I would like to say that they are acceptable in principle but require another more appropriate wording .
Honourable Members , the SAVE programme is intended to provide a framework of action in the field of energy efficiency .
When we compare data on energy efficiency we find differences of 1:5 and 1:6 in relation to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
There have certainly been some complex issues , some of which , like the issue of port and sherry , continue to raise difficulties which we hope will be resolved in the coming days .
It would have been unforgivable if , when South Africa has dismantled that odious regime , when the South Africans have made history and shown an example by bringing about an admirable reconciliation , successfully overcoming the always difficult transition from a civil war and a dictatorship , the transition from having the profile of a freedom movement to the establishment of a pluralist , democratic and constitutional State , it would have been scandalous if , when the South Africans have not betrayed our trust in their conduct , we Europeans were not able to rise to the occasion and were to betray the trust which South Africa has put in us .
Mr Andersson ' s question seems very interesting to me , and having been a professional sportsman for the last 20 years , drug taking in sport is an issue which interests me and worries me very much .
But I would like to ask you one thing .
Will you take account of the information supplied by the Agriculture Department which I have mentioned ?
Then they talked of an organised system for the payment of subsidies , but the family relatives of the senior members of the Agriculture Department who received subsidies already cultivated flax before those people took their senior posts , before Mrs de Palacio became Minister for Agriculture and even before Mrs de Palacio knew them .
