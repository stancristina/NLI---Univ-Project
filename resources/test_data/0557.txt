in fact .
There is even talk of a big bang of ten countries acceding simultaneously .
They are designed to instil fear and are based on worst-case scenarios : as if it has not been clear for a very long time that the cost of this whole enlargement process would be covered by the EU budget .
And everyone knows how important agendas are for the outcome of consultations .
Are there any more topics for the Convention ?
I should like to raise the same issue without , however , repeating what has already been said on the matter .
European citizens would not understand if the European Union did not work as fast as possible to adopt the measures in question .
We are doing everything we can to ensure that this instrument is adopted in December so that we can meet the objectives of Tampere .
Eurojust should bring real added value compared with the existing instruments .
( NL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in line with your wishes , Eurojust ' s areas of competence have been set up in such a way as to afford Eurojust the scope needed to deal with borderline cases and new forms of crime .
Despite this , a few important questions remain unanswered , although they are limited in number .
( NL ) The framework decision on this arrest warrant is technically a very complex instrument , because it deals with important issues within criminal law procedure , but also with issues which , for example , pertain to the description of people which facilitates the tracing of them .
( FR ) These offences are those covered by the Treaty on European Union , the Tampere conclusions , the Annex to the Europol Convention and the four offences proposed by the Commission , which are sabotage , arson , crimes against humanity according to the statute of the International Criminal Court , hijacking of aircraft and hijacking of ships .
In the event of the wanted person consenting to their surrender , a period of ten days is stipulated .
As I have said before , there are still difficulties , but we are hopeful that they can be resolved before next week .
They are making steady progress and that is borne out by the outcome of the meetings of 16 November .
Finally , the preamble will exclude from the framework decision ' s scope , the activities of the armed forces in a period of armed conflict when they are performing their official duties , as governed by international law .
However , the debates on this issue have not yet been completed .
The proposed general scope is no longer related to combating terrorism .
The Members of the European Free Alliance will approve the measures to combat terrorism .
The guarantees we want to give are contained in the EP amendments which will hopefully be adopted and which we really consider to be minimum requirements .
Mr President , my group would naturally like to help in the rapid creation of common security rules for civil aviation .
The third point is that the Commission , in tandem with the ECAC and the ICAO , must determine whether airports in third countries , in other words , airports outside the scope of the Regulation , meet essential security conditions , for any loopholes in the new system will surface particularly at those airports .
I should first of all like to turn my attention to the BÃ¶sch report .
Thirdly , there is legal uncertainty among the Christian community in Upper Egypt : it is exposed to downright religious persecution by Muslim extremists .
Indeed , this Agency has had very positive feedback right from the outset .
Why is it so important to grant aid in Macedonia so quickly now and to do this , therefore , via the Agency ?
If the situation changes for the worse in Macedonia , then I fear that that will rub off in the Balkans as a whole .
I would urge the Commission to clarify its strategy in the Balkans soon , and also to specify the role which the Agency has to play and the role which other sections of the Commission will need to play in future .
That was certainly necessary , but I still find something lacking .
And if human embryos are used for research and are destroyed in the process , that is precisely what is happening .
Should we not develop and use them ?
We have conferred with parliamentary colleagues at home and abroad , from both Member States and candidate countries .
I reject the production of embryos solely for research .
It is definitely not a question we should treat lightly .
One extreme position is the desire to ban all scientific research and imprison researchers , the other is the wish to allow every commercial use , such as those , for example , being developed by the American company Advanced Cell Technology , and hence making possible , at the individual level , everything that wealthy people can and are prepared to pay for .
Citizens are quite capable of taking their own decisions honourably and conscientiously .
The bio-patent directive regulates that power .
Gene therapy is so costly for the time being and that may threaten accessibility .
The view that therapeutic cloning automatically leads to reproductive cloning is untenable .
The suggestion that therapeutic cloning is indispensable for the preservation of human health is misleading : there are alternative research methods that are also promising .
I should therefore like on behalf of my group to plead for referral , to allow us to reconsider the whole matter thoroughly
