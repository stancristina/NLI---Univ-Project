Council of Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Presidency of the Council , I have the honour to present to you the draft general budget of the European Communities for the financial year 2007 , which the Council adopted on 17 July 2006 .
This is the first budgetary procedure under the new financial framework .
In this respect I believe that cooperation between both arms of the budgetary authorities , the European Parliament and the Council , will continue .
Firstly , I would stress that the Council complied with the new interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 in all respects .
In dealing with the budget , the main principle we employed was close assessment of specified and real expenditure needs .
Having taken stock of previous budgets , and having thoroughly examined selected activity-related reports , absorption capacity and the real requirements for 2007 , the Council finally decided on a controlled increase in payment appropriations in the draft budget .
It is the Council’s opinion that this level of payment appropriations is adequate and not too low .
Thus , the final figures in our draft budget are the result of targeted action based on objective factors .
Secondly , we adopted a comprehensive approach .
That would be best accomplished by equal and proactive scrutiny on the part of the budgetary authorities .
This is 3.7 % up on the budget for 2006 .
Payment appropriations total EUR 114.6 billion , which is 2.3 % more than in the 2006 budget .
The Council also proposed two new pilot projects under this subheading , one of which concerns the learning triangle , and the other of which concerns the reliability of the supply of energy to the Union .
The Council’s draft states that there are four special areas for priority action in the European Union in which the Council believes pilot projects or preparatory action should be implemented .
The Council cut payment appropriations by EUR 425 million in those budget lines that relate to the completion of the programmes that were begun prior to the year 2000 and the programmes for the period 2000–2006 , taking account of the current rate of implementation for them .
There was a general principle obtaining here , which took account of former implementation rates and estimates of real needs .
The Council , however , stated that agricultural expenditure and expenditure relating to international fishing agreements should be re-examined in the autumn on the basis of the Commission ’s revised communication .
The Council nevertheless increased appropriations in the External Borders Fund , because it regards this as a major political priority .
It approved the amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , which also meets the stipulations in the interinstitutional agreement .
Administrative expenditure is nevertheless 3.4 % up on the figure in the 2006 budget .
For that reason it has approved all the newly requested measures for enlargement for the year 2007 .
One of the Council’s main aims has been to ensure that there is a genuine increase in productivity in the administration of the EU during the period covered by the new financial framework .
You are very well aware of the different components of the administration package .
The Council is especially concerned about the way recruitment has slowed down this year .
My assumption is that these latest demands made in respect of administration must also be capable of being applied to the Union’s institutions .
In this way we can show the public that we produce a real return for their money : value added .
This requires an ability on the part of the budgetary authorities to prioritise resources .
In the months to come , we will have to deal comprehensively with the crisis in the Middle East and the necessary EU action .
We know that this is only the first phase of the budgetary procedure , and that there is still a long way to go before the 2007 budget is finally adopted .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I wish to say that I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss Europe’s social future with you .
The European social model , which is capable of combining economic growth , low levels of unemployment and social cohesion , provides a solid base on which to look for answers to the challenges of globalisation and an ageing population .
The European social model also needs to be reviewed constantly .
We have to show our support for European competitiveness and higher levels of employment and , furthermore , combat poverty and exclusion .
It is vital to the future of a social Europe that the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment is assiduously put into effect .
Over the coming weeks we are expecting the Commission to present a communication on demographic change in Europe .
Large sections of the population have the chance of a longer , healthier life .
Although the conclusions relating to the potential for economic growth and the sustainability of public finances may well be less positive , a long-term , proactive policy of reform is essential .
The Finnish Prime Minister , Matti Vanhanen , and the Commission President , Mr Barroso , will host an extraordinary tripartite Social Summit in Lahti on 20 October .
By making it easier for men and women to harmonise work with family life we will be creating at the same time a more effective response for Europe to the challenges of globalisation and an ageing population .
The Union is a key global player whose aim is the promotion of democracy , human rights and sustainable development .
The worldwide promotion of decent work will also boost productivity in the less developed countries .
During its Presidency , Finland wants to strengthen the European Union’s ability to adapt to the pressures of global competition
