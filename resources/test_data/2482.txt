Consequently , the code on state aid must be brought into line with the general system of the industry 's competitors .
We cannot have any transitional presidencies .
In terms of regional policy and , more particularly , in terms of the structural funds , we reject any linking of the structural policies with the accomplishment of the indices of convergence through conditionality clauses .
Will pressure be put on Turkey to free Leila Zana ?
The threat is still there .
No nation has the right to prevent the rest of the world trading with whoever it wishes .
Whether we like it or not it is the Cuban president who has won this battle , even though his political health is far from excellent .
On behalf of my group , I should like to take note of the important declaration made by Mr Fernández Albor at the end of his speech , about his position on the subject of deterrents - something he is right has never been dealt with and I think that we ought to deal with it separately in due time ; as far what was said by the Council , I should like to thank , although the President-in-Office of the Council is not here , but he was here this morning , Mr Spring , who read out to us a very complete report of everything that the Union did in 1995 and so far in 1996 .
Mr President , the excellent report presented by Mr Fernández Albor on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs might give rise to some specific comments and a few examples .
In the first case this was a sign of the success of diplomacy based on economic reasons , the defence of legitimate interests , without any doubt , but perhaps slightly forgetting the dramatic situation which the Cuban people are experiencing .
Mr President , may I first of all welcome Mr President-in-Office of the Council and wish him good luck for the next six months .
This also calls for policies directed at reducing public deficits .
From this point of view , the Council declaration calling upon the Member States to reduce their public deficits is necessary if we are to attain these objectives .
Mr Quinn also spoke about wage restraint policies .
Madam President , given the importance of this subject I should like to make a few specifications about the Spanish version .
In a climate as negative as the present one , we must shed a ray of hope for mankind .
Our message of solidarity from the European Parliament , firmly in favour of press freedom and calling for this journalist 's release , must not in any way be seen as alien but as a point of departure for an attitude of dialogue and joint action as Euro-Mediterranean partners , since we share the same aims of peace and democracy .
It seems to us that , once and for all - and not only in the case of Chechnya but also Turkey and many other countries - the European Union must use the means of pressure at its disposal in its agreements , thanks to the democratic and human rights protection clauses , to avoid such massacres .
As a consequence the system will be more transparent .
Community preference is being deteriorated and I should like to recall that this is a basic principle of the CAP.
Mr President , we should now be trying to defend Community preference or prevent the disappearance of the CAP.
This is an activity also being carried out by other operators in the economic and social fields such as , for example , the Banca Andorrana , which now has a code of conduct similar if not practically identical to that governing the Association of Banks of the European Union .
If this does not happen , if there is no vigorous response from the European Union , the United States will believe that in future it can take whatever decision it likes as regards other countries .
For it is not only acts of direct abuse of children which have been revealed , but toleration of and participation in them by bodies financed by the public to watch over the safety and wellbeing of all .
Mr President , our Group feels , as Mr Teverson has said in his magnificent report , that the structural funds are the main instrument for reducing inequalities between the various countries of the European Union and strengthening economic and social cohesion .
I also believe that it is most important to bear in mind the general approach of all our interventions .
I do not believe that this Parliament can work with this kind of report .
I sincerely believe that they are unsatisfactory both to the Commission and to this Parliament .
It is true that there are still great regional disparities in Spain , but it is also true that our GDP is moving ever closer to the Community average .
Mrs Sierra 's report shows that , whilst the Funds have contributed to Spain 's convergence with the other Member States , the process has been slow and uneven : slow overall and uneven as regards the regions , to the point of increasing regional inequalities and differences .
It must reach - and really reach - local bodies and the actual potential beneficiaries .
I should like to congratulate Mrs Sierra González for her magnificent work on the effect of the structural funds in Spain , and their influence on regional development throughout these years .
We must try to draw some conclusions in addition to those pointed out by other colleagues .
On more than one occasion I have recalled the case of ' Motorway 92 ' in Andalusia , which was completed in 1992 and is currently unusable
