importation of vermin and pests .
In Holland and other countries the original nature of national identity is being stripped away in the name of chicken and pig feed .
The same goes for irradiated food .
We must dare to face up to the reality of the matter .
It will certainly be a noteworthy occasion , as we will soon be going over Mrs Randzio-Plath 's report , which the Green Group in the European Parliament fervently supports .
He says that given the unfortunate absence of any common economic policy in the Union , the role of the central bank is a vital one as , in a way , it will have to use a certain kind of economic wisdom when taking decisions on funding .
We believe it is essential that individual country 's parliaments and governments alike maintain links with a system which aims to create a stable currency and stable prices for Europe .
In this respect , the EMI should certainly not go it alone in debating this matter .
It is neither sensible nor proper that the European Monetary Institute should condemn certain national laws as incompatible with a central bank system .
The EMI is judgemental about Finland 's central bank law which states that the President of the country can fire the managing director or any other member of the management if these prove to be unsuitable .
In a way , traffic safety is comparable to the protection of the environment .
One certain factor in this is car and motorcycle advertising that focuses on high speeds and other features which are just not viable for the normal motorist .
The success of a given make of car in competitions , rallies or circuit racing , is very often used to advertise a vehicle intended for everyday use .
In this way , people are lured into a driving culture that only befits the race track , and not always that either .
Even today there is still opposition to speed limits , in the name of civil liberties .
On the same principle , we should have common European legislation to enforce the use of driving lights even during daylight hours .
Mr President , it is at this point that I should congratulate the rapporteur , but I shall put off doing so for lack of time .
The rapporteur , however , considers it a good thing that it was the European Commission that negotiated the MAI treaty and not the Member States .
It gives the Commission power over my country 's social security system , environment , labour laws , health policy and psychology , which , according to this report , we should not be prepared to yield up to a supranational entity .
The MAI imposes global standards on state activity , but not on that of individual companies .
The EU is capitalism 's answer to Europe .
Mr President , I must point out to my colleague , Mr Seppänen , that my government and his were independent negotiators in the treaty .
But let us press on .
The Commission has negotiated a treaty that truly frustrates the cohesive strengths and ideas of a very large part of the EU.
That is a temporary solution at best .
The Amsterdam Treaty , as has been said here , will give more weight to questions of public health than at present .
This aspect of that Treaty should be exploited , so that it will have a genuine influence on promoting health in the Member States in a broader sense .
The health question should permeate all Community policy .
This is obviously also a question of education , one that is linked to diet and living habits , but still more a question of economics .
The EU should be able to prioritize those factors that are essentially European .
So although I understand how important the programmes concerned with specific diseases are , I would like to stress how vital it also is for the Commission in the future , in the formulation of its public health programme , to promote health at national level by means of a structured health policy ; in other words , by addressing questions of social policy , such as how efficient agriculture is , how different pesticides are used , which is to say , should more ecological prudence be applied ?
And how are traffic policy , employment , social exclusion and the rest dealt with ?
Secondly , security and peace in Europe , which is our main task , depends on finding a fruitful modus vivendi with Russia .
Lastly , I hope that all three Baltic countries will be able to join the Union at the same time .
Mr Cabezón Alonso quite rightly draws attention in his splendid report to the fact that an ageing European population requires a change in the way the labour market operates , to meet the needs of older people more adequately .
In the coming years employers will have to radically alter their attitude towards the elderly and the ageing .
It is especially important to try to maintain levels of fitness for work in a preventive way , and not wait until illness or injury has occurred .
In Finland we have developed the notion of "age management ' , which means taking age differences in the staff into account when managing work .
It is vital that they are kept up to date with changes in their role , and that their opinion is heard .
They will learn to use the new technology too as long as hands-on training is provided for them .
Whereas computers are something every young person is familiar with from childhood , older people often have prejudices about them and underrate their ability to use them
