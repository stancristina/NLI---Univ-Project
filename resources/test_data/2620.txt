two-stage information strategy , where peer groups keep each other ' s members informed , has turned out to be the best of all options , and this should be put to good use too in dealing with this information issue .
The fact that this information campaign is being made with the support of NGOs and via them will hopefully prevent a repeat of that .
In this the consumer organisations have a very big and important job , and women ' s organisations must also be taken into account , as women need information on this .
I genuinely hope that these practical matters , which are a thorny subject for consumers , are attended to before the euro comes into proper circulation .
However , we cannot accept the way in which the Council has interfered in relations between the Commission and Parliament now that the talks are over .
Madam President , I have reason to suspect that this is the direct consequence of the Feira summit .
In addition , Madam President , we have to improve the rights of rapporteurs to acquire confidential information , and perhaps a deferment would also provide the opportunity to establish this aspect of the matter .
Madam President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , and Commission Vice-President Loyola de Palacio , for having genuinely embarked on closer cooperation with Parliament in many respects .
This spirit of co-operation is depicted very well in the agreement in those points which concern , for example , the right of Parliament to be involved when international agreements are being discussed , not only with regard to the end result , but at every stage of such talks .
This symbolises the new spirit we are now creating with the Commission , and it is very important that the Commission and Parliament have mutual agreement .
We hope and demand that the Council gives a public and open explanation about whether in future it intends to respect relations between Parliament and the Commission , or whether it intends to interfere in them in the future .
However , I would particularly like to explain why I supported the proposals for amendments tabled by Mr Virrankoski and Mr Mulder .
I base my opinion in the notion that strict budgetary discipline should be continued and that the prevailing financial frameworks should be respected .
For this reason , I do not support an amendment to the financial perspectives in the area of appropriations under External Action .
First of all , I wanted to vote against Amendment No 11 .
We had a very good compromise but now the work here in the European Parliament means that European consumers and citizens have to wait until the new compromise proposal is made .
I voted against the committee proposal along with other members of my Group .
We are all very sorry that we have to wait for this agreement to come into force .
Mr President , the matter under discussion concerns children , and is therefore highly emotive .
The person making the decision should look at the issue calmly .
In addition , a warning was called for on products designed for 3 - 6 year olds , although the risk is likely to be associated with very small children , who like to put things in their mouths , in their discovery of the world .
What is even better is that the issue is being dealt with in a consistent way .
In my opinion , Mr Arvidsson has made a rational and responsible contribution to the issue , and is applying the EU precautionary principle to this problem of toxicity properly .
It should only be used , however , when there is scientific reason to suppose there is a real risk .
Neither is it sufficiently justifiable to resort to the precautionary principle if , for example , some Member States have introduced national legislation in this area .
That is what we are in danger of doing in the case of phthalates .
Finally , I would like to say that not one lobbyist from the chemical industry has come up to me .
My concern relates solely to the vague application of the precautionary principle .
The category of animal - heifer , cow , bull , bullock , young bull , calf - will not provide the consumer with any extra information , as the differences within categories might be greater than those between them .
And now the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has arrived at the same conclusion .
That is not the case in my country .
Another thorny problem relating to the proposal is labelling showing the origin of the meat .
In the first stage there would just be slaughter information .
It is therefore to be hoped that , on the basis of the current defining implementation regulation , the beef sector could be flexible enough to come round to establishing the two-stage labelling system .
I warmly welcome the proposal and hope that the IGC is ready to make the necessary changes to the Treaties .
But I would like to ask a specific question concerning the process in EPO .
Why is it that at the moment the EPO uses the system of many experts instead of the system of one expert , which is in use in Japan and the United States ?
The Commission may have information on the extent of the problem in the Member States .
Does the Commission think it possible that some kind of strategy could be found regarding these built-up areas ?
Mr President , the content of the regulation being discussed here is based on the situation that existed at the end of the 1980s , but since then things have changed greatly .
