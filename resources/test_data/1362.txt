Less than three weeks have passed since we adopted a resolution here in Strasbourg demanding access to a whole series of reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office ( OLAF ) .
I can understand that .
I am gratified to hear it .
And my last point : This House has called on the Commission repeatedly and with a broad majority to put forward proposals on the immediate introduction of a European Public Prosecutor 's office .
The reports by Ms van der Laan and Mr Seppänen were approved and adopted by the Committee .
If there are any error rates , we expect a clear statement from the Court of Auditors .
As a result of this dispute , the implementation of the SYNERGY Programme has now been blocked for a year and a half .
Various procedures are applied which vary in their speed and thoroughness .
Here , too , I am not aware of any Member State which furnishes its Parliament with such up-to-date information as is the case here .
Let me make it clear to the House that it is not a matter of resuming a regular programme of preventive vaccinations .
Mr President , the foot-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain and its spread to mainland Europe clearly demonstrate that the disease apparently cannot be halted with the current strategy .
There is no longer any rural tourism , even in areas which are free of FMD.
This automatically raises a further question : what has the Commission done to implement the report by the Scientific Committee in March 1999 as regards the regionalisation negotiations at international level , the validation of testing , and the evaluation of the criteria determining when emergency vaccinations are necessary in "at risk " regions too ?
And finally : tell us , what have you got against giraffes ?
It is not only the farmers who are affected ; it has an impact on everyone in these rural areas , including tourism and thousands of jobs .
What does Europe gain , in financial terms , from these exports , and what is the epidemic costing Europe ?
After all , it was scheduled for 6 p.m.
So my question is : How do you intend to provide information in these countries ?
So here too , best practice is imperative .
Firstly , the problem of Community legislation .
When you choose such ambitious words , then you must expect to be judged by your actions .
That is totally unacceptable as far as we are concerned .
We agree when America demands burden sharing in security and defence policy and for Europe to do more .
And a further change of tack from a passive to an active employment policy , over and above the previous objectives of the European employment strategy , is still on the agenda .
Now there are sometimes 30 , 40 or 50 items on the agenda .
What the previous government unfortunately failed to take into account was the question of higher education for these people and the need to resolve the problem of Tetovo University .
We discussed this quite clearly during the vote in committee .
Of course , we do spend it wisely , but what on ?
Nor has there been any significant change in the Commission ' s inadequate information policy vis-à-vis Parliament compared with the 1998 discharge .
Well , I had a day-dream - as opposed to a real dream - on precisely the Rühle report , which gives me the opportunity to explain why I voted for the motion .
As for the liberalisation of air space , we are still wrangling over how to deal with Gibraltar airport , meaning that umpteen thousand tourists will again be left sitting in airports this summer due to delayed flights .
So what exactly is the problem ?
We must do the job properly now !
We do not want a law of the strongest , we want a law of the weakest , which is why we need a security policy based on justice .
We call on the Council to make good these deficits .
Where there is no bearing on reality , as in the case of family reunion ...
That refugees are putting their lives at even greater risk is the consequence of the EU 's segregation policy .
The African country richest in raw materials was once the biggest coffee exporter in the world with enough money to feed its 12 million people easily .
This poses a problem , because it is not clear exactly what external costs are .
This is the only way of optimising the overall European transport system in the long term , especially in the freight sector .
On balance , the regulation will help to bring about a clearer structure for the granting of aid for the coordination of inland transport and to dismantle distortions of competition - including between Member States .
Secondly , we also assume that distortions of competition will be avoided by treating carriers identically .
We said both in Committee and in Parliament : let us set our sights a little lower !
I think that the classification which we have found together with the Council is a very good one .
It has taken several readings and a conciliation procedure , but all ' s well that ends well .
It is about fighting money laundering and there is a close connection between money laundering and international crime .
It is the reporting obligations which are at issue here .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we know from estimates by Europol that approximately 30 % of all crime can already be attributed to organised crime .
Mr President , money laundering means concealing the origin of the proceeds of crime so that they can be presented as the income of a legitimate company .
We have no intention of allowing an excellent
