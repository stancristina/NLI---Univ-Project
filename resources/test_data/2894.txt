Of course , you will always find French leaders who , to advance their careers or out of vanity , will try to engage France and its industries on a route which , deep down , they know is contrary to the long term interests of the French nation , but the French people are not fools and they feel threatened by this federal Europe , which some want to establish come what may .
As my French grandmother , who was also Dutch-speaking , used to say , ' Wie geen put graaft oor een ander valt er zelf in' - which translates as 'if you do not dig a hole for the other fellow , you are liable to fall into one yourself ' .
Every day , Mr Tindemans , police stations are set on fire , fire engines are attacked , there is extortion in the schools and knife attacks - which ought to cause as much outrage as the one by an immigrant against a Minister of Culture .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission 's 1996 communication ignores the close link between defence/weapons and national sovereignty and seeks to apply the principle of free competition to weapons for the sake of competitiveness .
The Titley report contains positive elements , but unfortunately it will not be possible to vote for it , because there are gaps in it , and because of its systematic approach and the federalist philosophy which underlies it .
The first is market place trivialization which would eliminate the political dimension of the business and would subordinate us to our great ally , the United States .
Trying to force beekeepers to stop their bees gathering pollen from crops in flower which have been subjected to chemical treatment suggests the impossible , and no-one can be bound by it .
The principal concern of agriculture as a whole today must be not the quantity but the quality of its products .
They respond to a demand from consumers , and especially tourists , who are hostile to genetically modified organisms , eager for healthy , diversified , quality food products , and concerned about respect for the environment .
This represents an almost colonial attitude which places the Union 's values above those of others and means that other countries are at risk of pressure from the Union if they hold different values .
Independence needs to be achieved at different levels .
The reason we have not voted for the Tindemans report is because it pretends the problems lie somewhere else instead of dealing frankly with the heart of the matter .
But reassuring words are not enough ; there must be practical consequences , with membership of the Union subject to clear demands and penalty clauses suspending our commitments .
This does not seem acceptable to me .
On the contrary , we should cry shame on Laurent-Désiré Kabila , because alongside the 'liberation of the Zairean people ' he organized genocide against completely innocent women and children .
But we cannot let this disgust remove our sense of responsibility .
Under the current decision-making procedure on fisheries within the European Union , authorizing powers to be conferred on the Commission to incorporate binding legal acts adopted by international organizations to which the Community belongs , as proposed here , means Parliament , and moreover the Council , would be cut off from the decision-making process in respect of acts relating to a significant part of the common fisheries policy .
The question of the European Union 's energy independence has become a crucial one .
I should like to mention the following points .
We cannot leave nuclear power stations as they are , but we must also trust technical procedures which are currently available to us and which probably will continue making progress to eliminate waste .
It shows that nuclear energy , which on average supplies 35 % of electricity supplies in Europe and up to 75 % in France , makes a very large contribution to reducing this dependence .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am astonished by the counter-truths and gratuitous remarks contained in the report drafted by the Committee on Energy .
Of course , when debating a report like this , no-one can expect a quiet debate , but , even so...
Consequently , in energy terms , we are only going to add another vital element that would worsen and slow down economic growth and therefore the overall creation of employment .
Projects such as sub-generator reactors developed in particular by Carlo Rubia deserve all of our attention and I know that the Commission is working on these .
( Loud applause ) .
Yet , whereas each Member State must , of course , look for the best value for money , it must first of all measure the value of armaments in terms of whether they are appropriate for the specific needs of its defence in order to preserve its national independence as well as it can .
I only hope that the crisis of the Great Lakes of Africa will enable us to be aware of this need .
Conveying the proposal to the European Parliament is a welcome initiative , which I must emphasize .
Mr President , I agree on the whole with what Mr Swoboda has just said .
For far too long the Khartoum regime has been violating these values by eliminating basic liberties , introducing intolerable forms of religious discrimination , executing its opponents , terrorising its own people domestically and exporting terror .
Of course , we approve of humanitarian action and the urgent need for it .
Mr President , nor do I believe , Mr Pompidou , that it is in receiving a handful of NGOs that France will wash itself of the double shame of Geneva .
