So why this warning ?
In regard to public tenders alone there are currently 35 infringement procedures .
It is time our Member States finally permitted the Union to act against the three most important scourges of our time : nationalism , crime and unemployment .
Nowhere is the amendment of the Treaty more necessary than here .
I therefore compliment the Commission on reminding Germany of its Treaty obligations in the Saksen case .
That is what we have to work on , under the Irish presidency , then under that of the Dutch .
So what is stated here is completely untrue .
We have conducted protracted discussions about this report in the Committee on Women&#x02BC ;s Rights which concern pensions for women , and during these debates we have always carefully ensured that the Commission was present .
We cannot just take the Rocard report and then not the following reports .
On all the essential points the Council has been very self-congratulatory while making its own life very easy .
I do not see any willingness among a large part of the Council to make any progress .
That cannot be the outcome of the dialogue we want on first and second reading .
The Council is also a pretending Institution - it pretends to save .
That brings me to the question of the priorities and the holier-than-thou attitude of the Council .
From the point of view of international law there may be a number of critical questions concerning the recent military action of the United States in Iraq .
The sovereignty , traditions and interests of the Member States always seem to be of decisive significance .
But if good reason should exist , with respect to Turkey a similar sort of critical policy may have to be chosen for the time being , indeed for Middle East policy as a whole , not least for finding a solution to the Kurdish question .
Mr President , I do not need such a report to be able to observe that the Turkish Government has absolutely failed to keep its promises , and that instead of the promised changes there is a deterioration in the situation .
I have submitted an amendment to the same effect for the draft budget of the Union .
The agreements undertaken by Mrs Ã‡iller have not been fulfilled .
In any case I would like to remind of my intervention of nine months ago concerning the situation of the textile and clothing sector , one of the most sensitive sectors in the working of the customs union .
Then the Council becomes co-responsible for a deterioration of the human rights situation in Turkey , as we can see it today .
My Group is determined to continue to block the appropriations for Turkey deriving from the Financial Protocol of the Customs Union Agreement in the 1997 budget .
So , I just wanted to make it clear to all colleagues .
Belgium is certainly not alone where the problem of commercialised paedophile networks is concerned , but the extent to which the network was able to develop over so many years is spectacular , just as other cases in Belgium have taken on spectacular forms .
This can largely be attributed to better information , but the main problem is the corruption , social degradation and social poverty which contribute to certain forms of violence .
But we must immediately add that the Europol Convention is still a long way from being ratified by the Member States .
Internet users trace child pornography .
Today they are working in child pornography , tomorrow in drug trafficking , then trafficking in women or weapons .
These are words from parties who , for example , still consider Professor Etienne Vermeersch as a moral beacon , although this man considers the public condemnation of paedophilia as , and I quote , "excessively exaggerated ' and in no way excludes the possibility that , and I quote again , "certain forms of paedophilia , both moral and criminal , must be cleared ' .
The Commission report on the budget guarantee is also a very good report , which looks in detail at the situation of the countries for which loans are provided .
This should be replaced because the Budget Committee should have a right of codecision on such an important question , as is not actually the case now .
Mr President , Parliament has done its best with a report on excise duties from the Commission in which , remarkably , no concrete proposal is to be found .
This is the effect which can occur if one of the constituent price elements is changed .
A fourth question relates to the problem of fraud .
The Commission report underestimates the problem in an almost incredible way .
The most important functions of excise duties , raising taxes and controlling behaviour , only appear to a limited extent .
Paragraph 4 on the upward harmonisation of tobacco prices ; paragraph 20b on a considerable increase in the minimum prices for engine fuels ; paragraph 20c on the internalisation of externals costs ; and paragraph 20f on an all-encompassing taxation basis for mineral oils and their competing products all clearly point in the right direction .
So the best thing we can do tomorrow is to vote with my group against large parts of this report .
The argument that it is particularly the less prosperous who use rolling tobacco is not relevant , as their health is just as much at stake .
I endorse the opinion that harmonisation of the levy structure is of the greatest importance .
Regarding excise duties on alcoholic drinks , some colleagues make an impassioned plea for the zero rate on wine , because this would concern a purely agricultural product .
With respect to the measures proposed
