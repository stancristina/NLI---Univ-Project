system of aid for private storage .
The main thrust of the amendments proposed for the tobacco sector is the preservation of the , whereas the Commission is aiming for profound change .
Let me turn , finally , to hops .
The stakes are high ; the President of the Council spoke of dangers – that is how his words were translated into my language – and so it is important that we remind ourselves again of what we seek to achieve through this constitution .
From the first of May , we shall be a Community of 455 million people .
Only one motive : more power for the national governments .
It seems to me , however , that views have begun to converge and that those who stand in the way of the agreement are now fewer in number .
What have we achieved here in Parliament ?
I can only recommend vigilance .
I could name many other directives too .
I expect the Commission to make this pact , along with the adopted projects , the basis of the policy that underlies its financial planning .
It is therefore in the interests of the acceding countries to do better in these areas .
Mr President , may I say in conclusion – and I believe I can speak for the entire House here – that we are looking forward to the first of May and to the accession of our new partners .     . – Mr President , honourable Members , this is probably the last big debate of this Parliament on what is a really great and historic project , and for my part I would like to take the opportunity to thank your House most sincerely for its cooperation on this project , in particular the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , its chairman Mr Brok and the rapporteurs .
The message must be that this enlargement will not create problems but that it is the only way to solve the problems caused by the great changes that took place in Europe 14 or 15 years ago .
We are making preparations .
We will need regulations for the gradual introduction of the in the north of the island .
We are concentrating on these areas in our cooperation with Bulgaria .
I am sure we will all do everything we can to help Romania and Bulgaria in this .
There is still a lot to be done , however .
As Mr Maaten said , far more than 400 000 jobs are affected .
I was very interested in Estonia even before I became this Parliament’s rapporteur for its accession , and I have visited it regularly for 11 years .
I am convinced that it will enable Latvia to overcome its negative image .
Turning to Malta , I cannot do other than congratulate this important small Mediterranean state , situated where Europe and North Africa meet , on its decision to join the European Union , a decision now supported by all its political forces , and also on the efforts the country has made to prepare itself for the EU.
At this stage , then , in my humble opinion , we should be wary of delivering too many homilies to countries such as Bulgaria .
I do believe that what matters is not just price stability , zero deficits , and tax cuts , but that what matters most of all is that growth is achieved and new jobs created – more stable ones , too – and the need for social stability in these countries to be supported and encouraged .
The reference to child marriages in item 19 has to be qualified .
I have made Cyprus my concern ever since I entered this House in 1984 , a time when few thought its accession a realistic prospect .
Now the two of them are sitting here beside me , so once again , I will express my thanks and appreciation for what they have done .
It will take us at least a generation , if not several , before we can do away with social discrimination against the Roma , but what we did insist on as a precondition for accession was a detailed strategy that would help to overcome such discrimination in all areas .
Although we are prepared to extend the list by adding , for example , the project for a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt , we want a more precise definition of the projects in some areas covered by Annex III .
One of the things that make this clear is that projects given priority status are in breach of the Birds Directive , the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive .
I would rejoice if , despite the resistance with which this meets , not least from my own country , we could also succeed in incorporating what is called the Southern Railway and the Semmering link into this network .
If the Council wants solutions – and I think it capable of getting them – then fair compromises are needed , and they have to be agreed by us together ; the Council cannot simply announce a done deal .
Mr Dhaene has done well to improve the practical details of the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security .
This is meant to be Mr Miller’s report ; we must make sure that it really is by , in the plenary , stopping them in their tracks .
These agreements were and are a recognition of the international nature of research at the end of the twentieth century , and also recognise that to limit research to EU territory would frequently be contrary to its best interests .
