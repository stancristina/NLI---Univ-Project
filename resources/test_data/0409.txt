The main difficulty currently facing the Community fleet concerns the manifest lack of resources for the inspection and surveillance of the country ’s exclusive economic zone , that is to say , outside the 12-mile zone .
Unfortunately , however , the important aspect of the cofinancing contribution was not amended .
Broadly speaking , Parliament , the Council and the Commission have taken the same line on this programme .
Naturally Europe must look at the economic growth indicators that it needs to improve .
The recommendation on the proposal for a Council decision on Community strategic guidelines on cohesion by Mrs Krehl is based on that parliamentary resolution of 18 May .
Furthermore , we are opposed – especially in this context – to extending the use of private-public partnerships .
We voted against this report because its broad premise is to submit public services to competition and to a future internal market for services , in light of the compromise reached by the Council over the notorious Bolkestein Directive .
Regardless of the capitalist and market economy model that we advocate , there will always be a need for public services to be provided by public bodies , either directly or indirectly .
The EU’s internal market has already proved successful in liberalising a large number of sectors of its services , which has ultimately benefited European consumers and employees .
The case law of the European Court of Justice has done little to clear the fog .
These two issues alone are indicative of the many questions raised by Turkey’s accession negotiations .
On the other hand , as I noted at the beginning of this negotiation stage , I feel that a negotiation in which one of the parties does not recognise the other in its entirety , as in the case of Turkey towards Cyprus and , by extension , the EU , is a negotiation that has got off on the wrong foot and that suffers from severe shortcomings .
The Sudanese Government must be punished if they persist in thwarting the efforts of the international community in Darfur .
That stability is also threatened by the heightened tensions in Somalia on account of the Ethiopian intervention instigated by the Bush Administration , which has had the disastrous outcome of strengthening the Islamic courts in Mogadishu .
Without financial independence , there is neither freedom nor equality .
Microfinancing instruments have proved effective in combating poverty and it is women who have benefited most and benefited best , and have succeeded in improving their families ’ economic situation .
I also wish to thank all of the organisations in the sector , who , by staunchly protecting fisheries and the workers in the sector , have helped the report to include a range of proposals that we feel address the serious social and economic crisis facing the sector .
The policy should be aimed at feeding the people , full employment , improving the social conditions of the workers , and ensuring the sustainability of companies .
These were the measures proposed by the sector at its meeting with Parliament .
As the sector itself has highlighted , extraordinary situations demand extraordinary measures , and that means exhausting all possibilities and stretching the financial limits of the Community budget this year , not least because what is at stake is a common Community policy , the common fisheries policy , which , to be consistent , should be responsible for funding its own costs , within the framework of the European Fisheries Fund .
It is generally held that the best way forward is to reduce fishing effort , to use more selective methods , and to introduce positive discrimination in favour of local , small-scale fishing , which is the best way of keeping fish fresh .
Consequently , it is only by extending responsibility to fishermen and involving them directly that we can think of improving their economic situation on a sustainable basis .     – Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the Commission communication on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry , which , in itself , is indicative of the fact that something must be done to help the sector , with the emphasis on the weakest areas of the common fisheries policy ( CFP) .
This aid must compensate for the permanent loss of income arising from the disappearance of jobs , and for the reduction in income resulting from recovery plans and from far-reaching changes in cost-effectiveness due to external circumstances .
Thought must be given , moreover , to support for producer organisations , albeit within existing legislative frameworks , in order to ensure greater fairness and to protect those who sustain the sector .     – Madam President , Commissioner , we all agree on the economic and social importance of the fisheries sector in the EU and on the Commission ’s diagnosis that the situation is critical .
We cannot have a common policy that imposes Community-level restrictions and then leaves it to the Member States to cherry-pick the problems they solve depending on the funds they have available .
What is under discussion here is the fact that the Commission communication has acknowledged the positive effect of the 2003 regulation and compliance with it .
We must indeed preserve the resource , but that must be done by other means .
Consequently , emphasis has been placed on the need to control products imported from third countries , in order to ensure that the product has been obtained in accordance with production standards equivalent to those applied to organic production in the Community , and that this is reciprocated .
Galileo could help put an end to dependence on the US-controlled GPS system , which is administered by the US military .
It is therefore up to us to ensure that it is not just another mere project .
The balance that was sought
