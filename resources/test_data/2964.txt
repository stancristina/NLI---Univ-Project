raise barriers to accession should be scrapped or voted against .
People , especially from the relevant countries , often ask about accession dates because they would so much like to share some of the responsibility for these dates .
But I am not sure whether the Minister was thinking along such constitutional lines .
Unfortunately , there are too many parties at the moment which have shed their ideological feathers and , as a result , display too little ambition and too much materialism .
Mr President , let us no longer use the word enlargement , but rather talk about accession , or even better , the reunification of Europe .
And all parties must aim for the shortest possible transitional periods , if any at all .
This says something about the long road ahead , but the Hungarian minority also fears that , despite the 1999 Law on the Use of Minority Languages , it will remain curtailed in its social , cultural and economic development .
The discussion on Mrs Paulsen' s sound report was emotionally charged at times , and I believe that now , with this discussion behind us , we can assume that , although the requirements prescribed for the feed industry are strict , we can ensure that by admixture , the quality will change in future .
The tighter measures which the rapporteur announced in his report and which encompass , for example , an exhaustive list of products , for which he calls on the Commission for help , is an interesting proposal and will only reinforce this policy .
My recommendation with regard to this amendment was negative at first , but I would now like to change this into a positive one .
( Parliament gave its assent to considering the oral amendment ) ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) Report ( A5-0248/2000 ) by Mr Queir√≥ , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the European Parliament resolution on Hungary 's membership application to the European Union and the state of negotiations ( COM(1999 ) 505 - C5-0028/2000 - 1997/2175(COS) ) Before the start of the vote President .
Not only do the social activities which underpin the social programme complement the directive ' s legal framework , they also need to generate the extra information , the expertise and the support structure to complement and improve this legal framework .
This summer , the Council adopted a directive to combat discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin .
As already stated , the level of protection concerning the fight against sex discrimination should also be brought into line with the highest standard .
This is the background to Amendments Nos 19 and 35 , which contain a horizon provision ...
I am pleased that what is now before us affords women better protection than the existing directive on the principle of equal treatment , especially with regard to vocational training , employment and employment conditions .
I applaud the recommendation of the Mann report to offer ideological organisations the opportunity to prescribe the functions required of staff with this background in mind .
I would like to air a few concerns regarding this directive which are of particular importance for my group .
Let us hope - and I am relying on you , Commissioner - that the European Commission will now come forward with proposals , pursuant to Article 13 , to fight discrimination on grounds other than those to be found in the workplace .
I have a feeling that these rights are being infringed upon by Article 4 of the Commission proposal and the amendment tabled in this respect by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
Discrimination in the sense of treating people as inferior , taunting them and putting them at a disadvantage is an evil that must be eradicated .
We do need this to happen and we must give out this signal to the outside world .
I subscribe to the objective of the present proposal of extending this right to include the professional environment .
I hope something can as yet be salvaged in the process with the Council and Commission which is to follow .
We continue to strive for legislation which is more binding and more up to date , in view of the developments within the arms market and in the arms industry .
I hope that the bigger players in the arms export industry can see this as well .
This can only be tackled through increased cooperation .
Secondly , the rapporteur is completely right in putting his finger on the sore point of supervision by national governments of the conduct of their own arms dealers .
In a resolution quoted by yourself , which was adopted in this Parliament on 18 May and for which I was rapporteur , I recommended multi-disciplinary teams for research , since innovations often occur on the cutting edge of different disciplines .
However , this proposal instead met with heavy protest from certain Member States .
This concludes my response for the time being .
According to Oxfam , fifty-five percent of the total trade in light weapons is illegal .
Mr President , I am pleased to see so many members of the public here today because , as everyone up there can see , there are very few people down here at this time of night .
Today 's debate marks an important step in the reform process that was initiated by the Prodi Commission just over one year ago .
With that aim in view , the human resources allocated to internal auditing should be greatly increased .
I cannot help but feel that in the race to produce a proposal within the time limit set by the Reform White Paper , the Commission failed to focus properly on the detail
