I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature .
Alternatively , Parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggesting .
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide .
My vote was "in favour " .
Very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission ' s priorities in the field of transport .
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .
A moment ago , Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal presented by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .
If they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalised , if entrepreneurs cannot take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly .
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
We all agree that we should ask that , halfway through these programmes , when the assessment of the directives is made , Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens ' representatives .
They are growing , but only in terms of GDP.
The European Commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
Mr President , I would like , in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau .
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , academics and lawyers .
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .
Frankly , I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
Mr President , I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union , when compared to previous reports .
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82 , especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that , despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code , the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code .
Mr President , today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .
Thirdly , it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies .
But we all want to be oarsmen on it .
We all agree on this .
In this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon .
I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration .
However , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Parliament for offering me the opportunity to hold a debate on the disaster which has occurred off the French coast , as a result of the sinking of the oil tanker Erika on 12 December 1999 , which resulted in more than 400 kilometres of coastline being contaminated with spilt oil , leading to the death of thousands of birds and other enormously adverse effects from the point of view of the environment and the preservation of our seas and of clean coastlines which meet the minimum requirements of a developed society .
We should also seek solutions and proposals which will give the best possible assurance that events such as this do not recur .
Therefore the Commission is delighted that Parliament has favourably received , at first reading , its draft decision on the establishment of a legal framework which will improve cooperation in combating accidental pollution .
The States have now been provided with a legal framework which allows them to tackle the issue of flags of convenience , as well as all of those parties who fail to fulfil their safety obligations .
In any event , I would like to inform Parliament that , on the 28th of next month , a special mission from the Commission will go to inspect the company RINA and , in accordance with the conclusions of this mission , we will take any necessary steps .
As for the content of this communication , we basically intend to tackle the following issues : Firstly , the tightening up of controls on 'high-risk ' ships , whatever flag they may sail under , although the statistics speak for themselves : in port inspections , ships carrying the flags of the fifteen Member States of the European Union show around 5.9 incidences per 100 inspections carried out .
That is to say , the
