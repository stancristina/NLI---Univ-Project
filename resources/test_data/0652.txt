Mr Monti .
I believe that Mr Monti will tackle this problem in earnest .
Perhaps we could then redirect the subsidies to areas that further the Union ' s intentions , especially that of sustainable development .
In this , the importance of an energy tax cannot be underestimated .
International emissions trading must be assessed according to how effective it will be in reducing emissions .
Ambitious attempts on the part of individual countries are doomed to failure unless there is progress in the EU area as a whole .
The cultivation of forests , as a means of dispensing with carbon dioxide , is still being discussed ; this discussion must continue openly and we should also make more of the versatility of forests with regard to the environment and the prevention of climate change .
Mr President , Mrs Jackson said that the policies hid the fact that their implementation costs money and that it was hard-hitting .
Personally , I am certain that the reduction of emissions will create jobs in some areas , but it is equally true that it will mean reduced employment in others .
As you know , the Council cannot take a decision on this , so I cannot say anything at all on behalf of the Council .
For example , in my own country we experienced the situation where an energy tax that was brought in at national level in its first version was found to be in violation of the Union ' s acts on competition .
However , I think that energy taxes are one means of inducing market forces to reduce emissions and develop new , modern and clean technology , and I consider that to be very important .
As these matters are being discussed internationally , I believe it is important that the EU holds the trump card , enabling it also to negotiate the terms on which it should be ratified .
The Kyoto Protocol and the climate agreement also states that if a combined body of economic cooperation such as the EU cannot achieve the targets as a whole , responsibility for the targets set for it falls to all its Member States , in other words , if some Member States cannot meet their commitments , the Union will suffer as a whole .
If the current trend is allowed to continue uncontrolled , with no determined climatic policy , the rise in temperature of the earth will be a lot greater than two degrees in one hundred years , and all the corresponding effects it will have will be all the more dramatic .
The war is political , it is taking place at the same time as election campaigns in Russia , so that any way out must also be political .
It will not be possible to get these fighters out of the mountains using force .
In both cases international aid is required simply on account of the refugees , some of whose camps are out in the open .
Military operations are now taking place in the territories of at least five States and for this reason the matter is already an international one .
It is therefore a question of a political solution - I do not believe a military one to be possible - and we now have the opportunity to help Russia , which is in a difficult political situation in any case , by offering help to find a solution and bring about negotiations on the Chechen problem .
Therefore , the fact that the Union has produced its first report on the export of arms , and that it has made it public , is very welcome .
The report must , however , be actively extended to also include instruments of torture and other inhumane and debasing treatment so that information is available to national parliaments and this House as soon as possible , and before it is more widely disseminated .
The present definition of 'carbon sink ' in forest is inappropriate for the European practice of forest regeneration .
However , we still often fail to understand the cultural and political significance of the Internet .
In the future , we shall obviously need a movement to uphold civil rights in electronic commerce .
We need growing trade , for example , so that we can improve our competitiveness with the United States .
In retail trade , where losses due to theft might be about 1 % of sales , it is the retail trade that suffers .
We need international cooperation , as has been proposed here already earlier this evening .
It is also important that surveillance take place where the action is .
This will require international cooperation and much effort from our negotiators at the WTO round of talks .
I await the time when they too can access the Internet , and I hope that the Commission will take action to that effect .
The Commission believes that , for reasons of safety and to protect the environment , mopeds and motorcycles that are not fitted with a type-approved speedometer should no longer be allowed to be placed on the market .
Besides , the speedometer is already a standard fitting in most of the vehicles placed on the market in the European Union , without this significantly affecting the overall price of the vehicle .
As the Commission will soon be making a proposal to amend the framework directive , i .e . the Directive establishing a committee on motor vehicles , the Commission suggests that the committee procedure be discussed in that connection .
The issue could also be dealt with when the new commitology decision approved in June enters into force with regard to the existing committees .
The increase is EUR 44 million , or 3.5 % .
