the other , highlighted the major tasks we still face together .
In the Berlin Declaration we turned our faces towards the future and said that there were two things we wanted to do .
We know that the European Union has some very ambitious ideas on this subject , and we will try to canvass support for them and try to make them globally accepted .
So , then , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , my compliments to you on the outstanding job of work you have done .
The twenty-seven Member States are home to 500 million people , who make up 8 % of the world 's population , and that percentage is tending to decrease .
They do not figure in it .
The more we manage to get done in these six months , in which we do of course have other important matters to address , the easier it will then be to make progress with these other issues .
The crisis simulation with a view to reviewing financial stability in the EU that was presented at the Ecofin meeting in Helsinki last September has indeed revealed shortcomings .
The United Nations established an administration , and now we are on the brink of a new beginning .
Consequently this is a controversial and emotive issue to debate .
That is one reason for the dual legal base ; the other , as you rightly established , is that many of the details should be resolved in the implementing provisions .
It is time that FIFA and UEFA had a new , joint insurance system .
A professional club 's greatest source of revenue is the sale of television rights .
It also requires the Member States finally to make available the necessary equipment and personnel so as to carry out effective inspections of their own vessels .
The message of these two reports is : the Member States should bear more responsibility for ships flying their flag and both the Member States and shipowners should bear more responsibility if something happens .
The only thing that is workable is that we leave the ethical issues to the Member States , for that is what we have always done .
It is not necessarily usual that one clears it with the rapporteur , Mr Mikolášik .
We have always said that those Member States who allow research on it could continue .
The need for high-quality products for everyone in Europe means that it is true to say , as some of you have , that what is on the agenda today is in fact life itself , improved quality of life and the chance of new life .
I might add that it is also a fact of life for all of us that , while we do well to pay attention to what our consciences tell us , we cannot make that a yardstick for the conduct of others .
So , then , let me ask you again to consider whether it is not indeed really high time that this debate were brought to a proper end , with a good outcome for those researching in this field , because they want to help people , and a good outcome for those who depend on these medicines for dear life .
Since the oral amendment relating to incitement to the act originated from me , I should like once more to make it clear that the translations are problematic and that some of them are positively wrong .
I am very glad , then , that we succeeded in getting over 41 European states , including some of our neighbours , represented by ministers or their deputies at the Bremen conference , that we were able to highlight the importance of the alliance between government and civil society in the fight against HIV/AIDS and that it was also made plain that HIV/AIDS has to be seen as the big issue .
It is for this reason that I was , in Bremen , very glad to see that the ministers from the new Eastern European Member States were willing to talk very frankly about these things , because I see in this frank and open approach to these problems , in the removal of taboos , a way in which we can move forward in the way we all hope to do .
I hope the time limits and deadlines that have been set will now serve to bring together the business participants and the requisite consortium .
Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members , as the European Security Strategy affirms , 'the European Union and the United States of American can , through their common action , be a powerful force for the good of the world ' .
It strikes me that the mobility of our citizens is an important factor in this as well , because , as you are aware , the citizens of 12 EU states still require visas even for brief visits to the United States .
Security and prosperity in Europe and America depend to a fundamental degree on peaceful and stable development throughout the world , and so one thing for which we want to use the EU/USA summit is to send out a signal of the broadest possible agreement on foreign and security policy issues .
Preparation for the summit have not yet been completed , and core issues in it are to include climate change and energy .
One essential point that has emerged from it is that it is better to talk with one another than about one another .
I would like to assure you that we are working very hard to ensure that the statement emerging from the EU/United States summit expresses in abundantly clear terms our shared determination to strengthen the hand of the United Nations and to equip it with the tools it needs to perform its tasks .
