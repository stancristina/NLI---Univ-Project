my own behalf , on behalf of my group and on behalf of many Galicians who have a great deal of respect for your work , Mr Sterckx , thanks to your dedication , your political sensitivity and , above all , your impartiality .
The person or persons who decided to move the vessel further out to sea have never said that they moved the vessel because there was no place of refuge .
The tourism minister in my region , Galicia , says that this is more of a media disaster than an ecological disaster , and he says this with 51 000 tonnes of waste collected from the sea , 79 000 tonnes of waste collected from the land and in France 31 000 tonnes collected from the land and 1 500 tonnes from the sea , solely along the French Atlantic coastline , and he said this 10 days ago , on the same day that the oil reached the Belgian coast .
We have heard that proceedings are underway in France and Spain , and we know that they are underway in the United States .
It is important to recall here the trips , the presentations , the hearings , the documents , etc .
Evidently , we are faced with a political debate that is not searching to clarify the truth .
I also want to highlight a major change that has taken place in the IMO , which up to now was practically immovable .
Ladies and gentlemen , as far as I am concerned , that is what the citizens are asking of those of us who represent them here and , first and foremost , Galicians , since they have suffered these consequences at their core to a greater extent than anyone .
It is our role to stamp out easy money and businesses without scruples in maritime transport that damage the marine environment and its resources .
( The President cut off the speaker )
What it does is to get into a game which , as Mr Ripoll has just quite rightly pointed out , will come to an end the day the elections take place in Spain .
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank all the honourable Members for their speeches , which have been very interesting .
We had to wait until 1999 , with this Commission and this Parliament , for measures to be taken .
Double hulls , as the report by Mr Sterckx points out quite correctly , help and improve , but they are not the solution .
One of your speeches referred to 'pump ships ' .
The Baltic .
This is decided by the judge on duty , and I can assure you that they are enormously protective of their independence .
For a long time things have been left , for a long time things have not been done and now it is we who are doing things .
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we are going to debate now naturally relates to other types of activity and actions , although it also relates to energy .
In this regard , I am happy with the development which has taken place within the International Energy Agency , with regard to the possibility of taking account of the definite risks of breaks in supplies .
It is expected to promote competition in the supply of gas .
They clearly demonstrate the contribution of the Commission 's proposal to the good functioning of the internal gas market , as well as the importance of security of supply in a market of this nature .
Because all the problems which this proposal is intended to prevent would have been confronted and we would have had ways to respond to them .
We are talking about something very different , that the European Energy Agency has modified its recent decisions and has adjusted its previous criteria , according to which oil stocks could only be used when there was a break in the market , specifically of around 6 or 7 % .
Well , ladies and gentlemen , there are two types of mechanism : mechanisms for managing the market and mechanisms for using stocks .
And all of this should guarantee greater security if we think in terms of improving the number of days for citizens and for the European production system .
We must work on the basis that this is not a proposal for a Directive for patenting computer programs .
We cannot end up in a situation here like the United States situation , in which there are currently certain companies which in practice are able to prevent all work in the field of computer programming .
The people who advocate this initiative tell us that the only intention is to unify practice on the part of the national patent offices , in a field in which there have recently been contradictory resolutions .
The exclusive use which the law allows holders of patents obliges the holder to explain their invention so that it may be comprehensible to an average expert in the field .
We have had the case of Kosovo , of the Balkans , of East Timor , of Afghanistan and this year we have the problem of Iraq .
Mr President , as the President of Romania said this morning , or as the President of the Convention , Mr Giscard d'Estaing , said the other day in this Chamber , if our aspiration is for the European Union to play a key role on the international stage , we will have to seek permanent solutions to these problems , because otherwise we will have to be content with being a non-governmental organisation or a kind of international Red Cross which has no other purpose or job than to pay the bill for the great dramas of our times .
