I had the good fortune to be a vice-chairman for both , first with Mr Böge and then with Mrs Roth-Behrendt .
I am giving one less vote for the embargo controls , which are pitifully lacking ; we realize that it may not be possible to control everything but the fact is that the United Kingdom is exporting uncontrolled quantities of meat every day ; recently , it seems that 100 , 000 tonnes have been exported , not only to the European continent but to third countries in particular .
We therefore need to adapt our monitoring and actions to the safety and screening of citizens .
But I am also disappointed to see that not all our recommendations have been followed by the Commission , which has perhaps been too timid , President Santer , with regard to the accompanying measures , the reorganization has been good , the work carried out so far has been very good , particularly that of the Commissioner responsible for this sector and by the Commission as a whole , but in my opinion it is a pity not to have had the courage to go right to the end , as Parliament requested , both internally and with regard to measures against the state which , I have to say , was at the origin of this crisis .
It must be clear to us , between ourselves .
Virtually every day , every week , science is making new discoveries on this very subject .
Everyone is very pleased with the separation we have been able to establish between the legislative powers and the control structure ; I would however like to point out to you that this is not the methodology followed by the majority of Member States .
The reception is different , of that there is no doubt .
The Böge report contains several worrying points ; there are still uncertainties that have to be dealt with .
It is true that we need scientific activity , but I am convinced that research should be independent .
Firstly , relations with Member States .
There is therefore clearly a problem in this area .
Are we going to be able to harmonize control systems one day , Mr Fayot ?
Is this triumphalism ?
It is a matter that needs to be closely examined for it raises a cost/benefit problem that has to be considered .
This is what we have begun to change little by little .
In conclusion , it must be said that , in my opinion , zero risk does not exist .
The Council 's 1991 decision on the abolition of intra-Community dutyfree sales granted a particularly long transition period (up to 1999 ) in which duty-free sales would still be tolerated within the scope of the single market .
At the same time , we believe it essential that the single market should operate fully and , within its scope , eliminate serious distortions to competition , because we think that those concerns , that may arise with reference to the specific cases indicated by Mr Collins , may be adequately taken into account with means that do not distort the single market and that do not have the disadvantage , as duty-free sales do , of generating unemployment in other sectors of the economy .
The Commission will take an active part in all the discussion groups where it will firmly insist on the need to strengthen international coordination , emphasize the need to improve the means of management and data banks and describe the capacities it has available .
First of all , as pointed out by the questioner , I would like to record the full agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on this important matter .
For some time now , a magic word has appeared in all the documents : flexibility .
This agreement is therefore partial because it only deals with part of the problems ; together with Mrs Jöns , we ask the Commission to finally take up its position , propose a directive on atypical employment and lay down regulations on all its aspects , because otherwise flexibility will remain an empty or even more dangerous word .
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , Parliament is once again examining the draft Directive on the lawyers ' right of establishment , which is of extreme importance not only to European lawyers but also to all European citizens , as potential users of the legal service .
The approval and actual implementation of the new directive , for which I too call warmly upon Mr Monti , will be the most useful way of celebrating this anniversary .
This is in my view an important point of the Tsatsos report , which reflects the concerns of the Committee on Budgets on this point .
An integration crisis , a prevailing trend towards renationalization , a discussion of several basic principles and several clear roles acquired by the Commission and the Court of Justice , despite what Mr Brok says , a dangerous game of Russian roulette on expansion which , if developed under current institutional conditions , would penalize the Union 's inability to make decisions .
Mr President , to use an English expression , this evening the whips will guide the vote of their own disciplined troops and there will be no surprises .
Unfortunately , we are only left with one vote against this resolution so far from the ideals on which the European challenge is based and the associational method that produced it , convinced that the way to honour our mandate is to do so as servants of Europe and its democratic growth , and not as government spokesmen .
But our rapporteurs too , like us , will have assessed the impact of a possible negative vote cast by this Chamber ,
