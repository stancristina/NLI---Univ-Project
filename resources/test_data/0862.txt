Over and above laying down the necessary rules to contain globalisation , the members of the international community must pursue a deliberate policy to safeguard international peace , to share the benefits of the growth of world trade more fairly and to ensure greater respect for the principles of justice , democracy and respect for human rights .

Europe - which , to me , encompasses the Commission , the Council , Parliament and the Member States - must stand united .
I would like to list a few promising initiatives : " Everything but Arms " , our action programme against AIDS and the initiatives by Messrs Jospin and Schr√∂der concerning the Tobin tax .
This is , in my opinion , the cornerstone of a partnership with developing countries .
Even if it is correct that the Belgian Prime Minister , following Gothenburg , said that the law enforcers and armed forces in my country have extensive experience of all kinds of disturbances .
My baptism - and I hope it will not be a baptism of fire - will take place tomorrow evening .
We will return to this topic during Question Time , when I will have the opportunity to give you more detail in my answers .
Even if this consultation does not reap any immediate benefits , the discussions at the Council will still be affected by this during the coming months until the end of the budgetary procedure in December .
The Council deems it of particular importance to keep to each of the annual maximum amounts for expenditure , as laid down in the financial perspectives and based on the recent EP and Council decision to adjust the financial perspectives with regard to budget implementation , and on the technical adjustment to GNP and price development , implemented by the Commission .
For this purpose , the Council has , with regard to commitment appropriations , taken account of the evaluation of the options to implement the appropriations .
An attempt has been made , where possible , to meet the needs of the different institutions and to take account of the specific characteristics and the general objective of a moderate increase in administrative expenditure .
We would ask the Commission to submit a detailed analysis of the needs and to meet those needs , first of all by using the appropriations still left from 2001 , and secondly , by including the required appropriations for 2002 in its letter of amendments this coming autumn .
This reduction does not provide for the discussion of the letter of amendments , which the Interinstitutional Agreement prescribes , and which requests that particular account be taken of the development of the markets and the state of negotiations on the different common market organisations .
That is why it has accepted the amounts which the Commission had requested in its preliminary draft budget , especially for the framework programme for research and development of the trans-European networks .
However , based on the anticipated price development , the Council has curtailed the commitment and payment appropriations , which are not accompanied by multi-annual programmes , together with appropriations for agencies .
In addition , as already mentioned , the Council has maintained the appropriations for international fisheries agreements in their entirety .
When the Council compiled its draft budget for administrative expenditure which falls within the scope of category 5 of the financial perspectives , as already stated , it followed an approach which aims to meet the needs of the institution as far as possible , taking into account their specific features .
This increase reflects the priority which the Council , backed by the European Parliament and the Commission , affords this expenditure .
If one considers the struggles one faces in the course of the budgetary procedure , he appears to be right .
That , of course , is also telling of how much the Council values Parliament .
Within category 5 , administrative expenditure , the Council is the fastest growing institution , and that creates added tension within this category .
I hope that we can at least agree on the principle , namely that operational expenditure belongs in category 3 and administrative expenditure in category 5 .
Despite this , the Council only approved 89 of the 317 requested posts .
The execution of contracts , however , is a matter which , in the first instance , falls under the competent services of Europol .
Since then the Council agencies have reached complete agreement on the draft , subject to the legal and linguistic amendment of the text and , as I have already said , the withdrawal of parliamentary reservations .
According to information given to the Commission and its competent services and also received by the Council , olive oil made from olive waste has been taken off the market in Spain after the Spanish government had activated the system for the rapid exchange of information in emergencies on 4 July 2001 on account of the fact that polycyclic aromatic compounds ( PACs ) had been found in this oil .
( NL ) As was said earlier with reference to oral question H-0545/01 of the honourable Member , Regulation (EC ) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 May 2001 relating to public access to documents of the European Parliament will come into force as of 3 December of this year .
I would draw your attention to the fact that this provision was not included in the previously mentioned Regulation (EC ) No 1049/2001 that comes into effect on 3 December next .
The receipt of e-mail is considerably less free of strings for the receiver than the receipt of paper leaflets and brochures .
