of citizens , preserve their collective future and respect democratically-elected institutions .
Secondly , we consider it essential to emphasize the need to withdraw foreign troops and prevent this war from being gradually extended to other countries .
Finally , there must be an immediate cease-fire , saving human lives and enabling the country to start functioning again while searching for a peaceful political solution that guarantees Guinea-Bissau 's territorial independence and integrity .
It affects one of the world 's poorest countries , which makes it even more deplorable inasmuch as it threatens the future and the real independence of a country , the Republic of Guinea-Bissau , after a heroic struggle by the PAIGC and a man of the political and human stature of Amilcar Cabral .
The military forces must not be allowed to go on preventing humanitarian aid from reaching people at risk .
The government 's mandate ended on 4 June , and therefore Nino Vieira , as President-elect , has the legitimate power - but greater responsibility - to promote a cease-fire , dialogue and negotiation .
Yet another disaster has befallen a people that only a few months ago were stricken by storms , deaths , injuries and damage .
Madam President , I will be brief , since my colleague Mr Novo has already clearly identified the problem .
Secondly , the fact that these phenomena have repeated themselves clearly proves that the ultra-peripheral regions have special problems and calls for the necessary initiatives to be taken by the Commission to give practical expression to the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty .
In any event , the Azores have no means to give them the kind of support they need in these circumstances .
Especially at times like this , solidarity must be more than just a concept .
All that is needed is the decision which , in the circumstances , I am sure will be taken .
If we fail to do so , either we shall retard irremediably our progress towards reaching the average development parameters for our country and the European Union , or we shall not carry out any reconstruction work .
The material damage is estimated at around 20 billion escudos .
This European solidarity will enable those citizens , who are Europeans like ourselves , to feel , despite all they have suffered , that it is worthwhile continuing to live and believe in the European ideal .
An astonishing number of air disasters and their heavy toll of victims have become part of our daily lives , the corollary not only of increased traffic , but also of a relaxation of safety standards by the less scrupulous operators and of lax legislation .
This text aims to establish a strategy for Buenos Aires , particularly with regard to the flexibility mechanisms , and does not just reaffirm our completely unaltered position on climate change .
Thirdly - and this is important for Buenos Aires - it is essential to clarify the emissions trading , joint implementation and clean development mechanisms .
None of this is clear to me at the moment and , so far , I have not seen any European Union positions which enlighten me as to the stance which will be taken in Buenos Aires .
The policy in favour of renewable energy and energy efficiency continues to exist only in statements and communications and has not yet been transformed into a mechanism , into an operational policy of the European Union .
If the situation is to be resolved , a change must be made in the ultra-liberal approaches that are conducive to speculative activity , and this inevitably calls at the same time for a closer focus on social problems and on the reviving of domestic demand in order to achieve sufficient growth to bring about the recovery of productive investment .
We have followed recent political developments and the declared intentions for the future with the closest attention .

It is time for Europe to emerge from its passivity and remoteness , acting as though Islam were nothing to do with it , as though Islam were not already part of Europe .
We must now focus on helping to make it intercultural .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have closely examined Mr Secchi 's report , together with the opinions and the Council directive on a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different Member States .
As we all know , traditionally the location of the registered office or effective administration has been the relevant factor in international tax relations .

Paragraph 13 of the motion for a resolution , which rejects the Tobin tax , appears out of place in a report on SMEs and access to markets .
Mr President , the European Observatory for SMEs continues to prove its usefulness in recognising and promoting these businesses which make such a vital contribution to our development .
