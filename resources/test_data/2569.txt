.
In conclusion , the reason why I shall be voting in favour of this directive is not that it will effectively fight air pollution , but because , compared to the previous directive , this new directive is the lesser of two evils .
Firstly , although Schengen exists , we have to observe that there is still no effective police cooperation and no effective exchange of intelligence which could yield major results in the fight against organised crime .
That is where Schengen really takes things too far .
They too deserve support and attention , often more than they are receiving now .
However , the amendments tabled by this Parliament with regard to the Commission document often lack the necessary balance .
In my opinion , it is much preferable to deal with the Afghanistan issue at a later date , should this appear necessary , when we can prepare for it properly , for we are now dealing with an extremely important and complex problem .
More than ten million citizens in Europe have sleeping disorders .
To curb the noise of trains at European level and prescribe the same noise standard along busy railway lines .
The tyre directive is a case in point .
The Environmental Committee has offered to pick those up .
The majority of the Environmental Committee have adopted the Council ' s position that a Member State must be able to establish its own noise indicator Lden .
Furthermore , the economic damage it incurs is enormous , running into the tens of billions of euros annually .
For that purpose , a formula will need to be established on the basis of which maps can then be drafted .
The people in the south worry about the disturbance of the pace of life , but that is not a constant .
I should like to express a personal opinion on one other point .
Most proposals have been re-instated from the original Commission proposal .
Clear examples of products are emission requirements for cars , lorries and machinery , while waste incineration and energy generation typify processes .
A separate problem is aircraft noise .
In addition , airports in border regions can cause extra problems .
If we really want to do something about aircraft noise , technical improvements must be carried out more quickly .
In this connection , the guidelines and opinions of the World Health Organisation should be taken into consideration .
The European Parliament pointed at the lack of data on various sources of noise a long time ago , and a common method must be found for measuring and assessing noise .
That is therefore no longer a point of discussion .
Furthermore , the call-back mechanism , to which the European Parliament can refer , should this prove necessary , must be regulated in advance .
The PSE Group , also in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , is now offering to break this cycle .
This Parliament has often called for a common and unambiguous policy on evaluating whether or not countries are safe .
A second observation pertains to the aid to those countries that receive large groups of refugees .
The recommendations made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy have been adopted unanimously in the committee .
A responsible compromise must be struck .
I would like to thank the fellow MEPs for their kind cooperation and wish them all every success .
I concur with the opinion by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on this .
In my opinion , this is a bridge too far .
First of all , the annual reports of the Member States are not harmonised .
Embassies of EU Member States could play a more supervisory role in situ .
Finally , I should like to express the hope that the EU Code of Conduct will form the basis for a worldwide code on the export of arms .
All available means are being deployed right across the pillars .
Annual reports are useful , but joint action is preferable , of course .
The citizens would like to know how the export policy will be adopted to prevent the wrong expertise from falling into the wrong hands .
I would quote the reports on terrorism and the use of weapons of mass destruction in this connection .
Madam President , Afghanistan is a country with an average income per inhabitant of USD 800 .
We know that we are extremely limited in what we can do .
We , together with UNHCR , will also need to take action in Pakistan .
On behalf of the Socialist Group , I hope that the Commission , in close cooperation with all those involved , the international NGOs , UNHCR , WFP , in Iran , in Pakistan , with the political initiatives which Commissioner Patten indicated a moment ago , manages to send out that signal on time : a new coalition for humanitarian aid in the region .
What is that relationship not ?
That is not acceptable .
It is unacceptable for a country such as Saudi Arabia to escape our attention , because it now forms part of our coalition , for that country too violates human rights and operates an anti-democratic regime .
That is why we deem the present Afghanistan strategy of the American administration to provide financial and material aid to the broadest possible coalition against the Taliban around the king in exile , Zahir Shah , to be the most plausible foreign contribution to this political and military tour de force .
Central Asia is a vulnerable and very fragile region .
Commissioner , a moment ago , you listed a number of projects which will be followed up , for example the high-speed link from Paris-Vienna-Budapest eastwards , and making the Danube navigable
