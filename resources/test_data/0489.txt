with Ecofin for its rushed attempt to pre-empt tomorrow 's vote here by issuing details of its compromise agreement .
The events of 11 September have exacerbated the current situation exponentially .
When Sabena folded , 7,500 people lost their jobs from one day to the next .
The airlines operate in a global village .
The main message must be that the proper response is to restructure the airline industry .
This communication contains a number of important points and measures .
The Commission is currently checking a number of medium-term monthly insurance plans on the basis of competition rules and internal market legislation relating to insurance .
And it is examining the possibility of a longer-term solution to the problem of insurance within the framework of the European Commission .
The restrictions imposed on airlines by traditional rules of ownership and control in bilateral air transport service agreements make mergers and acquisitions and external investment very difficult , even if the companies are in dire economic straits , which is why the Community desperately needs a dynamic common policy in the external relations sector .
The President-in-Office of the Council has set out the specific problems and the need for a direct European policy and agreement at European level very clearly .
Some are due to the crisis per se , which started last spring .
First of all , there is a relatively complete legal framework which allows companies to negotiate with their employees in order to find new working models in a bid to keep redundancies to a minimum .
The second way is by subsidising salaried employees whose jobs are at risk .
Certain measures for Sabena will be jointly funded by the European Social Fund .
We have already held meetings with the social partners through the Social Dialogue Committee and it has been decided that a European workshop will be held on 3 December , attended by all the sectors at social partner level and by national delegates from the fifteen Member States , in order to discuss the specific question of the repercussions on employment and the nascent social problems , in a bid to reach a joint agreement on measures which we can take into direct consideration .
And no doubt others will follow .
There can be no doubt that this situation is here to stay and , the more capital is concentrated , the more the workers and consumers will be expected to pick up the tab in the form of job losses and more and more expensive tickets .
Two major sets of issues have been debated .
There are three points worth making here : first , the present traditional model of ownership and control obviously will not allow the degree of restructuring we would like , or rather the degree of restructuring required .
And the third point relates to state aid .
What tool do we have at European level ?
Can we decide to give state aid to airlines ?
Meaning that we have national governments with different capabilities , different frameworks and different airlines .
That now more than ever we need a European transport policy , not national policies which at the moment are leading nowhere fast .
This has already been done in other sectors with large companies being restructured both in Great Britain and France .
We have urgent challenges to meet .
The European Parliament , as the rapporteur , Mrs Figueiredo has just said , had high hopes of this Community programme .
The ground which we need to cover between now and 2010 , the timeframe and political milestone set in Lisbon , will be a long , hard haul and it is crucial , in our view , that the European Council in Laeken set its stamp very firmly on this effort .
Mr President , the speakers referred - and this is important - to the shortcomings and limited potential of this tool as it stands .
First , national action plans against exclusion and poverty are being submitted , for the first time .
What is important is that , first , the budget has been increased as a result of significant pressure and intervention on the part of the European Parliament and , secondly , we have achieved a common position between the Commission and Parliament during conciliation on 90 % funding for organisations which really do not have any resources of their own .
Two , it helps us work together and develop joint social indicators , for the first time .
Six - and I should like to highlight this point - it specifically involves associations of people who are the victims of poverty and exclusion and , seven , it allows us to raise public awareness of the huge problem of poverty , which cannot be dealt with simply by governments and European programmes but which needs to galvanise the whole of society into action .
The Rule is clear .
We ask the Commission if it intends to withdraw its proposal .
Consequently , we need to proceed to the third paragraph of the Rule , which states that the matter has to be referred back to the committee responsible , without voting on the draft legislative resolution and I propose that we do precisely that .
It looks like the translator has translated a different text .
In one section , the words tuberculosis and malaria have simply been transliterated into Greek instead of using the Greek terms .
This approach works to the benefit of more general imperialist interests and to the detriment of the workers and society as a whole , in both supplier and consumer countries , which are being sacrificed so that the multinationals which create and exploit recessions and provoke wars which allow them to control the energy-rich areas of the world can make a profit .
