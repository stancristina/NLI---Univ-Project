if it becomes an institution .
Until now , the Swedish Government has been unable to conclude an accord de siege with the ECDC , although they desperately wanted this agency , like all Member States always badly want an agency .
Then it is rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the ECR Group say that everything that happens here is substandard - knowing quite well that responsibility lies somewhere else entirely .
Nevertheless , I would like to say clearly that there still need to be substantial amendments to this negotiating mandate .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Presidency and you , Commissioner Malmstr√∂m , for what you have said .
For me , there is no doubt that we must firmly integrate controls , the right of appeal , access rights , claims for damages , as well as the length of the retention period , in the agreement .
It is very important to us that we quickly reach a new negotiating mandate and , if possible , before the summer break , so that we can quickly gain clarity in detailed questions on how we should handle this data and what data should be included .
That means we need to look again in detail at what we are discussing when we say that serious crime should also naturally be included .
I do not want to irritate you just now by reviewing this great and still relevant film in even more detail , but the uncontrolled access to all passenger information of all people worldwide for the purpose of profiling and nothing else has been going on in the USA at least since 11 September 2001 .
For that reason , we discussed this once again this morning in our group and it was said that , if there is an opportunity for the open questions to be answered to Parliament 's satisfaction , we ought to take that opportunity .
Although the possible 100 % reimbursement for 2009 and 2010 for financing labour market policy measures did not promote further education and high-quality apprenticeships to the extent that we would have liked , it is certainly essential in the current situation .
In this regard , mention clearly needs to be made once again of the problem of dogs being imported from the East , in respect of which not all of the loopholes in the existing regulations have yet been closed .
This creation of a Euro-Latin American area has the potential not only to bring positive economic results but also , above all , to strengthen the role of the EU as a foreign-policy player , particularly in respect of the United States .
For this reason , I voted in favour of the motion .
With France and Germany acting like great powers , the process of reaching a decision on the assistance package was very expensive and protracted .
Mr Cohn-Bendit has already spoken very convincingly about this .
Mr Barroso , in the European Union , a market to which 27 States belong , we have no alternative but to actually come up with a financial transaction tax or other instrument that will reduce the hunger of speculators to make profits in this area .
On the basis of what we currently have in our hand , the European Parliament cannot yet , in my view , say that after Lisbon this is now a successful strategy .
Therefore , we should not abandon our focus on improving conventional means of locomotion , as crude oil will probably continue to fuel our mobility for a long time yet .
We need to carry out research in this regard , but we also need to harmonise our taxes .
The Greens will vote in favour of this resolution .
I am therefore recommending to all groups that they vote in favour of including the decision on discharge on the agenda .
There is just one amendment .
In addition , Member States should draw up national action plans to raise the standard of existing buildings closer to the level of near-zero energy buildings .
I believe that is the best way out of the crisis , because not only will it , of course , raise new tax revenue but , moreover , energy from fossil fuels will be replaced by renewable energy - thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption .
Thirdly , we need greater labour productivity in construction , and for that we need more training .
We want our energy saving measures to be implemented not just in new builds , but also in renovation work .
May I point out that this framework directive is being watched with interest in other regions of the world such as China and the US.
If we are still awaiting studies of the possible effects of harmful substances , then in the meantime , genetically modified cotton should at least be stated on the label .
The Commission has some urgent reworking to do here .
Similarly , we may be continuing with great efforts to promote health provision yet , at the same time , we are preventing the trade in generic medicines or pushing up the prices of medicines to prohibitive levels by extending patent protection .
So far , the Commission has not been able to eliminate this suspicion .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank all the members of the committee for their constructive cooperation .
As we are all aware , this can only be achieved if we have an effective penal system .
Perhaps it is only the beginning .
I repeat that that is for assistants , not for Members of this House .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , you have all heard how controversial the debate about this 2011 budget is
