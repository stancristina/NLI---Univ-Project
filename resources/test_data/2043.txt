, distributers and consumers can meet .
I would therefore like to ask for the sitting to be suspended for a few minutes to enable our group to hold a meeting .
Starting as you do with the vote on Amendment No 5 , Amendment No 2 can then be added - they are not mutually exclusive .
At that time , in fact , the majority of the House had increased the Council budget from 0.7 % to 2.7 % , the same increase as in the expenditure of the European Union .
Indeed , I should like to remind the House that France contributes 17.4 % to the Community budget and that the share of the EAGGF redistributed to France is over 24 % .
For , when this interesting example of an experiment in free cooperation has proved successful , it will be difficult to contain .
I think it possible that demonstrations like those censured by the Court of Justice would not take place if the European Union had a right and proper conception of freedom of movement .
In the south of France and in Corsica , small quantities are produced , compared with our Italian , Spanish and Greek neighbours .
In Mr Jové Peres ' initial report , it was proposed that production subsidies ( tree subsidies ) should be withdrawn and replaced by consumption subsidies .
We regret that our amendments , justified by the protection of employment and the control of our external trade deficits , were not adopted .
Madam Commission , please be brave , accept your responsibilities .
Mr President , I will use my speaking time to express my support for the honourable gentleman and the other speakers .
But a political responsibility is essential , and we frequently have difficulty in finding out where it lies within the Commission .
One attitude is to accept the Müller report , which , based on an apparent concern for efficiency , sees in the financial provisions of the new article 28 of the treaty , a need to increase the communitarization of the whole of the CFSP , by reinforcing the powers of the Commission , and of course , the powers of the European Parliament , within the framework of a new inter-institutional agreement .
However I would have hoped that you would have us proceed formally to the vote for or against the report .
In effect we were refused a vote on the Commission 's statement - which we considered to be very negative - on mad cow disease .
Today , transgenic beetroot pulp has been marketed in the Netherlands even though its commercialization was banned .
Regulation 1813/97 which came into force on 1 November establishes rules for additional labelling for food and ingredients which are produced from genetically modified soya and maize .
They prefer the protein criterion and the establishment of a list of products to be included on labels before the products to be included on the list are specified .
In response to the important question which deals with imports of genetically modified products from the United States or Canada , in accordance with the clauses of article 43 of Directive 90/220/EEC , the Member States are bound to see that this directive is observed , in other words they are responsible for monitoring the conformity of products containing genetically modified organisms which appear on the market in the European Union , and must see that the relevant authorities organize inspections and , if necessary , other control measures in an adequate way .
Mr President , almost a year ago the Parliament approved the work of the Committee on Conciliation on the novel foods regulation .
There is nothing in the regulations , we do not know what this could do to our health , nor do we know what effect it could have on the environment .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , genetically modified organisms have entered the European Union and the Parliament can only lament this state of affairs .
So , to ensure that European consumers can still aspire to the legitimate choice of natural foodstuffs , the least the European Union can do for now is to support biological production consistently .
We have also looked to provide positive indications .
However you can be sure that the Commission will be extremely vigilant in taking precautions where the health of consumers is concerned .
These are already showing great promise .
These procedural rules aim to guarantee the rights of parties to be heard and to give to third parties , whose interests could be affected by a Commission decision , the opportunity to highlight to their observations beforehand .
As we do not have any information , we cannot make a response .
Unfortunately , the only way the Commission has envisaged revitalizing our railways is by completely liberalizing them .
Mr President , I argue in favour of an efficient and modern railway system .
All the possibilities of Directive 91/440 must be explored before it is amended , and cooperation must be encouraged between rail operators .
If remote sensing expands , it will be because it is a tool for town and country planning .
Finally , like him , I am aware of the actions necessary to control and eliminate the pollution caused by space debris .
Article 150 has therefore not been respected .
I was told : Parliament will sit and give its opinion at the stage of recommendations to the Commission , but the Commission is not the same body as the Council of Ministers .
So much the better !
We are no longer in a system of fixed parities .
Once they make such a commitment , we will be able to say to them , six months or a year later : ' You set yourselves such and such a target .
