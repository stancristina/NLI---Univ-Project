said that they would be put on the Internet - we never saw them !
Yet we are expected to go along the lines that the Commission wanted without ever seeing those so-called studies .
The reason why we never saw those studies was because the social effects mentioned in them - the effects on postal services - were simply not to the liking of the Commission .
A reduction of the universal service - the very core of the postal service sector - to 50 grammes would seriously put at risk the ability of the national postal operators to deliver a universal service at an affordable tariff to people , irrespective of where they live .
That is a crucial point .
I am not saying that people who live in cities should get a better service than people in rural areas .
I am not going to give the old Florus Wijsenbeek argument : well , why should we be delivering letters up there - people should get on the Internet .
That is why he is no longer with us .
In other words , what the Commission is proposing , supported by some in this House , will in my own country lead to a reduction in service levels , in particular in rural areas .
You can forget the daily guaranteed delivery and collection service .
You can forget a single tariff : zonal pricing will be introduced .
In other words , people in rural areas will pay more .
There will be job losses .
I am sorry , Mr Ferber , I am concerned about job losses and the effect they will have .
It will also lead to the closure of rural sub-post offices , because they rely on postal services for their very survival .
I also want to stress the human element .
Some people have said that we have liberalised telecoms and it was not a great problem .
But telecoms are about machines , this is about people meeting the service face to face , not meeting the service the other side of a telephone or computer screen .
We often pontificate here about being the representatives of the citizens of Europe .
Well , if my mail bag is anything to go by , the citizens of Europe do not want to see their postal services decimated .
I remind my Conservative MEP colleagues of the mess they got into in the UK when they tried to privatise the British post office .
I fought against that and , having won that battle , I am not going to give that up to see the battle reopened via the back door of Europe .
Today we have a report before us that is an excellent response to the Commission 's proposals .
It is a response that is not only measured , but also guaranteed to improve our services for consumers , irrespective of where they live .
Again , I stress that what we are talking about today is people and public service and not ideologies .
It is about getting that public service delivered to them , irrespective of what is on the balance sheet .
I would recommend our compromises because I believe we have ensured that postal services will be developed in the European Union and that those postal services will deliver to the people of Europe .
If you go down the road of the Commission or some in this House , then you will decimate those postal services and we will be slated by the people for that action , and rightly so .
Madam President , I hope that the broader membership of the European Parliament will accept the recommendations of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism concerning the future administration of postal services within the European Union .
The opening up of postal services to greater competition is one of the recommendations of the Transport Committee .
However , we must recognise that unfettered competition in the area of postal services would result in a severe reduction in the quality of these services in rural and peripheral parts of the European Union .
Therefore , it is recommended that universal postal providers within the Union will be able to deliver all postal items below 150 grammes in weight .
This will have the effect of protecting the quality and continued regularity of postal service deliveries .
Private operators will also be able to deliver letters at four times the price of a normal letter .
We should be clear on one specific matter when we are discussing this new directive .
There has been absolute and total consultation between all interested parties in the field of postal services in Europe concerning the specific provisions of this directive ; and I am satisfied that these proposals which have come through the Transport Committee of the European Parliament are realistic and pragmatic .
They will ensure the economic viability of the rural post office network in my country and in other rural and peripheral parts of the European Union .
Regular postal deliveries must be seen as an essential economic and social element in rural villages and towns .
I would be very clear on one particular matter .
If there is unfettered competition in providing postal services in Europe , then lucrative urban areas will be cherry-picked by private operators at the expense of the poorer and less profitable rural parts .
We cannot , Madam President , Commissioner , and will not , tolerate such a situation .
That is why I urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by the Transport Committee of this Parliament with regard to the future administration and workings of postal services in Europe .
Madam President , Council , Commissioner , I understand the desires expressed by some of my colleagues for an end-date and for moves towards greater liberalisation
