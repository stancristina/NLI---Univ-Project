The electoral process provides civil society with a formal means of expression , and the result of that electoral process is the legislative bodies , and it is they who have to adapt the general regulations .
And it must do so within a system of international cooperation , particularly with the United States and with Russia , who are pioneers in terms of space , and also with others such as Japan , China , etc .
In the field of conciliations , it is the case that the reform of Regulation ( EEC ) No 4064/89 has not been as radical a change as the one which has taken place , for example , in the field of anti-competitive behaviour .
And if there was anything on which there was complete agreement it was the fact that the unnecessarily complex rule in Article 1( 3 ) , introduced in the 1997 reform , had not contributed to resolving the problem .
I would like firstly to congratulate him , as does the whole of this House I believe , for the good memories we all have of him and we wish him great success in his new role .
And neither that they are essential to both parties .
In summary , the international fisheries agreements are an essential mechanism for the European Union and for the third countries , since both parties benefit mutually from them , as the Cunha report points out in a crystal clear fashion .
It has indeed already proved its worth .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am bound to admit to you that I too am overcome by a feeling of frustration .
It is imperative not to allow this frustration to cloud our vision .
I will begin with the Road Map .
Still greater involvement by the international community is therefore called for , if that were possible .
It remains the focal point for all peace efforts .
Specific actions are required if the current stalemate is to be transcended .
Mr Ala has built up a wealth of experience in very difficult circumstances .
The Palestinian Government needs to put an end to this scourge , in the interests of the Palestinians themselves .
Further , Israel is called upon to put an end to its policy of targeted killings .
That is the bottom line .
This applies in particular to the United States .
It is important not to play into the hands of the terrorists .
I trust you will convey the deepest condolences of the House to the Government of Spain .
The broad support for these proposals in the House is also worth noting .
I also believe we should make it clear to the Israeli Government and to Mr Sharon that the solution to the conflict does not lie in implementing the law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
All this is to the credit of the Palestinian Authority .
I should point out too that from the Great Wall of China to the Berlin Wall , all such walls have proved utterly useless .
I believe the Quartet must continue its work .
I would also ask for our condolences to be sent to the family of Jose Manuel Bernal Gomez , the Spanish official accredited in Baghdad .
Everyone has lost out during the three years of the Intifada .
I am sure , however , that we all agree on our dislike of walls such as the so-called security wall .
His track record has earned him the support of the House .
I would ask honourable Members to take a moment to reflect on how they might be feeling if during the last three years terrorist attacks had become almost weekly events in their countries , and if these attacks had caused nearly 500 civilian victims .
This is particularly so in the case of the Middle East .     –  Mr President , Mr Solana was kind enough to say he had devoted a good deal of time to my report .
I am therefore now in a position to have the pleasure of speaking on this text on behalf of the committee , not just as a socialist .
The terrorists would actually see this as a success .
The rights of Palestinian citizens must also be taken into account .
Nonetheless , alternatives need to be in place , notably the establishment of an international mandate in Palestine under the authority of the Quartet .
Having listened to those Members of the House who took the floor , it seems that essentially we all agree that the present situation is extremely serious .
I believe the aforementioned objective is our shared objective .
The European  Union will certainly maintain its commitment .
It is therefore important to reiterate time and again that this is not a fight against particular civilisations or religions .
No agreement was reached .
I should now like to refer to the situation that is likely to arise this morning .
The Finance Minister has brought this about .
I think I have outlined what I feel we can and should do here and now as Europeans to try and overcome the present crisis .
I was asked how the Middle East is to be dealt with within the security strategy .
Those regions affected by the disaster are set to receive less than a fifth of the amounts Portugal and Italy are to be awarded following the fires and the earthquake .
According to the Government of Spain it is only EUR 436 million .
When the only Basque daily was closed down eight months ago , he wrote an open letter to the Spanish judiciary saying that the newspaper had nothing to hide , but much to reveal if called upon to do so .
It seems that there is a slight difference regarding the notion of democracy between Spain and all the other countries in Europe .     – Mr President , Mr Gorostiaga has referred
