that we must also establish the European internal market in the transport market , so we must become a little bolder in this respect .
We must see to it that we create an internal market .
As has already been mentioned , unladen journeys are of no benefit to anybody .
Monitoring of everything that is decided here is crucial - and that is also my appeal to the Member States .
Thank you , Commissioner Å pidla , for placing this core value of European politics at the centre of your remarks .
( Applause ) draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education . - ( DE ) Mr President , I too , would first like to thank Mrs Hall for her extremely ambitious efforts to achieve a timely result for this difficult report .
Therefore , for change to happen , we must set ourselves precisely this ambitious goal .
Producing criticism in print without being willing to subject it to formal scrutiny is hardly heroic conduct .
Let me tell you , the Stone Age ended , fortunately , because we politicians had courage : courage to seize the future , courage for our children , and courage for this planet of ours .
We need a change of course , but we all need to recognise that industrial structures which have been established over 50 or 60 years cannot be changed within two weeks by a parliamentary resolution .
The ambitious new dawn which is championed by Mr Dimas has been consistently blocked by various majorities in the European Parliament for the last one and a half years .
The challenge , then , is how to make a litre of fuel go twice as far as it does at present .
Not too long ago , those countries signed a new ASEAN Charter in which they explicitly affirm their adherence to the principle of respecting and protecting human rights .
What is most interesting is that in doing this we are addressing the Security Council , and Burma 's protectors , the Chinese , are in fact talking a rather unintelligible language .
They do not need large sums of money , for they possess the world 's largest currency reserves .
Is this the right time to be conducting a mid-term review of our industrial policy ?
That has to do with our policy on climate change , which is increasingly becoming a fanatical moral crusade , subjecting Europe to a form of lifestyle regulation that sometimes goes over the top .
Our main objective in refocusing the Turin-based agency is to strengthen relations between the Foundation and the European Parliament and to improve the overall operational efficiency of the Foundation .
For the sake of operational efficiency , I ask the House to support our Amendment 10 . , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , allow me to read out the wording : 'points to the potentially heightened risks involved in long-distance transport of live animals and , in this context , takes the view that more frequent thorough inspections should be conducted in order to ensure that only completely healthy animals are transported and believes that consideration should be given to the question whether the transport of animals for slaughter or fattening ' - and this is the difference - 'can be limited to a maximum journey time of nine hours ' .
In the long term , it makes no sense for us in the European Union to be flying around in 24 different types of helicopter .
This would in any case be in everyone 's interests .
There are currently 11 ESDP missions in the areas of policy , the rule of law and monitoring and two further missions in the military area .
However , such agreements are still being concluded now , and especially for the future , it is important to make it clear that , when such agreements are concluded , they must be embedded in a common security policy and a common energy policy .
A final remark on Iran : Mr Solana , I wish you good luck in Iran .
What happens to our credibility then ?
Previous EU missions must first be thoroughly evaluated .
Nevertheless , there is no risk of our foreign policy becoming militarised or that the European Union will be militarised , because the military answer to these risks is an option only in the rarest of cases .
I would also like to thank the all the committee members , particularly the committee chairman and rapporteur for the other report , Mr Saryusz-Wolski .
In an increasingly multipolar world , we have entered into strategic partnerships with our most important partners .
Our cooperation in the fight against international terrorism became a key joint concern on 11 September 2001 , if not before .
We have good working relationships with all existing transatlantic dialogue partners and I am also thankful for the support of the Council , which will continue to be important in the future too .
We must not allow protectionism to put the case , nor should we take the arrogant position that our solutions are the only good ones for consumers and that the way other people do things is automatically bad .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we want good relations between the United States of America and the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to address two issues briefly .
Secondly , the GSP+ incentive scheme , which provides additional benefits for countries implementing certain international standards in human and labour rights , environmental protection , the fight against drugs , and good governance .
