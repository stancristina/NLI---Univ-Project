Many decisions which have spelled disaster for companies and for employment could have been avoided if employees had been able to influence these decisions .
I hope that the Commission will take this into account when preparing its proposal for revising the directive .
We should in all cases honour the 1994 Directive .
Mrs Guigou , the Minister of Justice , felt that this directive , was "incompatible with French bioethical laws , with the code for industrial property and also the civil code that prohibits the marketing of the human body " .
This rapid increase is caused on the one hand by the constant proliferation of Community Law , and on the other hand , from the increased severity of a Commission that has at its disposal , since the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty , effective instruments of oppression , notably Articles 226 and 228 of the EC Treaty .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following on from what Mr Harbour has just said , I will now very briefly talk about technical problems of concern to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
In fact , in March we heard talk of EUR 500 million .
I would like to thank you for your understanding .
It is hoped that this meeting , which will obviously require very careful preparation and preliminary meetings at intermediary levels , will succeed in overcoming the current security deadlock .
Attempts - and now it is a question of more than mere attempts - to compare Zionism with racism , as at the Durban Conference and , therefore , to transform the Israeli-Arab conflict into a racial and religious conflict , when in fact it is a political conflict requiring a political solution , will certainly not have helped matters .
Madam President , I would have failed in my duty to acknowledge the efforts made by several institutions and key figures within the European Union if I also failed to highlight the extremely active role played by Commissioner Patten to ensure not only the financial survival of the Palestinian authorities but much more besides .
The so far very local cease-fire which the parties agreed upon on 28 August for the Beit Jalla/Bethlehem-Gilo sector and which is being complied with must be consolidated and extended to include other hotspots of conflict and tension in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank .

I think that this is the fundamental problem and the European Union cannot respond , Mr Patten , by considering sociological proposals to improve the economic conditions .
On the contrary , the complacent attitude and leniency shown by the Commission could only be taken as incentives to continue along this disastrous route .
This is a very human response and if we did not react in such a way , we might wonder , in fact , whether we are human .
Mr Sharon has suggested to Mr Solana that they meet tomorrow .
No one has managed to assess it properly either .
That is why we abstained from voting on this text .
Undeniably , the Statute for a European Company is a real labyrinth and economic and political actors are hardly enthusiastic about it , to put it mildly .
Workers ' councils are being refused the simple right of veto , even though , faced with an increase in collective redundancies , often in large companies which have been making huge profits for many years , a simple ban on redundancies would be enough to protect workers .
The hopes that the international community had placed in proximity talks , held under the aegis of the United Nations , were dashed last November by the unilateral withdrawal of Mr Denktash from the process .
By guaranteeing a large majority to the motion for a resolution on Cyprus , the European Parliament will strengthen the negotiating position of Mr Kofi Annan .
I would once more congratulate them on their responsible approach .
To be brief , Mr Prodi , these are the changes that would certainly be desirable for the European institutions to make to the way they work , but they will only have a marginal effect if they are not combined with deep-rooted changes in the balance of institutional powers .
In addition to this , the Commission and the European Investment Bank websites are linked and offer information on the memorandum .
We currently have a framework programme for technological research and development that the Commission has been funding since its adoption by Parliament and the Council .
It is possible that this information is , unfortunately , still relatively unknown and I think that it would be useful for it to be disseminated .
So , ladies and gentlemen , these are the main conclusions of the Committee on Industry .
Why can we not find out what is happening with these Structural Funds ?
What values should they defend ?
Points 5 , 8 and 10 : strengthening cooperation .
You will be one of the important outlets for spreading the word about this portal .
You have adopted the steps necessary for the introduction of two new budget headings in the 2002 draft budget .
We will not abandon the European authorities without having achieved this objective .
This is why the Community and the Member States remain fundamentally attached to their freedom of action to develop and adapt their cultural policy .
They exist and they will continue to exist .
The second question is that the Committee ' s work has demonstrated perfectly well that , as long as we are within NATO , and as long as we are tied to using NATO' s technical and logistical resources , an independent European and common security policy will not be possible .
We will respond by providing accurate information to the public about the
