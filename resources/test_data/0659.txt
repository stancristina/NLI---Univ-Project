It is now clear that the European countries have , to quote the former European Commissioner Karel Van Miert 's words in a Flemish newspaper a few days ago , been behaving 'like puppet states of the USA ' by effectively giving the green light to Turkey 's future accession to the European Union .

I think that this is very important .
If all small countries endorse this , we will fortunately be able to consign this nonsense of Mr Giscard d'Estaing 's to the scrap heap .
This means that in the eyes of the Right and the employers , the economy will flourish only if a majority of the people accepts a creeping drop in purchasing power .
The first thing I would like to ask - and I am also addressing this request to my good friend Mr Bertel Haarder - is that we apply the existing rules and that we take Erika I and II in hand .
We must avoid this kind of thing in future .
The one must not take priority over the other .
More stringent and more frequent inspections should result in unseaworthy ships or ships that are not in good enough condition to carry certain goods being placed under arrest at an earlier stage .
It is time we took a fundamental look at our position and our approach to these .
My colleague Mr Dirk Sterckx 's specific suggestions about ports of refuge are particularly appropriate .
