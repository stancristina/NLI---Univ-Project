mandate it needs to apply these funds in the region in question , and the cost of borrowing would be too high in the absence of co-funding from the Commission .
We took as the basis for our deliberations the voluntary agreements and guidelines for best practice agreed on in Madrid in 2003 .
We see this Regulation as making provision for the enactment of more specific , detailed and binding guidelines , thereby complementing the 2003 internal market directive on the complete opening-up of the gas markets .
The Russians would laugh themselves to death if a German town wanted to buy power directly from Gazprom and have the stuff delivered straight to it .
It is a fraction of what the big oil companies use to buy up their own shares and make themselves rather less liable to the influence of their own shareholders .
I am grateful to Commissioner Piebalgs for stating the fundamental principles so clearly .
This is a problem from which this sort of question should not divert attention , and I am grateful to the Greens and Liberals for having broadened the issue and enabled us to have a proper and wide-ranging debate today .
Right now , though , we can be confident that the Member States – at least where the issue of cross-border blocks of airspace is concerned – are evidently prepared to accommodate each other , so that it may well be possible to create a single airspace in Europe within the foreseeable future .
According to what we have heard , there are actually very good indications that the Council will go along with it , so that all three institutions will be in this together .
Now more than ever , being an air traffic controller is an attractive career , and one that can take you all over Europe , and I hope that it will be one on which even more young people will decide than they have done in the past .     .
A second point that is of course of equal interest to me as rapporteur on the monitoring of road transport is Mr Schmitt’s proposal for a mandatory and standardised or harmonised list of penalties .
In the last elections to the European Parliament , we did not experience the invasion we had dreaded and expected after the ten new Member States sent observers of whom only 14 % were women .
We have waited a long time for this Gender Institute , yet you had not one word to say about the topic of gender budgeting .
A State of the World Population Report study published by the UN indicates that around 5 000 girls and women , in at least fourteen countries – Pakistan and Turkey among them – are murdered in the name of honour , although the number of such killings that go unreported is much higher .
Why is society not more up in arms about them ?
I hope that a broad majority in the House will support this report and that the Council and the Commission will take up as many as possible of the issues it raises , for we cannot sit idly by while the few rich people in Europe get even richer and the number of poor people rises .
The war on unemployment must therefore also be a war on illegal immigrants and on illegal migrant labour .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty is of fundamental importance in terms of the European Union’s security and defence policy .
On issues such as the enrichment of uranium , there is a need for renewal .
Senator Roche from the Parliamentary Network for Nuclear Disarmament , pressed the point home in Brussels last week , saying – and I quote : ‘We cannot constantly be calling on others to refrain from acquiring more nuclear weapons if we are not ourselves willing to disarm and scrap the EU Member States’ highly dangerous potential for mass destruction’ .
I think thought should be given to what shape our political involvement might take .
North Korea is working on warheads and rockets to carry them , it is hampering the six-party talks and destabilising the entire region .
While Iran aspires to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union , we , who are the European Union , want to see Iran acting within the parameters set by the International Atomic Energy Agency and complying with its requirements .
Secondly , among our neighbours around the Mediterranean the Palestinian Authority has been the first to organise free elections – more free than any hitherto held in the Arab world .
Do you not see how , by taking this course of action on software patents , you are in fact hamstringing the European project in defence of which you have just spoken ?
The Common Position on the software patent directive is unacceptable , and we will be amending both directives to take account of the public interest and of the objectives of the European Union .
What are you doing upstream in that country to achieve diversification , and thus to ensure security of supply and to help bring gas prices even further down for customers here ?     I should just like to ask an additional question .
I think that there is still a good measure of misconception in this regard .
We have therefore proposed , as a result of our deliberations , that an ad hoc committee be set up to work out further details for the next annual report .
He demonstrates that we have improved in recent years and during recent sessions and , in section 6 , welcomes the fact that we have achieved compromise amendments and compromise resolutions with our partners among the ACP states .
